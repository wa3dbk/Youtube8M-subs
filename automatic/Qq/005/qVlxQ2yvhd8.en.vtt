00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.510
 connected flying saucer signed parrot 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.599
 the builder of connected objects 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.210
 French and a ps4 console to play 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.460

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.850
 that's not true yes it was actually 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.170
 the techno jokes of April 1st 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.180

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 jokes from April 1st with the editorial 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.579
 from 0 net.com right away the strength of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 star wars 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.290
 well yes according to the cern it exists there 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.489
 exists in a universe that is a 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.410
 force that would move 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.910
 objects with the strength of his thought and 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.829
 its derivatives the water was not bad 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 it was not bad but it was good 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.820
 good after there was samsung too he 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.340
 ya who did a nice thing a species 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.350
 of knife connect very pretty but in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.109
 more to samsung ie screen 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.850
 color and so it's imagined with a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.480
 knife here is a kind of cowardly one is 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.909
 can say that's a galaxy choice that's 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.729
 that google pulled us out of a box 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 letters connect one so that would 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.790
 here they wanted to talk to us about a 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.500
 mailbox that is installed in front of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.310
 his house and as soon as one is a real 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.439
 paper mail 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.670
 well we are notified on his 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 smartphone plus lots of other things 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.210
 term I did not find that super funny 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.560
 less fan wade this mailbox 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.049
 connected means but what do we have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 had we heard playstation with the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.840
 playstation 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.460
 this is very good article an article 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.960
 to choose is who was really enough 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 Nice it was very nice 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.729
 playstation blur is a reality mask 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.229
 virtual that allows you to make a 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.240
 something we had never done in 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.380
 video game in total immersion after-effects 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.360
 to read immersion because it's 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 to play underwater the idea was to play 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.939
 under water but it's true that there is 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.290
 some video game scenes that get 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.479
 goes under water sometimes so the lidc 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 here you put the mask jumping you 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.630
 in the pool either because we all 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.829
 a private pool waiting for us 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.090
 that's great because in the 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.090
 bathtub in my opinion it's a little fair 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.409
 the shower is a little bit complicated 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.909
 but it was funny because she has 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.939
 more at the end of the film he explains that the 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.129
 thing you dry in an instant south she 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.770
 was pretty good this April fool 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.140
 of sony good and then after there was when 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.480
 even the episode lunia a yes 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.709
 smartphones and put under ms back and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.599
 apple with two geeks because who 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.150
 knows but this back apart from you me and 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.930
 that his sister ciminelli the good eric the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.280
 bourlout there is still 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.050
 some who have known the 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.209
 here is taken putting systems 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.250
 operating on pc these rooms 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.530
 computers before imagine alumnia 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.060
 you start with ms dos it's not the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.290
 I will back you called and you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.790
 the instruction was what's the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.730
 instructions these fuss it would make it 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.140
 know i just want to just apply 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.790
 really say they really started 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.410
 on the windows store we can really 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.000
 play with and it's really back 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.410
 like old-fashioned it must be done to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.390
 enter the directory must launch 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.739
 programs in high memory for 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.180
 to be able to launch a game it's quite funny 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.879
 and it's really good for me 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.019
 it's one of the funniest it's a fish 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.209
 of April but it's not a fake it's 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.709
 something here so it's not that 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.390
 just an app it's not a real bone 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.800
 yeah that's for sure it's all the more 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.530
 funny that actually microsoft does 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.760
 problems with his bone our bones 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.300
 current mobiles which are said to go 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300
 we go back to the sources 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.790
 next year we assemble hours it will be 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.930
 cool I'm sure some would have 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.480
 did not do it like an April Fool's joke 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.750
 no I think that a few years ago I 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.800
 do not think not parrot also the driver 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.049
 dark and connected objects is 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.459
 specialist drones aulaqi then him 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.150
 launch its huge costs that facts 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.170
 in fact it was after the drone they 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 claim they would have they have 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.680
 asserted yesterday that they had invented a 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.750
 a flying saucer knows that a drone 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.500
 scoop shaped and each time this 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.319
 which is funny is that there is always 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.640
 the good the little son who is well and has 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.750
 noticed today as soon as he 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.069
 there is a new product that comes out it takes 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.769
 support must be confessed 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.519
 and so here is the word and until 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.569
 bout then there were others of fish 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.180
 of April but there we tried to 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.840
 present the best and the best 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.930
 the best 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.970
 oh yes I think it was this one and 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.030
 he told me France friends and there is even 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.140
 made in 01net almost christopher will 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.299
 explain everything to us because the 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.010
 responsible is there if we can see it 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.180
 so it was finally there is no big 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.650
 thing to see for once but it was 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.030
 A nice story 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.380
 about the color of smartphones 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.070
 christopher what's this time but hey 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.950
 it's true that it has become a 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.480
 tradition of making fish 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.980
 in the high tech sector have seized and 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.790
 a lot of confreres from other media than 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.440
 you surely know 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.120
 it's a criminal association 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.850
 why not make a big fish 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.860
 of April on a topic that could 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.960
 to be credible so we tried not to 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.520
 do something that is too much 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.380
 go too far who sees the pede it was 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.330
 here we say we feel a little believable 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.670
 here we started from a university in 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.230
 Finland is the viola university 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.210
 exists with his men there is already done 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.250
 measurements on smartphones and we have 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.590
 invented a phony study that would have like 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.850
 finding the golden smartphones would 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.980
 less performant would have a debit 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.170
 lower than smartphones white gray or 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.580
 black as the 4g flow of smartphones 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.730
 they could be more or less 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.650
 fast I could see yellow color 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.930
 exactly so with a big theory 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.460
 when we hear when we do not deepen 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.710
 we can say yeah why not why 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.930
 not petros copy that is to say that the 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.820
 safa the color density would have a 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.590
 impact on the diffusion of the waves 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.960
 electromagnetic the big any 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.630
 what but we were a big fat 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.190
 dozens of French media took the 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.170
 same info about at the same time with 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:24.200
 photographs that you see there and 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.790
 their taking into account in French media 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.440
 it fascinates me we will not mention the names 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.640
 written camara it takes and media 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.230
 americans too that's what's funny 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.970
 good American media have taken over the 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.160
 news 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.160
 that's without a source is obviously a
