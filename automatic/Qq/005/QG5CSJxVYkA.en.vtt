00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
and designing weapons is easy start by

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.010 
and designing weapons is easy start by
picking<00:00:49.219> a<00:00:49.489> chassis<00:00:49.760> which<00:00:50.359> determines<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
picking a chassis which determines the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.459 
picking a chassis which determines the
type<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.260> projectiles<00:00:51.920> your<00:00:52.160> weapon<00:00:52.489> fires

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
type of projectiles your weapon fires

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.740 
type of projectiles your weapon fires
then<00:00:54.469> just<00:00:54.680> customize<00:00:55.129> it<00:00:55.280> with<00:00:55.309> parts<00:00:55.760> you

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
then just customize it with parts you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.250 
then just customize it with parts you
can<00:00:56.930> say<00:00:57.140> we<00:00:57.289> have<00:00:57.469> a<00:00:57.500> few<00:00:57.949> to<00:00:58.219> choose<00:00:58.250> from

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
can say we have a few to choose from

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.910 
can say we have a few to choose from
okay<00:01:00.010> so<00:01:00.399> let's<00:01:00.579> slow<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:01.030> down<00:01:01.059> a<00:01:01.239> little

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
okay so let's slow that down a little

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.900 
okay so let's slow that down a little

the<00:01:10.149> weapon<00:01:10.420> behave<00:01:11.430> some<00:01:12.430> chest<00:01:12.729> like

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
the weapon behave some chest like

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
launchers have even more categories that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.200 
launchers have even more categories that

customizing<00:01:19.210> with<00:01:19.330> parts<00:01:19.690> really<00:01:19.960> starts<00:01:20.350> to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
customizing with parts really starts to

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.920 
customizing with parts really starts to
