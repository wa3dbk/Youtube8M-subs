actually massages the underside of the

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:17.179 
actually massages the underside of the
arm<00:01:14.899> so<00:01:15.899> I'm<00:01:15.990> using<00:01:16.170> pressure<00:01:16.560> leaning<00:01:17.100> in

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
arm so I'm using pressure leaning in

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.190 
arm so I'm using pressure leaning in
with<00:01:17.310> my<00:01:17.459> body<00:01:17.639> to<00:01:17.969> do<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.329> little<00:01:18.899> bit<00:01:19.020> more

with my body to do a little bit more
pressure<00:01:19.409> there<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.819> rotate<00:01:20.969> your

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:21.209 
pressure there now you can rotate your

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.319 
pressure there now you can rotate your
hand<00:01:21.569> over<00:01:21.749> and<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.399> work<00:01:23.579> on<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.969> back<00:01:24.149> of

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
hand over and so you work on the back of

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
all the gripping kind of loosens up some

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.560 
all the gripping kind of loosens up some
of<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.220> adhesions<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:37.090> if<00:04:37.330> you<00:04:37.419> need<00:04:37.539> a

of the adhesions and if you need a
little<00:04:37.780> bit<00:04:37.870> deeper<00:04:38.080> pressure<00:04:38.410> instead<00:04:38.770> of

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
little bit deeper pressure instead of

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.740 
little bit deeper pressure instead of
pressing<00:04:39.100> with<00:04:39.370> your<00:04:39.490> forearm<00:04:39.910> just<00:04:40.150> lean<00:04:40.720> a

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
little bit more forward with your body

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.980 
little bit more forward with your body
and<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.180> will<00:04:43.300> give<00:04:43.419> you<00:04:43.539> a<00:04:43.570> little<00:04:43.720> bit<00:04:43.870> more

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
and that will give you a little bit more

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.469 
and that will give you a little bit more
pressure<00:04:44.320> on<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.099> fingers<00:04:45.490> go<00:04:46.150> under<00:04:46.389> the
