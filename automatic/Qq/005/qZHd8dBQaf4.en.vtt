you've<00:00:09.090> probably<00:00:09.269> heard<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.630> lot<00:00:09.660> lately<00:00:10.110> about

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
you've probably heard a lot lately about

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.249 
you've probably heard a lot lately about
barefoot<00:00:10.920> or<00:00:11.400> natural<00:00:12.030> running<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:13.139> then

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
barefoot or natural running and then

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.720 
barefoot or natural running and then
actually<00:00:13.620> makes<00:00:13.799> a<00:00:13.920> lot<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.099> sense<00:00:14.400> from<00:00:14.639> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
actually makes a lot of sense from a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.540 
actually makes a lot of sense from a
biomechanics<00:00:15.480> standpoint<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.529> idea<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.130> that

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
biomechanics standpoint the idea is that

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.939 
biomechanics standpoint the idea is that
you're<00:00:17.910> born<00:00:18.240> running<00:00:18.810> naturally<00:00:19.289> kids<00:00:19.710> run

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
you're born running naturally kids run

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.130 
you're born running naturally kids run
up<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.250> their<00:00:20.460> toes<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.510> adults<00:00:21.869> should<00:00:21.900> run

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
up on their toes and adults should run

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.170 
up on their toes and adults should run
up<00:00:22.170> on<00:00:22.439> their<00:00:22.590> forefoot<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.250> well

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
up on their forefoot as well

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.060 
up on their forefoot as well
biomechanical<00:00:25.050> speaking<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.590> makes<00:00:25.769> sense

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
biomechanical speaking it makes sense

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.040 
biomechanical speaking it makes sense
because<00:00:26.279> when<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.119> land<00:00:27.359> on<00:00:27.480> your<00:00:27.599> forefoot

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
because when you land on your forefoot

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.290 
because when you land on your forefoot
you<00:00:28.230> land<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.590> your<00:00:28.769> knee<00:00:28.920> bent<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.880> all<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
you land with your knee bent so all the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.540 
you land with your knee bent so all the
shock<00:00:30.660> absorption<00:00:31.050> happens<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:31.920> muscles

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
shock absorption happens in your muscles

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639 
shock absorption happens in your muscles
not<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.090> joints<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> land<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.440> your

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
not your joints when you land on your

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.160 
not your joints when you land on your
heel<00:00:34.950> all<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.880> shock<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.270> taken<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:36.989> by<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
heel all that shock is taken up by the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.680 
heel all that shock is taken up by the
the<00:00:37.680> joints<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.250> your<00:00:38.460> knees<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.969> ankles<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the joints in your knees and ankles and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.630 
the joints in your knees and ankles and
hips<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> cartilage<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.190> doing<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
hips so the cartilage is doing the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
hips so the cartilage is doing the
cushioning<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.600> your<00:00:42.750> muscles<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.620> look

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
cushioning not your muscles if you look

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889 
cushioning not your muscles if you look
at<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> human<00:00:44.370> foot<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:45.149> actually<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> lot

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
at the human foot it's actually a lot

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.360 
at the human foot it's actually a lot
more<00:00:46.079> flexible<00:00:46.649> than<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> might<00:00:47.070> first

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
more flexible than you might first

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.069 
more flexible than you might first
imagine<00:00:47.879> when<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> look<00:00:48.629> at<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> bones

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
imagine when you look at the bones

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.110 
imagine when you look at the bones
inside<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.800> foot<00:00:50.070> there's<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
inside the foot there's a lot of

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
inside the foot there's a lot of
different<00:00:51.449> joints<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:51.989> angles<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> lot

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
different joints and angles that a lot

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
different joints and angles that a lot
of<00:00:52.829> people<00:00:53.070> aren't<00:00:53.219> familiar<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.539> when

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
of people aren't familiar with and when

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
of people aren't familiar with and when
your<00:00:54.809> foot<00:00:55.079> moves<00:00:55.230> naturally<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> doesn't

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
your foot moves naturally it doesn't

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
your foot moves naturally it doesn't
just<00:00:56.489> flex<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> forefoot<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.780> flexes

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
just flex in the forefoot it flexes

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
just flex in the forefoot it flexes
throughout<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> foot<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> idea<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
throughout the foot so the idea of a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
throughout the foot so the idea of a
natural<00:01:01.170> running<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.680> barefoot<00:01:02.160> shoe<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
natural running or barefoot shoe is to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.789 
natural running or barefoot shoe is to
allow<00:01:03.300> your<00:01:03.480> foot<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> flex<00:01:04.170> naturally

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
allow your foot to flex naturally

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.090 
allow your foot to flex naturally
everywhere<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.519> supposed<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> move<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.950> when

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
everywhere it's supposed to move so when

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800 
everywhere it's supposed to move so when
you<00:01:11.189> look<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:11.520> natural<00:01:11.700> running<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.540> seems

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you look at natural running it all seems

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840 
you look at natural running it all seems
very<00:01:12.990> very<00:01:13.110> good<00:01:13.530> its<00:01:13.890> biomechanically

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
very very good its biomechanically

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880 
very very good its biomechanically
correct<00:01:14.880> we're<00:01:15.630> seeing<00:01:15.840> less<00:01:16.080> joint<00:01:16.439> injuries

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
correct we're seeing less joint injuries

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
correct we're seeing less joint injuries
out<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.430> well<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> problem<00:01:18.810> with

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
out there as well but the problem with

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.140 
out there as well but the problem with
it<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.259> natural<00:01:19.890> running<00:01:20.070> makes<00:01:20.369> sense<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
it is natural running makes sense in the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.999 
it is natural running makes sense in the
natural<00:01:21.570> world<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.680> into<00:01:22.830> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
natural world when you get into the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
natural world when you get into the
man-made<00:01:23.460> world<00:01:23.790> where<00:01:24.030> things<00:01:24.180> are<00:01:24.390> made<00:01:24.479> of

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
man-made world where things are made of

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.560 
man-made world where things are made of
concrete<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.950> things<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:27.420> need

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
concrete and things like that you need

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.910 
concrete and things like that you need
something<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> little<00:01:28.200> more<00:01:28.530> protection

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
something with a little more protection

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.219 
something with a little more protection
so<00:01:29.729> our<00:01:29.880> solution<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.630> build<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
so our solution is to build in that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.830 
so our solution is to build in that
natural<00:01:31.860> flexibility<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.790> natural<00:01:33.420> motion

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
natural flexibility and natural motion

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.050 
natural flexibility and natural motion
that<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.079> foot<00:01:34.320> needs<00:01:34.530> yet<00:01:35.220> protect<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.850> when

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
that your foot needs yet protect it when

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.090 
that your foot needs yet protect it when
it<00:01:36.150> gets<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.479> those<00:01:36.630> hard<00:01:36.869> surfaces

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
it gets on those hard surfaces

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.620 
it gets on those hard surfaces
so<00:01:40.100> our<00:01:40.219> solutions<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.820> little<00:01:41.030> different<00:01:41.420> we

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
so our solutions a little different we

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.969 
so our solutions a little different we
want<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.899> keep<00:01:42.049> everything<00:01:42.409> that's<00:01:42.740> great

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
want to keep everything that's great

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.830 
want to keep everything that's great
about<00:01:43.039> barefoot<00:01:43.520> running<00:01:43.969> when<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.420> land<00:01:44.689> on

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
about barefoot running when you land on

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.719 
about barefoot running when you land on
that<00:01:44.869> forefoot<00:01:45.500> it's<00:01:45.679> biomechanically<00:01:46.520> more

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
that forefoot it's biomechanically more

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.580 
that forefoot it's biomechanically more
efficient<00:01:47.210> than<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.719> see<00:01:47.899> lower<00:01:48.170> injury

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
efficient than you see lower injury

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.859 
efficient than you see lower injury
rates<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.130> joints<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:50.329> we<00:01:50.450> want<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.689> take

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
rates and joints but we want to take

the forefoot all combined it gives you

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.069 
the forefoot all combined it gives you

difference<00:02:47.480> in<00:02:47.600> real<00:02:47.780> flex<00:02:48.049> we<00:02:48.799> continue<00:02:49.310> the

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
difference in real flex we continue the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.520 
difference in real flex we continue the
idea<00:02:49.819> of<00:02:50.060> natural<00:02:50.239> running<00:02:50.690> into<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.170> upper

idea of natural running into the upper
of<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:51.680> shoe<00:02:51.709> as<00:02:52.160> well<00:02:52.430> and<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:53.090> do<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.480> we

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
of the shoe as well and to do that we

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.970 
of the shoe as well and to do that we
took<00:02:53.870> out<00:02:54.049> everything<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.829> wasn't

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
took out everything that wasn't

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.460 
took out everything that wasn't
necessary<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.940> upper<00:02:56.180> of<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.359> shoe<00:02:56.470> so

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
necessary to the upper of the shoe so

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.660 
necessary to the upper of the shoe so
when<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:57.709> look<00:02:57.889> at<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.100> upper<00:02:58.370> of<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.489> real

when you look at the upper of the real
flex<00:02:58.970> shoe<00:02:59.180> you'll<00:02:59.389> notice<00:02:59.720> there's<00:02:59.959> no

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079
