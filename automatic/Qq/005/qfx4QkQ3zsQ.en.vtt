drag<00:00:09.059> race<00:00:09.269> between<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.750> program<00:00:10.290> three

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
drag race between the program three

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.580 
drag race between the program three
progeny<00:00:11.400> 20<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.929> pegassi<00:00:13.559> zentorno

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
progeny 20 and the pegassi zentorno

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.689 
progeny 20 and the pegassi zentorno
which<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.639> got<00:00:14.790> last<00:00:15.089> year<00:00:15.360> in<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.490> high<00:00:17.490> life

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
which we got last year in the high life

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.910 
which we got last year in the high life
update<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.300> these<00:00:18.960> are<00:00:19.109> quite<00:00:19.439> interesting

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
update and these are quite interesting

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
update and these are quite interesting
because<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.220> both<00:00:20.369> four-wheel<00:00:20.910> drive<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
because the both four-wheel drive and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.150 
because the both four-wheel drive and
it's<00:00:21.689> really<00:00:22.109> nice<00:00:22.260> comparison<00:00:22.830> between<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it's really nice comparison between the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
it's really nice comparison between the
two<00:00:23.279> cars<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.000> thought<00:00:24.240> I'd<00:00:24.390> give<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.720> you

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
two cars so I thought I'd give it to you

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
two cars so I thought I'd give it to you
anyway<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.830> said<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.430> haven't<00:00:26.640> seen

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
anyway like I said if you haven't seen

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.019 
anyway like I said if you haven't seen
the<00:00:27.119> program<00:00:27.900> versus<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> Cyrus<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.580> leave<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the program versus the Cyrus I leave a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.189 
the program versus the Cyrus I leave a
link<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> bottom<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
link to that in the bottom of the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.830 
link to that in the bottom of the
description<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.059> definitely

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
description there for you so definitely

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.430 
description there for you so definitely
check<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.050> out

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
check that out

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.229 
check that out
but<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> sauna<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> still<00:00:35.760> one<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
but the sauna is still one of the

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
but the sauna is still one of the
quickest<00:00:36.600> cars<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> game<00:00:37.280> that's<00:00:38.280> why<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
quickest cars in the game that's why I

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.160 
quickest cars in the game that's why I
thought<00:00:38.640> I'd<00:00:38.700> still<00:00:39.000> bring<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> out<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.629> so

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
thought I'd still bring it out to you so

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.209 
thought I'd still bring it out to you so
we've<00:00:40.260> got<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.410> 220<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:40.980> against<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
we've got the 220 going against the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.130 
we've got the 220 going against the
zentorno<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.969> can<00:00:42.120> tell<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.840> initial

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
zentorno and you can tell the initial

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.889 
zentorno and you can tell the initial
launch<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.860> initial<00:00:44.610> net<00:00:44.730> acceleration<00:00:44.899> is

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
launch so initial net acceleration is

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.720 
launch so initial net acceleration is
better<00:00:46.170> traction<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> with<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.489> with

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
better traction with the with it with

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.260 
better traction with the with it with
the<00:00:47.820> t20<00:00:48.890> prima<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.160> probably<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> while

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the t20 prima this is probably the while

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.330 
the t20 prima this is probably the while
it<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> best<00:00:52.260> accelerating<00:00:53.100> car

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
it is actually the best accelerating car

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
it is actually the best accelerating car
in<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> game<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:55.140> even<00:00:55.440> beating<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
in the game now it's even beating the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.290 
in the game now it's even beating the
acai<00:00:56.190> reefs<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.090> best

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
acai reefs which was the best

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.439 
acai reefs which was the best
accelerating<00:00:57.870> car<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> game<00:00:59.180> but<00:01:00.180> as<00:01:00.300> you

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
accelerating car in the game but as you

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.209 
accelerating car in the game but as you
can<00:01:00.570> tell<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.930> zentorno<00:01:01.140> still<00:01:01.739> keeps<00:01:02.010> up

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
can tell the zentorno still keeps up

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.000 
can tell the zentorno still keeps up
with<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.640> zentorno<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.570> still<00:01:03.930> keep<00:01:04.769> up

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
with it the zentorno can still keep up

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.310 
with it the zentorno can still keep up
with<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> t20<00:01:05.909> after<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> long<00:01:06.510> distance<00:01:07.020> so

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
with the t20 after a long distance so

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920 
with the t20 after a long distance so
what<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.100> means<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.060> terms<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> top

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
what that means is the terms of the top

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.590 
what that means is the terms of the top
speed<00:01:10.290> they<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:10.890> pretty<00:01:11.369> much<00:01:11.460> again<00:01:12.150> even

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
speed they are pretty much again even

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
speed they are pretty much again even
Stephens<00:01:13.110> these<00:01:13.320> top<00:01:13.619> three<00:01:13.890> cars<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.460> acai

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
Stephens these top three cars the acai

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
Stephens these top three cars the acai
rest'<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.180> went<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> t20<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> zentorno

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
rest' it's went the t20 in the zentorno

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.170 
rest' it's went the t20 in the zentorno
just<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.100> another<00:01:17.369> level<00:01:17.549> they're<00:01:17.939> just

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
just on another level they're just

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.539 
just on another level they're just
they're<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.619> close<00:01:19.950> together<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.430> would

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
in terms of a drag race the zentorno is

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.120 
in terms of a drag race the zentorno is
still<00:01:38.939> very<00:01:39.360> very<00:01:39.630> quick<00:01:40.049> as<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.740> can<00:01:40.770> tell

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
the acai Rossio grabs the acceleration

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.069 
the acai Rossio grabs the acceleration
straight<00:01:44.729> away<00:01:45.030> from<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.329> zento<00:01:45.630> Nepal's

pretty much a car length away from the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.210 
pretty much a car length away from the
zentorno<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.740> interesting<00:01:50.040> to

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
zentorno and it's just interesting to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.969 
zentorno and it's just interesting to
see<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.630> zentorno<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:52.439> we<00:01:52.770> can't

see you know the zentorno we we can't

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
see you know the zentorno we we can't
have<00:01:53.100> thought<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.460> faster<00:01:53.909> car<00:01:54.170> but<00:01:55.170> then

in terms of lap times but lap times of

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.130 
in terms of lap times but lap times of
testing<00:02:13.650> later<00:02:13.739> today<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.810> but<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:16.019> know

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140

so there's no customized options on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.550 
so there's no customized options on

basically<00:02:28.560> if<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.069> know<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.549> clumpy<00:02:30.000> one<00:02:30.209> in

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
basically if you know up a clumpy one in

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.360 
basically if you know up a clumpy one in
real<00:02:30.450> life<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:31.590> exact<00:02:31.859> same<00:02:32.069> car

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
real life this is the exact same car

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.039 
real life this is the exact same car
they<00:02:32.549> pretty<00:02:33.000> much<00:02:33.090> copied<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.569> pasted<00:02:33.900> this

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
they pretty much copied and pasted this

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.129 
they pretty much copied and pasted this
car<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> game<00:02:34.920> exactly<00:02:35.689> so<00:02:36.689> it's

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
car to the game exactly so it's

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.660 
car to the game exactly so it's
interesting<00:02:37.349> to<00:02:37.530> see<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.189> what<00:02:38.310> you'll<00:02:38.459> find

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
interesting to see but what you'll find

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.670 
interesting to see but what you'll find
out<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.329> know<00:02:39.569> how<00:02:39.750> does<00:02:39.959> how<00:02:40.290> does<00:02:40.349> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
out is you know how does how does the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.699 
out is you know how does how does the
zentorno<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.209> t20<00:02:42.870> react<00:02:43.169> bumps

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
zentorno on this and the t20 react bumps

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.490 
zentorno on this and the t20 react bumps
and<00:02:43.969> bumps<00:02:44.969> in<00:02:45.090> GTA<00:02:45.480> 5<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> big<00:02:46.169> deal<00:02:46.349> because

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
and bumps in GTA 5 or a big deal because

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.440 
and bumps in GTA 5 or a big deal because
obviously<00:02:46.769> when<00:02:47.189> certain<00:02:47.760> car<00:02:47.909> goes<00:02:48.120> over<00:02:48.389> a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
obviously when certain car goes over a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.720 
obviously when certain car goes over a
bump<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.870> gains<00:02:49.139> revs<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.829> revs<00:02:50.129> means<00:02:50.489> it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
bump it gains revs and revs means it

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.399 
bump it gains revs and revs means it
accelerates<00:02:51.449> that<00:02:51.599> much<00:02:51.780> quicker<00:02:51.989> at<00:02:52.290> that

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
accelerates that much quicker at that

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.849 
accelerates that much quicker at that
given<00:02:52.560> second<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.930> what<00:02:54.930> you'll<00:02:55.049> find<00:02:55.319> is<00:02:55.650> you

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
given second so what you'll find is you

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.979 
given second so what you'll find is you
know<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.489> t20<00:02:57.120> as<00:02:57.359> good<00:02:57.599> as<00:02:57.719> the<00:02:57.810> zentorno

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
know is the t20 as good as the zentorno

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.429 
know is the t20 as good as the zentorno
which<00:02:58.409> we<00:02:58.560> know<00:02:58.709> is<00:02:58.919> the<00:02:59.040> king<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.900> curbs<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
which we know is the king of curbs and

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.530 
which we know is the king of curbs and
bumps<00:03:02.099> in<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.280> road<00:03:02.549> finding<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.150> these<00:03:03.269> gaps

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
bumps in the road finding all these gaps

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.839 
bumps in the road finding all these gaps
because<00:03:03.810> if<00:03:04.109> as<00:03:04.680> anti<00:03:04.949> no<00:03:05.010> hits<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.430> bump<00:03:05.639> it

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
because if as anti no hits a bump it

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.759 
because if as anti no hits a bump it
just<00:03:06.090> flies<00:03:06.329> it<00:03:06.629> just<00:03:06.780> accelerates<00:03:07.439> on<00:03:07.650> to

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
just flies it just accelerates on to

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.979 
just flies it just accelerates on to
another<00:03:07.949> level<00:03:08.189> and<00:03:08.669> that's<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.209> some<00:03:09.719> people

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
another level and that's not some people

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.750 
another level and that's not some people
don't<00:03:10.199> know<00:03:10.349> that<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.739> know<00:03:10.829> it's<00:03:10.980> still<00:03:11.250> it's
