the fire test the exposure temperature

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
the fire test the exposure temperature
and<00:00:29.849> then<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.929> other<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> time<00:00:31.890> and

like that master just yet but it does
have<00:01:32.700> grab<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> flashlight<00:01:34.049> here<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:35.280> does<00:01:35.549> have

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
have grab a flashlight here it does have

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.510 
have grab a flashlight here it does have
a<00:01:36.650> reinforced<00:01:37.650> door<00:01:40.130> perimeter<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.340> it's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a reinforced door perimeter there it's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
a reinforced door perimeter there it's
got<00:01:41.729> basically<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.750> tubular<00:01:43.140> effect<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
got basically it's a tubular effect and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280 
got basically it's a tubular effect and
so<00:01:44.549> they<00:01:44.700> bring<00:01:44.909> their<00:01:45.090> their<00:01:45.780> steel<00:01:46.079> round

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so they bring their their steel round

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.139 
so they bring their their steel round
from<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.649> body<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.430> roll<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.000> back

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
from the body and they just roll it back

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
you just roll the handle so we've got

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.990 
you just roll the handle so we've got
this<00:03:43.450> little<00:03:43.720> can<00:03:43.990> here<00:03:44.440> on<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.620> master<00:03:45.160> that

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
this little can here on a master that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.030 
this little can here on a master that
helps<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.450> dissipate<00:03:46.900> any<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.650> force

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
helps to dissipate any of that force

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.350 
helps to dissipate any of that force
that<00:03:48.310> might<00:03:48.490> be<00:03:48.640> applied<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.240> board<00:03:50.310> okay

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
that might be applied to that board okay

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.230 
that might be applied to that board okay
so<00:03:53.190> other<00:03:54.190> than<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.550> I<00:03:54.700> mean<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:55.030> just<00:03:55.060> want

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
so other than that I mean you just want

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.700 
so other than that I mean you just want
to<00:03:55.450> get<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.720> heaviest<00:03:56.080> safe<00:03:56.290> that<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.500> can

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
to get the heaviest safe that you can

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.910 
to get the heaviest safe that you can
find<00:03:57.010> usually<00:03:57.570> heavier<00:03:58.570> say<00:03:58.960> heavier<00:03:59.740> the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
find usually heavier say heavier the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.640 
find usually heavier say heavier the
safe<00:04:00.160> equates<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> more<00:04:00.970> fire<00:04:01.900> protection<00:04:02.350> and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
safe equates to more fire protection and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.960 
safe equates to more fire protection and
and<00:04:02.890> heavier<00:04:03.670> steel<00:04:04.620> and<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:06.460> think<00:04:06.760> that's

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
and heavier steel and I think that's

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.530 
and heavier steel and I think that's
about<00:04:07.120> it<00:04:07.300> for<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.750> quick<00:04:07.959> little<00:04:08.140> video
