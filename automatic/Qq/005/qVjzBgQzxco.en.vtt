00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.150
 reason to meet ford s-max 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.309
 It has recently been updated 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.719
 touching both looks and 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.849
 internal content 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.320
 ford s-max and so did not suffer from 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.930
 lack of sportiness 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.560
 But the designers decided that you can still 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 a little bit 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.670
 it is a little more apparent 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.950
 in size grille 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.430
 led strip daytime lights 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.680
 bumper 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.650
 brighter and more expressive rear 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.469
 lamps from external innovations is all 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.269
 but enough to know the course before 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.399
 us updated generation 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:41.039
 but under the hood of the old motor 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.940
 generating aspirated 2 and 3 liters 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.890
 capacity of 160 one horsepower and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.050
 transmission five - speed traditional 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.569
 machine though ford s-max 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.219
 available with a new generation filling 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:56.210
 two-liter turbo engine 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.319
 ecoboost capacity of 203 h1 and strength and 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.699
 6-speed robotic box 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.949
 powershift gear 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.979
 but we'll rate it another time, but for now 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.420
 let's see what's new in the interior 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.710
 press release claiming to have changed 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 Decoration Materials 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.390
 although before ford s-max was difficult 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 show something in this respect all 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.750
 very solid and pleasant to eyesight and 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.790
 tactile 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 up from ergonomics full order 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.930
 we especially like management 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.990
 on-board computer with four 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.310
 steering wheel button 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.659
 computer readings are displayed on 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 large color display 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.159
 occupying a place in the instrument panel 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.030
 cabin appeared additional compartments 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.340
 for small things 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.920
 although it was a sin to complain about 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.320
 their absence ford s-max is still 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.109
 offered in 5 or seven seater 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.810
 option in the second case, the chair 3 rows 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.060
 hiding in the underground trunk passengers 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.479
 middle class comfort is not deprived 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 they have three separately adjustable chairs 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.490
 extra in 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 work in the back of the front seats 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.909
 folding tables 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 ford s-max can be converted from 5 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.530
 local to seven-seater family 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.630
 car but it's not done that way 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:13.230
 just fling it over first 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:14.700
 then raise the back and if you 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.190
 long arms then you 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.000
 will reach from the trunk and if the hands 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.599
 are short 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.110
 you have to climb the salon and so 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.230
 that's the way 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.630
 turn the pillow cross opportunity 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.370
 trunk transformations are wide and his 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.380
 size varies from two hundred 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.349
 eighty-five liters in seven-seater 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.650
 option then 2100 liters when folded 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.280
 backside of the second and third row seats 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.129
 key to start 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.019
 that is, our Ford C -Max button is equipped 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.160
 contactless access system and 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.410
 engine start 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.360
 it's nice that the start button is not 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.730
 you need to hold and just enough 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.739
 poke your finger in sound insulation 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.260
 the engine compartment is good 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.750
 engine noise and 2 penetrates the salon and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.870
 with intensive acceleration does not put pressure on the ears 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.239
 passengers oh what a tasty highway 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.280
 created for crush engineers even in 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.260
 extremely civilian regimes so 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.630
 nice to feel intelligible reactive 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.180
 the steering wheel effort is clear and 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.220
 unambiguous reactions minimal rolls in 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.769
 turning and at the same time comfortable 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.959
 the suspension wants to ride hot 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:24.720
 when you sit behind the wheel ford s-max 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.450
 the first thought is that yes probably 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.170
 it would be great if 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.470
 I hope racing overalls special 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.900
 racing shoes and only then 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.390
 go on the road 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.140
 because driving sensation 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.290
 the place is such that he should 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.780
 to go 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.150
 although with an engine of 2 and 3 liters 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.360
 five-speed automatic it's just 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.760
 cool family car for 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.019
 long journeys to travel around 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.799
 the city 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.630
 one or the whole family suitable 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:03.500
 option but if you want to feel 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:06.019
 all the beauty of the beauty of the chassis with max 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.739
 it is better to look at the version of course 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:13.489
 with turbo engines or powerful 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.079
 Diesel engines although I will repeat it here combined with 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.970
 atmospheric gasoline engine and 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.790
 five-speed automatic ford s-max 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.470
 perfectly fulfills this function which 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.610
 basically and should this comfortable 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.010
 family car 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.960
 by the way the second thought that arises 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.860
 after a few kilometers behind the wheel 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.080
 ford s-max 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.419
 it would wave now on it 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.340
 fly away 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.919
 German autobahns at prohvatit 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.229
 serpentine monte carlo and then smoothly and 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.840
 imposingly patrol along the promenade down 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.150
 and not a Belarusian dream at all 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.400
 come down from heaven to earth and wait 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.229
 meeting with a 2-liter turbocharged ford 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.800
 s-max and robotic box 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.690
 gears 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.690
 there must be something else
