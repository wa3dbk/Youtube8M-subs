00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.710 
so I was like shit what am I gonna do so
I'll<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.739> little<00:04:10.919> plan<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.549> know<00:04:12.150> he<00:04:12.569> has

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
I'll have a little plan I know he has

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.460 
I'll have a little plan I know he has
harvest<00:04:13.549> so<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.579> would<00:04:14.910> let<00:04:15.090> him<00:04:15.359> put<00:04:15.630> my<00:04:15.930> tail

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
harvest so I would let him put my tail

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.870 
harvest so I would let him put my tail
at<00:04:16.680> my<00:04:16.919> tangrowth<00:04:17.849> to<00:04:18.120> sleep<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.539> I<00:04:19.880> predict

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
at my tangrowth to sleep and I predict

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.570 
at my tangrowth to sleep and I predict
him<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.150> go<00:04:21.299> for<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.510> rest<00:04:21.810> so<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:23.310> I<00:04:23.400> would<00:04:23.550> go

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
him to go for the rest so and I would go

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.450 
him to go for the rest so and I would go
into<00:04:23.880> my<00:04:24.090> little<00:04:24.390> sand<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.469> my<00:04:25.620> book<00:04:26.159> thing

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
into my little sand to my book thing

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.410 
into my little sand to my book thing
that<00:04:26.640> call<00:04:26.789> spider-man

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
that call spider-man

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.670 
that call spider-man
and<00:04:27.920> so<00:04:29.600> he<00:04:30.600> goes<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:30.960> rest<00:04:31.260> as<00:04:31.590> I

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and so he goes to the rest as I

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.160 
and so he goes to the rest as I
predicted<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.610> he<00:04:33.210> has<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> Lum<00:04:33.690> berry<00:04:33.720> so

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
predicted and he has the Lum berry so

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.190 
predicted and he has the Lum berry so
wakes<00:04:34.380> him<00:04:34.530> up<00:04:34.590> instantly<00:04:35.100> and<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:36.810> know<00:04:36.900> he's

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
wakes him up instantly and I know he's

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.240 
wakes him up instantly and I know he's
going<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.410> switch<00:04:37.680> because<00:04:37.830> he<00:04:37.950> doesn't<00:04:38.130> want

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
going to switch because he doesn't want

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.640 
going to switch because he doesn't want
