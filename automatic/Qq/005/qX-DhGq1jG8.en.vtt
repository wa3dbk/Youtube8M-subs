00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.760
 ah 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.059
 It is a disease that occurs in our 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.830
 eyes because they exist 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.720
 microorganisms microorganisms or as 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.280
 we know them as bacteria that cause 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.280
 a disease in our eyes 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.469
 well there are different types of 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.620
 infections are mostly 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.600
 caused by virus bacteria and some 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.129
 parasites these are little bugs that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.510
 mostly found in our 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.729
 hands when we take them 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.129
 when we shut their eyes that's why they 

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.449
 We recommend that you do not size them 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.960
 that you can cause the 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.960
 disease 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.140
 well now what we should do is 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.750
 basic hygiene and hygiene measures 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.369
 How could he be washing his hands before 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.929
 and after going to the bathroom himself 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.179
 after before and after going to eat 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.429
 they are also advised not to leave 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.229
 when there is a lot of land since the 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.420
 since the earth contains many 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.920
 microbes and that's what causes us to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 It gets infected in our eyes 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360
 do not 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.469
 it must be given that your hands though 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.390
 we do not see it contain 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.340
 microbes and by doing this what are you 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.649
 doing is leads to take them to your eyes 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.489
 and this is causing you to cause 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.319
 the infection 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.510
 also in others it must have because 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.430
 you are irritating the 11 irritating given 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.410
 that treated you're hurting them what 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.239
 which makes you cry a lot and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.540
 so they can get out of the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.540
 desire 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.719

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.260

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.270

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.540
