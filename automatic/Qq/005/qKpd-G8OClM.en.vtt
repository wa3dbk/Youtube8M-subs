00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello colleagues in touch pashkin frazer 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:10.139
 This video is about my work 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.840
 the place I often talk about what 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.330
 I have wonderful beautiful and vice and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.310
 I totally agree vise 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.400
 really wonderful but they 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.289
 require appropriate care now I 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.289
 I am going to make installation of a vice 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.840
 on the table of the milling machine and how they saw 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 The movie began with the fact that I was rubbing 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.309
 rags 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.290
 table milling machine similar 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.489
 you need to pass the handle 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 and on the sole of the vise remove all the chips 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 and clear all inner pockets and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.430
 surface such a procedure I produce 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.430
 at each installation of milling equipment 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.430
 on the table milling machine is not a secret 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.300
 that the chips between the soles 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 vice 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.500
 and table milling machine can 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.530
 lead to the formation of dents on the table 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.260
 so and on the sole vise and also this 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.869
 will cause the vise to stand in 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.500
 unnatural position and maybe 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.560
 not parallelism in relation to 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.780
 to the table of the milling machine such 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.880
 accuracy must be shown in everything 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.400
 from such small bricks 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.159
 will form the image of 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.490
 the milling machine operator who can be trusted 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.220
 doing serious work at the same time 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.890
 one thing do not need to ride and 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.280
 all you need to keep under their control and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.579
 also think and analyze what can 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.890
 happen the next second of course 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.290
 all these abilities will come to you not 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.570
 today and not tomorrow it will be 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.759
 evolve over time and over the years 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.899
 remembering yourself in the early years of working on 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.649
 milling machine 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.899
 various things happened to me 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.750
 unforeseen circumstances so 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.710
 for example, I often drove a mill on 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.700
 sponges 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.160
 freak and them while 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.489
 and of course the vice of this current 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.739
 suffered and along with the clutches morally 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.120
 suffered and i thought it was all 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.569
 it turned out somehow 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.890
 and even that was unpredictable that time 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.550
 bang ashes and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.900
 the cutter drove onto the vise lips but now 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.180
 I understand that it was mine 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.790
 carelessness and rashness 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.120
 action probably all thanks for your attention 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.120
 goodbye
