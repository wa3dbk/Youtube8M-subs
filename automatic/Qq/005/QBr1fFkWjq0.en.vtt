 we are gone and by no means long gone 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.789
 who well we have vacation women 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.740
 that's because of my surgery but also 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.500
 were actually included in that episode 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.310
 and it something went wrong in this every 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.019
 diversion 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.670
 one I got a facebook notification that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.220
 the do it not you 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.140
 I therefore share that copyright to be 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.460
 claim had an episode 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.780
 only the first half all enough 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.809
 the second hand was clicked away 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 and that hanging lamp that can go on for a minute 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.390
 of the game 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.950
 yes that have the other last episode 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.379
 we actually have a double a-frame even 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.629
 has done two games and 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.289
 the west foots for that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.850
 surprises and 50 joule labor seconds 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.559
 so yes they show him by now 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.239
 in that vision 4 as I think we are 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.210
 the two are just two right 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.260
 lost to you what was or wages 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.820
 were one for the must be honest 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.449
 so that was in episode 5 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.120
 happens 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.439
 yes in the previous moa logo simply 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.780
 cruel and so have two cases 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.790
 two equal and see how far we get 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 we are going to achieve that vision, yes, well 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.850

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850
 see your claims 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.130

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.210
 to think 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.560
 yes it is a bit later wants very bad 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.250
 play must be really strict to what 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.250
 we play nicely 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.790
 look real defender I'm just looking at 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.670
