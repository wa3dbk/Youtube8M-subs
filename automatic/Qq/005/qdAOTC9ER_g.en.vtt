the<00:01:01.800> JR<00:01:02.640> programmer<00:01:03.210> let's<00:01:03.930> start<00:01:04.110> calling<00:01:04.260> us

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the JR programmer let's start calling us

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:15.340 
the JR programmer let's start calling us
jr.<00:01:06.409> here<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.880> jr.<00:01:09.350> as<00:01:10.350> soon<00:01:10.530> as<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.070> out

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.240 

right<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.740> guys<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.090> um<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> junior

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
right here guys this is um the junior

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.910 
right here guys this is um the junior
programmer<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.720> call<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.020> junior<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
programmer that I call it junior as we

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
programmer that I call it junior as we
just<00:01:23.189> came<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.810> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
just came up with that you can see it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.770 
just came up with that you can see it
has<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.009> NAND<00:01:31.640> reading<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.790> writing<00:01:32.909> port

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
has the NAND reading and writing port

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.990 
has the NAND reading and writing port
down<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:35.369> cool<00:01:35.729> runner

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
down here and the cool runner

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.749 
down here and the cool runner
programming<00:01:36.600> up<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.960> has<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> reset<00:01:38.579> switch

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
programming up here has a reset switch

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
programming up here has a reset switch
and<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.659> bootloader<00:01:40.079> switch<00:01:40.530> most<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> time

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and a bootloader switch most of the time

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.100 
and a bootloader switch most of the time
most<00:01:41.880> likely<00:01:42.060> you'll<00:01:42.479> never<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> use

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
most likely you'll never have to use

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830 
most likely you'll never have to use
this<00:01:43.320> unless<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.549> updated<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.570> can

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this unless it's updated then you can

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
this unless it's updated then you can
obviously<00:01:45.990> update<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> USB<00:01:49.070> it's<00:01:50.070> a

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
obviously update it it is USB it's a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.539 
obviously update it it is USB it's a
little<00:01:51.329> more<00:01:51.659> than<00:01:51.869> half<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.979> size<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.430> an

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
little more than half the size of an

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
little more than half the size of an
index<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.240> way<00:01:54.450> about<00:01:55.140> ninety<00:01:55.530> percent

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
index this way about ninety percent

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.620 
index this way about ninety percent
smaller<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:56.939> actually<00:01:57.030> have<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.360> right

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
smaller and I actually have one right

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.679 
smaller and I actually have one right
here<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:59.149> demonstrate<00:02:00.149> with

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
here so that we can demonstrate with

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.069 
here so that we can demonstrate with
this<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.890> pre-release<00:02:02.899> version<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.990> the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
this is the pre-release version of the

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.089 
this is the pre-release version of the
NAND<00:02:04.290> eggs<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:06.090> will<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.860> show<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
NAND eggs and I will just show you the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.460 
NAND eggs and I will just show you the
difference<00:02:08.459> in<00:02:09.060> size

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
difference in size

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.980 
difference in size
it's<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.980> little<00:02:11.310> larger<00:02:11.970> than<00:02:12.090> half<00:02:12.330> widthwise

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
it's a little larger than half widthwise

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.340 
it's a little larger than half widthwise
but<00:02:13.680> about<00:02:13.830> 90%<00:02:14.180> smaller<00:02:17.360> width<00:02:18.360> wise<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.200> have

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
but about 90% smaller width wise I have

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.660 
but about 90% smaller width wise I have
no<00:02:19.560> idea<00:02:19.860> which<00:02:20.040> way<00:02:20.190> you'd<00:02:20.370> call<00:02:20.640> that

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
no idea which way you'd call that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.080 
no idea which way you'd call that
lengthways<00:02:21.440> whatever<00:02:22.490> anyway<00:02:23.490> that's<00:02:23.910> not

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
lengthways whatever anyway that's not

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.930 
lengthways whatever anyway that's not
what<00:02:24.210> we're<00:02:24.300> talking<00:02:24.450> about<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:24.900> guys<00:02:25.940> but

what we're talking about here guys but

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.670 
what we're talking about here guys but
this<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.450> close-up<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.170> let's<00:02:28.410> see<00:02:28.530> if

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
this is the close-up of it let's see if

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.510 
this is the close-up of it let's see if
I<00:02:28.770> can<00:02:28.920> get<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:30.410> there<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.620> go<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.100> should

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
I can get you there we go and you should

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.510 
I can get you there we go and you should
be<00:02:32.670> able<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.850> see<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.240> really<00:02:33.570> well

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
be able to see that really well

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.910 
be able to see that really well
and<00:02:35.520> like<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:36.000> said<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.690> plug<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.380> comes<00:02:37.710> with

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and like I said the plug that comes with

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.920 
and like I said the plug that comes with
it<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.930> know<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.020> get<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.790> core<00:02:41.790> runner<00:02:42.090> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
it you know you get the core runner a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.120 
it you know you get the core runner a
cable<00:02:43.890> which<00:02:44.670> you'll<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.750> eventually<00:02:46.680> when

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
cable which you'll have eventually when

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.060 
cable which you'll have eventually when
they<00:02:47.280> get<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.550> stock<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.030> should<00:02:48.240> be<00:02:48.390> soon

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
they get the stock and should be soon

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.840 
they get the stock and should be soon
they're<00:02:50.070> supposed<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.310> be<00:02:50.430> already<00:02:50.580> on<00:02:50.700> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
they're supposed to be already on the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.420 
they're supposed to be already on the
way<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.960> is<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.260> NAND<00:02:52.500> cable<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.040> plugs<00:02:53.130> in

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
way this is the NAND cable that plugs in

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.250 
way this is the NAND cable that plugs in
here<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.600> might<00:02:54.780> not<00:02:55.020> be<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.260> right<00:02:55.290> way<00:02:56.120> it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
here that might not be the right way it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.010 
here that might not be the right way it
plugs<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.470> here<00:03:00.860> like<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:03.660> cool

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
plugs in here like that and the cool

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.670 
plugs in here like that and the cool
runner<00:03:04.290> programming<00:03:04.920> cable<00:03:05.280> would<00:03:05.640> plug<00:03:06.180> in

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
runner programming cable would plug in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.970 
runner programming cable would plug in
here<00:03:07.700> but<00:03:08.700> as<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:08.910> can<00:03:09.120> tell<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.990> is<00:03:10.560> not<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
here but as you can tell it is not the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.490 
here but as you can tell it is not the
right<00:03:11.160> size<00:03:11.490> that<00:03:12.480> was<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.690> manufacturing

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
right size that was a manufacturing

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.130 
right size that was a manufacturing
error<00:03:13.800> from<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.970> company<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.750> sent<00:03:15.990> them

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
the cable they sent the wrong cables but

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.910 
the cable they sent the wrong cables but
they're<00:03:18.840> going<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.140> make<00:03:19.320> good<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.709> as

it because it's still in my hand I will

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.699 
it because it's still in my hand I will
get<00:03:58.770> around<00:03:58.950> to<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.190> and<00:04:00.290> like<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.410> said<00:04:01.590> it

board<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.100> basically<00:04:06.030> what<00:04:06.570> I<00:04:06.600> plan<00:04:07.200> on<00:04:07.230> doing

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
board and basically what I plan on doing

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.820 
board and basically what I plan on doing
is<00:04:08.270> my<00:04:09.270> stripped<00:04:09.570> of<00:04:09.690> wire<00:04:09.900> down<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:12.830> remove

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
is my stripped of wire down and remove

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.210 
is my stripped of wire down and remove
the<00:04:13.860> shielding<00:04:14.670> a/c<00:04:15.620> they<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.650> can<00:04:16.919> get<00:04:17.010> it<00:04:17.130> to

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
the shielding a/c they I can get it to

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.150 
the shielding a/c they I can get it to
focus<00:04:17.580> on<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.850> wire

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.570 

i'ma<00:04:22.160> try<00:04:23.919> all<00:04:24.919> day<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.220> can<00:04:25.490> do<00:04:25.669> it<00:04:27.550> let<00:04:28.550> me

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
i'ma try all day I can do it let me

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.820 
i'ma try all day I can do it let me
bring<00:04:29.030> this<00:04:29.690> back<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:29.990> period<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.560> get<00:04:30.710> it

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
bring this back up period to get it

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.580 
bring this back up period to get it
focused<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.370> small<00:04:34.330> okay<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:35.389> here's<00:04:36.199> a<00:04:36.290> wire

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
focused and small okay so here's a wire

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.939 
focused and small okay so here's a wire
as<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.310> can<00:04:37.610> tell<00:04:37.760> what<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:37.970> did<00:04:38.240> was<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.949> trimmed

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
as you can tell what I did was I trimmed

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.850 
as you can tell what I did was I trimmed
off<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.160> rubber<00:04:41.030> outside<00:04:41.570> piece<00:04:41.870> then<00:04:42.710> I

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
off the rubber outside piece then I

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.900 
off the rubber outside piece then I
twisted<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.760> shielding<00:04:44.540> like<00:04:45.139> this<00:04:45.470> and<00:04:45.910> what

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
twisted the shielding like this and what

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.080 
twisted the shielding like this and what
a<00:04:46.940> plan<00:04:47.240> on<00:04:47.270> doing<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:48.970> grounding<00:04:49.970> the

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
a plan on doing is grounding the

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.270 
a plan on doing is grounding the
shielded<00:04:50.540> wire<00:04:50.750> as<00:04:51.080> well<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.949> know<00:04:52.100> that's

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
shielded wire as well you know that's

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.940 
shielded wire as well you know that's
what<00:04:52.400> you're<00:04:52.550> supposed<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:52.910> do<00:04:53.120> on<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.710> normal

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
what you're supposed to do on a normal

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.330 
what you're supposed to do on a normal
wire<00:04:55.370> these<00:04:56.180> I'm<00:04:56.419> not<00:04:56.450> sure<00:04:57.220> grounding<00:04:58.220> is

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
wire these I'm not sure grounding is
