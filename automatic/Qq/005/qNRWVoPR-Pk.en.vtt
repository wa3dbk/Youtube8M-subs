this<00:00:20.910> book<00:00:21.119> start<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.980> base<00:00:24.439> then<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.680> both

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
this book start with a base then on both

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.400 
this book start with a base then on both
sides<00:00:26.160> you're<00:00:26.580> gonna<00:00:26.699> place<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.410> diagonal

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
sides you're gonna place a diagonal

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.890 
sides you're gonna place a diagonal
block<00:00:28.939> just<00:00:29.939> like<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.330> then<00:00:30.689> you're<00:00:30.810> gonna

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
block just like that then you're gonna

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.590 
block just like that then you're gonna
go<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.560> them<00:00:31.740> both<00:00:31.920> sides<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.300> basically

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
