it's really cool when it bounces off the
shield's<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.759> yeah<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.299> time<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
shield's like that yeah I if you time it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.240 
shield's like that yeah I if you time it
just<00:01:45.689> right<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.829> zoom<00:01:47.040> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
just right and if you like zoom and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.649 
just right and if you like zoom and
maybe<00:01:47.399> see<00:01:47.610> someone's<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.149> starting<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
maybe see someone's like starting to

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
maybe see someone's like starting to
shoot<00:01:48.810> at<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.590> cannot<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.610> can

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
shoot at you then you cannot you can

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.399 
shoot at you then you cannot you can
actually<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.810> shield<00:01:52.020> up<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
actually just put your shield up in a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
actually just put your shield up in a
locket<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.729> if<00:01:53.909> you're<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.600> you're

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
locket but I think if you're if you're

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
locket but I think if you're if you're
crouching<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.350> whatever<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.670> can't

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
crouching or whatever then you can't

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.399 
crouching or whatever then you can't
then<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> shield<00:01:57.509> won't<00:01:57.719> work<00:01:57.899> safe<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.290> like

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
then the shield won't work safe to like

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.160 
then the shield won't work safe to like
stand<00:01:58.590> up<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> activate<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.030> shield<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:01.110> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
stand up and activate your shield so I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.780 
stand up and activate your shield so I
remember<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> tried<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.250> time<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
remember I tried to do that one time and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.580 
remember I tried to do that one time and
like<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.540> couldn't<00:02:04.079> figure<00:02:04.320> out<00:02:04.439> why

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
like I can I couldn't figure out why

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.210 
like I can I couldn't figure out why
they<00:02:04.799> she<00:02:04.950> wasn't<00:02:05.340> turning<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.820> but

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
they she wasn't turning on but

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.850 
they she wasn't turning on but
it<00:02:06.730> was<00:02:06.940> cuz<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.240> was<00:02:07.360> crouching<00:02:07.600> yeah<00:02:08.320> yeah<00:02:08.830> i

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
it was cuz I was crouching yeah yeah i

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.080 
it was cuz I was crouching yeah yeah i
mean<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.070> crouching<00:02:09.369> definitely<00:02:09.820> helps

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
mean the crouching definitely helps

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.210 
mean the crouching definitely helps

camp<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.070> background<00:02:30.460> with<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> little

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
camp in the background with a little

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.690 
camp in the background with a little
mini<00:02:31.360> flag<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.960> all<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.200> looks<00:02:32.500> awesome<00:02:32.700> and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
mini flag and all that looks awesome and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.400 
mini flag and all that looks awesome and
then<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.270> surprise<00:02:34.630> got<00:02:34.870> into<00:02:35.080> tent<00:02:35.260> yeah

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
then the surprise got into tent yeah

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.630 
then the surprise got into tent yeah
this<00:02:35.560> is<00:02:35.650> definitely<00:02:35.740> an<00:02:36.010> awesome<00:02:36.280> map<00:02:36.460> but

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
this is definitely an awesome map but

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.890 
this is definitely an awesome map but
I'm<00:02:36.730> surprised<00:02:37.090> we<00:02:37.180> haven't<00:02:37.390> seen<00:02:37.600> more<00:02:37.810> of

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
I'm surprised we haven't seen more of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.760 
I'm surprised we haven't seen more of
this<00:02:37.990> with<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:39.190> long<00:02:39.430> shots<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:40.770> guess

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
this with the the long shots I guess

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.140 
this with the the long shots I guess
it's<00:02:42.100> because<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:42.610> haven't<00:02:42.820> been<00:02:42.940> able<00:02:43.030> to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
it's because we haven't been able to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.730 
it's because we haven't been able to
recreate<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:44.260> know<00:02:44.350> there<00:02:44.500> hasn't<00:02:44.650> been

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
recreate the you know there hasn't been

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.680 
recreate the you know there hasn't been
a<00:02:44.830> big<00:02:45.070> flat<00:02:45.400> open<00:02:45.580> area<00:02:45.940> maybe<00:02:46.180> that's<00:02:46.360> why<00:02:46.510> we

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
a big flat open area maybe that's why we

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.560 
a big flat open area maybe that's why we
haven't<00:02:46.870> been<00:02:46.930> able<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.200> do<00:02:47.350> this<00:02:47.500> in<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.709> past

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
haven't been able to do this in the past

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.940 
haven't been able to do this in the past
yeah<00:02:49.570> for<00:02:49.959> driving<00:02:50.350> is<00:02:50.470> freaking<00:02:50.830> awesome

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
yeah for driving is freaking awesome

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.310 
yeah for driving is freaking awesome
I've<00:02:51.700> seen<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.240> a<00:02:52.450> bunch<00:02:52.660> of<00:02:52.750> cool<00:02:52.930> maps<00:02:53.140> on

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
I've seen like a bunch of cool maps on

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.530 
I've seen like a bunch of cool maps on
here<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.680> far<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.820> guys<00:02:54.910> should<00:02:54.970> make

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
here so far and you guys should make

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.940 
here so far and you guys should make
some<00:02:55.690> more<00:02:55.870> because<00:02:56.230> we<00:02:56.500> definitely<00:02:56.830> look

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
some more because we definitely look

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.620 
some more because we definitely look
forward<00:02:57.010> I'll<00:02:57.370> except<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.060> featuring<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
forward I'll except for the featuring it

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.110 
forward I'll except for the featuring it
cuz<00:02:58.930> it's<00:02:59.200> cool<00:02:59.410> and<00:03:00.370> then<00:03:00.490> I<00:03:00.580> think<00:03:00.820> this<00:03:00.940> one

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
cuz it's cool and then I think this one

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.730 
cuz it's cool and then I think this one
is<00:03:01.150> probably<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.720> modded<00:03:02.080> one<00:03:02.200> just<00:03:02.410> because<00:03:02.500> of

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
is probably a modded one just because of

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.710 
is probably a modded one just because of
the<00:03:02.770> number<00:03:03.070> of<00:03:03.100> trees<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.120> know<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.690> can

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
the number of trees so you know you can

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.330 
the number of trees so you know you can
find<00:03:05.050> us<00:03:05.200> out<00:03:05.410> there<00:03:05.560> easy<00:03:05.770> enough<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.250> we

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
find us out there easy enough and we

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.660 
find us out there easy enough and we
ended<00:03:06.730> up<00:03:06.820> using<00:03:06.880> one<00:03:07.300> for<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.570> huge<00:03:07.870> forest<00:03:08.260> map

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
ended up using one for a huge forest map

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.070 
ended up using one for a huge forest map
