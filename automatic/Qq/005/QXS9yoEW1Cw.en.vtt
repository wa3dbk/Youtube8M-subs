00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.590

 Titan also Gutmann will be cheaper for 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.140
 Dedicated to black also really strong

 pretty strong booster so far helix 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.210
 Exotics of the recall I am not so 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.820
 far from the intellect either way 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.909
 wants to play a lot scary 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:15.790
 temperament two was the challenge 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.100
 accept cute come trick on clouds 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.590

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.149
 loud soundless for 321 fly 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.740
 everyone is caught when she is caught 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.000
 little hangover his hand off and puts the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.460
 supreme cup his library in the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 Cemetery actually a top card like 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.850
 I think 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.530
 the eternal flame in contrast, rather not 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:40.149
 so strong that sirensong twice 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.729
 criticism the ability to pay two more 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.399
 Tap tap a chain of your choice 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.350

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.539

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.090
 pay and fix plus one plus 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.159
 One brand is a cool card itself 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.350
 In the late game you play the radar 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.270
 pump three four five times in and had 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.310
 really strong bidder for a top 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.200
 I would limit you to every card 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.240
 case in any case not peck 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.810
 Bad sees it looks Hessian 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.480
 I often have star breaks in the 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.489
 sideboard played in release for 402 1 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.050
 completely destroy in the game is on 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.700
 every case very nice to the creature 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.200
 Write down or shoot down the holders 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.700
 or somehow 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.790
 others too are definitely whole 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.739
 nice connection with a creature 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.660
 Definitely not a bad card 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.580
 and yes that was the fourth booster here 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.480
 in the warm up row and I have 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.450
