00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
but what was really moving I thought was

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.870 
but what was really moving I thought was
the<00:07:16.510> Alexander<00:07:16.960> McQueen<00:07:17.460> tribute<00:07:18.460> at<00:07:18.639> the<00:07:18.669> end

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:21.220 
which just I mean it was so sad I

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.980 
which just I mean it was so sad I
thought<00:07:21.639> Daphne<00:07:22.060> Guinness<00:07:22.240> was<00:07:22.539> gonna<00:07:22.690> just

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
thought Daphne Guinness was gonna just

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.540 
thought Daphne Guinness was gonna just
break<00:07:23.169> down<00:07:23.229> because<00:07:23.830> it<00:07:24.010> just<00:07:24.130> really<00:07:24.340> was

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
break down because it just really was

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:52.390 
break down because it just really was
upsetting
