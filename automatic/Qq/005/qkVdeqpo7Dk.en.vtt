00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
with manual because I always like to do

turbo<00:00:58.260> boost<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.859> never<00:00:59.489> play<00:00:59.699> automatic<00:01:00.210> at

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
all so at the beginning you always try

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
all so at the beginning you always try
to<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:04.170> good<00:01:04.199> head<00:01:04.589> start<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.280> know

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
to get a really good head start you know

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.859 
to get a really good head start you know
it's<00:01:05.610> always<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.939> your<00:01:05.970> advantage<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.689> be

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
race and the first mushroom we just used

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.960 
race and the first mushroom we just used
it<00:01:11.729> between<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> palm<00:01:12.390> trees<00:01:12.659> right<00:01:12.869> there<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
it between the palm trees right there I

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.789 
it between the palm trees right there I
see<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.570> beat<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.080> water<00:01:16.320> still

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
see because the beat the water still

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.469 
see because the beat the water still
hasn't<00:01:17.189> rose<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> way<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> beach

recommend you using just a wii

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.609 
recommend you using just a wii
controller<00:01:41.310> itself<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.170> use<00:01:43.380> both

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
controller itself so we just use both

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.130 
controller itself so we just use both
mushrooms<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.149> water<00:01:45.390> rolls<00:01:45.869> all

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
mushrooms because the water rolls all

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
mushrooms because the water rolls all
the<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.920> beach<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> would<00:01:47.640> be

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the way out to the beach and it would be

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.819 
the way out to the beach and it would be
hard<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> drive<00:01:48.299> through<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> water<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.740> would

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
hard to drive through the water it would

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.280 
hard to drive through the water it would
actually<00:01:50.009> slow<00:01:50.399> us<00:01:50.610> down<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.899> had<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.229> use

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
actually slow us down so we had to use

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.840
