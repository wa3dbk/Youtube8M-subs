00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:22.359 
rough idle said the check engine light

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.560 
rough idle said the check engine light
come<00:00:22.810> off<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.140> on<00:00:23.259> the<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:26.109> certain<00:00:26.529> times<00:00:26.800> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
come off and on the at certain times the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.919 
come off and on the at certain times the
engine<00:00:28.570> seems<00:00:28.839> to<00:00:29.140> Rev<00:00:29.380> and<00:00:29.710> not<00:00:29.859> Rev<00:00:30.160> and

engine seems to Rev and not Rev and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.450 
engine seems to Rev and not Rev and
something<00:00:31.929> was<00:00:32.050> wrong<00:00:32.230> so<00:00:32.560> they<00:00:33.070> took<00:00:33.220> it<00:00:33.280> in

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
something was wrong so they took it in

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.060 
something was wrong so they took it in
to<00:00:33.579> get<00:00:33.670> it<00:00:33.730> diagnosed<00:00:34.350> shop<00:00:35.350> diagnosed<00:00:35.890> it

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
to get it diagnosed shop diagnosed it

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.660 
to get it diagnosed shop diagnosed it
with<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.220> bed<00:00:36.840> IMR<00:00:37.840> see<00:00:38.230> that<00:00:39.129> stands<00:00:39.550> for

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
with a bed IMR see that stands for

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.799 
with a bed IMR see that stands for
intake<00:00:40.210> manifold<00:00:40.930> runner<00:00:41.739> control<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:43.600> will

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
intake manifold runner control it will

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.590 
intake manifold runner control it will
set<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.109> code<00:00:44.379> in<00:00:44.620> the<00:00:44.649> PCM<00:00:45.219> and<00:00:45.460> usually<00:00:46.149> turn

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
set a code in the PCM and usually turn

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.810 
set a code in the PCM and usually turn
the<00:00:46.719> light<00:00:46.899> on<00:00:46.930> it<00:00:47.260> may<00:00:47.379> not<00:00:47.559> stay<00:00:47.890> on<00:00:48.100> but<00:00:48.730> it

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
the light on it may not stay on but it

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.729 
the light on it may not stay on but it
will<00:00:48.879> flash<00:00:49.149> off<00:00:49.449> and<00:00:49.660> on<00:00:49.750> flash<00:00:50.109> off<00:00:50.410> and<00:00:50.620> on

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
will flash off and on flash off and on

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.299 
will flash off and on flash off and on
the<00:00:51.609> most<00:00:51.760> common<00:00:52.300> cause<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:53.410> intake

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
the most common cause is the intake

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.979 
the most common cause is the intake
manifold<00:00:54.850> runner<00:00:55.090> control<00:00:55.510> it's<00:00:55.629> actually<00:00:55.929> a

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
manifold runner control it's actually a

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.950 
manifold runner control it's actually a
little<00:00:56.140> solenoid<00:00:56.710> or<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.070> little<00:00:57.960> electrical

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
little solenoid or a little electrical

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.619 
little solenoid or a little electrical
vacuum<00:00:59.469> actuated<00:00:59.679> valve<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:00.760> in<00:01:01.420> fact

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
vacuum actuated valve and in fact

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.540 
vacuum actuated valve and in fact
basically<00:01:02.589> all<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:02.949> does<00:01:03.190> is<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:06.040> computer

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
basically all it does is it the computer

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.300 
basically all it does is it the computer
tells<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:07.090> when<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.750> how<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.230> distribute<00:01:09.040> the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
tells it when and how to distribute the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.450 
tells it when and how to distribute the
air<00:01:09.490> into<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.450> intake<00:01:10.600> manifold<00:01:11.410> and<00:01:11.620> when<00:01:12.340> it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
air into the intake manifold and when it

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.690 
air into the intake manifold and when it
fails<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.750> computer<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:15.010> telling<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.550> do

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
fails the computer is telling you to do

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.190 
fails the computer is telling you to do
something<00:01:16.090> it's<00:01:16.240> not<00:01:16.360> doing<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:16.870> so<00:01:17.080> it

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
something it's not doing it so it

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.390 
something it's not doing it so it
doesn't<00:01:17.530> know<00:01:17.590> what<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.800> do<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.130> that's<00:01:18.280> why

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
doesn't know what to do and that's why

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.760 
doesn't know what to do and that's why
it'll<00:01:18.640> set<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:18.850> code<00:01:19.150> it<00:01:19.990> can<00:01:20.170> cause<00:01:20.380> all<00:01:20.620> the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
it'll set the code it can cause all the

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.380 
it'll set the code it can cause all the
symptoms<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.430> customers<00:01:21.850> been<00:01:22.030> having

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
symptoms that the customers been having

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.420 
symptoms that the customers been having
and<00:01:22.650> basically<00:01:23.650> we're<00:01:23.800> going<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:23.980> go<00:01:24.100> in<00:01:24.250> and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
and basically we're going to go in and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.490 
and basically we're going to go in and
show<00:01:24.640> you<00:01:24.700> how<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.480> replace<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.170> this<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.470> a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
show you how to replace this this is a

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.680

very simple job do yourself it's just

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.110 
very simple job do yourself it's just
basically<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.410> bowl<00:01:29.980> couple<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.580> vacuum<00:01:30.910> lines

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
basically a bowl couple of vacuum lines

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.880 
basically a bowl couple of vacuum lines
a<00:01:31.330> plug<00:01:31.600> it's<00:01:31.930> probably<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.980> 10<00:01:33.460> 15<00:01:33.700> minute<00:01:33.970> job

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
a plug it's probably a 10 15 minute job

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.930 
a plug it's probably a 10 15 minute job
doing<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.070> video<00:01:36.370> might<00:01:36.700> take<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.880> couple

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
doing the video might take a couple

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.580 
doing the video might take a couple
extra<00:01:37.300> minutes<00:01:37.720> but<00:01:37.900> it's<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.110> very<00:01:38.350> very

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
extra minutes but it's a very very

this<00:01:43.000> yourself<00:01:43.830> basically<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:46.060> engine<00:01:46.450> here

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
this yourself basically the engine here

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.690 
this yourself basically the engine here
this<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:46.990> 2.3<00:01:47.800> liter<00:01:48.010> here's<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.430> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
this is a 2.3 liter here's the the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.730 
this is a 2.3 liter here's the the
intake<00:01:49.030> manifold<00:01:49.540> you<00:01:49.630> can<00:01:49.810> see<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.260> just

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
intake manifold you can see and just

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.070 
intake manifold you can see and just
down<00:01:51.010> below<00:01:51.400> it<00:01:51.640> right<00:01:51.820> down<00:01:52.510> here<00:01:52.840> there's

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
down below it right down here there's

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.880 
down below it right down here there's
where<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:53.410> parts<00:01:53.740> located<00:01:54.870> so<00:01:55.870> if<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.770> have

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
where that parts located so if you have

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.610 
where that parts located so if you have
a<00:01:56.920> 2003<00:01:57.820> Ford<00:01:58.120> Ranger<00:01:58.360> with<00:01:58.660> a<00:01:58.690> 2.3<00:01:59.440> liter

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
a 2003 Ford Ranger with a 2.3 liter

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.680 
a 2003 Ford Ranger with a 2.3 liter
engine<00:02:00.040> it's<00:02:00.520> also<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.940> same<00:02:01.150> as<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.480> little

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
engine it's also the same as the little

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.530 
engine it's also the same as the little
Mazda<00:02:02.140> pickup<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.790> two-point<00:02:04.180> most<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.480> the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
Mazda pickup the two-point most of the

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.360 
Mazda pickup the two-point most of the
2.3<00:02:05.050> liter<00:02:05.590> engines<00:02:05.920> are<00:02:05.980> going<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.190> be<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
2.3 liter engines are going to be the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.669 
2.3 liter engines are going to be the
same<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:06.820> that's<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.090> location<00:02:07.240> of<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.870> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
same so that's the location of it to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.050 
same so that's the location of it to
report<00:02:09.099> out<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.369> is<00:02:09.520> what<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.729> new<00:02:09.879> one

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
report out this is what the new one

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.220 
report out this is what the new one
looks<00:02:10.300> like<00:02:10.980> basically<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.719> same<00:02:13.719> part<00:02:14.019> it's

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
looks like basically a same part it's

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.289 
looks like basically a same part it's
got<00:02:14.379> that's<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.739> hole<00:02:14.950> for<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.250> bolt<00:02:15.400> these

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
got that's the hole for the bolt these

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.610 
got that's the hole for the bolt these
are<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.659> two<00:02:16.840> vacuum

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
are the two vacuum

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.110 
are the two vacuum
lines<00:02:17.739> here<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.220> then<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:18.849> is<00:02:19.030> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
lines here and then this is the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.470 
lines here and then this is the
electronic<00:02:19.629> plug<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.909> this<00:02:22.060> will<00:02:22.239> plug

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
electronic plug that that this will plug

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.809

little<00:03:13.299> bolt<00:03:13.629> which<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.959> can't<00:03:14.170> see<00:03:14.440> very

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
little bolt which you can't see very

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.460 
little bolt which you can't see very
well<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.129> the<00:03:15.909> camera<00:03:16.329> but<00:03:16.540> where<00:03:17.140> I'm<00:03:17.230> putting

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
well on the camera but where I'm putting

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.500 
well on the camera but where I'm putting
this<00:03:17.530> ratchet<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.099> a<00:03:18.129> little<00:03:18.430> bolt<00:03:18.640> so<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.390> is

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
this ratchet is a little bolt so this is

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.479 
this ratchet is a little bolt so this is
definitely<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:20.109> job<00:03:20.409> a<00:03:20.470> do-it-yourselfer<00:03:21.340> can

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
definitely a job a do-it-yourselfer can

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.650 
definitely a job a do-it-yourselfer can
do<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:24.310> location<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.000> this<00:03:25.150> part<00:03:25.450> it's

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
do the location of this part it's

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.420 
do the location of this part it's
actually<00:03:26.169> on<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:26.470> driver<00:03:26.829> side<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
actually on the driver side of the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.430 
actually on the driver side of the
engine<00:03:27.910> on<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.510> bottom<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.079> intake

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
engine on the bottom of the intake

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.729 
engine on the bottom of the intake
manifold<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:31.540> basically<00:03:31.930> pull<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.349> vacuum

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
manifold you basically pull the vacuum

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.860 
manifold you basically pull the vacuum
line<00:03:32.950> off<00:03:33.160> and<00:03:33.190> inspect<00:03:33.849> it<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.359> other<00:03:34.510> end<00:03:34.780> of

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
line off and inspect it the other end of

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.449 
line off and inspect it the other end of
it<00:03:34.989> just<00:03:35.019> plugs<00:03:35.440> in<00:03:35.709> right<00:03:35.739> here<00:03:36.190> to<00:03:36.340> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
it just plugs in right here to the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.610 
it just plugs in right here to the
intake<00:03:36.790> manifold<00:03:37.329> so<00:03:37.840> that's<00:03:38.019> all<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.500> is

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
intake manifold so that's all that it is

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.759 
intake manifold so that's all that it is
just<00:03:38.950> this<00:03:39.629> just<00:03:40.629> this<00:03:40.780> little<00:03:41.019> rubber<00:03:41.290> vacuum

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
just this just this little rubber vacuum

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.470 
just this just this little rubber vacuum
line<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.069> want<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.310> inspect<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:42.910> for<00:03:43.180> cracks

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
line you want to inspect this for cracks

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.750 
line you want to inspect this for cracks
or<00:03:43.750> holes<00:03:43.780> if<00:03:44.260> there<00:03:44.829> is<00:03:44.980> any<00:03:45.220> cracks<00:03:45.549> or<00:03:45.700> holes

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.670 
or holes if there is any cracks or holes
you<00:03:46.180> want<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.419> replace<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.049> because<00:03:47.530> this

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
you want to replace it because this

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.259 
you want to replace it because this
could<00:03:47.889> actually<00:03:48.040> be<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.489> problem<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.090> not

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
could actually be the problem and not

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.930 
could actually be the problem and not
the<00:03:49.329> manifold<00:03:49.989> or<00:03:50.349> not<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.709> IMR<00:03:51.579> see<00:03:53.940> there's

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
the manifold or not the IMR see there's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.379 
the manifold or not the IMR see there's
one<00:03:55.209> more<00:03:55.419> vacuum<00:03:55.810> line<00:03:55.989> on<00:03:56.139> the<00:03:56.230> bottom<00:03:56.620> just

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
one more vacuum line on the bottom just

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.770 
one more vacuum line on the bottom just
grab<00:03:58.389> that<00:03:58.660> wiggle<00:03:59.109> it<00:04:00.060> pull<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.180> off<00:04:01.329> of<00:04:01.510> there

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
grab that wiggle it pull it off of there

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.620 
grab that wiggle it pull it off of there
now<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:04.370> electrical<00:04:04.820> connector<00:04:05.180> is<00:04:05.270> a<00:04:05.300> little

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
now the electrical connector is a little

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.480 
now the electrical connector is a little
difficult<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.140> see<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.740> really<00:04:07.040> can't<00:04:07.280> see<00:04:07.460> it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
difficult to see you really can't see it

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.340 
difficult to see you really can't see it
from<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.820> camera<00:04:08.210> view<00:04:08.240> I'm<00:04:08.900> going<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.140> take

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
from the camera view I'm going to take

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.590 
from the camera view I'm going to take
the<00:04:09.770> part<00:04:10.100> off<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.700> then<00:04:10.970> disconnect<00:04:11.330> the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
the part off and then disconnect the

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.730 
the part off and then disconnect the
electrical<00:04:11.960> connector<00:04:12.350> when<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.500> have<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
electrical connector when I have the

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.680 
electrical connector when I have the
part<00:04:12.950> loose<00:04:13.130> so<00:04:13.460> basically<00:04:14.240> there's<00:04:14.450> one

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
part loose so basically there's one

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.060 
part loose so basically there's one
little<00:04:14.870> 8<00:04:15.740> millimeter<00:04:16.340> bolt<00:04:16.670> here<00:04:18.070> little

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
little 8 millimeter bolt here little

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:26.410 
little 8 millimeter bolt here little
ratchet<00:04:22.990> got<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.110> bolt<00:04:24.350> out<00:04:25.060> just<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.180> little

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
ratchet got the bolt out just a little

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.800 
ratchet got the bolt out just a little
tiny<00:04:26.740> 8<00:04:27.740> millimeter<00:04:28.280> hex<00:04:28.790> head<00:04:29.060> bolt<00:04:29.360> took<00:04:29.690> it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
tiny 8 millimeter hex head bolt took it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.930 
tiny 8 millimeter hex head bolt took it
out<00:04:29.900> with<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.080> ratchet<00:04:30.580> you<00:04:31.580> have<00:04:31.700> to<00:04:31.790> see

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
out with the ratchet you have to see

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.480 
out with the ratchet you have to see
that<00:04:35.169> anyway<00:04:36.169> it<00:04:36.530> holds<00:04:36.890> this<00:04:37.010> little<00:04:37.280> piece

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
that anyway it holds this little piece

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.110 
that anyway it holds this little piece
on<00:04:37.700> and<00:04:38.060> now<00:04:38.750> you<00:04:38.810> can<00:04:39.020> flip<00:04:39.230> it<00:04:39.320> over<00:04:39.500> and<00:04:40.120> see

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
on and now you can flip it over and see

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.720 
on and now you can flip it over and see
the<00:04:41.270> electrical<00:04:41.780> connector<00:04:42.260> if<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.280> turn<00:04:43.550> this

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
the electrical connector if I turn this

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.420 
the electrical connector if I turn this
around<00:04:44.710> you'll<00:04:45.710> be<00:04:45.800> able<00:04:45.890> to<00:04:46.010> see<00:04:46.130> this<00:04:46.280> little

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
around you'll be able to see this little

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.210 
around you'll be able to see this little
tab<00:04:46.730> here<00:04:46.840> that<00:04:47.840> tab<00:04:48.230> needs<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.620> be<00:04:48.740> lifted<00:04:48.950> up

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
tab here that tab needs to be lifted up

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.920 
tab here that tab needs to be lifted up
you<00:04:49.940> can<00:04:50.090> use<00:04:50.210> a<00:04:50.240> little<00:04:50.510> flat-head

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
you can use a little flat-head

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.190 
you can use a little flat-head
screwdriver<00:04:50.960> or<00:04:51.800> your<00:04:52.040> fingernail<00:04:52.990> just<00:04:53.990> lift

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
screwdriver or your fingernail just lift

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.500 
screwdriver or your fingernail just lift
that<00:04:54.290> piece<00:04:54.620> up<00:04:54.910> wiggle<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:56.090> and<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.419> will

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
that piece up wiggle this and it will

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.150 
that piece up wiggle this and it will
pop<00:04:56.720> out<00:04:59.200> and<00:05:00.200> pops<00:05:00.500> right<00:05:00.650> out<00:05:00.860> just<00:05:00.890> an

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
pop out and pops right out just an

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.960 
pop out and pops right out just an
electrical<00:05:01.610> plug<00:05:01.790> this<00:05:02.780> fits<00:05:03.110> right<00:05:03.290> into<00:05:03.470> it

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
electrical plug this fits right into it

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.610 
electrical plug this fits right into it
and<00:05:04.970> that's<00:05:05.240> it<00:05:07.210> okay<00:05:08.210> so<00:05:08.720> there<00:05:08.930> is<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.500> old

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
and that's it okay so there is the old

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.190 
and that's it okay so there is the old
part<00:05:10.419> again<00:05:11.419> we're<00:05:11.570> going<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.750> compare<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.110> to

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
part again we're going to compare it to

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.860 
part again we're going to compare it to
the<00:05:12.320> new<00:05:12.560> part<00:05:13.120> make<00:05:14.120> sure<00:05:14.390> it's<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.690> right

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
the new part make sure it's the right

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.000 
the new part make sure it's the right
one<00:05:16.479> should<00:05:17.479> look<00:05:17.660> identical<00:05:17.990> there<00:05:18.830> may<00:05:18.979> even

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
one should look identical there may even

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:20.530 
one should look identical there may even
be<00:05:19.370> a<00:05:19.400> part<00:05:19.669> number<00:05:19.970> on<00:05:20.120> it<00:05:20.150> but<00:05:20.270> you<00:05:20.450> don't

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
be a part number on it but you don't

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.180 
be a part number on it but you don't
have<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.780> go<00:05:20.900> by<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:21.110> just<00:05:21.470> looking<00:05:21.800> make

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
have to go by that just looking make

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.590 
have to go by that just looking make
sure<00:05:22.340> the<00:05:22.460> parts<00:05:22.729> identical<00:05:23.240> make<00:05:23.360> sure<00:05:23.479> the

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
sure the parts identical make sure the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.230 
sure the parts identical make sure the
plug<00:05:23.840> is<00:05:24.020> identical<00:05:24.610> that<00:05:25.610> means<00:05:25.669> you've

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
plug is identical that means you've

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.690 
plug is identical that means you've
ordered<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.810> correct<00:05:27.110> part<00:05:27.520> there's<00:05:28.520> the

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
ordered the correct part there's the

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.430 
ordered the correct part there's the
part<00:05:28.910> number<00:05:29.150> on<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.360> base<00:05:30.790> and<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:33.020> install

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
part number on the base and to install

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.140 
part number on the base and to install
this<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.890> just<00:05:34.100> basically<00:05:34.250> reverse<00:05:34.940> the

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
this you just basically reverse the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.540 
this you just basically reverse the
removal<00:05:35.600> procedure<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:36.440> do<00:05:36.800> want<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.220> inspect

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
removal procedure I do want to inspect

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.310 
removal procedure I do want to inspect
that<00:05:37.790> bottom<00:05:38.210> vacuum<00:05:38.690> line<00:05:38.900> because<00:05:39.290> that

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
that bottom vacuum line because that

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.130 
that bottom vacuum line because that
line<00:05:39.970> you<00:05:40.970> couldn't<00:05:41.300> see<00:05:41.479> very<00:05:41.510> well<00:05:41.930> if<00:05:42.050> I

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
line you couldn't see very well if I

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.940 
line you couldn't see very well if I
pull<00:05:42.380> it<00:05:42.410> up<00:05:42.620> oh<00:05:43.630> guess<00:05:44.630> what<00:05:44.780> they<00:05:45.770> got<00:05:45.919> a

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
pull it up oh guess what they got a

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.820 
pull it up oh guess what they got a
cracked<00:05:46.250> vacuum<00:05:46.729> line<00:05:46.940> that<00:05:47.690> definitely<00:05:48.410> will

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
cracked vacuum line that definitely will

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.070 
cracked vacuum line that definitely will
cause<00:05:49.130> the<00:05:49.460> problem<00:05:49.850> with<00:05:50.000> the<00:05:50.090> IMR<00:05:50.600> see<00:05:50.840> it

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
cause the problem with the IMR see it

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.870 
cause the problem with the IMR see it
very<00:05:51.650> well<00:05:51.800> could<00:05:52.160> have<00:05:52.220> been<00:05:52.310> the<00:05:52.520> entire

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
very well could have been the entire

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.770 
very well could have been the entire
cause<00:05:53.919> this<00:05:54.919> this<00:05:55.220> cracked<00:05:55.580> line<00:05:55.880> will<00:05:56.240> will

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
cause this this cracked line will will

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.590 
cause this this cracked line will will
allow<00:05:57.080> vacuum<00:05:57.650> to<00:05:58.280> not<00:05:58.520> flow<00:05:58.910> properly<00:05:59.479> and

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
allow vacuum to not flow properly and

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.570 
allow vacuum to not flow properly and
this<00:05:59.660> is<00:05:59.840> most<00:06:00.110> likely<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.590> problem<00:06:01.250> with

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
this is most likely the problem with

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.320 
this is most likely the problem with
this<00:06:01.729> vehicle<00:06:01.990> let's<00:06:02.990> see<00:06:03.200> what<00:06:03.350> else

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.210 

okay<00:06:06.810> this<00:06:06.990> line<00:06:07.200> goes<00:06:07.410> back<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:07.890> connects<00:06:08.130> to

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
okay this line goes back and connects to

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.100 
okay this line goes back and connects to
the<00:06:08.340> other<00:06:08.640> backside<00:06:09.270> here<00:06:09.540> and<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.720> seems<00:06:09.960> to

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:10.110 
the other backside here and it seems to

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.770 
the other backside here and it seems to
be<00:06:10.230> in<00:06:10.350> good<00:06:10.500> shape<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:11.330> the<00:06:12.330> customers

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
be in good shape so the customers

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.180 
be in good shape so the customers
already<00:06:13.080> blocked<00:06:13.230> this<00:06:13.440> part<00:06:13.710> and<00:06:13.830> supplied
