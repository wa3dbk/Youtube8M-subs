00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.470 

the<00:00:19.010> way<00:00:19.130> that<00:00:19.310> I'd<00:00:19.400> like<00:00:19.520> to<00:00:19.670> begin<00:00:19.820> this<00:00:20.240> is

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
the way that I'd like to begin this is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.350 
the way that I'd like to begin this is
to<00:00:21.140> identify<00:00:21.350> some<00:00:22.160> landmarks<00:00:22.760> because<00:00:23.150> I

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
to identify some landmarks because I

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.810 
to identify some landmarks because I
believe<00:00:24.290> that<00:00:24.320> in<00:00:24.770> thinking<00:00:25.250> about<00:00:25.370> the<00:00:25.670> head

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
believe that in thinking about the head

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.970 
believe that in thinking about the head
if<00:00:26.000> you<00:00:26.150> name<00:00:26.450> a<00:00:26.720> thing<00:00:27.410> if<00:00:27.620> you<00:00:27.710> name<00:00:27.950> a

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
if you name a thing if you name a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.680 
if you name a thing if you name a
landmark<00:00:28.490> it<00:00:28.910> will<00:00:29.090> at<00:00:29.180> least<00:00:29.300> get<00:00:29.539> you

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
landmark it will at least get you

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.870 
landmark it will at least get you
thinking<00:00:30.080> about<00:00:30.200> that<00:00:30.530> landmark<00:00:31.039> it's<00:00:31.520> one<00:00:31.760> of

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
thinking about that landmark it's one of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.250 
thinking about that landmark it's one of
the<00:00:31.940> things<00:00:32.180> that<00:00:32.390> it<00:00:32.509> seems<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:32.870> me<00:00:33.020> as<00:00:33.140> an

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
the things that it seems to me as an

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.410 
the things that it seems to me as an
instructor<00:00:33.699> here<00:00:34.699> in<00:00:34.850> New<00:00:34.940> York<00:00:35.120> City<00:00:35.329> over

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
instructor here in New York City over

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.619 
instructor here in New York City over
the<00:00:35.659> past<00:00:35.870> decade<00:00:36.320> is<00:00:37.219> very<00:00:37.789> important<00:00:38.269> toward

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
the past decade is very important toward

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.529 
the past decade is very important toward
developing<00:00:39.499> oneself<00:00:39.949> in<00:00:40.100> portrait<00:00:40.460> work<00:00:40.640> what

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
developing oneself in portrait work what

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:42.849 
developing oneself in portrait work what
I've<00:00:41.629> done<00:00:41.749> for<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:42.019> today<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:42.589> make<00:00:42.829> a

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
I've done for you today is to make a

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.829 
I've done for you today is to make a
three-dimensional<00:00:43.539> structural<00:00:44.539> drawings

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:44.839 
three-dimensional structural drawings

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.079 
three-dimensional structural drawings
more<00:00:45.440> like<00:00:45.589> what<00:00:45.739> I'd<00:00:45.859> call<00:00:46.069> it<00:00:46.219> rather<00:00:46.760> than<00:00:46.999> a

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
more like what I'd call it rather than a

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.079 
more like what I'd call it rather than a
sculpture<00:00:47.539> of<00:00:48.229> some<00:00:48.469> of<00:00:48.589> these<00:00:48.649> landmarks<00:00:49.089> and

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
sculpture of some of these landmarks and

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.090 
sculpture of some of these landmarks and
I've<00:00:50.479> tried<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:50.809> simplify<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.409> forms<00:00:51.949> I<00:00:52.039> know

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
I've tried to simplify the forms I know

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.119 
I've tried to simplify the forms I know
it's<00:00:52.309> not<00:00:52.460> incredibly<00:00:53.649> representational<00:00:54.649> but

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
it's not incredibly representational but

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.549 
it's not incredibly representational but
it's<00:00:55.309> more<00:00:55.489> like<00:00:55.729> a<00:00:55.760> structural<00:00:56.449> diagram<00:00:56.960> as<00:00:57.199> I

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
it's more like a structural diagram as I

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.529 
it's more like a structural diagram as I
said<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.069> I<00:00:58.519> did<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:58.819> for<00:00:58.879> the<00:00:59.120> purpose<00:00:59.449> of

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
said and I did this for the purpose of

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.329 
said and I did this for the purpose of
articulating<00:01:00.229> several<00:01:00.559> of<00:01:00.620> these<00:01:00.710> landmarks

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
articulating several of these landmarks

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.799 
articulating several of these landmarks
because<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.850> believe<00:01:02.210> that<00:01:02.359> when<00:01:02.479> you<00:01:02.510> name<00:01:02.780> a

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
because I believe that when you name a

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.380 
because I believe that when you name a
thing<00:01:03.170> you<00:01:03.620> begin<00:01:03.859> to<00:01:03.949> think<00:01:04.010> about<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:04.850> I

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
thing you begin to think about it and I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.210 
thing you begin to think about it and I
observed<00:01:05.780> over<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.080> last<00:01:06.140> decade<00:01:07.070> or<00:01:07.100> so

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
observed over the last decade or so

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.780 
observed over the last decade or so
teaching<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:08.650> quite<00:01:09.650> a<00:01:09.680> bit<00:01:09.800> of<00:01:10.160> learning<00:01:10.670> to

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
teaching that quite a bit of learning to

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.400 
teaching that quite a bit of learning to
do<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.120> portrait<00:01:11.510> effectively<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:12.140> is

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
do the portrait effectively is is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:20.230 
do the portrait effectively is is
identifying<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.250> parts<00:01:13.550> therein

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.700 

as<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.420> get<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> drawing<00:01:21.899> underway<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.649> we

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
as we get the drawing underway what we

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.499 
as we get the drawing underway what we
want<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.039> is<00:01:23.280> begin<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.000> slightly<00:01:24.240> an

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
want to do is begin and slightly an

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.200 
want to do is begin and slightly an
unusual<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.829> is<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.250> walk<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
unusual way and that is to walk up and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.149 
unusual way and that is to walk up and
measure<00:01:27.390> our<00:01:27.659> model<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.799> we're<00:01:28.979> going<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
measure our model which we're going to

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.240 
measure our model which we're going to
do<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.539> this<00:01:31.140> following<00:01:31.770> way<00:01:31.979> we're

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
do in a in this following way we're

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
do in a in this following way we're
going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.429> walk<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.969> take<00:01:33.929> a<00:01:33.990> measurement

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
going to walk up and take a measurement

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.789 
going to walk up and take a measurement
of<00:01:34.619> her<00:01:35.189> tear<00:01:35.490> duct<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:37.189> her<00:01:38.189> chin<00:01:39.409> which<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.649> I

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
of her tear duct to her chin which as I

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.200 
of her tear duct to her chin which as I
mentioned<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.220> moment<00:01:41.340> ago<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.819> just<00:01:41.939> about

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
mentioned a moment ago is just about

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.620 
mentioned a moment ago is just about
halfway<00:01:42.539> on<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> human<00:01:43.409> head<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:45.270> can<00:01:45.420> see

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
halfway on the human head you can see

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.039 
halfway on the human head you can see
just<00:01:46.560> about<00:01:46.829> half<00:01:47.069> way<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.630> once<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
just about half way and once we get that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.109 
just about half way and once we get that
measurement<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> tear<00:01:50.220> duct<00:01:50.459> to<00:01:50.670> her<00:01:50.789> chin

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
measurement of the tear duct to her chin

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.240 
measurement of the tear duct to her chin
we're<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> walk<00:01:52.409> back<00:01:52.649> over<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
we're going to walk back over to the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.760 
we're going to walk back over to the
drawing<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.869> indicate<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.110> not<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.679> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
drawing and indicate that not in the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.149 
drawing and indicate that not in the
centre<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.640> over<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.209> side

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
centre but over on the side

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.800 
centre but over on the side
I'll<00:01:59.159> go<00:01:59.520> maybe<00:01:59.909> here<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.830> indicate<00:02:01.830> that

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
I'll go maybe here and indicate that

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.570 
I'll go maybe here and indicate that
distance<00:02:03.810> then<00:02:04.560> I<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:04.950> double<00:02:05.399> that

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
distance then I will double that

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.620 
distance then I will double that
distance<00:02:06.229> here<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:08.880> I<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.149> is

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
distance here and so what I have now is

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.350 
distance here and so what I have now is

conscious<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> fact<00:02:18.810> that<00:02:19.019> when<00:02:19.530> you

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
conscious of is the fact that when you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.590 
conscious of is the fact that when you
get<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.890> head<00:02:20.040> too<00:02:20.250> big<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.329> make<00:02:21.359> the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
get the head too big you can make the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.530 
get the head too big you can make the
head<00:02:21.720> look<00:02:21.900> monstrous<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:24.180> about<00:02:24.269> this

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
head look monstrous so think about this

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420 
head look monstrous so think about this
when<00:02:24.750> you're<00:02:24.870> setting<00:02:25.170> up<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> drawing<00:02:25.620> don't

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
when you're setting up the drawing don't

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
when you're setting up the drawing don't
feel<00:02:26.670> limited<00:02:26.970> by<00:02:27.359> what's<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.590> with

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
feel limited by what's going on with

regard<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.069> your<00:02:29.220> measurement<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.060> be

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
regard to your measurement but just be

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.479 
regard to your measurement but just be
aware<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.510> overall<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.799> head<00:02:31.980> scale<00:02:32.310> is

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
aware that overall the head scale is

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.340 
aware that overall the head scale is
going<00:02:32.609> to<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.819> about<00:02:33.030> this<00:02:33.269> big<00:02:33.329> will<00:02:34.049> begin<00:02:34.260> to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
going to be about this big will begin to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.979 
going to be about this big will begin to
draw<00:02:34.560> now<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.069> as<00:02:35.459> we<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.819> I'm<00:02:36.420> going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> begin

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
draw now and as we do I'm going to begin

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.160 
draw now and as we do I'm going to begin
by<00:02:37.410> pushing<00:02:38.060> Marissa's<00:02:39.060> head<00:02:39.299> up<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.959> little

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
by pushing Marissa's head up a little

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.920 
by pushing Marissa's head up a little
bit<00:02:40.380> higher<00:02:40.700> into<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.940> paper<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.750> think

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
bit higher into the paper and I think

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.990 
bit higher into the paper and I think
this<00:02:43.049> is<00:02:43.200> important<00:02:43.650> because<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.190> believe<00:02:44.970> that

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
this is important because I believe that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970 
this is important because I believe that
studying<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.900> structure<00:02:46.380> or<00:02:46.829> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
studying the structure or the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.920 
studying the structure or the
relationship<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> head<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.480> neck<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
relationship of the head to the neck and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.410 
relationship of the head to the neck and
the<00:02:49.200> neck<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.190> upper<00:02:50.220> body<00:02:50.549> particularly

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the neck and the upper body particularly

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.030 
the neck and the upper body particularly
the<00:02:51.630> clavicle<00:02:52.109> bones<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.560> one<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.829> most

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the clavicle bones is one of the most

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.979 
the clavicle bones is one of the most
misunderstood<00:02:53.700> areas<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.299> figure<00:02:54.569> so<00:02:54.780> I

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
misunderstood areas of the figure so I

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.830 
misunderstood areas of the figure so I
would<00:02:55.410> much<00:02:55.620> rather<00:02:55.700> frame<00:02:56.700> her<00:02:57.030> portrait<00:02:57.660> by

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
would much rather frame her portrait by

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
would much rather frame her portrait by
pushing<00:02:58.139> her<00:02:58.380> head<00:02:58.560> up<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.829> bit<00:02:59.010> higher<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.000> I'm

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
pushing her head up a bit higher so I'm

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.910 
pushing her head up a bit higher so I'm
going<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.299> do<00:03:00.389> this<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.870> then<00:03:01.500> I'm<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
going to do this and then I'm going to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.550 
going to do this and then I'm going to
indicate<00:03:02.160> a<00:03:02.609> line<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.299> action<00:03:03.420> between<00:03:03.780> her

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
indicate a line of action between her

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.550 
indicate a line of action between her
head<00:03:04.799> and<00:03:04.980> her<00:03:05.160> neck<00:03:08.510> and<00:03:09.510> using<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.139> shoulder

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
head and her neck and using the shoulder

head and her neck and using the shoulder

I'm going to try to set up a series of

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
very long lines that begin to get at

as I go first thing I'm going to do is

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.640 
as I go first thing I'm going to do is
to<00:04:07.950> articulate<00:04:08.400> my<00:04:08.580> darkest<00:04:09.240> dark<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:10.380> give<00:04:10.530> me

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
to articulate my darkest dark to give me

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.370 
to articulate my darkest dark to give me
range<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:12.360> second<00:04:12.660> thing<00:04:12.780> I'm<00:04:12.870> going<00:04:13.050> to<00:04:13.140> do

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
range the second thing I'm going to do

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.940 
range the second thing I'm going to do
is<00:04:13.560> articulate<00:04:14.100> my<00:04:14.250> lightest<00:04:14.760> dark<00:04:15.950> to

thing<00:04:19.650> I'm<00:04:19.799> going<00:04:19.950> to<00:04:20.040> do<00:04:20.220> is<00:04:20.459> then<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.880> look<00:04:21.030> at

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
thing I'm going to do is then to look at

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.390 
thing I'm going to do is then to look at
this<00:04:21.420> area<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.930> light<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.590> lay<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.100> tone<00:04:23.370> a

thing<00:04:27.000> is<00:04:27.240> I'm<00:04:27.450> going<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.660> go<00:04:27.750> in<00:04:27.930> and<00:04:28.080> indicate

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
thing is I'm going to go in and indicate

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.010 
thing is I'm going to go in and indicate
a<00:04:28.440> highlight<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.160> then<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> last<00:04:30.419> thing<00:04:30.750> is

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
a highlight and then the last thing is

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.950 
a highlight and then the last thing is
I'll<00:04:31.200> indicate<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.890> darkest<00:04:32.400> light<00:04:32.960> thereby

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
I'll indicate the darkest light thereby

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.470 
I'll indicate the darkest light thereby
solidifying<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:35.010> sort<00:04:35.820> of<00:04:35.910> approach<00:04:36.450> to

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
restricting myself to five values I'm

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.700 
restricting myself to five values I'm
thinking<00:04:47.850> a<00:04:48.000> little<00:04:48.419> bit<00:04:48.570> more<00:04:48.930> about<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
thinking a little bit more about the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.190 
thinking a little bit more about the

see that near Marissa's eye socket the

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.510 
see that near Marissa's eye socket the

sides and what we want to do with that

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.850 
sides and what we want to do with that
is<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.370> articulate<00:05:56.880> a<00:05:57.210> certain<00:05:57.870> receding<00:05:58.530> form
