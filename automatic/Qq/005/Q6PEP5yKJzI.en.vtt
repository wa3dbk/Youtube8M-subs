00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.340
 good today let's do the challenges are 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.530
 sudden 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.389
 pumpkin when choosing a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.210
 Pumpkin told her that she 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.220
 I asked how it has to be tough 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.590
 high hardness the trunk that is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.359
 part have to be long and the color 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.160
 it has to be even all this because 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 then when the court is you're going to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.260
 find a good pumpkin 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 this guarantees that it is sweet exactly 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.100
 you know why because if you do not miss 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.250
 ripening so look that orange 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.020
 what is inside we choose well the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.329
 pumpkin or squash anco as you go 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.700
 also see out there is and a little salt 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.170
 of pepper olive oil aplin al 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.629
 stupid much liked by a director is 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.410
 good to see how easy it is to see what 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 easy to see this is going baked 45 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.840
 minutes you listened well 40 and very loud 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 soccer as high as it can be that 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.400
 happens also if you have less typical the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 you can cut in half and in 4 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.690
 a little say how I do not have 45 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.160
 minutes to bake the head well so 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.590
 visit and then I'm back 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.200
 there are rooms but what is sewn 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 the pumpkin does not end or does not end here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.650
 the story is because in less time 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.860
 exact 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.180
 it will be 20 minutes you can also do it 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.280
 in the microwave what you can not do 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.800
 is to serve the pumpkin knows why 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.000
 because we fill with water what is not 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.510
 we want is water 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.920
 just then here does not end the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.619
 pumpkin game what you have to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.050
 to make with this puree is to take it to the oven 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.900
 you listened well to the oven back so 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.000
 that value not first once two 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.190
 Sometimes once it is pureed it returns 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.960
 baked so that to dry well the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.000
 mashed guys and that after our 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.550
 Argentine is well armed and we are not 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.990
 undo and explode in the water 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:00.869
 as you do you do not know that not the other way around 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.820
 it concentrates look without you those same 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.410
 you concentrate, you see that it is darker than 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.759
 because this puree is baked in the oven 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.759
 about 15-20 minutes 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.250
 she 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.140
 the truth that I would not put him because the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.000
 basket is already more the pumpkin already has 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.860
 pretty sugar and pretty sweet like 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.370
 for if it's perfect we put salt 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.940
 pepper , nutmeg and grated cheese 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.940
 taste 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.070
 we do then have several options or 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.260
 to fill the Argentines with a 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.130
 spoon or if you do not have a sleeve 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.130
 these disposable 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.990
 are sold now we buy a bag with 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.640
 milk with a milk sachet with a 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.620
 spoon can also be me this what 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.480
 I do for a matter of prolixity to 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 show you let's say that 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.770
 it's a lot to eat because in the restaurant 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:16.510
 it's good because actually first that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.220
 more the big business of the restaurant is 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.320
 the truth 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.210
 the pizza does not talk if what happens is that 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.530
 you need people to do it then 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.180
 there is no machine that is going to be a 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.340
 sorrentino like the one we're going to do 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.600
 we therefore need a person 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.330
 that makes pasta all day has to 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.470
 pay their salaries social charges 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.980
 et cetera etcetera etcetera is the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.350
 application meanwhile the ball 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.540
 outside no guys is the truth while 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.950
 so much I'm going to put cooking moments 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.740
 Now I'll explain how we're going to put it together 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.860
 but I need this to go cooking 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.230
 to be able to show from a glass and go 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.910
 go let's leave to you who follows 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.610
 stalking and I'm going to go to the mass to 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.800
 this side if they want to buy 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.970
 here we have three eggs and besides 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.970
 break the eggs with me here 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.950
 salt eggs 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.950
 we go well or not so you know the hand 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.420
 very well 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.540
 you saw that colorful eggs that we have 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.150
 here 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.540
 are games are from a hen that does not 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.540
 wants 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.960
 we stir, we stir, we stir 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.020
 and after you love hamas aziz and 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.610
 anarchic do not water the dough a 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.020
 egg every 100 grams of flour what 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.520
 it means that for a kilogram of 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.820
 flour are 10 eggs 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.690
 there is the texture that has you look 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.240
 Silky soft smooth does not need anything of 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.220
 water do not do days once we arrived 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.220
 at this point I step 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.940
 and if you do not want to put jala hands and 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.780
 look 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.340
 pasta machine if I do not assure you that 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.380
 with this recipe, you can stretch the 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.150
 compa lot that the mass without any 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.850
 problem is going to stretch and I have it here 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.340
 advanced at number 5 and if you have this 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.440
 machine should reach number 7 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.410
 the other secret that almost no cook 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.330
 he tells you that he is going to finish and the 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.890
 another cook that the other center that 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.680
 almost no account cook that you 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.310
 to stretch you have to use the pse mill 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.310
 the bait 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.770
 Of course, because the pse grind what 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.660
 gives you is that possibility to stretch without 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.210
 that the flour is adhered but the flour 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.520
 they always adhere and you're doing 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.620
 mess with that and you will not look good the 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.310
 mass now I 'm going to ask for the space 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.020
 to show people how big there is going 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.920
 let's go stretching let's go stretching 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.160
 stretching the little angels so that the 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.160
 will 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.650
 alone and nobody to assange news is 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.650
 nominated in three categories to 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.380
 2012 gardel awards for the life album the 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.540
 best album of the year best song of the 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.940
 red flag year and best artist 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.710
 new folklore to fish it 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.650
 are waiting today for vinyl coffee Friday 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.420
 they will be accompanied by diego rolón on guitars 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.140
 and the typical whole in percussion so 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.370
 to fill it is very good 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.760
 even if it is a torrent for them to see 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:28.280
 how sometimes I put one here well into 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.409
 up I put another one here up 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.539
 I do this I close like this 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:34.099
 I close so remember that the dough has 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.659
 that be finite if not then people say 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:37.399
 that the pasta is fat 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.830
 and it's not rich and what we do at this point 

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:42.139
 closes it deep and sharp hands you know 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.439
 that a coffee cup serves perfect 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.969
 to do so much book this recipe if 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:52.369
 is in my book and they are not renting or but 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:54.080
 they are of verín yes of course yes here 

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:56.599
 we only have cream that you 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.669
 let's put some grated cheese 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:07:00.649
 and on this cream we are going to put these 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.419
 horrendous that if you get to see is so 

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:04.809
 transparent the mass that you get to see 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.809
 the face 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.419
 Thank you
