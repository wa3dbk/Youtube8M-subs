00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.440
 so hello friends of my building that was 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.420
 a sailing ship which actually 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.220
 It was pretty hard to build with ships 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.130
 First, because of the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.819
 hull because the occurs quite the 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.470
 hoped shape and because of the sail the 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.060
 are quite time consuming and 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.489
 also have a special shape 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.720
 and if you liked it all 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.310
 You may like to thumb up 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 give and if you do not like it 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.550
 then there is a thumb down and am 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.160
 best you send the whole ship 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.780
 Just look it yourself and look below 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.090
