in my last video you would have seen my

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.570 
in my last video you would have seen my
600<00:00:09.269> sorry<00:00:09.990> my<00:00:10.260> 650<00:00:11.040> X<00:00:11.460> powered<00:00:12.650> 400<00:00:13.650> ax<00:00:13.889> which

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
600 sorry my 650 X powered 400 ax which

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.740 
600 sorry my 650 X powered 400 ax which
is<00:00:14.759> running<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> XR<00:00:15.509> 650<00:00:16.080> our<00:00:16.230> engine<00:00:16.590> now<00:00:17.750> if

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
is running the XR 650 our engine now if

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.349 
is running the XR 650 our engine now if
you've<00:00:19.020> watched<00:00:19.289> my<00:00:19.560> last<00:00:19.740> video<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.670> blew<00:00:21.150> up

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
you've watched my last video it blew up

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.960 
you've watched my last video it blew up
and<00:00:21.600> con<00:00:22.560> rod<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:23.160> hanging<00:00:23.640> out<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and con rod is hanging out of the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939 
and con rod is hanging out of the
cylinder<00:00:24.230> and<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> look<00:00:25.800> at<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
cylinder and if you have a look at the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.330 
cylinder and if you have a look at the
hole<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.400> where<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.880> came<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:28.070> it's<00:00:29.070> made<00:00:29.310> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
hole here where it came out it's made a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.830 
hole here where it came out it's made a
rather<00:00:29.550> large<00:00:29.849> mess<00:00:30.119> yeah

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
rather large mess yeah

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.510 
rather large mess yeah
I've<00:00:30.960> taken<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> liberty<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.800> disassembling

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
I've taken the liberty of disassembling

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970 
I've taken the liberty of disassembling
this<00:00:33.050> okay<00:00:34.050> now<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.410> was<00:00:34.500> nothing<00:00:34.829> wrong

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this okay now there was nothing wrong

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.880 
this okay now there was nothing wrong
with<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> cam<00:00:36.230> Pistons<00:00:37.230> still<00:00:37.440> relatively

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
with the cam Pistons still relatively

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.520 
with the cam Pistons still relatively
close<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> top<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> cylinder<00:00:39.530> there's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
close to the top of the cylinder there's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.770 
close to the top of the cylinder there's
nothing<00:00:40.829> wrong<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> head<00:00:44.120> but<00:00:45.120> if<00:00:45.660> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
nothing wrong with the head but if you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.950 
nothing wrong with the head but if you
have<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> look<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.340> cylinder<00:00:47.850> where<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
have a look here the cylinder where the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.889 
have a look here the cylinder where the
con<00:00:49.140> rod<00:00:49.170> stopped<00:00:49.649> was<00:00:50.129> about<00:00:50.399> there<00:00:50.899> wedged

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
con rod stopped was about there wedged

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.540 
con rod stopped was about there wedged
in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> cylinder<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.920> has<00:00:53.129> split<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
in the cylinder it has split the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.290 
in the cylinder it has split the
cylinder<00:00:53.940> from<00:00:54.210> top<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.750> bottom

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
cylinder from top to bottom

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.910 
cylinder from top to bottom
and<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> piston<00:00:58.530> doesn't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
and as you can see the piston doesn't

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.470 
and as you can see the piston doesn't
usually<00:00:59.070> come<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> cylinder<00:01:00.239> like

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
usually come out with the cylinder like

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.889 
usually come out with the cylinder like
that

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.429 

not<00:01:03.899> too<00:01:04.140> bad<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> little<00:01:04.710> bit<00:01:04.830> carving<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:06.439> okay

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
not too bad a little bit carving up okay

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.140 
not too bad a little bit carving up okay
now<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.799> turn<00:01:07.950> him<00:01:08.100> over<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.119> see

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
now if you turn him over we can see

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060 
now if you turn him over we can see
there's<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.570> rather<00:01:09.750> large<00:01:09.900> chunk<00:01:10.560> missing<00:01:10.799> her

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
there's a rather large chunk missing her

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.100 
there's a rather large chunk missing her
head<00:01:11.189> at<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> bottom<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.729> cylinder<00:01:12.119> which

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
head at the bottom of the cylinder which

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
head at the bottom of the cylinder which
I'm<00:01:13.290> assuming<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> bottom<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
I'm assuming is in the bottom of the

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
I'm assuming is in the bottom of the
crankcase<00:01:15.259> along<00:01:16.259> with<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.500> those<00:01:16.650> other

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
crankcase along with all those other

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.410 
crankcase along with all those other
nice<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.400> green<00:01:17.610> bits<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:20.210> the<00:01:21.210> breath

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
nice little green bits and the breath

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.440 
nice little green bits and the breath
and<00:01:21.600> corrode

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.160 

okay<00:01:26.560> now<00:01:27.850> looking<00:01:28.850> at<00:01:28.940> this<00:01:29.090> I'll<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.960> pop

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
okay now looking at this I'll just pop

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:40.080 
okay now looking at this I'll just pop
the<00:01:30.320> cylinder<00:01:30.650> piston<00:01:30.860> out<00:01:31.190> somewhat

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.810 

yeah<00:01:40.659> there's<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.680> few<00:01:41.860> little<00:01:42.040> scuff<00:01:42.399> marks<00:01:42.759> on

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
yeah there's a few little scuff marks on

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.420 
yeah there's a few little scuff marks on
the<00:01:43.000> piston<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.750> has<00:01:44.049> been<00:01:44.290> clobbered<00:01:45.899> whoo<00:01:46.930> I

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the piston it has been clobbered whoo I

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.420 
the piston it has been clobbered whoo I
think<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:49.380> might<00:01:50.380> actually<00:01:50.649> be<00:01:50.890> beyond

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
think that might actually be beyond

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.039 
think that might actually be beyond
repair<00:01:51.820> I'm<00:01:52.060> not<00:01:52.270> sure<00:01:52.539> yet

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
repair I'm not sure yet

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.170 
repair I'm not sure yet
let's<00:01:53.950> see<00:01:54.100> where<00:01:54.250> it's<00:01:54.369> been<00:01:54.579> hit<00:01:54.789> on<00:01:55.030> the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
let's see where it's been hit on the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.340 
let's see where it's been hit on the
inside<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.979> couple<00:01:56.979> of<00:01:57.100> times<00:02:00.869> no<00:02:01.869> idea<00:02:02.170> what

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
inside a couple of times no idea what

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.219 
inside a couple of times no idea what
caused<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:03.070> corner<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.490> break<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:04.079> thought<00:02:05.079> it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
caused the corner to break I thought it

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.639 
caused the corner to break I thought it
was<00:02:05.350> locked<00:02:05.530> up<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.039> shaft<00:02:07.080> but<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.349> still

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
was locked up on the shaft but it still

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.160 
was locked up on the shaft but it still
moves<00:02:08.830> freely<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:10.209> should<00:02:10.420> not<00:02:10.750> have

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
moves freely that should not have

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.440 
moves freely that should not have
happened<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.450> one<00:02:13.630> is<00:02:15.180> something<00:02:16.180> that

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
happened so that one is something that

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.910 
happened so that one is something that
I've<00:02:16.569> never<00:02:16.780> seen<00:02:17.049> happen<00:02:17.350> before<00:02:17.650> usually

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
I've never seen happen before usually

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.550 
I've never seen happen before usually
when<00:02:18.280> they<00:02:18.400> bust<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> con<00:02:18.850> rod<00:02:19.030> up<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.209> top<00:02:19.560> it's

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
when they bust a con rod up the top it's

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.640 
when they bust a con rod up the top it's
because<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.720> con<00:02:22.720> rod<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.019> gouge<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.380> penis

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
because the con rod and gouge and penis

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.009 
because the con rod and gouge and penis
seize<00:02:23.890> together<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.549> then<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.630> starts

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
seize together and then it starts

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.440 
seize together and then it starts
bending<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.739> gadget<00:02:27.099> with<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> con<00:02:27.760> rod<00:02:27.970> which

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
bending the gadget with a con rod which

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:40.740 
bending the gadget with a con rod which
ultimately<00:02:29.410> ripped<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.160> apart<00:02:35.430> -<00:02:36.430> works<00:02:39.750> for

ultimately ripped it apart - works for
the<00:02:40.930> cylinder<00:02:41.380> as<00:02:42.340> we<00:02:42.549> can<00:02:42.730> see<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:44.739> is

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
the cylinder as we can see that is

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.370 
the cylinder as we can see that is
definitely<00:02:46.299> beyond<00:02:46.720> repair

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
definitely beyond repair

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.500 

okay<00:03:13.060> now<00:03:13.239> what<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.660> got<00:03:13.840> Danny<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.440> here

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.680 

rather<00:03:22.510> large<00:03:22.810> chance<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:24.310> cylinder<00:03:24.760> in

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
rather large chance of the cylinder in

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.970 
rather large chance of the cylinder in
the<00:03:25.840> bottom<00:03:26.110> in<00:03:26.260> there<00:03:28.170> if<00:03:29.170> you<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.470> see<00:03:29.500> Danny

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
the bottom in there if you can see Danny

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.930 
the bottom in there if you can see Danny
at<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.340> bottom<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.760> con<00:03:30.970> would<00:03:32.940> probably

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
at the bottom of the con would probably

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.680 
at the bottom of the con would probably
care<00:03:36.510> anyway

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
care anyway

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.410 
care anyway
the<00:03:38.560> rest<00:03:38.769> of<00:03:38.920> that<00:03:39.010> motor<00:03:39.459> I'm<00:03:39.910> hoping<00:03:40.209> the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
the rest of that motor I'm hoping the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.940 
the rest of that motor I'm hoping the
gearbox<00:03:40.780> is<00:03:40.959> okay<00:03:41.379> but<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.310> rest<00:03:42.489> of<00:03:42.580> its

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
gearbox is okay but the rest of its

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.720 
gearbox is okay but the rest of its
rooted<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:46.380> we<00:03:47.380> might<00:03:47.590> have<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.400> see<00:03:48.579> what

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
rooted so we might have to see what

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.410 
rooted so we might have to see what
happens<00:03:48.819> not<00:03:49.750> get<00:03:49.959> a<00:03:49.989> new<00:03:50.170> motor
