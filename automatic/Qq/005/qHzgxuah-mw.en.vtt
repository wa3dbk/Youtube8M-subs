00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
being vegetarian because I have been

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.870 
being vegetarian because I have been

those<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.050> always<00:00:40.379> options<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.399> example<00:00:41.700> i

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
those are always options for example i

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
those are always options for example i
lived<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.059> bangkok<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> year<00:00:43.230> last<00:00:43.469> year

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
lived in bangkok for a year last year

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.400 
lived in bangkok for a year last year
and<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.329> hard<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> avoid<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and it was very hard to avoid all the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
and it was very hard to avoid all the
sea<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.340> i<00:00:47.370> wanted<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.120> just

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
sea not because i wanted it but just

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
sea not because i wanted it but just
because<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.809> everywhere<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:50.039> was

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
because it was everywhere there was

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.069 
because it was everywhere there was
little<00:00:50.430> cubes<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.910> fruit<00:00:51.180> shrimp<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> almost

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
little cubes of fruit shrimp in almost

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.799 
little cubes of fruit shrimp in almost
everything<00:00:52.550> but<00:00:53.550> i<00:00:53.820> found<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.510> lot<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
everything but i found that a lot of the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
everything but i found that a lot of the
time<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.170> can<00:00:55.199> substitute<00:00:55.530> room<00:00:56.100> for<00:00:56.340> eggs<00:00:56.610> or

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
time you can substitute room for eggs or

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.790 
time you can substitute room for eggs or
tofu<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.780> makes<00:00:57.960> hardly<00:00:58.289> difference<00:00:58.680> in

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
tofu and it makes hardly difference in

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.770 
tofu and it makes hardly difference in
taste<00:00:58.980> and<00:01:00.410> not<00:01:01.410> only<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:01.949> um<00:01:02.570> good<00:01:03.570> for

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
taste and not only is it um good for

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.240 
taste and not only is it um good for
your<00:01:03.960> body<00:01:04.170> but<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.739> great<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
your body but it's also great for the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.090 
your body but it's also great for the
planet<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.790> vegetarian<00:01:05.990> because<00:01:07.100> um

have to clean them and all the water and
pesticides<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.740> into<00:01:23.000> keeping<00:01:24.000> these

animals alive until you slaughter them
for<00:01:26.220> me<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.930> awful<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> planet<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:29.340> my

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
for me is awful for the planet in my

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.929 
for me is awful for the planet in my
reasoning<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.900> people<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.740> wanted<00:01:32.070> if<00:01:32.280> we

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
reasoning is if people that wanted if we

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.550 
reasoning is if people that wanted if we
have<00:01:33.090> come<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.360> far<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> we're<00:01:33.960> clothing

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
have come so far that we're clothing

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.609 
have come so far that we're clothing
tomatoes<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.579> sheep<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.390> something<00:01:36.810> if

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
tomatoes and a sheep or something if

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.609 
tomatoes and a sheep or something if
we're<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.780> culturally<00:01:39.780> advanced<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
we're so I culturally advanced as a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.520 
we're so I culturally advanced as a
human<00:01:41.520> race<00:01:41.729> why<00:01:42.450> are<00:01:42.509> we<00:01:42.689> still<00:01:42.990> eating<00:01:43.229> meat

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
human race why are we still eating meat

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.289 
human race why are we still eating meat
that's<00:01:44.280> what<00:01:44.490> they<00:01:44.549> came<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.939> did<00:01:45.090> when<00:01:45.210> they

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
that's what they came in did when they

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.270

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
eating and I would think that it and I

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.189 
eating and I would think that it and I
would<00:03:09.489> envision<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.329> and<00:03:10.510> suddenly<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.930> would

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:11.199 
would envision it and suddenly I would

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.770 
would envision it and suddenly I would
be<00:03:11.349> so<00:03:11.620> turned<00:03:11.949> off<00:03:12.250> by<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:13.120> things<00:03:13.419> that<00:03:13.599> used

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
be so turned off by the things that used

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.899 
be so turned off by the things that used
to<00:03:13.900> advertise<00:03:14.230> me<00:03:14.799> so<00:03:14.979> much<00:03:15.159> that<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.639> just

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
to advertise me so much that I just

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.449 
to advertise me so much that I just
wouldn't<00:03:16.209> want<00:03:16.359> it<00:03:16.569> anymore<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.199> now<00:03:17.769> I'm

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
wouldn't want it anymore and now I'm

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.460 
wouldn't want it anymore and now I'm
nauseated<00:03:18.849> by<00:03:19.449> the<00:03:19.509> smell<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:19.900> meat<00:03:20.139> and<00:03:20.319> so

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
nauseated by the smell of meat and so

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.640 
nauseated by the smell of meat and so
it's<00:03:20.650> so<00:03:20.799> much<00:03:20.949> easier<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.459> be<00:03:21.639> vegetarian<00:03:22.650> but

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
it's so much easier to be vegetarian but

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.699 
it's so much easier to be vegetarian but

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.400 
hopefully i'll make a video on tips
about<00:04:47.650> running<00:04:47.979> later<00:04:48.190> but<00:04:49.120> you<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.199> don't

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
about running later but you just don't

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.320 
about running later but you just don't
need<00:04:50.800> what's<00:04:51.070> in<00:04:51.190> me<00:04:51.400> if<00:04:51.610> you<00:04:51.729> replace<00:04:52.300> the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
need what's in me if you replace the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.540 
need what's in me if you replace the
protein<00:04:53.199> replacement<00:04:54.190> does<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.400> most

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
protein replacement does the most

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.029 
protein replacement does the most
important<00:04:55.120> thing<00:04:55.300> is<00:04:56.199> also<00:04:56.500> good<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.860> be

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
important thing is also good to be

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.159 
important thing is also good to be
educated<00:04:57.639> about<00:04:57.699> it<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.210> understand<00:04:58.810> how<00:04:58.990> it

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
educated about it to understand how it

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.150 
educated about it to understand how it
works<00:04:59.460> because<00:05:00.460> if<00:05:00.880> you<00:05:01.090> just<00:05:01.860> get<00:05:02.860> chocolate

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
works because if you just get chocolate

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.730 
works because if you just get chocolate
cheese<00:05:03.850> every<00:05:04.180> time<00:05:04.360> you<00:05:04.510> avoid<00:05:04.840> going<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.620> the
