00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
mine courts used to look like I I still

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.360 
mine courts used to look like I I still
don't<00:03:58.150> know<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.350> first-ever<00:03:59.800> version

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.150 
don't know it is the first-ever version
or<00:04:00.520> not<00:04:00.720> I<00:04:01.720> think<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.560> might<00:04:02.770> be<00:04:02.980> actually

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
or not I think it might be actually

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.880 
or not I think it might be actually
because<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:04.030> saw<00:04:04.390> sing<00:04:04.630> gang<00:04:04.810> they<00:04:06.780> over

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
because I saw sing gang they over

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.610 
because I saw sing gang they over
minecraft<00:04:09.270> 9.30<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:11.170> they<00:04:11.440> were<00:04:11.500> like

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.530 
minecraft 9.30 and that they were like
skeletons<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.610> the<00:04:12.700> daylight<00:04:13.060> but<00:04:13.360> they<00:04:13.480> were

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
skeletons in the daylight but they were

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.900 
skeletons in the daylight but they were
burning<00:04:14.050> I<00:04:14.170> don't<00:04:14.380> think<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:15.670> they<00:04:15.760> still

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
burning I don't think and they still

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.310

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
bow and they also invented ste with rock

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.490 
bow and they also invented ste with rock
I<00:04:20.680> could<00:04:20.739> tell<00:04:20.980> about<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.250> steeped<00:04:21.580> hand<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:23.080> I

I could tell about a steeped hand so I

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.350 
I could tell about a steeped hand so I
so<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.340> actually<00:04:24.460> haven't<00:04:24.760> really<00:04:25.060> that<00:04:25.180> this
