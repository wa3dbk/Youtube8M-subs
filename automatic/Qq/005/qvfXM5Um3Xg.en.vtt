this<00:06:13.070> cuz<00:06:13.370> then<00:06:13.490> you<00:06:13.580> can<00:06:13.700> see<00:06:13.850> the<00:06:13.970> body<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.450> I

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
this cuz then you can see the body and I

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.260 
this cuz then you can see the body and I
don't<00:06:14.660> like<00:06:14.810> that<00:06:14.960> so<00:06:15.290> I<00:06:16.120> just<00:06:17.120> always<00:06:17.270> like<00:06:17.630> to

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
don't like that so I just always like to

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.290 
don't like that so I just always like to
put<00:06:20.270> the<00:06:20.420> hair<00:06:20.450> in<00:06:20.780> by<00:06:21.170> just<00:06:21.380> going<00:06:21.860> upwards

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
so it's kind of hidden but it keeps the

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:37.129
