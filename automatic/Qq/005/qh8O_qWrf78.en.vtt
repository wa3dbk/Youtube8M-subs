00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 represents rubrics not 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.840
 and so hello everyone I am Melanie 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.980
 from the channel my shack by the way what 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.079
 frames 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.600
 yes, I have a new editor 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 Editor's name will be here 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.690
 below in the description below this video and if 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.840
 you like my new editor and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.180
 effects in it then put like yes and this 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.030
 already the sixth edition of the heading hand made in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 which I will show how to do beads 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.970
 lps collars 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.820
 and so well, let's start probably with the beads for 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.430
 lps 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.979
 It turns out like this you manage boutiques 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.979
 took it not itself was in the set matter itself 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.049
 we can do something like this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.390
 use attack like beads like on 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:32.270
 this kitty or how beautiful thing so 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:35.270
 as a hoop on the head here, you can even so 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.270
 here 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:48.180
 and I will do beads for a period 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:51.900
 dogs well let's start and so that she 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.680
 break on need thread gum 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.810
 okay simple gum yes and in this 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.690
 most thread gum all the main secret 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.580
 bus well and we will need these sucked beads 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:12.090
 I have such a huge set of universities here 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.310
 it is very very much and they are all 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.680
 multi-colored well, you can make any 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:22.620
 what do you have there such you can and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.340
 doing so well, and to what we will do for 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.430
 beginnings 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.019
 well, we first need to cut off 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.300
 quite a big piece of flying away threads 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.300
 there will be enough such elastic bands 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.440
 the camera was going 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.480
 here's a piece of advice to cut off the stock 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.989
 because we cut the beads and then 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:00.030
 to make it easier to tie a knot 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.920
 you need to cut off the stock and now you need 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.900
 just take any universities that you have 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.269
 there is not probably this gum well 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.209
 here we are strung 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.540
 should it happen like this but i 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:20.329
 snow falls bandages spinning here 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.620
 so here we are tied up 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:27.620
 I advise you to look at the triple body 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:32.269
 it would seem then did not unleash a 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.269
 can now try on beta 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:47.469
 This is how it turned out very nicely. 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.469
 but you are all tartan 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:57.769
 Well, by the way I wanted to say, please 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:03.319
 not to write what about beads is trite 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:05.599
 because well, I just saw these myself 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.569
 Busiki video of one girl 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:11.450
 long ago, I did not know how to do it 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:16.280
 then I understood and just decided with you that 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.829
 share so don't think that shorter 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.239
 that's banal 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.810
 if something i just wanted to share 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:28.810
 the fact that I learned and so we now I tell you 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.889
 show you how to make collars for lps 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.669
 let's not distract you 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.710
 effects of my new editor and so 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.330
 for this you will need us 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.849
 need scissors understandable to us 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.419
 need tape 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:49.180
 That's so simple, but I'll show 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:59.199
 how to make such 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:59.199
 drawings are shorter than that of customers and 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:08.090
 on the hospital clip okay the clip is not for 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.590
 to clip us 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:15.889
 need a little bit for another 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.580
 and if you have a walk you can 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.229
 wire 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:25.370
 yes, I forgot to tell us 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:27.650
 thread with a needle itself ordinary that we 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:34.190
 let's do this first take a thread with 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:35.150
 needle and sew the two sides of the tape so 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:42.080
 that's the way 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:45.219
 such are in half here and so should 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.219
 turn out like this 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.620
 Now this type of tube and now need 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.040
 will melt 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.020
 clip or wire if wire then 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.230
 much easier it will be necessary just her 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.270
 stick inside and if you don't have 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:09.220
 the wire will have to unfold the clip 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:13.660
 unfold the clip well here we have 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:22.810
 it turns out that's stuck well straightened 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:26.229
 the cage now forgot steppe turned out 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:36.479
 such a thing like wire you know 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:36.479
 now you need to stick her up 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.860
 if you have a long trim I like 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.630
 already cut off shave you can sir deaf 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.850
 clips like a not strong clip 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.720
 so I got her just like that 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:57.940
 scissors then it fell apart so 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:02.979
 that here and now this thing is possible 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:08.289
 bend the size of any poet here 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:12.960
 it will turn out like that 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:19.380
 I was with you today 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:22.780
 the name of the editor's name is down there 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.289
 if you like, put likes to everyone 

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.340
 until 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.340
 I love you so much
