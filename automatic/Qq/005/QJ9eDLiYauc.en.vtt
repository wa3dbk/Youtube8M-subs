00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.660 
animation base tutorial today we're
going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.730> be<00:00:05.819> looking<00:00:05.940> at<00:00:07.010> how<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> mask<00:00:08.400> is

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and created this symbol and um so let's

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.359 
and created this symbol and um so let's
jump<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.150> get<00:00:24.240> started<00:00:25.250> you're<00:00:26.250> gonna

jump in and get started you're gonna
want<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.300> layer<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:28.170> your<00:00:28.199> symbol<00:00:28.800> on<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.130> or

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
the bottom part that we covered up is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.149 
the bottom part that we covered up is
shown<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.200> so<00:01:07.200> there's<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.710> pretty<00:01:07.950> cool

shown that so there's some pretty cool
ways<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> cannot<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.220> make

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
ways that you cannot you can make

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
ways that you cannot you can make
different<00:01:11.880> animations<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.689> I'll<00:01:13.290> show

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
different animations with this I'll show

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.060 
different animations with this I'll show

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
mask layer on the second frame we're

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.039 
mask layer on the second frame we're
going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> insert<00:01:25.170> another<00:01:25.439> keyframe<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
going to insert another keyframe and

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.390 
going to insert another keyframe and
color<00:01:28.049> some<00:01:28.290> more<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.439> keep

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
color some more and I'm going to keep

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.420 
color some more and I'm going to keep
doing<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.700> until<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.509> did<00:01:35.060> most<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:37.430> most

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
doing this until I did most of the most

doing this until I did most of the most
of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> rose-colored<00:01:41.600> over<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.340> you'll<00:01:44.340> see

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
of the rose-colored over and you'll see

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.700 
of the rose-colored over and you'll see
the<00:01:44.759> effect<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.530> going

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
the effect that it is and it's not going

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.649 
the effect that it is and it's not going
to<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> best<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.939> I'm<00:01:48.360> doing<00:01:48.600> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
to be the best because I'm doing this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.310 
to be the best because I'm doing this
quickly

quickly

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.389 
quickly
you<00:01:49.920> should<00:01:50.189> really<00:01:50.460> actually<00:01:51.920> do<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.070> slowly

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
you should really actually do it slowly

you should really actually do it slowly
and<00:01:54.020> you'll<00:01:55.020> did<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.530> pull<00:01:55.740> effect<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.369> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and you'll did I pull effect like a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.429 
and you'll did I pull effect like a
flower<00:01:57.390> growing<00:01:58.250> on<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> bottom<00:01:59.640> up<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.439> this

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
flower growing on a bottom up and this

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.560 
flower growing on a bottom up and this
is<00:02:01.590> also<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.399> create<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> some<00:02:03.390> cool

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
is also how you can create a some cool

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.880 
is also how you can create a some cool
effects<00:02:03.810> linked<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:05.360> vine<00:02:06.360> growing<00:02:06.890> or

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
effects linked a vine growing or

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.949 
effects linked a vine growing or
something<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.789> that

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
okay all right let's do this up a bit so

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:32.420 
okay all right let's do this up a bit so
I<00:02:20.189> don't<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.430> much<00:02:20.609> time<00:02:30.560> with<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.799> with

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
I don't have much time with the with

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.149 
I don't have much time with the with
masks<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.269> can<00:02:33.510> do<00:02:33.659> all<00:02:34.290> kinds<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.709> sorts<00:02:35.069> of

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
masks you can do all kinds of sorts of

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.569 
masks you can do all kinds of sorts of
things<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.819> it<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.599> used<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.430> for<00:02:38.430> some

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.379 
of my nest tutorials I'm going to show
you<00:02:43.799> guys<00:02:44.040> how<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.280> make<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.519> as<00:02:44.879> we're<00:02:45.180> moving

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
you guys how to make a as we're moving

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.729 
you guys how to make a as we're moving
tornado<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.109> what<00:02:49.319> we'll<00:02:49.590> be<00:02:49.709> using

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
tornado and that is what we'll be using

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.569 
tornado and that is what we'll be using
the<00:02:50.040> whole<00:02:50.189> time<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.699> mask<00:02:53.419> it's<00:02:54.419> good<00:02:54.659> to

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
the whole time this mask it's good to

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:12.589 
the whole time this mask it's good to

get onto it right now so anyways after

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.750 
get onto it right now so anyways after
we<00:03:13.290> get<00:03:13.469> this<00:03:13.590> all<00:03:13.799> done<00:03:14.069> we<00:03:14.280> should<00:03:14.519> have<00:03:14.730> a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
we get this all done we should have a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:25.249 
we get this all done we should have a
pretty<00:03:15.000> cool<00:03:15.239> effect<00:03:15.389> and<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:21.060> will<00:03:21.329> see<00:03:23.930> in<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:25.259 
pretty cool effect and you will see in a

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:31.099 
pretty cool effect and you will see in a
minute<00:03:25.409> once<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:29.509> by<00:03:30.509> the<00:03:30.599> way<00:03:30.720> I'm<00:03:30.810> not<00:03:30.870> using

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
minute once and by the way I'm not using

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.719 
minute once and by the way I'm not using
the<00:03:31.229> hotkeys<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.220> everyone<00:03:32.579> can<00:03:32.669> see

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
the hotkeys just so everyone can see

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.240 
the hotkeys just so everyone can see
what<00:03:32.970> I'm<00:03:33.030> doing<00:03:33.359> but<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.930> hockey<00:03:34.439> to<00:03:34.709> mate<00:03:34.919> or

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
what I'm doing but the hockey to mate or

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.300 
what I'm doing but the hockey to mate or
to<00:03:35.939> uh<00:03:35.970> insert<00:03:36.629> keyframe<00:03:37.139> is<00:03:37.459> f6<00:03:40.009> it<00:03:41.009> just

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
to uh insert keyframe is f6 it just

00:03:41.310 --> 00:04:03.860 
to uh insert keyframe is f6 it just
makes<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.669> little<00:03:42.180> bit<00:03:42.359> faster<00:03:42.540> but<00:03:43.340> sure

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.350 

and<00:04:04.870> it's<00:04:05.410> kind<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.890> neat<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:06.100> you<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:06.910> just

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
and it's kind of neat that you can just

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.059 
and it's kind of neat that you can just
paint<00:04:07.630> like<00:04:07.990> whatever<00:04:08.440> you<00:04:08.709> want<00:04:08.890> you'd

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
paint like whatever you want you'd

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.650 
paint like whatever you want you'd
rather<00:04:09.250> keep<00:04:09.490> inside<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:09.970> lines<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.390> stop

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
rather keep inside the lines and stop

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.800 
rather keep inside the lines and stop
because<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.830> masking<00:04:12.550> it<00:04:13.150> will<00:04:13.330> only<00:04:13.510> show<00:04:13.660> up

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
because the masking it will only show up

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.770 
because the masking it will only show up
something<00:04:14.709> that's<00:04:14.830> already<00:04:15.069> on<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.490> stage<00:04:15.780> so

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
something that's already on the stage so

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.509 
something that's already on the stage so
if<00:04:17.079> you<00:04:17.200> had<00:04:17.350> nothing<00:04:17.530> on<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.890> stage<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.400> you

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
if you had nothing on the stage and you

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.199 
if you had nothing on the stage and you
did<00:04:18.760> this

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
did this

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.330 
did this
nothing<00:04:19.870> just<00:04:20.049> want<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.260> show<00:04:20.380> up<00:04:20.560> obviously<00:04:20.769> I

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
nothing just want to show up obviously I

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:34.550 
nothing just want to show up obviously I
don't<00:04:22.330> remember<00:04:22.780> where<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.050> was

nice big blob of nothing I'm gonna put
down<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.640> keyframe<00:04:46.210> ready<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.660> bit<00:04:46.870> we'll

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
down the keyframe ready to a bit we'll

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.360 
down the keyframe ready to a bit we'll
say<00:04:47.620> 13<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.770> go<00:04:50.860> ahead<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.220> test
