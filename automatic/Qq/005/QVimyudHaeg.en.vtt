reckon<00:05:16.379> just<00:05:16.560> for<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.740> safety<00:05:17.159> of<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.580> fact

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
reckon just for the safety of the fact

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:20.390 
reckon just for the safety of the fact
that<00:05:17.879> if<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:19.349> do<00:05:19.529> get<00:05:19.740> stuck<00:05:20.039> in<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.279> really
