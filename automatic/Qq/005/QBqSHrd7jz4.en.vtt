the<00:01:18.910> first<00:01:19.120> time<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.300> picked<00:01:19.480> up<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.720> DK<00:01:20.020> 15

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
the first time I picked up the DK 15

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.140 
the first time I picked up the DK 15
sticks<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:20.830> showered<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:21.670> first<00:01:21.910> thing<00:01:22.030> that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
sticks and showered the first thing that

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.940 
sticks and showered the first thing that
I<00:01:22.180> noticed<00:01:22.480> with<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.690> weights<00:01:22.900> it's<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.740> the

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
I noticed with the weights it's the the

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.020 
I noticed with the weights it's the the
immediate<00:01:24.430> thing<00:01:24.580> that<00:01:24.700> grabs<00:01:24.880> your

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
immediate thing that grabs your

immediate thing that grabs your
attention<00:01:25.090> how<00:01:25.540> light<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:25.960> stick<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.380> it's

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
attention how light this stick is it's

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.260 
attention how light this stick is it's
much<00:01:27.250> much<00:01:27.460> lighter<00:01:27.610> than<00:01:27.790> anything<00:01:28.060> I've

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
much much lighter than anything I've

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.550 
much much lighter than anything I've
ever<00:01:28.420> used<00:01:28.720> or<00:01:28.960> felt<00:01:29.230> before

ever used or felt before
the<00:01:30.370> way<00:01:30.490> sure<00:01:30.730> would<00:01:30.850> have<00:01:30.910> been<00:01:31.060> able<00:01:31.150> to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
the way sure would have been able to

the way sure would have been able to
accomplish<00:01:31.540> this<00:01:31.870> is<00:01:32.020> by<00:01:32.170> using<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.650> unique

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
accomplish this is by using a unique

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.010 
accomplish this is by using a unique
construction<00:01:33.880> process<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.510> build<00:01:34.720> this<00:01:34.840> new

now<00:01:36.220> what<00:01:36.400> this<00:01:36.520> involves<00:01:36.850> take<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.000> look<00:01:37.210> at

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
now what this involves take a look at

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.120 
now what this involves take a look at
the<00:01:37.330> shaft<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.810> begin<00:01:38.080> is<00:01:38.290> with<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.890> shaft

the shaft to begin is with the shaft

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.290 
the shaft to begin is with the shaft
they're<00:01:39.280> using<00:01:39.520> what<00:01:39.610> they<00:01:39.700> call<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:40.030> spear

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
they're using what they call a spear

they're using what they call a spear
construction<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.320> way<00:01:41.440> this<00:01:41.619> works<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
construction the way this works the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.530 
construction the way this works the
actual<00:01:42.400> body<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.820> shaft<00:01:43.090> goes<00:01:43.210> all<00:01:43.510> the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
actual body of the shaft goes all the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.880 
actual body of the shaft goes all the
way<00:01:43.660> into<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:43.990> heel<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.380> sticks<00:01:44.619> blade

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
way into the heel of the sticks blade

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.310 
way into the heel of the sticks blade
creating<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.790> much<00:01:46.030> more<00:01:46.270> direct<00:01:46.690> feel<00:01:47.080> for<00:01:47.260> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
creating a much more direct feel for the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.690 
creating a much more direct feel for the
puck<00:01:47.500> while<00:01:47.680> you're<00:01:47.830> in<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.979> ice<00:01:53.700> another

puck while you're in the ice another
thing<00:01:54.880> that<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.060> views<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.479> stick<00:01:55.690> is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
thing that the views on this stick is

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.840 
thing that the views on this stick is
what<00:01:55.930> they<00:01:56.020> call<00:01:56.200> Ecore<00:01:56.680> 10<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.580> way<00:01:57.670> this

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
what they call Ecore 10 the way this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.580 
what they call Ecore 10 the way this
process<00:01:58.060> works<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:58.660> that<00:01:58.750> it's<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:59.020> handmade

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
process works is that it's a handmade

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.889 
process works is that it's a handmade
process<00:01:59.920> that<00:02:00.369> increases<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.420> sort<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.750> them

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
process that increases the sort of them

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.749 
process that increases the sort of them
a<00:02:02.140> build<00:02:02.710> time<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> stick<00:02:03.340> roughly<00:02:03.640> by

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
a build time of the stick roughly by

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.850 
a build time of the stick roughly by
about<00:02:03.940> eight<00:02:04.180> times<00:02:04.479> but<00:02:05.170> what<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:05.470> results

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
about eight times but what this results

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.469 
about eight times but what this results
in<00:02:06.009> is<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.520> stick<00:02:06.820> with<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.000> much<00:02:07.300> more

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
in is a stick with a much more

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.479 
in is a stick with a much more
consistent<00:02:07.869> flex<00:02:08.320> profile<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:08.979> feel<00:02:09.220> and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
consistent flex profile and feel and

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.550 
consistent flex profile and feel and
most<00:02:10.360> importantly<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.989> eliminates<00:02:11.440> any

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
most importantly it eliminates any

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.260 
most importantly it eliminates any
excess<00:02:11.980> materials<00:02:12.640> that<00:02:12.730> build<00:02:12.850> up<00:02:13.000> during

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
excess materials that build up during

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.810 
excess materials that build up during
the<00:02:13.390> more<00:02:13.840> traditional<00:02:14.350> machined<00:02:14.650> process<00:02:15.130> so

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
the more traditional machined process so

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.010 
the more traditional machined process so
not<00:02:16.000> only<00:02:16.120> does<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.450> give<00:02:16.600> you<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.780> much<00:02:16.989> more

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
not only does this give you a much more

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.990 
not only does this give you a much more
refined<00:02:17.500> product<00:02:18.010> but<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.520> also<00:02:18.670> means<00:02:18.850> that

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
refined product but it also means that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.740 
refined product but it also means that
you're<00:02:19.090> going<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.239> have<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.420> stick<00:02:19.660> that's

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you're going to have a stick that's

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.930 
you're going to have a stick that's
going<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:19.989> feel<00:02:20.200> newer<00:02:20.560> for<00:02:21.190> longer<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.670> last

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
going to feel newer for longer and last

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.220 
going to feel newer for longer and last
much<00:02:22.209> longer<00:02:22.239> than<00:02:22.510> anything<00:02:22.780> else<00:02:23.049> on<00:02:23.170> the

so take a look at the materials of their

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
so take a look at the materials of their
views<00:02:41.489> on<00:02:41.670> this<00:02:41.819> stick<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.629> shaft<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.109> the

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
with the construction method that they

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.429 
with the construction method that they
used<00:02:50.069> they've<00:02:50.340> been<00:02:50.459> able<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.700> shave<00:02:50.969> off<00:02:51.439> 30%

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.899 
used they've been able to shave off 30%
in<00:02:52.590> terms<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.430> overall<00:02:53.700> weight<00:02:53.879> of

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
than competitors sticks on the market so

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.129 
than competitors sticks on the market so
this<00:02:57.389> means<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.599> you're<00:02:57.780> not<00:02:57.870> only<00:02:57.989> getting

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
this means that you're not only getting

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.050 
this means that you're not only getting
the<00:02:58.590> life<00:02:58.980> stick<00:02:59.340> that<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.609> currently<00:02:59.909> on<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the life stick that is currently on the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.129 
the life stick that is currently on the
market<00:03:00.120> you're<00:03:00.540> also<00:03:00.629> getting<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.959> most

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
market you're also getting the most

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.229 
market you're also getting the most
responsive<00:03:01.799> stick<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.670> sticks<00:03:02.909> really

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
responsive stick so this sticks really

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.849 
responsive stick so this sticks really
gonna<00:03:03.359> benefit<00:03:03.689> the<00:03:03.780> players<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.230> utilize

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
gonna benefit the players that utilize

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.710 
gonna benefit the players that utilize
their<00:03:05.069> wrist<00:03:05.250> shots<00:03:05.430> in<00:03:05.579> their<00:03:05.730> snapshots<00:03:06.209> and

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
while they're on the ice this is going

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.500 
while they're on the ice this is going
to<00:03:08.489> allow<00:03:08.579> you<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.790> get<00:03:08.879> your<00:03:08.939> shots<00:03:09.180> off<00:03:09.299> much

to allow you to get your shots off much

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.119 
to allow you to get your shots off much
quicker<00:03:09.750> there<00:03:10.530> are<00:03:10.620> going<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.799> be<00:03:10.859> a<00:03:10.889> lot<00:03:11.099> more

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
quicker there are going to be a lot more

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.440 
quicker there are going to be a lot more

they<00:03:40.319> also<00:03:40.470> have<00:03:40.799> what<00:03:40.979> they<00:03:41.099> call<00:03:41.280> a

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
they also have what they call a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.520 
they also have what they call a

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
lot more rigid while you're taking shot

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.330 
lot more rigid while you're taking shot
for<00:03:48.569> us<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.470> not<00:03:49.590> only<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:49.889> this<00:03:49.979> going<00:03:50.159> to<00:03:50.250> give

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
for us so not only is this going to give

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.920 
for us so not only is this going to give
you<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.549> rigidity<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:51.269> help<00:03:51.479> you<00:03:51.659> with<00:03:51.810> your

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
you that rigidity to help you with your

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.960 
you that rigidity to help you with your
shooting<00:03:52.560> accuracy<00:03:53.010> but<00:03:53.579> one<00:03:53.729> of<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.879> issues

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
shooting accuracy but one of the issues

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.250 
shooting accuracy but one of the issues
that<00:03:54.239> sticks<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.689> is<00:03:54.870> when<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.079> take<00:03:55.199> a

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that sticks have is when you take a

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.259 
that sticks have is when you take a
really<00:03:55.560> hard<00:03:55.739> shot<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:56.519> stick<00:03:56.729> play<00:03:56.879> tends<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
really hard shot the stick play tends to

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.420 
really hard shot the stick play tends to
open<00:03:57.449> out<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.379> idea<00:03:58.680> by<00:03:58.859> inserting<00:03:59.280> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
open out but the idea by inserting the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.860 
open out but the idea by inserting the
stabilizer<00:03:59.970> which<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.359> carbon<00:04:00.569> fiber

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
stabilizer which is the carbon fiber

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.869 
stabilizer which is the carbon fiber
insert<00:04:01.319> it<00:04:01.530> keeps<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.889> stick<00:04:02.129> sort<00:04:02.669> of<00:04:02.729> in<00:04:02.819> the

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
insert it keeps the stick sort of in the

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.189 
insert it keeps the stick sort of in the
same<00:04:03.030> position<00:04:03.449> that<00:04:03.479> you<00:04:03.659> would<00:04:03.720> expect<00:04:04.109> to

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:04.199 
same position that you would expect to

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.749 
same position that you would expect to
be<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.530> so<00:04:04.709> when<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:04.859> shoot<00:04:05.159> you<00:04:05.519> know<00:04:05.639> that

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:05.759 
be in so when you shoot you know that

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:06.740 
be in so when you shoot you know that
you're<00:04:05.849> not<00:04:05.939> going<00:04:06.030> to<00:04:06.120> overcook<00:04:06.449> your<00:04:06.599> shot

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you're not going to overcook your shot

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.520 
you're not going to overcook your shot
and<00:04:06.870> they're<00:04:06.959> going<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.139> be<00:04:07.199> a<00:04:07.229> lot<00:04:07.409> more

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
and they're going to be a lot more

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:15.850 
and they're going to be a lot more
accurate

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.110 

so<00:04:16.860> the<00:04:16.980> overall<00:04:17.250> weight<00:04:17.430> of<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.670> stick<00:04:17.910> is

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
so the overall weight of the stick is

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.870 
so the overall weight of the stick is
385<00:04:19.110> grams<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.799> course<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.310> most<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.610> us<00:04:20.700> that's

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
385 grams of course to most of us that's

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.370 
385 grams of course to most of us that's
just<00:04:21.030> a<00:04:21.120> number<00:04:21.480> but<00:04:21.900> when<00:04:22.019> you<00:04:22.110> pick<00:04:22.260> the

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
just a number but when you pick the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.420 
just a number but when you pick the
stick<00:04:22.560> up<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.860> compare<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> other

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
stick up and compare it to the other

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.680 
stick up and compare it to the other
sticks<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:23.850> are<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.090> market<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.570> also

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
sticks that are on the market and also

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.690 
sticks that are on the market and also
what<00:04:25.020> you<00:04:25.140> might<00:04:25.290> be<00:04:25.440> currently<00:04:25.620> using<00:04:26.160> you<00:04:26.550> do

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
what you might be currently using you do

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.160 
what you might be currently using you do
really<00:04:26.880> feel<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.300> amount<00:04:27.480> of<00:04:27.660> effort<00:04:27.960> that's

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
really feel the amount of effort that's

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.330 
really feel the amount of effort that's
willing<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.470> constructing<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.040> stick<00:04:29.220> and

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
willing to constructing the stick and

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.250 
willing to constructing the stick and
reducing<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:29.790> and<00:04:30.360> wait<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:30.810> our<00:04:30.840> bracket

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
reducing that and wait for our bracket

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.320 
reducing that and wait for our bracket
by<00:04:31.350> 30%<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:32.190> way<00:04:32.670> it's<00:04:32.820> spelled<00:04:33.030> on<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.210> ice
