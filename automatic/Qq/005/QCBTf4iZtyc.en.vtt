00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.030 
alive that's incredible I mean
but<00:02:13.069> they're<00:02:13.219> not<00:02:13.310> very<00:02:13.519> fast<00:02:14.109> and<00:02:15.109> if<00:02:15.859> they

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
but they're not very fast and if they

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.459 
but they're not very fast and if they
die<00:02:16.250> it's<00:02:16.969> probably<00:02:17.120> better<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.109> the<00:02:18.260> lava

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
die it's probably better so the lava

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:22.809 
die it's probably better so the lava
lava<00:02:19.040> pups<00:02:19.519> could<00:02:20.269> get<00:02:20.450> around<00:02:20.829> if<00:02:21.829> but

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
lava pups could get around if but

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.179 
lava pups could get around if but
there's<00:02:23.030> nothing<00:02:23.329> else<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.599> kill<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.189> lava

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
there's nothing else to kill the lava

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.369 
there's nothing else to kill the lava
hounds<00:02:25.519> now<00:02:25.640> besides<00:02:26.030> an<00:02:26.180> air<00:02:26.329> minor<00:02:26.569> very

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379

seeking<00:02:28.069> here<00:02:28.250> mine<00:02:28.489> so<00:02:30.099> slow<00:02:31.099> machine<00:02:31.370> is

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
seeking here mine so slow machine is

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.479 
seeking here mine so slow machine is
probably<00:02:31.790> hoping<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:33.349> one<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.650> those<00:02:33.889> traps

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489
