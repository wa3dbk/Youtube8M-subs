 Start a path to one of the 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.600
 target cards and the saboteurs 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.460

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.050
 stock pile 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.759
 no matter what options you use 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.920
 pull a map again with paths 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.100

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.819

 they help you fulfill theirs 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.930
 either they block players 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.380

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:39.340

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.860
 action treasure card may only you 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.060

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:59.110
 the game away with the action cards 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 broken hoe lore and lantern can 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.400
 the players hinder each other 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.280
 who at least one of these cards before 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.190
 Lying may not have a route map 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.710
 create more 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.990
 I can help with these repair cards 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.340
 me or a fellow player one 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.920

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.470

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.760
 decide which of the pictured blog 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.760
 I have on love 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:36.300
 if a player uses the card with the 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:39.090
 Goldschatz achieved a pity is the round 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.870
 finished and now the rolls will be cards 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.600
 uncovered 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.840
 The gold seekers have won them 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.010
 get depending on the number of players 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.040
 gold pieces as a reward 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.230
 the round is also finished when 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.500
 all sorts of cards are used up and 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.950
 the ingredients did not reach the place 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.610
 has been 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.910
 then the saboteurs win and get 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.820
 the gold card after the distribution of 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:09.060
 gold cards begins the next round 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.180
 with new role distribution the game 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.959
 ends after the third round of the player 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.269
 wins with the most gold pieces 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:22.230
 saboteur is also great for the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:25.350
 number of players is suitable every round 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.070
 the exciting new because the roles are new 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.810

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.550
 small tip to the saboteurs 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:37.050
 acts in the beginning in the hidden or 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.400
 somebody blocks and accuses him 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:43.340
 to be a saboteur 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:48.330
