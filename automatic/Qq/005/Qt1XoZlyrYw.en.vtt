 here we are so to 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.360
 the installation of the raeder in the 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.360
 configuration 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.119
 so for those who had seen the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.740
 unpacking goes posidion ball to you the 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.630
 see installed with the new cables 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 so which are bitfenix cables 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 hachemi the fans are privateers 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.579
 believing white edition seduces pipes 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.200
 taiwan liquid kauter block in water 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.239
 swiftech turblog and there you see there 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.079
 posidon connected installed in the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.670
 case so that is a carbide 540 m 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.390
 then without further waiting for the raider or 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.129
 do I install 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.260
 I simply installed on the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.660
 express pci port which is all the way down 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.520
 the max zus seems to install it 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.940
 nothing more simple you slip it 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.379
 in it we position it well we support 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.770
 and here it is a stand up tell you no 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.770
 the small screw 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.240
 like that at the same time that you can 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.320
 see inside the case we see that 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.910
 the big graphics cards i'm doing 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.290
 a little parenthesis passes quite 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.930
 in a box with a big box 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.640
 watercooled watercooling radiator 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.700
 by no and a hundred and twenty years 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.410
 it goes very well our teeth I'm going 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.130
 you put the power on the way for 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.350
 that you see the illumination of the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.470
 map and we 'll film the startup of 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.470
 windows 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.530
 yes it's a little light 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:43.160
 so as you see excess feed 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:44.570
 it lights up on leave so here's the 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.700
 raider is installed you see in 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.430
 installation it's really extremely 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.060
 simply no 36 manipulation 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 do we connect it aims well and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.330
 here it is ready we go right away 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.350
 passed to the market at the launch of the windows 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.030
 and we'll end up on the pc for 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.510
 test a little the performance of this 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.459
 record immediately 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.959
 short so we go now like 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:20.410
 as expected at bright start without 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:20.410
 more wait 3 2 1 to lens 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.890
 so the windows that is installed in 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.890
 uefa 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.840
 here is your windows is loaded and 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.040
 usable you can immediately it 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.750
 there is more software loading time 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.849
 the airlock and the map software 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.060
 graph I will introduce another 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:19.250
 time so here it's ready to 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.470
 operate there's nothing left to do so 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.349
 as you see it's still is 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.909
 still a speed that is who is 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:29.930
 quite appreciable appreciable for 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:32.090
 this type of material 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.170
 it starts quickly it's effective tells them 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.609
 ready immediately no loading 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.670
 after that it's really good 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.409
 we're going to camera the hand before 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.730
 go directly to the pc software I 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.430
 so let's show you the famous little girl 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.590
 light of which I spoke to you see the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.639
 activity light nantes the raeder which 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.639
 is behind the pc 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.560
 So here we are for the ignition of 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.480
 windows we are immediately 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.609
 for a software test for you 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.940
 present a little a rescript words for the 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.910
 noise here is presented a little so the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.879
 software bundled with and a little test 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.910
 fast on assassin's creed has everything from 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.910
 after
