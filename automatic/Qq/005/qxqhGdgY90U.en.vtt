00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
get the oscar gunner now that is the

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.860 
get the oscar gunner now that is the
biggest<00:00:07.560> kill<00:00:07.950> street<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.790> game<00:00:09.120> at<00:00:09.480> least

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
biggest kill street in the game at least

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.350 
biggest kill street in the game at least
in<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> assault<00:00:10.410> package<00:00:10.769> um<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.610> don't<00:00:12.120> think

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
in the assault package um I don't think

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.780 
in the assault package um I don't think
there's<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.460> support<00:00:14.460> that's<00:00:14.580> any

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
there's one of the support that's any

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.150 
there's one of the support that's any
higher<00:00:15.120> than<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> Osprey<00:00:16.560> gunner<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:17.039> might

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
higher than the Osprey gunner it might

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.680 
higher than the Osprey gunner it might
be<00:00:17.279> equivalent<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:17.940> there's<00:00:18.150> nothing<00:00:18.480> higher

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
be equivalent but there's nothing higher

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.980 
be equivalent but there's nothing higher
so<00:00:19.250> this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.880> biggest<00:00:21.119> kill<00:00:21.480> streak<00:00:21.779> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
so this is the biggest kill streak in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.509 
so this is the biggest kill streak in
the<00:00:22.109> game<00:00:22.289> unless<00:00:22.529> you're<00:00:22.859> talking<00:00:23.070> about

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the game unless you're talking about

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.460 
the game unless you're talking about
well<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.850> should<00:00:24.119> say<00:00:24.150> point<00:00:24.630> streak<00:00:24.960> unless

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
well I should say point streak unless

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.990 
well I should say point streak unless
you're<00:00:25.650> talking<00:00:25.859> about<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.099> moa<00:00:26.400> be<00:00:26.730> which

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
you're talking about the moa be which

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640 
you're talking about the moa be which
that's<00:00:27.240> not<00:00:27.420> really<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> point<00:00:28.109> streak<00:00:28.470> that's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that's not really a point streak that's

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.980 
that's not really a point streak that's
just<00:00:28.920> more<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.460> ex<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.689> Pine<00:00:30.960> Street

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.240 
something I'm gonna let you guys know
it's<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.050> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.710> stupid<00:00:47.219> that

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's going to be kind of so stupid that

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's going to be kind of so stupid that
it<00:00:47.550> actually<00:00:47.730> makes<00:00:48.059> sense<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.770> when

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it actually makes sense is that when

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.970 
it actually makes sense is that when
you're<00:00:50.789> using<00:00:51.120> um<00:00:51.480> no<00:00:52.379> sorry<00:00:52.680> when<00:00:52.860> you're

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you're using um no sorry when you're

you're using um no sorry when you're
playing<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.030> studying<00:00:54.270> these<00:00:54.360> high

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
playing and you're studying these high

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.680 
playing and you're studying these high
killstreaks<00:00:55.489> make<00:00:56.489> sure<00:00:56.730> you're<00:00:56.969> doing<00:00:57.180> them

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
killstreaks make sure you're doing them

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.220 
killstreaks make sure you're doing them
against<00:00:58.020> bad<00:00:58.289> players<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:59.160> these<00:00:59.940> elite<00:01:00.539> MLG

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
against bad players not these elite MLG

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.049 
against bad players not these elite MLG
all-star<00:01:01.949> players<00:01:02.250> you<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.760> guys<00:01:02.879> know

all-star players you think you guys know

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.820 
all-star players you think you guys know
what<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.210> means<00:01:03.449> all<00:01:03.600> right<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.019> don't<00:01:04.320> if

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
what I means all right I don't if

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.320 
what I means all right I don't if
there's<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> full<00:01:05.369> party<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.939> other<00:01:06.030> team<00:01:06.299> I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
there's a full party on the other team I

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
there's a full party on the other team I
would<00:01:06.570> definitely<00:01:06.689> not<00:01:06.990> recommend<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.860> for

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
would definitely not recommend going for

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.700 
would definitely not recommend going for
these<00:01:08.820> high<00:01:09.060> killstreaks<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> reason

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
these high killstreaks and the reason

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.130 
these high killstreaks and the reason
for<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.720> they're<00:01:12.720> good<00:01:12.960> players

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
for that is that they're good players

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.840 
for that is that they're good players
and<00:01:13.650> their<00:01:13.770> experience<00:01:13.950> they're<00:01:14.549> not<00:01:14.700> gonna

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
and their experience they're not gonna

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.030 
and their experience they're not gonna
let<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.180> pub<00:01:15.390> stomp<00:01:15.720> them<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.049> time<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
let you pub stomp them all the time so

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.899 
let you pub stomp them all the time so
this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.659> quick<00:01:18.659> tip<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.140> how<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> to

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this is my quick tip on how to do it to

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
this is my quick tip on how to do it to
get<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> Osprey<00:01:21.509> gunner<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:22.409> um<00:01:22.680> it's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
get the Osprey gunner it's very um it's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.539 
get the Osprey gunner it's very um it's
a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.490> easier<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:24.119> should<00:01:24.600> say<00:01:24.840> if<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.549> get

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
a lot easier I should say if you get

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.730 
a lot easier I should say if you get
your<00:01:26.700> attack<00:01:26.970> helicopter<00:01:27.689> which<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
your attack helicopter which is the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.410 
your attack helicopter which is the
seven<00:01:29.040> kill<00:01:29.189> streak<00:01:29.460> which<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.729> recommend<00:01:29.909> for

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
seven kill streak which I recommend for

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.999 
seven kill streak which I recommend for
using<00:01:30.689> your<00:01:30.780> first<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
using your first one and then I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.080 
using your first one and then I
recommend<00:01:32.520> using<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.350> pave<00:01:34.350> low<00:01:34.650> ac<00:01:34.979> 130<00:01:35.700> or

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
recommend using the pave low ac 130 or

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.990 
recommend using the pave low ac 130 or
even<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> assault<00:01:37.170> juggernauts<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.790> i'd

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
even the assault juggernauts but i'd

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.819 
even the assault juggernauts but i'd
recommend<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> 12<00:01:39.900> kill<00:01:40.170> streak<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.650> way

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
recommend the 12 kill streak that way

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.740 
recommend the 12 kill streak that way
your<00:01:40.979> 7<00:01:41.340> killstreak<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> ques

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
your 7 killstreak can get you to a ques
