00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
the probes and push the button and you

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.179 
the probes and push the button and you
can<00:01:23.539> see<00:01:23.780> that<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.109> conducts<00:01:24.530> electricity

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the lights light up nonmetal atoms do

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.160 
the lights light up nonmetal atoms do
not<00:02:55.160> allow<00:02:55.519> their<00:02:55.819> electrons<00:02:56.420> to<00:02:56.660> freely<00:02:57.140> move

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
from atom to atom therefore they can't

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
therefore they don't conduct electricity

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.699 
therefore they don't conduct electricity
