00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
thing is tiny tiny tiny that's why i

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.810 
thing is tiny tiny tiny that's why i
love<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.040> zoom<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.610> that's<00:01:53.729> about

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
love it it is zoom I think that's about

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.020 
love it it is zoom I think that's about
five<00:01:54.119> times<00:01:54.390> zoom<00:01:54.950> then<00:01:55.950> after<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
five times zoom then after that think it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.060 
five times zoom then after that think it
goes<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.360> digital<00:01:57.719> zoom<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> things<00:01:58.920> just

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
goes to digital zoom and things just

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.440 
goes to digital zoom and things just
really<00:01:59.430> really<00:01:59.520> small<00:01:59.820> time<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
really really small time this is the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
really really small time this is the
main<00:02:00.630> reason<00:02:00.899> why<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> got<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> video

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
main reason why I got it but the video

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
main reason why I got it but the video
quality<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.430> awesome<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:03.659> it's<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
quality is awesome and I think it's the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.990 
quality is awesome and I think it's the
same<00:02:04.110> camera<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.530> CTFxC<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.700> YouTube
