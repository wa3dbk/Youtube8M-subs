00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.259
 hello my name is ivan members and 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.980
 Today I will talk about the motherboard 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.830
 which I bought to collect the system 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.730
 core i5 processor based unit on 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.500
 core haswell 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.670
 this board is based on system logic 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.020
 h87 chipset 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.439
 possesses a connector olga 1150 1150 for 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.439
 haswell 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:42.010
 also here is all express 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:45.969
 30 and 20 are backward compatible 4 eat a cheetah 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:49.690
 but now I donâ€™t think so 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:54.300
 there should be 4 usb ports 30 behind two more 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.300
 usb 2 0 well and also the front plate 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.089
 open look here we have a manual 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.249
 By the way, for the first time I see that there was a qr-code 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.799
 you can download the digital version there will be 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:08.040
 with colored pictures in more detail 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.680
 here is a manual in English 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 full and well that's a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.729
 localized to m for cis countries 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.840
 can be written in eight steps 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:23.439
 briefly how do we assemble a computer 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 sticker disk drivers and proper 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.070
 the board itself 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.210
 back plank there is nothing more 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:47.130
 so it looks like micro tanks form factor 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.899
 Now even from X you and the decision are they 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.000
 more expansion slots but here 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.579
 in width they are all about here 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.429
 full hell and x boards are good old ones 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:03.509
 Che is not very expensive in equal 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:08.300
 10,000 how are you all going in the year decrease 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:13.640
 there is just 1 slot pci-express crossfire 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.080
 or the slide certainly won't pull up in the future 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.120
 can be installed here for now 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.890
 what will be installed here in the future 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.050
 maybe a video card so far here 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.010
 haase processor will work with 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.410
 rainfall 4 600 rear graphics 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.810
 panel here we see the standard 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.050
 6 channel sound 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 gigabit ethernet 2 usb 2 0 and 4 beaten 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.020
 30 also ps for 2 fully soldered here 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.150
 it happens only there universal 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.270
 connector or mouse keyboards single and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.560
 disa watering j is also here 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.990
 eight-phase optional 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.380
 CPU power you don't see often 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:58.870
 worth of three thousand one hundred one hundred and one hundred rubles 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:03.230
 dollars is practically a good option 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.110
 sata ports are all 6 gigabit i.e. 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.820
 sata3 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.840
 no problem to connect her hard drives 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.959
 old and carry all capacitors 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.030
 solid-state on board increased 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.350
 survivability that is if standard 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.810
 capacitors live two and a half 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.739
 thousand hours these five thousand that is 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.290
 you can count 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.730
 if you computer is working 12 hours in 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:32.180
 day for there year well let year 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.790
 we will have a few days off not 350 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.459
 355 days and let three hundred and ten 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.840
 months she take you without turning it off 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.350
 it turns out for 12 hours it is 3600 hours 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.820
 has a year and a half may be possible to tell from 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.550
 possibly enabled to work without 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.930
 problems from payment guaranteed but on 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.170
 practice this dirt what if on average 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:59.630
 fee lives for 35 years then this is about 70 70 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:03.860
 years old true capacitors they 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:09.350
 occupy less space while possessing 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.600
 long life such a fee 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.120
 socket 1150 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.300
 old coolers will be compatible with it 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.310
 there are 156 1155 can put here 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.420
 some 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.390
 customized cooler and non-standard 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.800
 it is also possible any and there are boxed even 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:33.940
 put without problems everything will rise such 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.940
 here's a small fee so long as udalenkaya
