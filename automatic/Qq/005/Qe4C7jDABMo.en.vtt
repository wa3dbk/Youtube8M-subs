 tubasket com 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.640
 3 x 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.019
 the oil is finished 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.630
 this 21st century is in fact the last for the reserves of this hydrocarbon 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.310
 that revolutionized our time 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.599
 also the main destination is still combustion 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.099
 accelerating its end and contributing to the afp 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.550
 nation was saying two alarms 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.830
 while others and waiting for firm commitments from the large 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.730
 powers 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.060
 the geopolitical weight of our planet is more polarized 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.420
 and energy dependence is an obstacle to an independent development 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.910
 two countries 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.210
 before this panorama, there is no doubt 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.460
 The countdown has begun 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.800
 you have to look for substitutes for the increasingly scarce black gold and one of the 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 main candidates that hydrogen 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.290
 the hydrogen I still think the same thing many years those not at the beginning of the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.320
 20th century in the 40s for example 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.780
 is produced on a large scale while as of natural gas and currently continues 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.060
 hydrogen production 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.799
 the train we unload subtlety the hydrogen as fuel we want that 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.259
 been that the vector is not the motor that moves for example the transport 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.930
 to 66 'a thousandth production of hydrogen at a much larger scale 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.700
 in that sense then what we have to look for are the fruit of hydrogen 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.680
 sustainable renewable clean 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.800
 that is the big challenge how we produce hydrogen on a large scale and at the same time we are 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.110
 compatible with the environment 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.610
 One of the great advantages of hydrogen is that it can be produced 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.290
 from renewable energy sources 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.520
 in this way each country or each community can decide the form of production 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.900
 which suits you best and thus develop local economies and get 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.930
 energy autonomy 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.430
 hydrogen from geothermal in Icelandic nuclear as already foreseen france 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.140
 or from photovoltaic or wind roads that seem reasonable in 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139
 Andalusia 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.199
 In our community we are already working on this technology 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.059
 hydrogen 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:18.069
 companies such as the sevillian gener crin filial abengoa pursue clean forms 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.519
 stop hydrogen and also work in their storage and in the 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.129
 The University of Huelva designed a novel propulsion system for a 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.059
 clean engine 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.609
 I was talking about that is a propulsion system claimed its engine 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.789
 the propulsion system one of its parts an electric motor that would be the 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:37.119
 calcining would move 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.429
 n the vehicle 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.889
 and that we are not making a car either 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.529
 and that the idea that our judged system could be integrated 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:47.109
 in any commercial vehicle of which yes I have mine we are 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.569
 working with a laboratory prototype 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.269
 that was with a normal vehicle 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.769
 of giving a power of about 80 horses 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.119
 a top speed of 1,160 kilometers per hour 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.119
 and an acceleration from 0 to 100 around 11 seconds 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.699
 maciel let's say a mixed trajectory announced in a mixed circuit of 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.129
 driving row road 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.129
 because it would have an autonomy between six and eight hours 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.039
 then what he introduces arrived here would be 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:16.489
 an electric motor 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.759
 the electric motor would be purchased directly from the hotel headquarters 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:23.379
 the vehicle transmission go through the exchange house and dock 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.009
 electric motor and now to power the electric motor we had 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:29.829
 the different elements that the electric current would provide 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.899
 necessary motor on the one hand 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.929
 photovoltaic solar energy 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:38.429
 that it would be he and I would answer network covering all the surface that 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:40.129
 there was the interperience of the vehicle 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.909
 the fuel cell battery 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.909
 and that the ultracapacitor bank 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.079
 we're 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.029
 With these four power sources, a closed scheme is pursued 

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:59.159
 that you just need to recharge yourself with hydrogen 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:03.689
 The big challenge now is to design an intelligent control system capable of 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.310
 adapt its behavior to the demand and obtain the power of each one of these 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:10.310
 sources with a competitive end result in the market 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.609
 the team of researchers from the University of huelva seeks the formula 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.519
 one of the key elements are fuel cells the device that 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.259
 converts the energy and chemistry of hydrogen into electrical with steam 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.039
 water as the only residue 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.610
 with two goals of óbolo opened living with my goals 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.889
 they are an element that gives more power but less time 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.379
 the fuel cell gives more less power 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:35.949
 has more autonomy to control life 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:36.750
 we need 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.620
 know its dynamic behavior 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.559
 is a static goalkeeper that allows us 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.180
 design control system 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.969
 so have the battery where we want 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:46.979
 those were 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.680
 fiorina in the vila 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.979
 after toyota said does not let you know what point to beat to work public 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.759
 more efficiency as you can 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.580
 despite the efficiency of the stack its non-linear behavior is a 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.800
 inconvenient 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.940
 from the study area of ​​the photovoltaic panels try to compensate for 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.960
 your part 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.970
 chuckie world that for example

 cuomo ensured in a massive 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:19.900
 they will enter otherwise 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.450
 athens for the merengue technician 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.090
 of winning static throughout the day moves depends on the conditions of 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.430
 once 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.939
 enslaved 

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.360
 turner algorithm that 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.229
 He has also pointed out converts 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.059
 he has to take care of looking 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.069
 devised for each traffic infraction 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:40.069
 consequently a higher increase is expected 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.750
 In the absence of perfecting it, the system is expected to be ready within a period of 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.839
 three years 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.649
 but it will take a lot longer for the hydrogen era to begin 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.969
 although there have been other energy paradigm shifts in history in 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:59.569
 this occasion will have to produce a total transformation of the sector 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:04.619
 meanwhile the energy industry looks at hydrogen 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:08.439
 car manufacturers have experimental prototypes the companies of 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.050
 transport pioneer projects and hydrogen is present in the 

00:06:12.049 --> 00:06:16.419
 speeches the president bush but the relay will not be able to produce a 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.770
 legislation that they have returned to if the proposal 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.120
 roma speaks of the years 2020 2040 or 2050 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.930
 so that hydrogen is really used as a fuel 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.990
 right now what different countries defend who they are doing is 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.050
 position yourself 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.750
 is to develop their own standards their own platforms their own 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.910
 associations to be sure that when the time comes they are 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:42.289
 positioned right now everything is prepared for also this guy without 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.760
 But it also takes six politicians and even society demands 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.629
 that change 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:49.729
 until society sees an advantage changes to the hydrogen vehicle 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.729
 I really did not look to be excluded 

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.719
 that we can have the prototype point determined 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.589
 is fundamentally based on the fact that we can have the funds of 

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:02.309
 research to be able to do it 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:06.269
 because let's say that in technology at the level of theoretical developments even 

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:09.259
 computer simulations we have developed later 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.930
 that this can be commercialized because it will depend on the administration and 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.439
 company that interests you 

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.439
 take that to the commercial plane 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.000
 and I calculate that if in Spain in 2015 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.060
 does not have hydrogen technology aimed once again we will not have stayed 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.850
 out of the race and once we kill we buy a bride as fatima up 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.100
 now
