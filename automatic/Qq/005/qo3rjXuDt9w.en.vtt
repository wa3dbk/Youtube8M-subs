 video channel for boxing was the video 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.320
 of today a simple quick tutorial 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.270
 easy and a lot of people will be there 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 enjoying learning 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.619
 today I went to you how to move the bottom 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.079
 of an image by the mobile by android 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.390
 to remove the bottom but we need 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.090
 only from an application that iraty 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.220
 background far and gatwick at place thor 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 as usual you will still have to 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.730
 story in the description and the link to it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.130
 that the father for you to download and if not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.870
 I was able to download in place time and it's very 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.760
 simple people and a place when you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.700
 opens the application even more it already 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 is clear and simple it is easy to use 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.410
 You will stay cloud photo and go look for 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.090
 photo you want to remove the background without 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.430
 I'm very picky and I'll choose this one. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.989
 image here first more if I know not 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.829
 there are images and if they do not 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 recent 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.240
 just click here from the side and look for 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.700
 example the gallery by photos by some 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.369
 image application by clicking on the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.079
 image it was a person you cut in 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.080
 if the staff if they in line schin 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:17.820
 aquino mother craft 11 you want to meet 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.070
 more or less the image size for 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.560
 visit as you wish stay in 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.780
 Rondônia on top and that was two 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.890
 ways you removed the background from the image 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.960
 first you can stay in 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 and remove by color by 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.400
 example if I could remove let's 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 white part of the unisc 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.030
 selected the automatic and that was in the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.010
 white part 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.619
 If I die here in this part of 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.680
 you are now seeing the increase the degree 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.869
 thing to remove by 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 example there was a white tone that I 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.040
 I'll leave it to you at least 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.810
 back here on that button those buttons there 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.299
 to tie back and make a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.159
 modifies a tone only in white 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.250
 a little bit blank 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.720
 now is to remove more is increasing and 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.330
 develop a yellow or 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.490
 develop - as it has been 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.450
 decrease in error more or less tones to 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.189
 same color 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.319
 It is an issue without one being close to the 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:13.830
 he asks another still reconnecting 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.330
 image on the screen and half still half as well 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.760
 in the image you have already seen the work that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.260
 I did and I did both ways if the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.450
 first French way in colors and 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.400
 Removing you are here is withdrawing 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.599
 or later paraná 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.480
 after all you can choose this option 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.250
 aquino where you do it manually 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 you can increase or decrease the radius 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.750
 for example here, already with you very quickly 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.189
 take a good part and I can give a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 also zoom in order to remove more than 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.989
 close 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.359
 I can pick up the use manually 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.760
 Simple here and I can get it here. 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.810
 So I came and I can take the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.939
 zoom out 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.650
 and so gradually and doing something 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.780
 that depending on the image you not so much 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.400
 work exposes more with two or three 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.620
 different background colors is very 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.750
 simple very fast and even this image 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.700
 that had enough colors you saw that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.819
 until the result was also legal 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.049
 confirmed again on the screen and was 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.540
 I took time to do it, I finished. 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.769
 little time each day that they are the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.450
 three less I had already achieved 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.519
 wrap the background image all things 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.900
 can be very simple and right here 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.090
 I will not finish doing it to give 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.310
 show you how it 's but the little 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.959
 time we already have a good tutorial 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.150
 part is to make this work a bit 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.280
 more and such beauty then again 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.019
 automatically remove any color I 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.700
 randomly, and if I give a 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.590
 more professional more finishing touch 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.750
 I can get back here and you can select 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.510
 the background color the psp will get this 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.359
 white or stay there like this is just 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.120
 part of the single edition save and parents grandparents 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.530
 also the kingdom there at the top if 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.400
 Do you want to visualize better? 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.870
 do it here 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.909
 here it has about five options of 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.409
 finish finishing for example you cut 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.099
 the image but did not stay with some 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.900
 dots 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.449
 You can read here in the sesi you want to leave. 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.780
 more or less is God want to leave less 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:56.760
 points in the 11 in the 2 in the 3 and you go seeing 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.829
 here you imagine will contract a little more 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.169
 those tip those residues that 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.419
 can be trimmed it is clear that 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.729
 did a good job there quickly there 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.590
 Why do not you have this problem, you made me 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.359
 occurring only gives this improvement 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.879
 option is very useful, I'll leave it here 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.729
 2 to stay reasonably good 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:17.609
 I'll be on save and here you have the option of 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.239
 finish just click finish and you're done 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.130
 that's right 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.479
 just in your gallery there as if 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.240
 can see this was the result of will 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.800
 which I did before and after very simple 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.300
 very fast very easy i hope 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.099
