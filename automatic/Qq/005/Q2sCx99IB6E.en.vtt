00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.629
 every year there is a big party 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.610
 of honor and I think that this year will happen what 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.799
 same 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.320
 in these days of agencies and many 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.270
 shopping there are radio ads in the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.650
 television and in all for franchises 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.650
 that we want a store 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.010
 of something else but what little is missing for 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.989
 arrives 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.960
 the truth is nice to know that at 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:44.000
 less a day of the year some people 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.589
 they think a little bit about me you know a lot 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.589
 Years began to celebrate my birthday 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.300
 at first they did not seem to understand and 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.270
 thank you so much I did for them 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.910
 but nowadays nobody knows why 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.310
 celebrate 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.720
 people get together and have a lot of fun 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.930
 but but they do not know what it is about 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.180
 I remember last year when the day arrived 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.910
 of my birthday they made a great 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.450
 honor party there were very things 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.810
 delicious on the table 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:23.680
 everything was decorated and I also remember 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.430
 that there were many many gifts but 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.050
 Do you know something 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.050
 they did not even invite me 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.680
 about the guest of honor not even 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.950
 they agreed to invite me 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.909
 the party was for me and when the 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.690
 great day 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:53.390
 even outside they closed the door 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.390
 and I wanted to share the table with them 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.670
 in recent years all close the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.000
 door and how they did not invite me 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.430
 it occurred to me to enter without doing it my gift 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.009
 I went and stood in the corner were 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:13.739
 all drinking there were some drunk 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.739
 counting jokes, cackling cellular 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.650
 they were having a great time to make it 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.650
 came a fat old man dressed in red 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.530
 He also said that he had drunk others 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.510
 he fell heavily from the chair and 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.510
 they all ran towards him telling him 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.340
 even if the party was in his honor 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.849
 it was twelve o'clock at night 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.849
 and everyone started hugging 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.819
 I extended my arms waiting for 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.930
 someone will hug me 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.930
 and know 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.410
 nobody hugged me 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.720
 Suddenly everyone started to share 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.050
 the gifts one by one they were 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.730
 opening until they all opened 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.260
 I went to see if by chance there was 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.409
 some for me 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.610
 what would it feel like on your birthday 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:29.260
 they made gifts to each other and to you 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.260
 and they did not give you anything 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.830
 I understood then that I had left over in that 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.830
 party 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.450
 of death 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.959
 and I retired 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.480
 each passing year is worse people only 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.810

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.750

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.210
