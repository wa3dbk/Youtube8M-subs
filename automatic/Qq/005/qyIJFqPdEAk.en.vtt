00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.120
 he 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 welcome boys and 9 high day 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.520
 gazzara today I will propose you an unboxing 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.379
 video not that you will not often find the 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.050
 my channel because I received new ones 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:21.820
 native headphones are now 25 or urban 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.439
 revolt base light of the sentence is fine if 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.390
 very nice here decided to make a 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.810
 unboxing that with one hand because 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.749
 with the other I have to try to operate 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.240
 helping me with this scissor though 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:38.720
 being able to open this thing 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.840
 then becoming scarce throughout 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.690
 ok 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.040
 I already had sites and bulls for things 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.040
 so let us also help with the feet 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.330
 possible I did it we look all over 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.830
 the packaging in its splendor 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.080
 but we see that there is a lot written behind it 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.600
 well there is a button for more than 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.380
 phone calls you can attack anything 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.320
 what do you want 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.860
 all the statistics are fine here 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.910
 and so what should I do now we have to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 remove from the labels a moment only 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:20.690
 that then there are the labels 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.710
 however, you can also have water 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.130
 so now he makes a respected film 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.130
 we know why dr 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.650
 last day 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.820

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.500
 in between and come out destroy this 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.470
 beautiful packaging and I find more a 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.890
 beautiful real piece of paper that will give us 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.310
 very much an installation kit now 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.820
 of quagmire all the 8 million son 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.820
 cases that can serve and of course there 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.429
 these courses are to be opened 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:14.950
 so let's see a moment like water 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.950
 works and others find to be upbeat 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.870
 and I did it, these are the least 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.880
 pander look 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.280
 obviously with a microphone because of the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:35.580
 trust I do not know has not focused that yes 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.580
 is the microphone should be think here 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.740
 they are very cool they are very beautiful and 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.190
 so you guys good guys 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.680
 I had forgotten that in particular 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.350
 fancy of these headphones that medical the 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.380
 dog that is directly attached 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.110
 the headphones after the button to close 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.209
 phone calls do not end as well as 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.239
 the usual headphones are there or with the jack 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:06.150
 Microphone I'm here produced the red 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:09.730
 canvas is this green for headphones but 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.720
 that is to say that it does not end then all this 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.680
 blog 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.040
 here ends here instead there is another cable 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.420
 December to unroll it ending in 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.930
 this way so curious they must 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.780
 attack like this or finish directly 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.690
 with this object to attach here 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.250
 this object is by chance this 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.110
 connection does not work there 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.610
 this other replacement cable indeed 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.370
 as it is written here 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.680
 if it doesn't work and the use of sticks a 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:45.140
 blair if parolisi remains in the travails 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.620
 koblet design the blue brook vertices 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.790
 shocked bumps when it's gone tuners 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.220
 business does not work this cable 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:04:01.550
 present moment therefore in practice to do 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:04:02.810
 in this way of this doubtful decline 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.760
 link if it doesn't work then 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.040
 double tricks and so thanks 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.140
