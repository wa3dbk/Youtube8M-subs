00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.769
 hello how are you shelby and in this 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.170
 video I want to show you the steps that 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:11.480
 I continue to remove makeup and 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.330
 products that I use these are not 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.039
 the best nor the worst but 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.900
 I recommend that you first consult 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.730
 your weapon your logo to recommend 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.000
 the cream they need according to their type of 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.190
 skin let's start the first thing that 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.980
 I do it with a bandit cover all my 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.930
 hair so as not to wet it using a 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.989
 The barnier's tissue is divided by 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.600
 half to remove makeup half of my 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.899
 face and the other for the other half of my 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.050
 starting first face above the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.770
 part clean or in between with another 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:49.280
 clean part at the bottom and 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.140
 I repeat the same thing on the other side a part 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.190
 clean removed all the makeup from the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.809
 front of the cheeks in the same way 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.550
 and very carefully eliminate the 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.710
 makeup of your eyes 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.800
 very carefully since it is a very 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.010
 delicate good and here we see a part of 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.200
 what we removed but not all are going 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.479
 to continue using the cream is maquillan 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.229
 you for dry skin we put it on 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.229
 Our skin 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.590
 and then with these two fingers in between 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.080
 let's make circular movements 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.210
 to pass it all over the whole face 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.790
 since it is spread all over the face 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.130
 let's start using some bats 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.920
 how are you doing the movements like 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.320
 that I am showing the video and of 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.060
 preference every time you get dirty 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.520
 cut you have to use a new one 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.080
 let's start first on the forehead after 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.020
 by eyes 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.910
 by the cheekbones and cheeks and finish 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.790
 with the chin with another clean part and 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.880
 with a cotton swab we apply a little bit of 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.760
 make-up remover cream we fold from the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.210
 next way we put it below 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.380
 our tabs and we're going to remove the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.119
 excess makeup of the eyelashes with 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.310
 very much, be careful, take care of this area 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.110
 super delicate we have the usual 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.630
 just super strong for all our 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.390
 eyelid and that irritates us with that 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.320
 this cotonete we make it easier until 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.540
 remove all the mascara that you have and 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.550
 that the pad comes out super white 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.450
 we deserve our face and with a soap 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.310
 neutral we're going to wash ourselves super well all 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.260
 our face 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.930
 with circular movements until 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.040
 come out a lot of foam we remove the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.870
 soap and with another pair and with tonic that 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.200
 will help us to hydrate our 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.569
 skin and close the pores that you do with 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.519
 light tapping all over your skin to 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.970
 finish applied the moisturizer on 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.530
 front cheekbones chin and nose and with 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.720
 movements from the inside out and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.550
 circular I'm going to put all over my skin 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.030
 to increase it super well and also 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.970
 go down to the neck to the contour of my 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.670

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.459

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.690
 with the middle fingers 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.690
 I'm going to distribute it superbien 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.660
 and since they are all creams outweigh 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.120
 games on the face then ready
