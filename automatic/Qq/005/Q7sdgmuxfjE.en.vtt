hi i'm josh from espares
a<00:00:09.710> question<00:00:10.700> we<00:00:10.790> often<00:00:10.940> get<00:00:11.210> asked<00:00:11.570> here<00:00:11.690> at

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
a question we often get asked here at

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.530 
a question we often get asked here at
espares<00:00:12.200> is<00:00:12.559> how<00:00:12.830> people<00:00:13.070> access<00:00:13.760> and<00:00:14.030> replace

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
espares is how people access and replace

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.480 
espares is how people access and replace
the<00:00:14.840> Sun<00:00:15.110> pose<00:00:15.379> on<00:00:15.709> their<00:00:15.860> washing<00:00:16.160> machine

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:16.490 
the Sun pose on their washing machine

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.790 
the Sun pose on their washing machine
now<00:00:17.180> why<00:00:17.539> would<00:00:17.690> you<00:00:17.720> need<00:00:17.870> to<00:00:17.930> do<00:00:18.080> this<00:00:18.230> well

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
now why would you need to do this well

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.950 
now why would you need to do this well
if<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.250> Sun<00:00:19.460> pose<00:00:19.640> develops<00:00:20.060> a<00:00:20.150> blockage<00:00:20.660> it

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
if the Sun pose develops a blockage it

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.210 
if the Sun pose develops a blockage it
can<00:00:21.110> affect<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.560> efficiency<00:00:22.099> of<00:00:22.130> your

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
can affect the efficiency of your

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.130 
can affect the efficiency of your
machine<00:00:22.580> and<00:00:22.760> if<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:23.240> gets<00:00:23.330> pierced<00:00:23.720> your

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
machine and if it gets pierced your

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.839 
machine and if it gets pierced your
machine<00:00:24.410> can<00:00:24.590> actually<00:00:24.679> develop<00:00:25.099> a<00:00:25.340> leak<00:00:25.369> as

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
machine can actually develop a leak as

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.570 
machine can actually develop a leak as
well<00:00:26.090> so<00:00:26.900> in<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:27.439> video<00:00:27.679> I'm<00:00:27.859> going<00:00:28.250> to<00:00:28.339> show

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
well so in this video I'm going to show

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.450 
well so in this video I'm going to show
you<00:00:28.670> how<00:00:28.910> to<00:00:28.970> access<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:29.720> if<00:00:30.080> necessary

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
you how to access and if necessary

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.980 
you how to access and if necessary
replace<00:00:31.460> the<00:00:31.699> Sun<00:00:31.910> pose<00:00:32.119> on<00:00:32.360> your<00:00:32.750> washing

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
replace the Sun pose on your washing

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.960 
replace the Sun pose on your washing
machine<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:34.040> procedure<00:00:34.430> I'm<00:00:34.580> going<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.880> be

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
machine the procedure I'm going to be

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.970 
machine the procedure I'm going to be
using<00:00:35.330> is<00:00:35.510> for<00:00:35.810> a<00:00:35.840> washing<00:00:36.200> machine<00:00:36.500> without<00:00:36.740> a

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
using is for a washing machine without a

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.380 
using is for a washing machine without a
baseplate<00:00:37.490> and<00:00:37.670> it's<00:00:38.000> relatively

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
baseplate and it's relatively

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.660 
baseplate and it's relatively
straightforward<00:00:38.780> but<00:00:39.620> if<00:00:39.800> your<00:00:39.920> machine<00:00:40.280> does

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
straightforward but if your machine does

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.400 
straightforward but if your machine does
have<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.910> baseplate<00:00:41.329> the<00:00:41.840> procedure<00:00:42.200> is<00:00:42.379> a

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
have a baseplate the procedure is a

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.959 
have a baseplate the procedure is a
little<00:00:42.710> bit<00:00:42.800> different<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.309> you<00:00:43.370> can<00:00:43.610> see<00:00:43.850> me

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
little bit different and you can see me

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.959 
little bit different and you can see me
doing<00:00:44.120> that<00:00:44.239> in<00:00:44.539> another<00:00:44.840> espares<00:00:45.110> video<00:00:45.969> the

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
doing that in another espares video the

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.470 
doing that in another espares video the
machine<00:00:47.270> I'm<00:00:47.390> using<00:00:47.600> is<00:00:47.840> an<00:00:48.199> LG<00:00:48.440> WM<00:00:49.370> 1<00:00:49.760> treble<00:00:50.180> 2

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
machine I'm using is an LG WM 1 treble 2

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.380 
machine I'm using is an LG WM 1 treble 2
5<00:00:50.930> FD<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:51.859> obviously<00:00:52.430> it's<00:00:52.670> very<00:00:52.879> important

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
5 FD and obviously it's very important

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.029 
5 FD and obviously it's very important
that<00:00:53.510> if<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.750> are<00:00:53.780> replacing<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.620> Sun<00:00:54.800> pose

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
that if you are replacing the Sun pose

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.979 
that if you are replacing the Sun pose
you<00:00:55.430> do<00:00:55.640> have<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:55.940> correct<00:00:56.210> spare<00:00:56.600> part<00:00:56.899> for

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
you do have the correct spare part for

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.259 
you do have the correct spare part for
it<00:00:57.320> and<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.949> procedure<00:00:58.340> is<00:00:58.579> largely<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.239> same

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
it and the procedure is largely the same

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.330 
it and the procedure is largely the same
for<00:00:59.840> most<00:00:59.989> makes<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:00.620> models<00:01:00.949> of<00:01:01.160> washing

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
for most makes and models of washing

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.520 
for most makes and models of washing
machine<00:01:01.699> now<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:02.719> important<00:01:03.079> to<00:01:03.140> point<00:01:03.289> out

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
machine now it's important to point out

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.439 
machine now it's important to point out
that<00:01:03.769> we<00:01:04.190> are<00:01:04.220> actually<00:01:04.430> going<00:01:04.699> to<00:01:04.760> be<00:01:04.820> turning

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
that we are actually going to be turning

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.840 
that we are actually going to be turning
the<00:01:05.540> machine<00:01:05.840> onto<00:01:06.440> its<00:01:06.620> side<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.460> we<00:01:07.670> need<00:01:07.700> to

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
the machine onto its side so we need to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.460 
the machine onto its side so we need to
make<00:01:07.970> sure<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.330> there's<00:01:08.480> no<00:01:08.600> water<00:01:08.990> left<00:01:09.290> in

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
make sure that there's no water left in

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.499 
make sure that there's no water left in
it<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.100> way<00:01:10.220> you<00:01:10.280> can<00:01:10.460> do<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:10.759> is<00:01:11.150> by<00:01:11.299> putting

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
it the way you can do that is by putting

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.370 
it the way you can do that is by putting
the<00:01:11.630> machine<00:01:11.750> onto<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.380> spin<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.100> drain<00:01:13.490> cycle

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
the machine onto a spin and drain cycle

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.800 
the machine onto a spin and drain cycle
then<00:01:15.380> once<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:15.740> finished<00:01:15.920> just<00:01:16.570> take<00:01:17.570> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
then once it's finished just take the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.749 
then once it's finished just take the
dispenser<00:01:18.500> drawer<00:01:18.619> out<00:01:18.740> and<00:01:19.070> check<00:01:19.610> there's

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
dispenser drawer out and check there's

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.480 
dispenser drawer out and check there's
no<00:01:19.850> water<00:01:20.090> in<00:01:20.330> there<00:01:20.479> as<00:01:20.630> well<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.100> then<00:01:22.100> if<00:01:22.310> we

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
no water in there as well and then if we

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.670 
no water in there as well and then if we
open<00:01:22.759> up<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:23.000> filter<00:01:23.780> flap<00:01:24.110> at<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.320> front

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
open up the filter flap at the front

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.510 
open up the filter flap at the front
here<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:26.049> can<00:01:27.049> empty<00:01:27.259> out<00:01:27.439> any<00:01:27.619> last<00:01:27.890> remnants

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
here you can empty out any last remnants

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.210 
here you can empty out any last remnants
of<00:01:28.610> water<00:01:28.850> in<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.180> machine<00:01:29.290> via<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.590> filter

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
of water in the machine via the filter

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.130 
of water in the machine via the filter
drain<00:01:31.640> hose<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.119> you<00:01:32.240> just<00:01:32.420> empty<00:01:32.780> that<00:01:32.900> into

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
drain hose and you just empty that into

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.789 
drain hose and you just empty that into
a<00:01:33.170> cup<00:01:33.470> or<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.710> saucepan<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.990> while<00:01:36.439> we're<00:01:36.590> down

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
a cup or a saucepan and while we're down

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.639 
a cup or a saucepan and while we're down
here<00:01:37.159> it's<00:01:37.369> also<00:01:37.610> worth<00:01:38.299> just<00:01:38.930> checking<00:01:39.020> the

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
here it's also worth just checking the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.649 
here it's also worth just checking the
filter<00:01:41.140> for<00:01:42.140> any<00:01:42.290> debris<00:01:42.619> that<00:01:43.100> might<00:01:43.340> be

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
filter for any debris that might be

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.280 
filter for any debris that might be
collected<00:01:44.659> in<00:01:44.780> there<00:01:45.430> as<00:01:46.430> well<00:01:46.689> ok<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:47.720> now<00:01:48.229> the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
collected in there as well ok so now the

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.350 
collected in there as well ok so now the
machine<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:48.649> empty<00:01:48.979> of<00:01:49.250> any<00:01:49.340> water<00:01:49.640> I<00:01:49.939> need<00:01:50.180> to

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
machine is empty of any water I need to

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.179 
machine is empty of any water I need to
disconnect<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:51.049> from<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.259> water<00:01:51.530> supply<00:01:51.770> and

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
disconnect it from the water supply and
