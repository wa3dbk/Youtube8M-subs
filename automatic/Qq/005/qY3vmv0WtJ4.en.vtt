00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
gluten

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.910 
gluten
it<00:00:33.000> looks<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.239> relaxed<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:33.960> me<00:00:33.989> yes<00:00:35.329> and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.810 
it looks very relaxed to me yes and
we're<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> give<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> little

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
we're just going to give it a little

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.410 
we're just going to give it a little
stir

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
stir

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.910 
stir
because<00:00:39.750> there<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:39.989> been<00:00:40.020> some<00:00:40.379> settling<00:00:40.800> I

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
because there have been some settling I

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
because there have been some settling I
can<00:00:41.100> feel<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.820> tighter<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.360> bottom

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
can feel it's tighter on the bottom

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.709 
can feel it's tighter on the bottom
there<00:00:42.930> because<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.430> flour<00:00:44.670> tends<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.300> sink<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
there because the flour tends to sink to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.799 
there because the flour tends to sink to
the<00:00:45.809> bottom<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.110> water<00:00:46.289> rises<00:00:46.800> from<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> milk

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
the bottom the water rises from the milk

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.310 
the bottom the water rises from the milk
so<00:00:48.809> we're<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:48.989> bring<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> remix<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
so we're just bring it in so remix it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.779 
so we're just bring it in so remix it
and<00:00:52.500> there<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> should<00:00:53.579> look<00:00:53.730> like

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and there it is and it should look like

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
and there it is and it should look like
the<00:00:54.180> consistency<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.890> half-and-half<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.340> say

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
the consistency of half-and-half I say

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.180

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
okay because that is going to give us

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.480 
okay because that is going to give us
the<00:01:45.060> lacy<00:01:45.560> effect<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:46.979> on<00:01:47.369> these

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the lacy effect that we have on these

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.280 
the lacy effect that we have on these
see<00:01:47.670> little<00:01:48.000> holes<00:01:48.180> yes<00:01:48.540> that's<00:01:48.899> because<00:01:49.049> we

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
see little holes yes that's because we

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.600 
see little holes yes that's because we
got<00:01:49.409> our<00:01:49.500> temperature<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.340> our

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
got our temperature right and our

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.910
