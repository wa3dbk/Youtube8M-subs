00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
should hopefully show up and Odin as

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.830 
should hopefully show up and Odin as
being<00:03:41.459> recognized<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.419> can<00:03:42.540> see<00:03:42.659> that

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
being recognized and you can see that

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.119 
being recognized and you can see that
it's<00:03:42.989> there<00:03:43.199> so<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.500> drivers<00:03:43.859> will<00:03:44.009> be

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
it's there so the drivers will be

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.670 
it's there so the drivers will be
incorrectly<00:03:44.400> installed<00:03:44.729> and<00:03:45.409> the<00:03:46.409> phone<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
incorrectly installed and the phone is

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.499 
incorrectly installed and the phone is
talking<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.099> Odin<00:03:47.519> then<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.239> need<00:03:48.389> to

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
talking to Odin then you just need to

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.330 
talking to Odin then you just need to
simply<00:03:48.870> hit<00:03:49.409> the<00:03:49.439> start<00:03:49.799> button<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.189> what

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
simply hit the start button and what

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.770 
simply hit the start button and what
that's<00:03:50.519> going<00:03:50.699> to<00:03:50.759> do<00:03:50.909> is<00:03:51.060> install

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
that's going to do is install

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.110 
that's going to do is install
clockworkmod<00:03:52.409> recovery<00:03:52.439> on<00:03:52.949> your<00:03:53.129> phone<00:03:53.310> and

do is to power it off obviously we're

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.330 
do is to power it off obviously we're
going<00:04:16.469> to<00:04:16.560> longer<00:04:16.769> it's<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:16.949> power<00:04:17.099> button

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
going to longer it's the power button

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.699 
going to longer it's the power button

powered<00:04:22.289> down<00:04:22.500> then<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.760> time<00:04:23.940> we're<00:04:24.120> going

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
powered down then this time we're going

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.580 
powered down then this time we're going
to<00:04:24.389> need<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.659> boot<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:24.990> phone<00:04:25.199> into<00:04:25.560> recovery

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
to need to boot the phone into recovery

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.930 
to need to boot the phone into recovery
mode<00:04:26.250> rather

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
mode rather

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.730

than<00:04:27.090> download<00:04:27.510> mode<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:28.440> actually<00:04:28.710> very

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
than download mode it's actually very

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.170 
than download mode it's actually very
similar<00:04:29.070> process<00:04:29.550> except<00:04:29.880> we're<00:04:29.970> going<00:04:30.090> to

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
similar process except we're going to

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.780 
similar process except we're going to
hold<00:04:30.360> volume<00:04:30.660> up<00:04:31.080> at<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.860> same<00:04:32.010> time<00:04:32.280> as<00:04:32.550> we

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
hold volume up at the same time as we

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.060 
hold volume up at the same time as we
hold<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.450> home<00:04:34.020> button<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.560> then<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.860> power

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
hold the home button and then the power

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.190 
hold the home button and then the power
button<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.520> can<00:04:35.700> see<00:04:35.850> I'm<00:04:36.000> just<00:04:36.270> getting

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
button so you can see I'm just getting

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.840 
button so you can see I'm just getting
positioned<00:04:37.680> depress<00:04:38.100> all<00:04:38.250> three<00:04:38.490> buttons

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
positioned depress all three buttons

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.810 
positioned depress all three buttons
simultaneously<00:04:39.180> now<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:41.610> phone<00:04:41.790> is

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
simultaneously now and the phone is

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.220 
simultaneously now and the phone is
going<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.090> boot<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.720> should<00:04:42.960> go<00:04:43.080> into

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
going to boot and it should go into

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.780 
going to boot and it should go into
clockworkmod<00:04:43.680> recovery<00:04:43.890> which<00:04:44.460> we've<00:04:44.610> just

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
clockworkmod recovery which we've just

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.930 
clockworkmod recovery which we've just
flashed<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.390> there<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:45.960> okay<00:04:46.670> once<00:04:47.670> we're

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
flashed and there it is okay once we're

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.640 
flashed and there it is okay once we're
in<00:04:48.060> clockworkmod<00:04:48.750> recovery<00:04:48.780> things<00:04:49.440> are<00:04:49.560> very

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
in clockworkmod recovery things are very

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.080 
in clockworkmod recovery things are very
straightforward<00:04:50.220> you<00:04:50.280> never<00:04:50.460> get<00:04:50.610> with<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
straightforward you never get with the

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.360 
straightforward you never get with the
volume<00:04:51.300> keys<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:51.960> use<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.770> home<00:04:52.950> button<00:04:53.160> to

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
volume keys and use the home button to

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.250 
volume keys and use the home button to
select<00:04:53.550> things<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.060> we<00:04:54.180> need<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.450> go<00:04:54.630> to

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
select things so we need to go to

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.690 
select things so we need to go to
install<00:04:55.620> zip<00:04:55.950> from<00:04:56.010> card<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:58.580> then<00:04:59.580> we<00:04:59.670> need

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
install zip from card and then we need

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.970 
install zip from card and then we need
to<00:04:59.880> go<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.300> choose<00:05:00.660> zip<00:05:00.930> from<00:05:01.110> internal<00:05:01.470> SD

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
to go to choose zip from internal SD

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.790 
to go to choose zip from internal SD
card<00:05:02.250> that's<00:05:02.460> where<00:05:02.670> we<00:05:02.790> saved<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:04.380> superuser

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
card that's where we saved the superuser

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.350 
card that's where we saved the superuser
file<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.460> earlier<00:05:07.430> select<00:05:08.430> super<00:05:08.850> user<00:05:09.060> there

file to earlier select super user there

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.440 
file to earlier select super user there
and<00:05:10.520> then<00:05:11.520> go<00:05:11.640> through<00:05:11.790> the<00:05:11.820> confirmation

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
and then go through the confirmation

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.740 
and then go through the confirmation
screen<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:13.080> flash<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:13.350> to<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.740> phone<00:05:13.950> and<00:05:14.750> it's

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
screen to flash it to the phone and it's

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.270 
screen to flash it to the phone and it's
going<00:05:15.870> to<00:05:15.930> take<00:05:16.080> just<00:05:16.290> a<00:05:16.350> few<00:05:16.380> seconds<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:17.010> do

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
going to take just a few seconds to do

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.150 
going to take just a few seconds to do
that<00:05:17.490> all<00:05:17.760> going<00:05:17.970> well<00:05:18.240> and<00:05:19.040> yet<00:05:20.040> that's

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
that all going well and yet that's

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.360 
that all going well and yet that's
already<00:05:20.430> finished<00:05:20.910> so<00:05:21.450> now<00:05:21.720> we've<00:05:22.050> got

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
already finished so now we've got

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.260 
already finished so now we've got

phone flashed with odin on the computer
side<00:05:26.430> and<00:05:26.700> now<00:05:27.270> we've<00:05:27.540> installed<00:05:27.930> super<00:05:28.530> user

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620

side and now we've installed super user
using<00:05:29.280> clockworkmod<00:05:29.760> recovery<00:05:30.740> so<00:05:31.740> this<00:05:32.610> is

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
using clockworkmod recovery so this is

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.490 
using clockworkmod recovery so this is
the<00:05:32.880> acid<00:05:33.180> test<00:05:33.270> of<00:05:33.419> course<00:05:33.690> we<00:05:34.230> need<00:05:34.380> to

the acid test of course we need to

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.470 
the acid test of course we need to
reboot<00:05:34.800> the<00:05:34.980> phone<00:05:35.160> now<00:05:35.400> and<00:05:35.430> we<00:05:36.300> should

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
reboot the phone now and we should

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.590 
reboot the phone now and we should
hopefully<00:05:36.750> find<00:05:37.200> that<00:05:37.380> super<00:05:37.680> user

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
hopefully find that super user

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.940 
hopefully find that super user
