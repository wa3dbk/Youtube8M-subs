 Baked pancakes with meringue 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Will be needed: 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 flour, sugar, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 milk, brandy, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 apples, 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 peach, 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 eggs, butter. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 Now, first, we'll make caramel, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 we will cut the apples 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 in small pieces, 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 półcentymetrowe. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 We put a pot on fire. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Here we have stuffing, 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 sugar, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 1-2 tablespoons per person, 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 01:07 For caramel. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Now the sugar begins to dissolve. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 Now apples. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 A little milk or cream. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Boil. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 And we add a bit of cognac to taste. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 Cook apples and peach until tender. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 We will make a cake now. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Cake: 1 tablespoon of sugar, 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 now we will only add yolks to the dough. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 The proteins will be used to prepare the meringue. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 Mix. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 We add milk to the dough. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 Now we're starting to fry pancakes. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 And a little butter. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
 Now we will slaughter the protein from 4 eggs and two tablespoons of sugar. 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 Apples and peaches. 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Pancake now. 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
