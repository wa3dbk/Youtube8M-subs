00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.149 
and I just thought that this would be a
lot<00:02:01.450> better<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.869> bring<00:02:02.049> in<00:02:02.170> my<00:02:02.290> backpack<00:02:02.500> okay

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
lot better to bring in my backpack okay

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.219 
lot better to bring in my backpack okay
