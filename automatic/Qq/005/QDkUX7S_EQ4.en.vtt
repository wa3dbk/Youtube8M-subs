00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.180
 my dear there 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.559
 then to our little conversation of the asca who receives 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.389
 saying he wants 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.129
 for his part was nicolas sirkis 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.919
 at the same time you told me you were not able so 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.919
 it's just for whom for whom 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:19.859
 I am still able to do 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.859
 with eight others 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.759
 so the song c 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.759
 third sex 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.550
 third sex is made up of men since their agreement 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.480
 killer 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.130
 of the ground 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.330
 of the 6 miners 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.220
 F sharp minor 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.240
 back 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.310
 a minor 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.530
 of the laminator 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.530
 and that's all 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.540
 m 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.409
 kapo 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.409
 castro 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.080
 a soil 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.620
 - What is it 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.710
 so the site of the ol 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.710
 the zardari cevenol in second 15 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.140
 and we are 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.890
 the major 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.890
 on the second body from the bottom 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 and the other two must actually on the side boxes just above 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 so that that make up 6 billion 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.039
 after at the other side a little less short also for mans both fingers 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.250
 2 a rope 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.500
 and do not place the middle finger 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 and what we do we will not get 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.210
 montagnier seminar 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.780
 these compounds in couple 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.240
 for several months in several couples and child 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.830
 it will turn 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.089
 on the same chords 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:09.889
 so in a first sign 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.339
 in the street 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.430
 and all the chains 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.150
 rarely baptized 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.929
 like a movie we know 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.289
 and that's seven years on the three agreements 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.289
 on the four agreements 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.229
 and every bit of field 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.680
 So that's what it takes on their very first verse 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.169
 until 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.209
 the outraged but I have nothing to do 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.549
 but so part-time the first time 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.679
 the first chorus that is rare 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:52.499
 so that starts with% we actually stay on the back note of I have nothing to 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:53.409
 make 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.749
 so that's an illusion 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.819
 vigo chipman 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.569
 millar 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.569
 leader among the eight do not forget - 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.470
 so there the best 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.309
 most of 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:10.929
 the English 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.329
 and I like it 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.219
 therefore only 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.379
 the rondo have disappointed fifteen years 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:20.589
 Kyodo 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:24.499
 the region only one that is what for the losc and compose the first chorus 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.029
 so much the two parts components 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:30.279
 and therefore to teach the second part to women 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.919
 and to take care of themselves so their share on a minor 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.709
 at least a year 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.709
 my name 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.859
 guillaume durand 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.929
 so that's it 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.929
 king by car 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.709
 it's because of it 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.599
 and so after we have all the other couples that follow 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.049
 e 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.089
 visas a buyer of the unemployed tomorrow ben it's the same we resume 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.819
 still so on the only one at 1 6 billion is about to go 25th 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:15.889
 minor 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.440
 for the more friendly bayamon technique it's my favorite people in order to 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.729
 go out 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.729
 so these offers it's the attacker 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.680
 so it's okay it's all the time like that 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.259
 boeing 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.599
 a little rotten tutorial 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.330
 the right gesture to get out and especially I hope I can 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.770
 hear them 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.669
 on the deep good I'm going to ask with their underwear because I'm not 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.669
 certain that the explanations are good 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:46.520
