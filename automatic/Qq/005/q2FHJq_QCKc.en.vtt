00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
I think the Michigan marching band

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.979 
I think the Michigan marching band
brings<00:02:57.320> everybody<00:02:57.650> together<00:02:58.000> no<00:02:59.000> matter<00:02:59.239> if

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
it's an all the long or a young student

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.540 
it's an all the long or a young student
or<00:03:02.540> even<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.989> young<00:03:03.140> child<00:03:03.440> everybody<00:03:04.280> can<00:03:04.400> get

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
or even a young child everybody can get

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.420 
or even a young child everybody can get
behind<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.970> marching<00:03:05.330> band<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:07.010> need<00:03:07.070> to<00:03:07.250> be
