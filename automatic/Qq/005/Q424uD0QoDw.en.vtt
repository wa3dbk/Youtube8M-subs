today<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.320> science<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.889> have<00:00:10.969> monumental

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
today in science we have monumental

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.879 
today in science we have monumental
scientists<00:00:12.600> that<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:12.959> think<00:00:13.290> about<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
scientists that we think about in the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.830 
scientists that we think about in the
Pantheon's<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.850> greatest<00:00:15.240> scientists<00:00:15.780> in

Pantheon's of the greatest scientists in
the<00:00:15.929> world's<00:00:16.380> and<00:00:16.529> there<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:16.740> people<00:00:17.040> like

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the world's and there are people like

of people include Charles Darwin in

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.109 
of people include Charles Darwin in
there<00:00:23.610> well<00:00:24.540> Charles<00:00:25.110> Darwin<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:26.279> worthy<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
there well Charles Darwin is worthy of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.389 
there well Charles Darwin is worthy of
certain<00:00:27.480> praise<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.259> worthy<00:00:28.770> of<00:00:29.130> certain

certain praise and worthy of certain
critical<00:00:29.820> awareness<00:00:30.059> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> other<00:00:30.899> side<00:00:31.169> as

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
critical awareness on the other side as

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.250 
critical awareness on the other side as
well<00:00:31.739> that<00:00:31.980> he's<00:00:32.520> not<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.180> god<00:00:33.630> that's<00:00:34.079> up

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
well that he's not that god that's up

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.319 
well that he's not that god that's up
there<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.890> he<00:00:34.980> did<00:00:35.280> make<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> most<00:00:35.880> profound

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
there but he did make the most profound

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.840 
there but he did make the most profound
contribution<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.460> what<00:00:38.460> Charles<00:00:38.820> Darwin

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
contribution because what Charles Darwin

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.810 
contribution because what Charles Darwin
did<00:00:39.420> was<00:00:40.260> write<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.309> concept<00:00:41.760> of

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
did was write up the concept of

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.430 
did was write up the concept of
evolution<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.510> such<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> way<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.019> the<00:00:43.320> average

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
evolution in such a way that the average

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.279 
evolution in such a way that the average
person<00:00:43.859> could<00:00:44.699> say<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.120> let<00:00:45.960> me<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
person could say well let me see that

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.619 
person could say well let me see that
sounds<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> far<00:00:47.519> better<00:00:47.760> idea<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.390> how

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
sounds like a far better idea of how

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
sounds like a far better idea of how
humans<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.980> planet<00:00:50.010> got<00:00:50.519> into<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
humans and the planet got into the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.720 
humans and the planet got into the
situation<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:52.170> than<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.399> old<00:00:53.609> version

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
situation it is now than the old version

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.649 
situation it is now than the old version
of<00:00:54.210> Genesis<00:00:54.839> so<00:00:55.620> Charles<00:00:56.429> Darwin<00:00:57.059> offered<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
of Genesis so Charles Darwin offered a

00:00:57.659 --> 00:00:59.899 
of Genesis so Charles Darwin offered a
scientific<00:00:58.350> understanding<00:00:59.249> that<00:00:59.429> was

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
scientific understanding that was

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.910 
scientific understanding that was
available<00:01:00.179> to<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> people<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.350> he<00:01:01.499> wrote<00:01:01.769> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
available to the people so he wrote it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.719 
available to the people so he wrote it
at<00:01:02.159> that<00:01:02.339> level<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.650> yet<00:01:04.650> he<00:01:04.920> also<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.550> doing

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
at that level and yet he also in doing

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
at that level and yet he also in doing
that<00:01:06.090> helped<00:01:06.600> helped<00:01:07.470> us<00:01:07.590> evolve<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
that helped helped us evolve from a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.270 
that helped helped us evolve from a
church<00:01:09.300> run<00:01:09.630> world<00:01:09.900> into<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.470> world<00:01:10.770> based<00:01:11.040> more

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
church run world into a world based more

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.830 
church run world into a world based more
on<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.460> scientific<00:01:12.120> understanding<00:01:12.300> of<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
on a scientific understanding of the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.860 
on a scientific understanding of the
universe<00:01:13.040> well<00:01:14.040> he<00:01:14.220> did<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.730> he<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.210> put<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
universe well he did that he also put a

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.270 
universe well he did that he also put a
bias<00:01:16.200> into<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.800> situation<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> really

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
bias into the situation that is really

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
bias into the situation that is really
slanted<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.550> way<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.060> look<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> world<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
slanted the way we look at the world and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.280 
slanted the way we look at the world and
how<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.290> fit<00:01:22.740> into<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.220> first<00:01:23.910> of<00:01:24.060> all<00:01:24.290> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
how we fit into it first of all the

how we fit into it first of all the
theory<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> evolution<00:01:26.040> was<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> theory<00:01:27.060> by

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
theory of evolution was a theory by

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.350 
theory of evolution was a theory by
Lamarck<00:01:28.260> jean-baptiste<00:01:29.220> even<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.030> from

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
Lamarck jean-baptiste even one from

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.900 
Lamarck jean-baptiste even one from
France<00:01:30.660> he<00:01:31.470> wrote<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.830> 50<00:01:32.280> years<00:01:32.550> before

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
France he wrote it 50 years before

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.890 
France he wrote it 50 years before
Darwin<00:01:33.330> it<00:01:33.870> is<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.170> first<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.710> most<00:01:35.310> valid

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
Darwin it is the first and most valid

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
Darwin it is the first and most valid
understanding<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.990> evolutionist<00:01:37.970> process

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
understanding of evolutionist process

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.440 
understanding of evolutionist process
that<00:01:39.930> was<00:01:40.200> scientifically<00:01:40.920> published<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that was scientifically published so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.690 
that was scientifically published so
when<00:01:42.720> Darwin<00:01:43.080> got<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:43.950> he<00:01:44.400> didn't

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
when Darwin got in there he didn't

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.180 
when Darwin got in there he didn't
introduce<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:46.050> concept<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.590> evolution<00:01:47.070> he

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
introduce the concept of evolution he

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.400 
introduce the concept of evolution he
was<00:01:47.340> trying<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.730> introduce<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.450> mechanism<00:01:49.230> of

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
was trying to introduce a mechanism of

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.620 
was trying to introduce a mechanism of
how<00:01:49.980> evolution<00:01:50.250> occurred<00:01:50.910> that<00:01:51.480> were

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
how evolution occurred that were

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.490 
how evolution occurred that were
different<00:01:51.930> from<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.440> one<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:52.980> Lamarck

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
different from the one that Lamarck

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.780 
different from the one that Lamarck
presumably<00:01:55.500> said<00:01:55.800> how<00:01:56.010> evolution<00:01:56.520> occurred

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
presumably said how evolution occurred

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.690 
presumably said how evolution occurred
and<00:01:57.150> so<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.960> say<00:01:58.080> ok<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.410> what<00:01:58.740> was<00:01:58.920> darwin's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and so we say ok so what was darwin's

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.730 
and so we say ok so what was darwin's
contribution<00:02:00.270> not<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.810> theory<00:02:01.080> of<00:02:01.110> evolution

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
contribution not the theory of evolution

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.660 
contribution not the theory of evolution
it<00:02:02.460> was<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.940> theory<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.660> this<00:02:04.670> competition

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
it was the theory of this competition

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.270 
it was the theory of this competition
and<00:02:05.850> struggle<00:02:06.660> for<00:02:06.840> survival<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.680> evolution

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
and struggle for survival that evolution

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.309 
and struggle for survival that evolution
is<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.640> there's<00:02:09.060> an<00:02:09.269> ongoing<00:02:09.450> struggle<00:02:10.019> for

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
is a there's an ongoing struggle for

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.979 
is a there's an ongoing struggle for
fitness<00:02:10.560> okay<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.760> was<00:02:12.060> how<00:02:12.300> he<00:02:12.360> said<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.750> was

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
fitness okay that was how he said it was

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.809 
fitness okay that was how he said it was
driven<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.530> that<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.160> came<00:02:14.459> into<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
driven and that was what came into the

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.599 
driven and that was what came into the
world<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.300> we<00:02:15.659> go<00:02:15.810> back<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.140> say<00:02:16.260> well<00:02:16.609> where

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
world so we go back and say well where

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.280 
world so we go back and say well where
so<00:02:17.879> I'll<00:02:17.999> come<00:02:18.150> down<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.450> said<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.870> theory

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
so I'll come down to I said the theory

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.280 
so I'll come down to I said the theory
of<00:02:19.319> evolution

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
of evolution

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.360 
of evolution
was<00:02:20.709> provided<00:02:21.280> by<00:02:21.310> Lamarck<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:22.239> more<00:02:23.370> natural

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
was provided by Lamarck a more natural

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.009 
was provided by Lamarck a more natural
understanding<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> processes<00:02:25.840> of

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
understanding of the processes of

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.809 
understanding of the processes of
evolution<00:02:26.140> were<00:02:26.739> introduced<00:02:27.310> by<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.519> man

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
evolution were introduced by a man

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.119 
evolution were introduced by a man
called<00:02:27.969> Alfred<00:02:28.420> Russel<00:02:28.810> Wallace<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.439> he

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
called Alfred Russel Wallace and he

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.069 
called Alfred Russel Wallace and he
wrote<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> paper<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.909> the<00:02:31.599> thing<00:02:31.810> called

wrote a paper on the thing called

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.679 
wrote a paper on the thing called
natural<00:02:32.620> selection<00:02:33.189> and<00:02:33.370> he<00:02:34.150> sent<00:02:34.480> this

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
natural selection and he sent this

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.259 
natural selection and he sent this
manuscript<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.680> Charles<00:02:36.069> Darwin<00:02:36.280> who<00:02:36.760> had

manuscript that Charles Darwin who had

manuscript that Charles Darwin who had
been<00:02:37.420> working<00:02:37.629> on<00:02:37.989> some<00:02:38.290> idea<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.920> theory<00:02:39.220> of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
been working on some idea of a theory of

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.250 
been working on some idea of a theory of
evolution<00:02:39.459> but<00:02:39.909> and<00:02:40.030> really<00:02:40.359> have<00:02:40.480> never<00:02:40.689> come

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
evolution but and really have never come

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.199 
evolution but and really have never come
down<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.680> point<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:42.159> commitment<00:02:42.760> to

down to a point of commitment to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.780 
down to a point of commitment to
actually<00:02:43.689> say<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> what<00:02:44.829> it's<00:02:45.010> all<00:02:45.159> about

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
actually say this is what it's all about

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.849 
actually say this is what it's all about
so<00:02:46.209> Darwin's<00:02:46.930> working<00:02:47.379> on<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.500> theory<00:02:47.829> of

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
so Darwin's working on a theory of

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.910 
so Darwin's working on a theory of
evolution<00:02:48.579> Wallace<00:02:49.480> sends<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.260> theory<00:02:50.829> of

evolution Wallace sends a theory of

evolution Wallace sends a theory of
evolution<00:02:51.159> and<00:02:51.810> he<00:02:52.810> writes<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.170> note<00:02:53.349> saying<00:02:53.650> to

evolution and he writes a note saying to

evolution and he writes a note saying to

when Darwin received this he broke down

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.360 
when Darwin received this he broke down
he<00:03:04.989> had<00:03:05.079> a<00:03:05.109> motional<00:03:05.620> Brook<00:03:05.829> break<00:03:06.189> down

they<00:04:01.329> entered<00:04:01.540> into<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.199> that<00:04:02.290> is<00:04:02.470> Darwin<00:04:03.040> and

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
they entered into and that is Darwin and

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.460 
they entered into and that is Darwin and
Lyell<00:04:04.180> entered<00:04:04.599> into<00:04:04.930> what<00:04:05.079> was<00:04:05.199> called<00:04:05.349> the

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
Lyell entered into what was called the

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.589 
Lyell entered into what was called the
delicate<00:04:05.889> arrangement<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:06.909> what<00:04:07.180> they<00:04:07.329> did

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
delicate arrangement and what they did

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.050 
delicate arrangement and what they did
is<00:04:08.019> they<00:04:08.079> changed<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.949> priority<00:04:09.729> of<00:04:09.939> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
is they changed the priority of the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.110 
is they changed the priority of the
paper<00:04:10.329> by<00:04:10.659> saying<00:04:10.989> that<00:04:11.349> Darwin<00:04:12.250> also<00:04:12.489> has<00:04:13.090> a

paper on the theory of evolution which

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.029 
paper on the theory of evolution which
he<00:04:15.099> didn't<00:04:15.430> have<00:04:15.609> so<00:04:16.419> they<00:04:16.870> reported<00:04:17.739> at<00:04:17.889> the

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
he didn't have so they reported at the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
they would say that this was Darwin's

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.550 
they would say that this was Darwin's
work<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.570> say<00:04:38.720> well<00:04:38.900> why<00:04:39.050> is<00:04:39.080> all<00:04:39.410> this

work you say well why is all this

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.440

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.600 
important at some point well number one
it<00:04:41.750> gives<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:42.290> emphasis<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:42.889> Darwin's

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
it gives the emphasis that Darwin's

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.670 
it gives the emphasis that Darwin's
point<00:04:44.000> of<00:04:44.150> view<00:04:44.830> becomes<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.130> selected<00:04:47.680> point

point of view becomes the selected point

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.860 
point of view becomes the selected point
of<00:04:48.860> evolution<00:04:49.550> for<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:49.910> masses<00:04:50.389> because<00:04:50.570> he

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
of evolution for the masses because he

evolution I don't know there's that old

different things - which way you look at

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.120 
different things - which way you look at
it<00:05:02.510> well<00:05:03.320> what's<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.680> difference<00:05:03.800> between

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
it well what's the difference between

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.300 
it well what's the difference between
the<00:05:04.700> darwin<00:05:05.210> version<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:05.960> Wallace's<00:05:06.710> theory

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
the darwin version of Wallace's theory

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.640 
the darwin version of Wallace's theory
and<00:05:07.490> Wallace's<00:05:08.240> version<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:09.110> difference<00:05:09.470> is

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
and Wallace's version the difference is

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.409 
and Wallace's version the difference is
think<00:05:10.220> about<00:05:10.460> living<00:05:10.669> in<00:05:10.940> either<00:05:11.180> of<00:05:11.389> two

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
struggle to survive and the only way you

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.780 
struggle to survive and the only way you
can<00:05:17.120> survive<00:05:17.360> is<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.320> be<00:05:18.770> in<00:05:18.979> this<00:05:19.250> competition

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
can survive is to be in this competition

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.570 
can survive is to be in this competition
for<00:05:20.330> fitness<00:05:20.600> and<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.560> worst<00:05:21.860> winners<00:05:22.370> and

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
for fitness and the worst winners and

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.610 
for fitness and the worst winners and
there's<00:05:22.729> losers<00:05:22.820> and<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.750> so<00:05:24.200> you're<00:05:24.380> out

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
there's losers and and so you're out

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.379 
there's losers and and so you're out
there<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.979> survive<00:05:25.430> every<00:05:25.669> day<00:05:25.940> you're<00:05:26.180> in<00:05:26.300> a

there to survive every day you're in a

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:28.030 
there to survive every day you're in a
rat<00:05:26.630> race<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.200> you've<00:05:27.320> got<00:05:27.440> to<00:05:27.530> go<00:05:27.620> out<00:05:27.770> there

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
rat race and you've got to go out there

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.740 
rat race and you've got to go out there
because<00:05:28.220> if<00:05:28.520> you<00:05:28.669> don't<00:05:28.850> do<00:05:29.060> it<00:05:29.090> somebody<00:05:29.450> else

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
because if you don't do it somebody else

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.290 
because if you don't do it somebody else
is<00:05:29.870> gonna<00:05:30.020> beat<00:05:30.290> you<00:05:30.470> and<00:05:30.620> you're<00:05:30.770> gonna<00:05:30.860> die

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
is gonna beat you and you're gonna die

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.230 
is gonna beat you and you're gonna die
world<00:05:32.300> one<00:05:32.570> world<00:05:33.470> two<00:05:33.820> and<00:05:34.820> this<00:05:34.970> is<00:05:35.150> the

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
world one world two and this is the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.560 
world one world two and this is the
world<00:05:35.450> of<00:05:35.660> Alfred<00:05:35.990> Russel<00:05:36.290> Wallace<00:05:36.320> and<00:05:36.860> said

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
world of Alfred Russel Wallace and said

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.150 
world of Alfred Russel Wallace and said
the<00:05:38.570> world<00:05:38.780> of<00:05:39.050> evolutions<00:05:39.590> based<00:05:39.860> on<00:05:40.039> the

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
the world of evolutions based on the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.640 
the world of evolutions based on the
elimination<00:05:40.669> of<00:05:40.789> the<00:05:40.910> weakest<00:05:41.440> and<00:05:42.440> so

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
elimination of the weakest and so

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.110 
elimination of the weakest and so
basically<00:05:42.950> says<00:05:43.220> if<00:05:43.370> you<00:05:43.460> live<00:05:43.640> in<00:05:43.760> that<00:05:43.940> world

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
basically says if you live in that world

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.750 
basically says if you live in that world
then<00:05:44.479> you<00:05:44.780> strive<00:05:45.289> not<00:05:45.710> to<00:05:45.770> be<00:05:46.100> the<00:05:46.280> weakest

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
then you strive not to be the weakest

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.640 
then you strive not to be the weakest
then<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.510> don't<00:05:47.660> have<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.870> be<00:05:47.960> in<00:05:48.050> competition

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
then you don't have to be in competition

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.680 
then you don't have to be in competition
with<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:48.950> many<00:05:49.070> others<00:05:49.370> because<00:05:49.729> the<00:05:50.360> it's

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
with so many others because the it's

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.390 
with so many others because the it's
only<00:05:50.870> you<00:05:51.440> just<00:05:51.650> don't<00:05:51.860> want<00:05:52.010> to<00:05:52.070> be<00:05:52.190> in<00:05:52.280> the

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
only you just don't want to be in the

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.310 
only you just don't want to be in the
last<00:05:52.580> couple<00:05:53.060> so<00:05:53.539> that<00:05:53.570> means<00:05:53.840> you<00:05:53.960> just<00:05:54.200> have

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
last couple so that means you just have

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.260 
last couple so that means you just have
to<00:05:54.470> work<00:05:54.620> yourself<00:05:55.010> off<00:05:55.130> a<00:05:55.250> bunch<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.610> a<00:05:55.850> couple

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
to work yourself off a bunch of a couple

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.390 
to work yourself off a bunch of a couple
of<00:05:56.390> people<00:05:56.539> rather<00:05:56.960> than<00:05:57.260> to<00:05:57.680> be<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:57.950> top<00:05:58.190> one

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
of people rather than to be the top one

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.370 
of people rather than to be the top one
in<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.610> entire<00:05:58.669> pile<00:05:59.150> so<00:05:59.750> I<00:05:59.780> said<00:06:00.020> well<00:06:00.169> which

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
in the entire pile so I said well which

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.290 
in the entire pile so I said well which
planet<00:06:00.919> would<00:06:01.039> you<00:06:01.130> like<00:06:01.280> to<00:06:01.400> live<00:06:01.550> on<00:06:01.700> the<00:06:01.910> one

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
planet would you like to live on the one

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.640 
planet would you like to live on the one
where<00:06:02.450> you<00:06:02.600> have<00:06:02.780> to<00:06:02.810> struggle<00:06:03.289> every<00:06:03.470> day<00:06:03.500> to

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
where you have to struggle every day to

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.100 
where you have to struggle every day to
be<00:06:03.860> on<00:06:03.979> the<00:06:04.100> top<00:06:04.310> of<00:06:04.460> the<00:06:04.520> pile<00:06:04.729> or<00:06:05.570> the<00:06:05.630> one

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
be on the top of the pile or the one

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.390 
be on the top of the pile or the one
where<00:06:06.320> every<00:06:06.500> day<00:06:06.650> is<00:06:06.680> all<00:06:07.039> you<00:06:07.070> have<00:06:07.220> to<00:06:07.340> make

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
where every day is all you have to make

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.070 
where every day is all you have to make
sure<00:06:07.520> is<00:06:07.880> is<00:06:08.060> you're<00:06:08.240> not<00:06:08.389> at<00:06:08.570> the<00:06:08.690> bottom<00:06:08.990> of

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
sure is is you're not at the bottom of

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.490 
sure is is you're not at the bottom of
the<00:06:09.139> pile

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
the pile

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.469 
the pile
and<00:06:10.310> you<00:06:10.400> see<00:06:10.580> well<00:06:10.880> that's<00:06:11.090> two<00:06:11.360> different

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
and you see well that's two different

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.409 
and you see well that's two different
worlds<00:06:11.870> and<00:06:12.500> we<00:06:13.130> live<00:06:13.340> in<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.789> Darwinian

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:14.419 
worlds and we live in the Darwinian

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.840 
worlds and we live in the Darwinian
version<00:06:14.810> world<00:06:15.050> and<00:06:15.260> that<00:06:15.979> Darwinian<00:06:16.490> version

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
version world and that Darwinian version

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.779 
version world and that Darwinian version
world<00:06:17.060> this<00:06:17.840> is<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.020> world<00:06:18.229> of<00:06:18.410> competition

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
world this is the world of competition

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.629 
world this is the world of competition
struggle<00:06:19.789> violence<00:06:20.389> war<00:06:20.750> all<00:06:21.260> as<00:06:21.770> part<00:06:22.190> of<00:06:22.460> a

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
struggle violence war all as part of a

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.969 
struggle violence war all as part of a
biological<00:06:23.389> necessity<00:06:23.930> for<00:06:24.139> evolution<00:06:24.620> and

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
biological necessity for evolution and

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:27.760 
biological necessity for evolution and
that<00:06:25.880> there's<00:06:26.120> an<00:06:26.240> upper<00:06:26.539> class<00:06:26.840> and<00:06:27.139> they're

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
that there's an upper class and they're

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.070 
that there's an upper class and they're
the<00:06:28.160> real<00:06:28.729> leaders<00:06:29.330> of<00:06:29.510> evolution<00:06:29.990> and

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
the real leaders of evolution and

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.590 
the real leaders of evolution and
everybody<00:06:30.500> else<00:06:30.710> is<00:06:31.190> the<00:06:31.250> feeder<00:06:31.940> layer<00:06:32.300> and

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:32.600 
everybody else is the feeder layer and

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.140 
everybody else is the feeder layer and
that<00:06:33.350> class<00:06:33.740> consciousness<00:06:34.460> and<00:06:34.850> all<00:06:34.940> that

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
that class consciousness and all that

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.610 
that class consciousness and all that
stuff<00:06:35.419> I<00:06:35.600> said<00:06:35.810> well<00:06:35.930> what<00:06:36.080> does<00:06:36.169> that<00:06:36.229> lead<00:06:36.590> to

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620 
stuff I said well what does that lead to

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.590 
stuff I said well what does that lead to
and<00:06:36.889> the<00:06:36.950> answer<00:06:37.280> is<00:06:37.400> you<00:06:37.910> take<00:06:38.120> tower<00:06:38.330> winning

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
and the answer is you take tower winning

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.690 
and the answer is you take tower winning
theory<00:06:38.990> you<00:06:39.380> make<00:06:39.530> scientific<00:06:39.919> principle<00:06:40.580> of

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
theory you make scientific principle of

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.790 
theory you make scientific principle of
out<00:06:41.090> of<00:06:41.270> this<00:06:41.450> theory<00:06:41.840> then<00:06:42.320> you<00:06:42.470> put<00:06:42.650> it<00:06:42.710> into

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
out of this theory then you put it into

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.710 
out of this theory then you put it into
political<00:06:43.130> action<00:06:43.460> and

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
political action and

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.190 
political action and
have<00:06:44.900> Nazi<00:06:45.470> Germany<00:06:45.860> and<00:06:46.480> that<00:06:47.480> is<00:06:47.750> what<00:06:48.050> you

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
have Nazi Germany and that is what you

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.520 
have Nazi Germany and that is what you
get<00:06:48.380> from<00:06:48.590> a<00:06:48.710> Darwinian<00:06:49.220> theory
