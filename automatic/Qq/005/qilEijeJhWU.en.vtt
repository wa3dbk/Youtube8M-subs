Endora it was Fire Blast now and then I
see<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.610> he's<00:01:11.729> faster<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:13.110> he<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
see that he's faster so now I know he is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820 
see that he's faster so now I know he is
scarfed<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> put<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.259> my<00:01:16.350> brain<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.650> I

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
scarfed so I put that in my brain and I

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.200 
scarfed so I put that in my brain and I
go<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.159> HP<00:01:17.580> fighting<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
go for HP fighting because you know it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.640 
go for HP fighting because you know it
seems<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.900> would<00:01:22.170> be<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.320> better<00:01:22.530> option

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
seems like that would be a better option

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.840 
seems like that would be a better option
than<00:01:23.040> any<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> other<00:01:23.759> HP's<00:01:24.330> uh<00:01:25.520> maybe<00:01:26.520> in

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
than any of the other HP's uh maybe in

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
than any of the other HP's uh maybe in
some<00:01:27.060> cases<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.829> most<00:01:28.950> cases

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
some cases I think I think in most cases

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.590 
some cases I think I think in most cases
after<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> bus<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.299> gonna<00:01:30.420> be

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
after you get the bus to it's gonna be

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.830 
after you get the bus to it's gonna be
really<00:01:30.810> good<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> bring<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> Shan<00:01:32.549> Dara<00:01:32.840> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
really good so I bring in Shan Dara to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.219
