00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
poisoning an enzyme system we're doing

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400 
poisoning an enzyme system we're doing
something<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.240> but<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.960> doesn't<00:02:42.260> stop

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
something like that but it doesn't stop

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.790 
something like that but it doesn't stop
the<00:02:42.800> process<00:02:43.100> that's<00:02:43.610> causing<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.330> problem

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
the process that's causing the problem

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.920 
the process that's causing the problem
so<00:02:45.800> that<00:02:45.950> doesn't<00:02:46.100> work<00:02:46.370> at<00:02:46.490> all<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.660> only

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
so that doesn't work at all the only

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.620 
so that doesn't work at all the only
thing<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.260> heals<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:50.480> body<00:02:52.630> and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
thing that heals is the body and

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.690 
thing that heals is the body and
anything<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.530> nature<00:02:54.830> does<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.340> know<00:02:55.370> if

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
anything in nature does that you know if

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.270 
anything in nature does that you know if
you<00:02:55.880> cut<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.210> tree<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.930> will<00:02:57.080> heal<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.740> if<00:02:58.130> a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
you cut a tree it will heal if you if a

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.460 
you cut a tree it will heal if you if a
dog<00:02:59.380> cut<00:03:00.380> so<00:03:00.980> healing<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.910> innate<00:03:02.360> part<00:03:03.260> of

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
dog cut so healing is innate part of

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.630 
dog cut so healing is innate part of
nature<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:05.320> all<00:03:06.320> nature<00:03:06.740> needs<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.340> know<00:03:07.460> if

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
nature and all nature needs you know if

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.890 
nature and all nature needs you know if
you're<00:03:07.790> going<00:03:07.910> to<00:03:07.970> make<00:03:08.180> anything<00:03:08.510> you<00:03:08.750> need

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
you're going to make anything you need

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.500 
you're going to make anything you need
three<00:03:09.140> things<00:03:09.170> you<00:03:09.590> need<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.580> plan<00:03:10.850> the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
three things you need the plan the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.930 
three things you need the plan the
blueprint<00:03:11.990> you<00:03:12.950> need<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.220> materials<00:03:13.760> and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
blueprint you need the materials and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.090 
blueprint you need the materials and
then<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.780> need<00:03:14.930> somebody<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.320> do<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.560> work<00:03:15.860> so

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
then you need somebody to do the work so

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.380 
then you need somebody to do the work so
if<00:03:16.160> you're<00:03:16.280> going<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.460> build<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.730> house<00:03:16.880> that's

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
if you're going to build a house that's

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.090 
if you're going to build a house that's
what<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.660> do<00:03:17.840> I'm<00:03:18.440> going<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.650> build<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.890> body

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
what you do I'm going to build a body

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.630 
what you do I'm going to build a body
you<00:03:19.940> need<00:03:20.170> blueprint<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.560> materials<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.190> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
you need blueprint the materials and the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.970 
you need blueprint the materials and the
energy<00:03:23.090> or<00:03:23.240> someone<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.600> do<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.530> blueprint

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
energy or someone to do so the blueprint

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.340 
energy or someone to do so the blueprint
exists<00:03:25.550> in<00:03:25.790> ourselves<00:03:25.910> it's<00:03:26.510> called<00:03:26.660> DNA<00:03:26.930> and

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
exists in ourselves it's called DNA and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.670 
exists in ourselves it's called DNA and
it<00:03:28.340> knows<00:03:28.520> what<00:03:28.730> it's<00:03:29.240> got<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.540> plan<00:03:29.720> all<00:03:30.440> it

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
it knows what it's got the plan all it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.760 
it knows what it's got the plan all it
needs<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.100> materials<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:32.480> do<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.930> the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
needs is the materials to do and the

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.480 
needs is the materials to do and the
body<00:03:34.010> is<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:35.320> very<00:03:36.320> nature<00:03:36.620> of<00:03:36.770> nature<00:03:37.040> is

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
body is the very nature of nature is

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:44.170 
body is the very nature of nature is
that<00:03:38.170> sells<00:03:39.790> leaves<00:03:41.800> everything<00:03:42.800> has<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> short

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
that sells leaves everything has a short

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.570 
that sells leaves everything has a short
cycle<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:44.900> it<00:03:45.230> gets<00:03:45.740> replaced<00:03:46.220> by<00:03:46.520> a<00:03:46.550> new

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
cycle in that it gets replaced by a new

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.060 
cycle in that it gets replaced by a new
one<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.060> get<00:03:47.150> replaced<00:03:47.510> by<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.690> new<00:03:47.780> one<00:03:48.070> okay

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
one and get replaced by a new one okay

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.110 
one and get replaced by a new one okay
so<00:03:49.760> regeneration<00:03:51.610> rejuvenation<00:03:52.610> and<00:03:52.760> then

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
so regeneration rejuvenation and then

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.410 
so regeneration rejuvenation and then
appropriation<00:03:53.960> which<00:03:54.170> is<00:03:55.330> keeping<00:03:56.330> the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
appropriation which is keeping the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.840 
appropriation which is keeping the
species<00:03:56.870> alive<00:03:57.110> is<00:03:57.380> what<00:03:58.010> nature<00:03:58.370> always<00:03:58.550> does

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
species alive is what nature always does

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.780 
species alive is what nature always does
so<00:03:59.420> all<00:03:59.630> you<00:03:59.810> have<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.140> do<00:04:00.290> is<00:04:00.590> provide<00:04:01.580> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
so all you have to do is provide the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.450 
so all you have to do is provide the
body<00:04:01.940> with<00:04:02.120> what<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.660> needs<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:03.290> do<00:04:04.190> what<00:04:04.340> it

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.460 
body with what it needs to do what it

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.870 
body with what it needs to do what it
will<00:04:04.580> do<00:04:04.730> okay<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.920> problem<00:04:07.340> is<00:04:07.459> we're<00:04:07.670> dirty

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
will do okay the problem is we're dirty

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.820 
will do okay the problem is we're dirty
we've<00:04:08.510> been<00:04:08.660> doing<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.020> wrong<00:04:09.200> thing<00:04:09.500> for<00:04:09.530> so

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
long it's like instead of a fresh stream

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.020 
long it's like instead of a fresh stream
with<00:04:14.330> nice<00:04:14.900> water<00:04:15.260> it's<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.680> pond<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.400> it's

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
with nice water it's a pond and it's

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.030 
with nice water it's a pond and it's
it's<00:04:17.510> dirty<00:04:17.780> yeah<00:04:18.200> and<00:04:18.470> you're<00:04:18.709> not<00:04:18.799> going<00:04:18.950> to

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
long so what we have to do is clean it

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.850 
long so what we have to do is clean it
first<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.160> when<00:04:25.850> we<00:04:25.940> clean<00:04:26.210> away<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.870> garbage

first and when we clean away the garbage

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.730 
first and when we clean away the garbage
the<00:04:28.820> toxins<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.970> body<00:04:32.150> starts<00:04:32.360> healing<00:04:33.199> right

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
the toxins the body starts healing right

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.000 
the toxins the body starts healing right
now<00:04:34.270> if<00:04:35.270> the<00:04:35.479> body<00:04:35.690> is<00:04:35.780> full<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.139> toxins<00:04:36.650> it's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
now if the body is full of toxins it's

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.980 
now if the body is full of toxins it's
being<00:04:37.220> surrounded<00:04:37.550> by<00:04:37.790> poisons<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:38.570> toxins

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
being surrounded by poisons and toxins

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.300 
being surrounded by poisons and toxins
all<00:04:39.169> the<00:04:39.320> cells<00:04:39.620> are<00:04:39.770> being<00:04:39.949> surrounded<00:04:40.160> by

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
all the cells are being surrounded by

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.909 
all the cells are being surrounded by
poisons<00:04:41.090> and<00:04:41.240> toxins<00:04:41.630> instead<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.440> doing<00:04:42.560> the

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
poisons and toxins instead of doing the

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.500 
poisons and toxins instead of doing the
work<00:04:43.130> that<00:04:43.370> they<00:04:43.520> would<00:04:43.760> do<00:04:43.940> like<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.180> liver

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
work that they would do like a liver

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.200 
work that they would do like a liver
cell<00:04:44.810> or<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.080> hard<00:04:45.350> sell<00:04:45.620> it's<00:04:46.520> spending<00:04:47.030> all<00:04:47.180> of

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
cell or a hard sell it's spending all of

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.300 
cell or a hard sell it's spending all of
this<00:04:47.389> energy<00:04:47.540> defending<00:04:48.260> itself<00:04:48.530> against<00:04:49.100> the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
this energy defending itself against the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.570 
this energy defending itself against the
toxins<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.479> so<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.830> function<00:04:52.340> of<00:04:52.430> that

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
toxins and so that the function of that

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.090 
toxins and so that the function of that
organ<00:04:53.000> goes<00:04:53.690> down<00:04:53.960> because<00:04:54.350> it's<00:04:54.680> just<00:04:54.740> in

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
organ goes down because it's just in

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.790 
organ goes down because it's just in
defense<00:04:55.699> yeah<00:04:56.240> so<00:04:56.780> if<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:57.020> move<00:04:57.229> if<00:04:57.470> you<00:04:57.530> take

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
defense yeah so if you move if you take

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.180 
defense yeah so if you move if you take
away<00:04:58.039> that<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:59.020> poisons<00:05:00.020> now<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:00.919> doesn't

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
away that the poisons now it doesn't

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.920 
away that the poisons now it doesn't
have<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.400> defend<00:05:01.639> itself<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.180> it<00:05:02.240> starts<00:05:02.810> to

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
have to defend itself and it starts to

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.700 
have to defend itself and it starts to
repair<00:05:03.340> so<00:05:04.340> juice<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.510> really<00:05:05.930> not<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.380> fast

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
repair so juice is really not a fast

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.820 
repair so juice is really not a fast
it's<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.220> feast<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:08.840> call<00:05:08.990> juice<00:05:09.229> feasting<00:05:09.590> but

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
it's a feast we call juice feasting but

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.760 
it's a feast we call juice feasting but
in<00:05:10.789> a<00:05:11.300> sense<00:05:11.600> it<00:05:11.900> depends<00:05:12.199> how<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:12.320> find<00:05:12.680> the

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
in a sense it depends how you find the

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.170 
in a sense it depends how you find the
word<00:05:12.919> fast<00:05:13.220> fast<00:05:13.669> really<00:05:14.240> means<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.750> abstain<00:05:15.530> I

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
word fast fast really means to abstain I

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.629 
word fast fast really means to abstain I
think<00:05:17.180> Gemma<00:05:17.720> n---word<00:05:17.960> is<00:05:18.139> fasting<00:05:18.650> and<00:05:18.800> it

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
think Gemma n---word is fasting and it

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.920 
think Gemma n---word is fasting and it
means<00:05:19.789> to<00:05:19.910> abstain<00:05:22.000> so<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.660> know<00:05:23.780> the

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
means to abstain so the you know the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.620 
means to abstain so the you know the
ultimate<00:05:24.590> sure<00:05:25.070> fast<00:05:25.340> would<00:05:25.610> be<00:05:25.760> not<00:05:26.090> no<00:05:26.330> water

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
ultimate sure fast would be not no water

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.529 
ultimate sure fast would be not no water
no<00:05:26.990> yeah<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.800> totally<00:05:28.460> Toby<00:05:28.820> fasting<00:05:29.360> and

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
no yeah and totally Toby fasting and

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.900 
no yeah and totally Toby fasting and
some<00:05:29.930> people<00:05:30.200> have<00:05:30.289> done<00:05:30.410> that<00:05:30.639> Moses<00:05:31.639> is

some people have done that Moses is
reported<00:05:32.419> to<00:05:32.450> have<00:05:32.539> done<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:32.960> Moses<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:34.220> is

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
reported to have done that Moses it is

said that Moses went up for 40 days

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.409 
said that Moses went up for 40 days
before<00:05:38.720> he<00:05:38.810> received<00:05:39.139> the<00:05:39.229> tablets<00:05:40.000> with<00:05:41.000> no

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.760 
water and no food and then he came down
and<00:05:45.639> he<00:05:46.639> got<00:05:46.820> angry<00:05:47.060> because<00:05:47.840> the<00:05:48.500> people

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
and he got angry because the people

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.010 
and he got angry because the people
there<00:05:49.220> was<00:05:49.340> a<00:05:49.370> problem<00:05:49.669> so<00:05:50.300> he<00:05:50.450> went<00:05:50.599> back<00:05:50.810> up

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
there was a problem so he went back up

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.779 
there was a problem so he went back up
for<00:05:51.199> another<00:05:51.380> 40<00:05:51.800> days<00:05:51.949> so<00:05:52.099> he<00:05:52.250> supposedly

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
for another 40 days so he supposedly

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.290 
for another 40 days so he supposedly
than<00:05:53.060> 80<00:05:53.240> days<00:05:56.020> according<00:05:57.020> to<00:05:57.169> what<00:05:57.289> we<00:05:57.500> know

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
than 80 days according to what we know

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.870 
than 80 days according to what we know
we've<00:05:59.300> never<00:05:59.330> seen<00:05:59.840> anybody<00:06:00.080> be<00:06:00.530> able<00:06:00.770> to<00:06:00.889> last

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:01.880 
we've never seen anybody be able to last

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.750 
we've never seen anybody be able to last
more<00:06:02.330> than<00:06:02.510> I<00:06:02.630> think<00:06:02.810> there's<00:06:02.960> been<00:06:03.020> some<00:06:03.760> some

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
more than I think there's been some some

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.089 
more than I think there's been some some
places<00:06:05.000> we've<00:06:05.270> seen<00:06:05.330> people<00:06:05.780> can<00:06:06.500> last<00:06:06.740> maybe

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
places we've seen people can last maybe

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.920 
places we've seen people can last maybe
three<00:06:07.490> weeks<00:06:07.520> four<00:06:07.940> weeks<00:06:08.410> water<00:06:09.410> but<00:06:10.599> if<00:06:11.599> that

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
three weeks four weeks water but if that

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.390 
three weeks four weeks water but if that
was<00:06:12.139> reported<00:06:12.620> in<00:06:12.710> like<00:06:12.860> the<00:06:12.979> 19th<00:06:13.310> century

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
was reported in like the 19th century

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.240 
was reported in like the 19th century
but<00:06:13.900> not<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.139> century<00:06:15.530> not<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:15.919> 20th

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
but not this century not the 20th

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.250 
but not this century not the 20th
century<00:06:16.490> 21st<00:06:16.760> century<00:06:17.060> so<00:06:17.690> i<00:06:17.720> don't<00:06:17.870> think<00:06:18.229> so

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
century 21st century so i don't think so

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.540 
century 21st century so i don't think so
i<00:06:18.349> think<00:06:19.030> and<00:06:20.110> it<00:06:21.110> doesn't<00:06:21.380> make<00:06:21.470> sense<00:06:21.530> we<00:06:22.400> do

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
i think and it doesn't make sense we do

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.500 
i think and it doesn't make sense we do
need<00:06:22.699> water<00:06:23.000> because<00:06:23.300> we<00:06:23.479> are<00:06:23.599> water<00:06:23.900> right<00:06:24.830> so

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
need water because we are water right so

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.380 
need water because we are water right so
the<00:06:26.510> real<00:06:26.750> fast<00:06:27.020> is<00:06:27.260> water<00:06:27.500> only<00:06:27.910> and

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
the real fast is water only and

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.140 
the real fast is water only and
that's<00:06:31.140> where<00:06:31.530> you<00:06:31.800> get<00:06:32.100> it<00:06:32.340> only<00:06:32.520> takes<00:06:32.760> 72

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
that's where you get it only takes 72

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.170 
that's where you get it only takes 72
hours<00:06:34.340> to<00:06:35.340> get<00:06:35.460> into<00:06:35.700> a<00:06:35.730> place<00:06:35.880> where<00:06:36.060> your

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
hours to get into a place where your

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.940 
hours to get into a place where your
body<00:06:36.270> just<00:06:36.600> starts<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:36.960> clean<00:06:37.230> out<00:06:37.410> all<00:06:37.440> the

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
body just starts to clean out all the

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.550 
body just starts to clean out all the
garbage<00:06:38.160> it<00:06:38.880> actually<00:06:39.240> happens<00:06:39.660> faster<00:06:40.080> now<00:06:40.530> a
