00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
waterfall and the cave next to it now

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.040 
waterfall and the cave next to it now
the<00:00:27.689> first<00:00:27.869> thing<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.230> know<00:00:28.349> about<00:00:28.529> specs<00:00:29.519> lab

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
the first thing to know about specs lab

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.410 
the first thing to know about specs lab
is<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.590> jumping<00:00:32.009> puzzle<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
is that it is a jumping puzzle and it is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.950 
is that it is a jumping puzzle and it is
a<00:00:33.690> timed<00:00:34.260> jumping<00:00:34.920> puzzle<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.840> when<00:00:36.840> you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
a timed jumping puzzle in that when you

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
a timed jumping puzzle in that when you
activate<00:00:37.850> some<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.440> consoles<00:00:40.440> or<00:00:40.969> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
activate some of the consoles or the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.520 
activate some of the consoles or the
panel's<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:43.350> timed<00:00:43.649> platforms<00:00:45.530> now

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
panel's you get timed platforms now

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.900 
panel's you get timed platforms now
you'll<00:00:46.829> need<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> navigate<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.670> ten

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you'll need to navigate these ten

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.630 
you'll need to navigate these ten
platforms<00:00:49.039> before<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.160> run<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:52.430> every<00:00:53.430> time

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
platforms before they run out every time

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.970 
platforms before they run out every time
you<00:00:53.879> reach<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.329> new<00:00:54.660> control<00:00:55.140> panel<00:00:55.170> that's<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
you reach a new control panel that's a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.939 
you reach a new control panel that's a
checkpoint<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.239> die<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:58.620> have

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
checkpoint so if you die you will have

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.220 
checkpoint so if you die you will have
the<00:00:59.070> option<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.910> back<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> start<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
the option to go back to the start and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.860 
the option to go back to the start and
just<00:01:01.469> show<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> quickly<00:01:02.420> when<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> come<00:01:03.750> back

to the start all you want to do is head

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.620 
to the start all you want to do is head
down<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.390> talk<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.380> lab<00:01:07.650> assistant

down here and talk to this lab assistant

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.179 
down here and talk to this lab assistant
you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.810> transport<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> any<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> stations

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you can transport to any of the stations

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.950 
you can transport to any of the stations
but<00:01:11.520> obviously<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.510> the
