00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370 

all<00:00:00.539> right<00:00:00.780> I'm<00:00:00.870> going<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.079> show<00:00:01.170> you<00:00:01.260> how<00:00:01.350> to

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
all right I'm going to show you how to

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.530 
all right I'm going to show you how to
start<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.829> 2001<00:00:02.399> yz250<00:00:03.300> F<00:00:03.629> or<00:00:04.470> 2002<00:00:05.540> because

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
start a 2001 yz250 F or 2002 because

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.720 
start a 2001 yz250 F or 2002 because
he's<00:00:06.779> got<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.170> decompression<00:00:07.830> lever<00:00:08.250> on<00:00:08.460> them

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.610 

decompression<00:00:11.730> levers<00:00:12.179> right<00:00:12.360> here<00:00:12.660> it's<00:00:13.559> a

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
decompression levers right here it's a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.820 
decompression levers right here it's a
black<00:00:13.830> lever<00:00:14.160> right<00:00:14.309> above<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> clutch<00:00:14.910> lever

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
black lever right above the clutch lever

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.099 
black lever right above the clutch lever
so<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.859> turn<00:00:17.160> your<00:00:17.279> gas<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.699> turn<00:00:18.539> your<00:00:18.660> choke<00:00:18.869> on

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
so I turn your gas on turn your choke on

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.900 
so I turn your gas on turn your choke on
if<00:00:20.070> it's<00:00:20.279> cold<00:00:20.520> out<00:00:21.320> hop<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.820> find<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
if it's cold out hop up here find the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
if it's cold out hop up here find the
compression<00:00:24.480> stroke<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.680> put<00:00:25.800> my<00:00:25.920> hand

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
compression stroke I like to put my hand

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.630 
compression stroke I like to put my hand
right<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:27.330> top<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> master<00:00:28.140> cylinder

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
right here on top of the master cylinder

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.389 
right here on top of the master cylinder
so<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:30.480> give<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:30.810> one<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.800> two<00:00:31.949> twists

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so just give it like one or two twists

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.450 
so just give it like one or two twists
of<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> trial<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.149> cold<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.340> kick<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
of the trial if it's cold out so kick it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.920 
of the trial if it's cold out so kick it
through<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.880> find<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> compression<00:00:36.690> stroke

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
through and find the compression stroke

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.869 
through and find the compression stroke
I'm<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> compression<00:00:38.280> stroke<00:00:38.489> right<00:00:38.670> now

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
I'm on the compression stroke right now

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.280 
I'm on the compression stroke right now
and<00:00:40.610> pull<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:42.149> decompression<00:00:42.870> lever<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and pull in your decompression lever and

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.670 
and pull in your decompression lever and
go<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> hair<00:00:45.329> pass<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.170> compression

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
go just a hair pass the compression

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
go just a hair pass the compression
stroke<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.879> all<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.210> needs<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
stroke that's all it needs to be and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:01:03.350 
stroke that's all it needs to be and
then<00:00:49.020> kick<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> should<00:00:49.860> start

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:48.310 

man

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:02:04.810 

oh<00:02:02.680> well<00:02:03.680> there<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.890> go<00:02:03.950> thanks<00:02:04.340> for<00:02:04.460> watching
