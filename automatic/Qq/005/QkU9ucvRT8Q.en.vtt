the mini marshmallows just like we're
making<00:01:58.799> hot<00:01:59.070> chocolate<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.700> ahead<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.000> pour

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
making hot chocolate go ahead and pour

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.010 
making hot chocolate go ahead and pour
that<00:02:00.210> into<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.719> other<00:02:00.990> circle<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.840> is

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
that into the other circle this is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.080 
that into the other circle this is
basically<00:02:04.920> just<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> hold<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.700> they're<00:02:05.909> gonna

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
basically just to hold on they're gonna

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.339 
basically just to hold on they're gonna
fire<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.890> cool<00:02:07.890> aged<00:02:08.129> shape<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.970> then<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
fire that cool aged shape and then I

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.920 
fire that cool aged shape and then I
think<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.709> take<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.099> spoon<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:12.540> some<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
think you take the spoon get some of the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.640 
think you take the spoon get some of the
sticky<00:02:13.290> stuff

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
sticky stuff

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.440 
sticky stuff
on<00:02:13.739> it<00:02:13.890> dip<00:02:14.189> it<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.459> marshmallows<00:02:14.730> this

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
on it dip it in the marshmallows this

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.089 
on it dip it in the marshmallows this
looks<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.049> could<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.260> good
