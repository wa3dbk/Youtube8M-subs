brains<00:01:18.570> grow<00:01:19.250> each<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> drawer<00:01:26.000> here<00:01:27.000> we

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
brains grow each have a drawer here we

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.320 
brains grow each have a drawer here we
go

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:52.270 

I<00:01:37.010> must<00:01:38.010> begin<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:41.180> search<00:01:42.740> ever<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.220> carefully

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.720 

look<00:01:53.060> at<00:01:53.180> that

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:55.730 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.300 

just<00:01:56.420> breaking<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:57.230> start<00:01:57.500> bubbling<00:01:58.490> up

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
just breaking just start bubbling up

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.920 
just breaking just start bubbling up
there's<00:02:01.310> even<00:02:01.430> like<00:02:01.640> blood<00:02:02.330> in<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.750> that's

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
there's even like blood in it that's

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:13.630 
there's even like blood in it that's
gross<00:02:03.440> too<00:02:04.420> awesome<00:02:05.470> oh<00:02:09.790> oh

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.790 

Oh

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.660 

this<00:02:16.580> tastes<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:17.030> lot<00:02:17.270> better<00:02:17.330> than<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.050> bar

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
this tastes a lot better than the bar

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.670 
this tastes a lot better than the bar
but<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:19.940> very<00:02:19.970> salad

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.970 

I<00:02:23.739> love<00:02:24.010> brains

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.060 

Thanks<00:02:31.700> hello
