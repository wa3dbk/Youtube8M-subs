00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
pillars here because if it's kind of

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.360 
pillars here because if it's kind of
inset<00:01:30.020> on<00:01:30.050> here<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:30.500> can<00:01:30.680> kind<00:01:30.830> of<00:01:30.920> be<00:01:31.010> hard<00:01:31.250> to

and then i love the new gauge cluster

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.920 
and then i love the new gauge cluster
design<00:01:43.160> compared<00:01:43.760> compared<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.600> mine<00:01:44.750> the

design compared compared to mine the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.900 
design compared compared to mine the
digital<00:01:45.320> readout<00:01:45.680> definitely<00:01:46.460> i<00:01:46.520> feel<00:01:46.700> is

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
digital readout definitely i feel is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.280 
digital readout definitely i feel is
more<00:01:47.770> accurate<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.490> it's<00:01:49.610> safer<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:54.110> much

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
more accurate and it's safer so much

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.550 
more accurate and it's safer so much
easier<00:01:55.570> no<00:01:56.570> it's<00:01:56.720> really<00:01:56.930> comfortable<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.500> I

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
easier no it's really comfortable and I

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.500 
easier no it's really comfortable and I
feel<00:01:57.770> like<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.130> have<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> lot<00:01:58.550> room<00:01:58.760> even<00:01:59.180> if<00:01:59.300> the

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
feel like I have a lot room even if the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.110 
feel like I have a lot room even if the
seat<00:02:00.290> pushes<00:02:00.710> back<00:02:00.920> it's<00:02:01.370> nice<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.760> a
