00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.000
 welcome to today I learn something I am jose 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.100
 and today I'm going to teach you how to transfer 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 files from a our device ios 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.950
 I'm going to make an iphone an ipod touch or 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.590
 an eibar to our computer with linux 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.990
 mac or windows 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.030
 well and good and that is also backwards 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.220
 from the computer to the device from 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.260
 the device to the computer how are we going to 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.600
 do that we're going to need this 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.210
 program called faith master file 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.290
 master and we have it only 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.540
 we will have to open it 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.280
 and have this option active when not 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.140
 come out as you can see the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.840
 we can touch it we can activate it 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.820
 turn it off and he's going to tell us an ip 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.190
 it's going to be an ip where we are 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.050
 they put http bold I'll point here with 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.730
 the mouse so that you can observe it with 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.710
 the mouse pointer 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.770
 this is true then we will have to 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.780
 write our browser http two 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.640
 points bars bars good as you can 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.430
 see I have previously accessed 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.410
 so that's why I have it here 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.790
 we will write whole without making mistakes and 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.830
 we will give the intro 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.740
 and we can play in the program 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.590
 our on our device 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.660
 we will play just right in the part of 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.150
 down here around here we will play with the 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.820
 finger to make it cleaner 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.220
 image that we can see well and how 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.020
 You can see what's on our device and 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.850
 what we have in our browser 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.850
 our computer 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.980
 in the same folders because then what 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.300
 go see now because now 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.900
 we are already inside our 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.090
 device let's image be a 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.640
 place 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.009
 and I'm going to select what I'm going to 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.310
 climb as you can see I already have it in the 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.170
 device is in the device what 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.729
 same that I just went up and 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.220
 we could see it from the device 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.869
 obviously because now we have here if 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.759
 we had it pressed we can make a 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.770
 series of options and one of them would be 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.950
 save in album 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.400
 that as you can see puts saved by 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.040
 what because the exported to the reel is worth 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.220
 exported to the photo spool of the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.140
 Our device's camera is worth 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.580
 and well, then, nothing, I hope that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.830
 be very useful since you can also 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.230
 pass music and all that without having to 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.330
 ignore because directly from 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.180
 here only having connected to the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.980
 two devices in the same wifi network 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.740
 you can catch interacting between 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.840
 them so if you liked this 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.840

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.510
