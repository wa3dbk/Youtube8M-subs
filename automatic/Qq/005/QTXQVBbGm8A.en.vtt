a little tight end sticky so I found

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.569 
a little tight end sticky so I found
myself<00:00:58.350> having<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.160> trouble

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579

trying<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> plug<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.420> when<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.690> needed<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
trying to plug it in when I needed to

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.110 
trying to plug it in when I needed to
charge<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> bottom<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.760> where<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
charge it on the bottom is where the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.880 
charge it on the bottom is where the
speakers<00:01:03.510> are<00:01:03.600> located<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.619> really

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
speakers are located and I'm not really

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399 
speakers are located and I'm not really
a<00:01:05.040> fan<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.489> them<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.000> sound<00:01:06.240> very<00:01:06.390> tinny<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
a fan of them they sound very tinny and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.490 
a fan of them they sound very tinny and
quite<00:01:08.250> flat<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.960> quite<00:01:10.200> loud

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
quite flat but they can get quite loud

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.490 
quite flat but they can get quite loud
which<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> bonus<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.939> guess<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.659> back<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
which is a bonus I guess so back to the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.649 
which is a bonus I guess so back to the

you're used to displays with higher
pixel<00:02:08.729> density<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:09.660> maybe<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
pixel density but maybe that's one of

pixel density but maybe that's one of
the<00:02:11.220> things<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.700> one

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240
