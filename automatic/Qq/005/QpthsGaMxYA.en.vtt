not<00:00:14.130> too<00:00:14.280> long<00:00:14.460> ago<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.759> started<00:00:15.210> doing

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
not too long ago I started doing

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.630 
not too long ago I started doing
something<00:00:15.780> called<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.289> ex-dea<00:00:16.830> unboxing

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
something called an ex-dea unboxing

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.070 
something called an ex-dea unboxing
where<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> did<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> unboxing<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.810> then<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
where I did the unboxing and then the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.689 
where I did the unboxing and then the
teardown<00:00:19.289> at<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.619> same<00:00:19.800> time<00:00:20.070> well<00:00:20.670> I

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
teardown at the same time well I

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.279 
teardown at the same time well I
realized<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.420> kind<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.840> confusing

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
realized that this was kind of confusing

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.390 
realized that this was kind of confusing
because<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.650> lot<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.920> people<00:00:23.160> didn't

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
because a lot of people didn't

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
because a lot of people didn't
understand<00:00:23.789> what<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.150> ex-dea<00:00:24.630> unboxing<00:00:25.320> was

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
understand what an ex-dea unboxing was

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.960 
understand what an ex-dea unboxing was
so<00:00:26.220> today<00:00:27.150> we're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.080> do<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.529> teardown<00:00:29.460> on

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
so today we're going to do a teardown on

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.310 
so today we're going to do a teardown on
the<00:00:30.539> Galaxy<00:00:31.080> camera<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.550> let's<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.910> started

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320

the Galaxy camera so let's get started
and<00:00:34.320> we<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.680> turn<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.070> right<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.550> off<00:00:35.850> now

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
and we can turn this right back off now

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.930 
and we can turn this right back off now
we<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.930> remove<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> battery<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.910> SD

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
we can remove the battery and the SD

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:50.030 
we can remove the battery and the SD
card<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> let's<00:00:40.140> take<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.469> these<00:00:40.620> screws

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.550 

we<00:00:51.040> have<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.220> hidden<00:00:51.460> screw<00:00:51.820> right<00:00:52.570> here<00:00:52.960> which

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
we have a hidden screw right here which

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.180 
we have a hidden screw right here which
we<00:00:53.740> can<00:00:53.860> remove<00:00:54.160> the<00:00:54.610> cover<00:00:54.760> with<00:00:55.090> a<00:00:55.120> needle<00:00:56.190> as

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
we can remove the cover with a needle as

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.350 
we can remove the cover with a needle as
well<00:00:57.370> as<00:00:57.550> a<00:00:57.580> hidden<00:00:58.000> screw<00:00:58.330> right<00:00:58.870> here<00:00:59.340> here

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
well as a hidden screw right here here

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.110 
well as a hidden screw right here here
here<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:03.430> we<00:01:03.490> can<00:01:03.550> finish<00:01:03.790> removing

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
here and now we can finish removing

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:19.410 
here and now we can finish removing
screws<00:01:12.990> one<00:01:13.990> more<00:01:14.200> hidden<00:01:14.410> screw<00:01:14.710> here<00:01:18.420> and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
screws one more hidden screw here and

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.910 
screws one more hidden screw here and
let's<00:01:19.750> just<00:01:19.900> take<00:01:20.050> another<00:01:20.110> look<00:01:20.470> around<00:01:20.560> for

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
let's just take another look around for

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.700 
let's just take another look around for
extra<00:01:21.250> screws<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:22.540> I<00:01:22.960> believe<00:01:23.200> that's<00:01:23.410> all<00:01:23.590> of

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
extra screws and I believe that's all of

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.880 
extra screws and I believe that's all of
them<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.700> we're<00:01:24.910> going<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.060> start<00:01:25.360> with<00:01:25.510> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
them so we're going to start with a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.680 
them so we're going to start with a
guitar<00:01:26.890> pick<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.729> separate<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.360> front<00:01:28.479> from

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
guitar pick to separate the front from

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.120 
guitar pick to separate the front from
the<00:01:28.750> back<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.170> then<00:01:29.410> we'll<00:01:29.500> move<00:01:29.650> to<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.890> case

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
the back and then we'll move to a case

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:53.920 
the back and then we'll move to a case
opener<00:01:30.580> tool

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.440 

and<00:01:54.200> this<00:01:54.860> edge<00:01:55.040> right<00:01:55.070> here<00:01:55.700> as<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.120> see

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
and this edge right here as you can see

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.810 
and this edge right here as you can see
it<00:01:57.320> has<00:01:57.560> these<00:01:57.800> additional<00:01:58.310> little<00:01:58.550> hooks

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
it has these additional little hooks

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.670 
it has these additional little hooks
right<00:01:59.030> there<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.930> little<00:02:00.290> bit<00:02:00.500> more

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
right there so it is a little bit more

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.500 
right there so it is a little bit more
difficult<00:02:01.130> to<00:02:01.190> get<00:02:01.340> off<00:02:01.520> then<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.240> bottom

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
difficult to get off then the bottom

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.490 
difficult to get off then the bottom
side<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.780> which<00:02:03.320> does<00:02:03.620> not<00:02:03.740> have<00:02:04.010> those<00:02:04.190> hooks

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
side is which does not have those hooks

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.500 
side is which does not have those hooks
will<00:02:06.500> remove<00:02:06.830> this<00:02:07.040> tape<00:02:07.280> here<00:02:07.670> and<00:02:07.700> here<00:02:10.510> and

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
will remove this tape here and here and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.200 
will remove this tape here and here and
now<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.950> can<00:02:13.040> disconnect<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.610> camera<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
now we can disconnect the camera and the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.000 
now we can disconnect the camera and the
controller<00:02:16.630> now<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:17.900> remove<00:02:18.200> one<00:02:18.530> two

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
controller now we can remove one two

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.590 
controller now we can remove one two
three<00:02:19.640> four<00:02:20.150> five<00:02:20.930> six<00:02:21.800> seven<00:02:22.760> screws<00:02:23.300> to

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
three four five six seven screws to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:43.220 
three four five six seven screws to
separate<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.200> board<00:02:24.440> from<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.430> chassis

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.050 

now<00:02:44.230> we<00:02:44.290> can<00:02:44.469> disconnect<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:45.459> power<00:02:45.640> button

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
now we can disconnect the power button

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.920 
now we can disconnect the power button
the<00:02:46.829> microphone<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.730> controls<00:02:49.120> now<00:02:49.870> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the microphone and the controls now the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.319 
the microphone and the controls now the
board<00:02:50.170> should<00:02:50.379> just<00:02:50.590> lift<00:02:50.739> out<00:02:50.950> at<00:02:51.069> this<00:02:51.189> point

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.309 

now<00:02:58.329> let's<00:02:58.510> go<00:02:58.629> ahead<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.870> remove<00:02:58.989> this

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
now let's go ahead and remove this

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.399 
now let's go ahead and remove this
shielding<00:02:59.769> here<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.120> here's<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> close-up<00:03:02.109> at

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
shielding here and here's a close-up at

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.069 
shielding here and here's a close-up at
the<00:03:02.500> board<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.859> you<00:03:02.920> guys<00:03:06.870> now<00:03:07.870> of<00:03:07.930> course

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
the board for you guys now of course

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.449 
the board for you guys now of course
we're<00:03:08.290> not<00:03:08.319> going<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.620> delve<00:03:08.859> into<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.189> camera

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
we're not going to delve into the camera

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.789 
we're not going to delve into the camera
parts<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.480> reason<00:03:10.810> being<00:03:10.989> is<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.620> they're

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
parts the reason being is that they're

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.360 
parts the reason being is that they're
sensitive<00:03:12.219> optics<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.269> there<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.980> as<00:03:14.980> soon<00:03:15.220> as

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
sensitive optics in there and as soon as

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.970 
sensitive optics in there and as soon as
you<00:03:15.489> begin<00:03:15.670> exposing<00:03:16.659> these<00:03:16.840> optics<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.439> dust

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
you begin exposing these optics to dust

package on package design let's see if

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.590 
package on package design let's see if
we<00:03:48.609> can<00:03:48.760> look<00:03:48.970> closely<00:03:49.659> at<00:03:50.049> this

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.750 

all<00:03:55.350> right<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:55.710> here<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:56.070> can<00:03:56.190> see<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.550> is

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
all right so here you can see this is

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.990 
all right so here you can see this is
the<00:03:56.880> Exynos<00:03:57.300> chip<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:58.610> there<00:03:59.610> are<00:03:59.730> several

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the Exynos chip and there are several

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.620 
the Exynos chip and there are several
resistors<00:04:00.690> around<00:04:01.050> this<00:04:01.350> chip<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:02.420> each<00:04:03.420> of

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
resistors around this chip and each of

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.860 
resistors around this chip and each of
these<00:04:03.720> resistors<00:04:03.990> is<00:04:04.680> about<00:04:05.520> the<00:04:05.790> size<00:04:06.030> of<00:04:06.420> a

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
these resistors is about the size of a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:07.910 
these resistors is about the size of a
needle

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
needle

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.470 
needle
I<00:04:07.950> believe<00:04:08.250> these<00:04:08.400> resistors<00:04:08.880> right<00:04:09.120> here

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
I believe these resistors right here

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.570 
I believe these resistors right here
right<00:04:09.870> below<00:04:10.020> the<00:04:10.260> needle<00:04:10.560> are<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.800> exo-m

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
right below the needle are the exo-m

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.990 
right below the needle are the exo-m
resistors<00:04:12.090> and<00:04:12.350> these<00:04:13.350> resistors<00:04:14.000> control

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
resistors and these resistors control

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.900 
resistors and these resistors control
the<00:04:15.180> boot<00:04:15.390> mode<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> device<00:04:16.140> now<00:04:17.100> my<00:04:17.640> goal

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
the boot mode of the device now my goal

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.210 
the boot mode of the device now my goal
for<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.300> future<00:04:18.810> hack<00:04:19.080> will<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.830> get<00:04:20.070> this

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.210 
for a future hack will be to get this
device<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.670> boot<00:04:20.820> off<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.270> SD<00:04:21.750> card<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.290> that

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
device to boot off of SD card and that

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.730 
device to boot off of SD card and that
will<00:04:23.460> enable<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.510> load<00:04:24.810> odin<00:04:25.230> mode<00:04:25.410> which

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
will enable you to load odin mode which

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.470 
will enable you to load odin mode which
will<00:04:25.980> then<00:04:26.250> be<00:04:26.400> able<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.640> flash<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.210> device

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
will then be able to flash the device

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.380 
will then be able to flash the device
with<00:04:27.840> firmware<00:04:28.520> so<00:04:29.520> that's<00:04:29.790> project<00:04:30.240> coming

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
with firmware so that's project coming

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.190 
with firmware so that's project coming
up<00:04:30.510> soon<00:04:31.610> as<00:04:32.610> usual<00:04:33.090> Samsung's<00:04:33.630> build<00:04:33.900> quality

up soon as usual Samsung's build quality
is<00:04:34.590> very<00:04:34.740> good<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.490> can<00:04:35.970> see<00:04:36.240> here<00:04:36.720> there

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
is very good and you can see here there

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.810 
is very good and you can see here there
are<00:04:37.370> impact<00:04:38.370> zones<00:04:39.260> around<00:04:40.260> all<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.520> corners

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
are impact zones around all the corners

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.430 
are impact zones around all the corners
of<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.030> device<00:04:42.300> which<00:04:42.600> keep<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.900> device<00:04:43.230> from

back panel on the device is made of a
very<00:04:52.650> sturdy<00:04:53.570> aluminum<00:04:54.570> so<00:04:55.230> I<00:04:55.530> don't<00:04:55.830> believe

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
very sturdy aluminum so I don't believe

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.970 
very sturdy aluminum so I don't believe
that<00:04:56.190> this<00:04:57.090> board<00:04:57.690> will<00:04:57.960> actually<00:04:58.440> receive

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
that this board will actually receive

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.400 
that this board will actually receive
any<00:04:59.430> impact<00:05:00.150> as<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.450> can<00:05:00.780> see<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> flex<00:05:01.320> cable

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
any impact as you can see the flex cable

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.770 
any impact as you can see the flex cable
usage<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.460> very<00:05:02.490> minimized<00:05:03.150> in<00:05:03.390> this<00:05:03.510> device

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
usage is very minimized in this device

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.860 
usage is very minimized in this device
this<00:05:04.680> camera<00:05:05.490> here<00:05:05.760> has<00:05:06.000> some<00:05:06.270> motors<00:05:06.570> and

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
this camera here has some motors and

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.390 
this camera here has some motors and

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
cause the device to flex and so I would

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.890 
cause the device to flex and so I would
say<00:05:11.250> this<00:05:11.430> use<00:05:11.640> of<00:05:11.670> flex<00:05:12.030> cable<00:05:12.360> here<00:05:12.570> is<00:05:12.600> very

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
say this use of flex cable here is very

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.800 
say this use of flex cable here is very
appropriate<00:05:13.500> in<00:05:13.620> this<00:05:13.800> condition<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:15.330> rest

the emmc if I'm not mistaken there is a

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.220 
the emmc if I'm not mistaken there is a
connection<00:05:48.030> here<00:05:48.390> for<00:05:48.570> hooking<00:05:48.840> up<00:05:48.960> to<00:05:49.110> an

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
external antenna however it ends up

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.300 
external antenna however it ends up
being<00:05:51.480> right<00:05:51.930> around<00:05:52.200> the<00:05:52.440> area<00:05:52.770> where<00:05:53.040> the

lanyard is connected on the device so I

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.550 
lanyard is connected on the device so I
don't<00:05:56.520> know<00:05:56.640> how<00:05:56.790> practical<00:05:57.030> that<00:05:57.360> is<00:05:57.660> but<00:05:58.350> it

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
don't know how practical that is but it

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.260 
don't know how practical that is but it
is<00:05:58.710> an<00:05:58.830> option<00:05:59.190> if<00:05:59.400> you're<00:05:59.670> looking<00:05:59.700> to<00:06:00.090> hack<00:06:00.240> a

before the USB chip is initialized so
I'll<00:06:30.000> be<00:06:30.120> looking<00:06:30.390> for<00:06:30.510> that<00:06:30.600> sometime<00:06:30.990> in<00:06:31.020> the

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
I'll be looking for that sometime in the

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.810 
I'll be looking for that sometime in the
future<00:06:31.410> all<00:06:32.190> right<00:06:32.250> so<00:06:32.550> while<00:06:32.700> I<00:06:32.730> was

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
future all right so while I was

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.520 
future all right so while I was
reassembling<00:06:33.360> this<00:06:33.540> device<00:06:33.780> first<00:06:34.080> off<00:06:34.290> a

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
reassembling this device first off a

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.580 
reassembling this device first off a
couple<00:06:35.130> of<00:06:35.250> notes<00:06:35.430> this<00:06:36.300> device<00:06:36.600> is<00:06:36.930> pretty

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:37.590 
couple of notes this device is pretty

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.410 
couple of notes this device is pretty
darn<00:06:37.950> difficult<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.580> get<00:06:38.730> back<00:06:38.880> together<00:06:39.060> all

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
darn difficult to get back together all

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.840 
darn difficult to get back together all
the<00:06:39.570> tolerances<00:06:40.140> are<00:06:40.290> very<00:06:40.470> small<00:06:40.800> and<00:06:41.070> the

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
the tolerances are very small and the

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.700 
the tolerances are very small and the
alignment<00:06:42.210> just<00:06:42.540> has<00:06:42.690> to<00:06:42.810> be<00:06:42.930> just<00:06:43.290> right<00:06:43.410> for

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
alignment just has to be just right for

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.530 
alignment just has to be just right for
everything<00:06:44.070> go<00:06:44.280> in<00:06:44.490> these<00:06:44.730> connections<00:06:45.360> right

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
everything go in these connections right

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.240 
everything go in these connections right
here<00:06:45.780> we're<00:06:45.930> pretty<00:06:46.080> tricky<00:06:46.530> now<00:06:47.010> the<00:06:47.070> other

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
here we're pretty tricky now the other

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.130 
here we're pretty tricky now the other
thing<00:06:47.460> I<00:06:47.520> wanted<00:06:47.760> to<00:06:47.820> note<00:06:48.090> is<00:06:48.270> there's<00:06:49.050> a

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
thing I wanted to note is there's a

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.510 
thing I wanted to note is there's a
spare<00:06:49.440> connector<00:06:49.830> right<00:06:50.010> here<00:06:50.310> which

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
spare connector right here which

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.330 
spare connector right here which
typically<00:06:50.970> on<00:06:51.210> samsung<00:06:51.690> devices<00:06:51.990> would<00:06:52.980> be

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
typically on samsung devices would be

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.270 
typically on samsung devices would be
the<00:06:53.760> JTAG<00:06:54.540> port<00:06:54.960> however<00:06:55.470> we<00:06:55.830> already<00:06:56.130> know

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.280 
the JTAG port however we already know

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.640 
the JTAG port however we already know
that<00:06:56.310> JTAG<00:06:57.030> is<00:06:57.360> locked<00:06:57.780> down<00:06:57.930> on<00:06:58.200> this<00:06:58.380> device

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
that JTAG is locked down on this device

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.670 
that JTAG is locked down on this device
so<00:06:59.370> this<00:06:59.790> port<00:07:00.120> right<00:07:00.180> here<00:07:00.360> will<00:07:00.960> likely<00:07:01.260> be

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
so this port right here will likely be

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.820 
so this port right here will likely be
useful<00:07:02.130> for<00:07:02.430> you<00:07:03.000> art<00:07:03.180> as<00:07:03.360> well<00:07:03.690> we'll<00:07:04.560> take<00:07:04.800> a

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
useful for you art as well we'll take a

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.770 
useful for you art as well we'll take a
look<00:07:05.040> at<00:07:05.130> that<00:07:05.280> sometime<00:07:05.970> in<00:07:06.000> the<00:07:06.180> future<00:07:06.240> I

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
look at that sometime in the future I

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.870 
look at that sometime in the future I
have<00:07:07.560> to<00:07:07.710> say<00:07:07.860> this<00:07:08.070> camera<00:07:08.400> is<00:07:08.550> kind<00:07:08.820> of

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 
have to say this camera is kind of

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.520 
have to say this camera is kind of
difficult<00:07:09.300> to<00:07:09.360> get<00:07:09.510> assembled<00:07:09.780> back<00:07:10.080> properly

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
difficult to get assembled back properly

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.400 
difficult to get assembled back properly
there<00:07:11.370> was<00:07:11.490> a<00:07:11.520> lot<00:07:11.820> of<00:07:11.850> little<00:07:12.270> pieces<00:07:12.900> and

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:13.410 
there was a lot of little pieces and

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.320 
there was a lot of little pieces and
parts<00:07:13.620> and<00:07:13.860> a<00:07:13.890> lot<00:07:13.920> of<00:07:14.130> extra<00:07:14.610> screws<00:07:14.970> so<00:07:15.300> I

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
parts and a lot of extra screws so I

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.810 
parts and a lot of extra screws so I
wouldn't<00:07:15.720> try<00:07:15.930> this<00:07:15.990> at<00:07:16.260> home<00:07:16.340> however<00:07:17.340> I

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:17.820 
wouldn't try this at home however I

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.330 
wouldn't try this at home however I
would<00:07:18.600> like<00:07:18.750> to<00:07:18.870> note<00:07:19.050> that<00:07:19.080> this<00:07:19.620> device<00:07:19.980> is

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
would like to note that this device is
