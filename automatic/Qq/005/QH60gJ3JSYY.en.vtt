00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
footage this is going to become a big

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.850 
footage this is going to become a big
issue<00:01:48.070> that's<00:01:48.640> why<00:01:48.820> we<00:01:48.850> tackle<00:01:49.330> this<00:01:49.860> humanity

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860

and<00:01:51.040> human<00:01:51.130> rights<00:01:51.460> versus<00:01:52.060> machine<00:01:52.240> is<00:01:52.810> much

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
and human rights versus machine is much

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.450 
and human rights versus machine is much
more<00:01:53.409> relevant<00:01:53.590> now<00:01:53.890> than<00:01:53.920> when<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.280> first

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
more relevant now than when the first

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.190 
more relevant now than when the first
film<00:01:54.700> was<00:01:54.820> made<00:01:54.880> its<00:01:55.210> really<00:01:55.540> it's<00:01:55.780> perfect

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
film was made its really it's perfect

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.440 
film was made its really it's perfect
yeah<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.640> first<00:01:57.880> film<00:01:58.090> saw<00:01:58.390> it

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
yeah it's and the first film saw it

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.020 
yeah it's and the first film saw it
which<00:01:58.869> is<00:01:59.049> a<00:01:59.080> great<00:01:59.440> merit<00:01:59.920> they<00:02:00.040> saw<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.340> way

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
which is a great merit they saw that way

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.250 
which is a great merit they saw that way
back<00:02:02.100> now<00:02:03.100> we<00:02:03.159> have<00:02:03.610> more<00:02:04.600> knowledge<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:05.110> how

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
back now we have more knowledge of how

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.859 
back now we have more knowledge of how
this<00:02:05.409> is<00:02:05.560> going<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.860> go<00:02:06.159> down<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.390> think

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
this is going to go down and I think

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.389 
this is going to go down and I think
it's<00:02:08.019> going<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.200> go<00:02:08.350> down<00:02:08.380> exactly<00:02:08.920> as<00:02:09.100> you<00:02:09.220> see

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it's going to go down exactly as you see

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.070 
it's going to go down exactly as you see
first<00:02:09.880> we're<00:02:10.149> going<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.299> be<00:02:10.450> using<00:02:10.630> machines

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
first we're going to be using machines

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.979 
first we're going to be using machines
abroad<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:12.670> foreign<00:02:13.150> policies<00:02:13.750> and

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
abroad in foreign policies and

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.360 
abroad in foreign policies and
interventions<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.830> then<00:02:15.010> we're<00:02:15.190> going<00:02:15.280> to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
interventions and then we're going to

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.390 
interventions and then we're going to
bring<00:02:15.549> machines<00:02:16.000> home<00:02:16.269> and<00:02:17.010> Michael<00:02:18.010> Raymond

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
bring machines home and Michael Raymond

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.220 
bring machines home and Michael Raymond
Sellars<00:02:18.670> strikes<00:02:19.150> me<00:02:19.299> as<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.450> guy<00:02:19.600> who<00:02:19.660> believes

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
Sellars strikes me as a guy who believes

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.490 
Sellars strikes me as a guy who believes
one<00:02:20.530> hundred<00:02:20.860> percent<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.519> he's<00:02:21.820> right<00:02:22.500> yeah

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
one hundred percent that he's right yeah

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.180 
one hundred percent that he's right yeah
I<00:02:23.530> mean<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.549> think<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:25.090> think<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.620> he<00:02:26.620> sees<00:02:26.890> even

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
I mean I think I think it he sees even

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.960 
I mean I think I think it he sees even
more<00:02:27.370> actually<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.090> think<00:02:28.330> he<00:02:28.480> sees<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.410> maybe

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
more actually I think he sees that maybe

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.490 
more actually I think he sees that maybe
you<00:02:30.970> know<00:02:31.000> how<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.269> define<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.260> right

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
you know how you define what is right

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.130 
you know how you define what is right
and<00:02:32.530> what<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:33.209> what<00:02:34.209> is<00:02:34.329> wrong<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:34.930> know<00:02:35.019> he's

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
and what is what is wrong you know he's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.750 
and what is what is wrong you know he's

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
humanity and and that was the that was

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.290 
humanity and and that was the that was
the<00:04:36.969> challenge<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.750> portray<00:04:38.469> that<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:39.300> and
