00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
really the concept is rock-solid but the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.820 
really the concept is rock-solid but the
execution<00:03:58.880> leaves<00:03:59.300> something<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.780> be<00:03:59.870> desired

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
very nice as well so the question arises
