00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.980
 I am 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.110
 Hmm 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.090
 after a few years of waiting you are in the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.340
 time to go beyond death 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.040
 packaged by the success of the first 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.529
 title dark souls 2 arrives with the difficult 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.920
 task to overcome your near perfect 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.930
 predecessor but even with the announcement of 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.850
 change in the production and 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.920
 some controversies involving the 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.570
 difficulty of the game will be that a new 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.410
 franchise software title is worth 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.030
 effort 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.790
 Let's check out a new world of dark. 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.829
 souls 2 is bigger and better than your 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.030
 predecessor in virtually all 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.239
 questions 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.579
 the system of good faulks persists and you 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.579
 still recovers its energy and these 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.500
 flashes when sitting in front of campfires 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.559
 The answer your enemies now is 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.250
 has two implications. 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.350
 direct 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.690
 one is that you should no longer be 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.000
 concentrate on making souls of the same 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.850
 place which will make you to be 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.270
 thank you to explore more the gigantic 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.179
 world with a little less worries 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.990
 imagine the game has more than 30 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.910
 bosses in addition now you can already 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.330
 carry between the different good 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.780
 fires since the beginning of the game 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.020
 this change may seem initially 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.300
 facilitator 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.429
 but as the game progresses you go 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.860
 find that it is essential to go 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.250
 from place to place in the immensity of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.250
 dry lake 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.050
 apart from that some attributes of evolution 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.670
 of the characters were divided by doing 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.619
 with which your choices ensure a 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.039
 more specialized character of your 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.170
 warrior is in charge ability 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.630
 for example were divided into two 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 separate issues while a new 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.899
 Adaptability has arisen 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.030
 another interesting change is the 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.459
 gradual decrease of your 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.880
 up to 50 percent of the maximum 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.580
 while you are in hall state 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.590
 this implies a greater importance of 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.050
 Nefe Street says they can be used as 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.420
 common items to reverse your condition 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.090
 from andrÃ© 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.490
 talking about who played the two games 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.070
 above will note the existence of 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.750
 several new items and several 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.260
 of them will be very important in 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.600
 from the adventure in terms of 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.060
 gameplay keeps the 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.190
 qualities of previous experiences and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.680
 add some news 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.050
 the movement of each side is more 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.300
 especially when you 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.420
 must equip a torch in order to 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.550
 light your way 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.530
 this annex as well as all weapons 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.870
 has a small bar of life 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.590
 shown in the slot where the object is 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.780
 indicated as expected dax the two did not 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.640
 takes you by the hand absolutely in 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.890
 no time to direct their 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.930
 steps 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.000
 instead the game proposes that you 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.280
 tutorial right at the beginning of the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.140
 adventure but in no time this is 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.400
 then just look at it because the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.440
 improved accessibility did not 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.650
 means that the game is easier 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.170
 In fact, an easy word is a non-existent word. 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.600
 in the dictionary the dark souls 2 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.000
 It is clear that from here both have a 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.150
 here is another problem there 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.730
 for example to certain places in the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.790
 which you simply can not pass 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.430
 due to a native game ban 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.520
 otherwise it bothers the fact that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.770
 some enemies reach more than 360 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.720
 degrees of coverage in their attacks 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.150
 besides a final look of the work in the 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.500
 consoles is a little lower than that 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.659
 shown in broadcast videos 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:05.120
 but the real cherry of the tax bun 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.730
 the two was due to the stoning of the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.189
 online mode to movies software has made 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.379
 lighter blood system and the 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.719
 attempts to bribe fellows 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.940
 now have immediate answers 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.410
 readily qualified with success 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.900
 or not 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.889
 The cool thing is that in the case of 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.160
 negative 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.960
 usually the reason for the failure 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.850
 so you can expect several and 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.650
 several minutes to see an invocation 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.810
 these fail to rely on the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.940
 participation of your colleagues in the game 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.120
 became much easier 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.789
 due to the improvement and clarification of the 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.470
 use of covers 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.020
 now you can even choose where the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.430
 server wants to log in which facilitates 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.430
 meeting of acquaintances 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.810
 all this was a way that the 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:12.849
 producers have found to cut 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.340
 first fat surplus 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.680
 title and create an atmosphere of 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.740
 practicality and balance for gamers 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.439
 the most fantastic attribute of giving only 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.659
 remains the enormous sensation of 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:28.060
 fulfilled after being able to detonate 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:30.250
 some boss or complete some terrain 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.099
 very complex 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.319
 so even if you have invested 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.810
 hundreds of hours of his life in the 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.150
 first dark souls dark souls 2 goes 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.479
 can make you spend twice as much 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.539
 time it includes several items that the 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.340
 players always asked for improvements 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.379
 absurd in the new online system 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.889
 ways of fighting adjustments in 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:57.060
 complexity of revolutions and more 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:57.060
 simply stunning 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.729
 yesterday 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.910
 windows blame me 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.620
 nine troy
