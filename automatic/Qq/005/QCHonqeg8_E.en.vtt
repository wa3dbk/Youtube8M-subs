00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.410 
3 so we look at that and then look at
this<00:00:47.640> one<00:00:47.910> how<00:00:48.629> well<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:50.420> but

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this one how well you can see that but

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.560 
this one how well you can see that but
it's<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> exact<00:00:52.079> same<00:00:52.170> UPC<00:00:52.610> there<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
it's the exact same UPC there we go the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.139

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910 
now an official release would have a
unique<00:00:59.730> ISBN<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.660> unique<00:01:00.960> UPC<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.710> both
