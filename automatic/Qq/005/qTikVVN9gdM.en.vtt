00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
latest explosion that we've seen there

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
latest explosion that we've seen there
does<00:02:01.860> seem<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.340> an<00:02:02.520> indication<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
does seem to be an indication that the

off<00:02:07.049> now<00:02:07.799> we<00:02:07.860> are<00:02:08.310> still<00:02:08.610> waiting<00:02:08.789> official

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
off now we are still waiting official

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.390 
off now we are still waiting official
confirmation<00:02:09.660> from<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.319> authorities<00:02:10.860> but

confirmation from the authorities but

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.300 
confirmation from the authorities but
what<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.569> those<00:02:12.930> well

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
what we do know of those well

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.550 
what we do know of those well
which<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> bit<00:02:14.390> troubling<00:02:14.959> is<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
which is a bit troubling is that the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.410 
which is a bit troubling is that the
Tokyo<00:02:15.950> fire<00:02:16.190> department<00:02:16.700> has<00:02:16.819> sent<00:02:17.060> special

Tokyo fire department has sent special

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.339 
Tokyo fire department has sent special
nuclear<00:02:18.080> rescue<00:02:18.500> teams<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.580> area<00:02:20.319> we<00:02:21.319> are

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
nuclear rescue teams to that area we are

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.470 
nuclear rescue teams to that area we are
still<00:02:21.680> waiting<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.430> official<00:02:22.459> word<00:02:23.000> but

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
still waiting on the official word but

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.770 
still waiting on the official word but
that<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.959> latest<00:02:24.260> from<00:02:24.800> Tokyo<00:02:25.599> okay<00:02:26.599> we

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
that is the latest from Tokyo okay we

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.660 
that is the latest from Tokyo okay we
are<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:27.050> getting<00:02:27.170> me<00:02:27.500> latest<00:02:28.010> news<00:02:28.099> reports

are just getting me latest news reports

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.460 
are just getting me latest news reports
that<00:02:28.849> there<00:02:29.000> has<00:02:29.270> been<00:02:29.300> an<00:02:29.630> explosion<00:02:29.989> at<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
that there has been an explosion at the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.680 
that there has been an explosion at the
Fukushima<00:02:31.160> nuclear<00:02:31.190> plant<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:32.090> Japan<00:02:32.239> what

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan what

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.589 
Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan what
are<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.840> picking<00:02:33.170> up<00:02:34.150> right<00:02:35.150> well<00:02:35.390> that's

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
are you picking up right well that's

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.479 
are you picking up right well that's
exactly<00:02:36.019> what<00:02:36.170> I've<00:02:36.260> been<00:02:36.319> explaining<00:02:37.280> to

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
exactly what I've been explaining to

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.699 
exactly what I've been explaining to
earlier<00:02:37.880> but<00:02:38.120> essentially<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.200> one<00:02:39.680> of

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
earlier but essentially this is one of

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.580 
earlier but essentially this is one of
the<00:02:40.010> nuclear<00:02:40.790> plants<00:02:41.420> operated<00:02:41.989> by<00:02:42.110> Tokyo

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
the nuclear plants operated by Tokyo

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.890 
the nuclear plants operated by Tokyo
Electric<00:02:43.190> obviously<00:02:43.940> as<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.120> know<00:02:44.239> Japan<00:02:44.480> is

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
Electric obviously as you know Japan is

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140 
Electric obviously as you know Japan is
a<00:02:44.930> quick<00:02:45.260> phone<00:02:45.530> region<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.130> nuclear<00:02:46.910> energy

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
a quick phone region and nuclear energy

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.960 
a quick phone region and nuclear energy
is<00:02:47.360> one<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:47.989> Japan's<00:02:48.350> main<00:02:48.650> power<00:02:48.980> sources<00:02:49.400> so

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
is one of Japan's main power sources so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.809 
is one of Japan's main power sources so
we<00:02:50.150> are<00:02:50.269> getting<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.690> lot<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:51.400> electricity<00:02:52.400> from

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
we are getting a lot of electricity from

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.050 
we are getting a lot of electricity from
this<00:02:53.120> from<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:53.959> source<00:02:55.030> nuclear<00:02:56.030> energy

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
this from this source nuclear energy

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.520 
this from this source nuclear energy
however<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:57.230> very<00:02:57.739> sensitive<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.340> these<00:02:58.580> quake

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
however is very sensitive to these quake

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.430 
however is very sensitive to these quake
in<00:03:00.530> tremors<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.510> Fukushima<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.750> one<00:03:03.140> of

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
in tremors and Fukushima is one of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.460 
in tremors and Fukushima is one of
several<00:03:03.830> nuclear<00:03:04.959> facilities<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.349> are

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
several nuclear facilities that are

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.949 
several nuclear facilities that are
feared<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.890> have<00:03:06.920> been<00:03:07.280> impacted<00:03:07.880> by<00:03:07.959> the
