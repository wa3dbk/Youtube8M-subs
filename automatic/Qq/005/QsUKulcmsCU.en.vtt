00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.530

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.789
 If you get to hear the song such 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.750

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.920
 We are not going to touch something like that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.920
 gentlecito is to touch everything there 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.960

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:04.059

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.070
 sixth of fa what we were playing 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.409

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.049
 middle fingers we play 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.110
 once again 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.729
 since we have up there we continue now 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.770
 we will go 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.619
 this is a natural my and this is a do 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.979

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.909
 from there we go down we make sun and down 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.909

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.200
 4 down down ring finger 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.200
 then how is the change 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.370
 once again 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.100
 then we are going to combine these two 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.100
 we just learned parts 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.800
 t 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.490
 m 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.030
 If you have completed it until now, we are going 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.490
 to the final part of this introduction 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.620
 we do again re that is the sixth ere 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.159

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.970
 let's go back sixth finger is a mini top 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.629
 or down and we come back then here they go to 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.629
 be polite 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.280
 once again we are going to go sixth of networks 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.990
 exceeded the sixth finger 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.920
 Be careful, touch yourself with your fingers 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.920
 half we do 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:35.760
 and the last cuts we ended up 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:37.650
 for the and below network 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.200
 this is a very closed position here 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.480
 down do not open it up here 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.400
 we're 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.400
 and there we play the last cuts 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:55.950
 how would this end be heard and there 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.970
 we have the whole part of the introduction 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.970
 with the accordion 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.090
 now we go with the part of the arrangements 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.980
 it's really a very short part and 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.470
 It is also very simple 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.970
 we start where the voice starts to 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 sing all the emotion 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.829
 then there we are going to do to 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:22.280
 up and down separately 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.970
 it's always going to be 22 over 24 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.050
 down 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:29.650
 cancel down and we passed nor up 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.650
 nor down 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:40.030
 if we upload to the network from top to bottom 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.520
 we go up to 22 up or down as we go to 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:46.350
 do 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.180
 my king 2 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.790
 since we have up there we are going to do 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.520
 some chords is the chord with which 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.740
 we had finished the part of the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:00.030
 introduction was fa 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.060
 the iv king remember 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.870
 and here we are going to make two cuts with each 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.870
 I agreed 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.590
 let's repeat we do 2 and 2 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:22.760
 from there we go to another chord is the chord 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.760
 of two we make my sun and down my sun 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.130
 and we will be playing with these two 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.350
 chords during the chorus part where 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.630
 the part comes that says move your waist 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.810
 move your waist then here we go to 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.810
 do 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.330
 we 're going to two again to the king 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.629
 again to do if you listen to the song 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.879
 you will be able to follow the rhythm much better 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.520
 and the part that we are doing 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:06:09.930
 so how would I continue to start this 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:13.620
 part what we are going to do is four 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.189
 chord games that is to say we have network and 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.569
 It is to that noise they make a game what 

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:24.059
 let's do four repetitions 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:25.800
 network or network or network or network or four times and 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.520
 after these chords that we just 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.139
 touch let's go back to the pub to me I re 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.139
 re all of ropes 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:45.319
 let's play exactly the same as 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:49.039
 we had played at the beginning and with that 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:51.409
 we have the part of the arrangements good 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:53.509
 Well, as you will only notice 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.550
 we have two parts in the song that are 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:59.090
 what we just saw one is the intro and 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.909
 the other are the arrangements the intro 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.969
 is starting the song after we have 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:07.039
 the arrangements then goes again the 

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:08.689
 part of the intro but now in the middle of 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.969
 the song then is now called 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:14.000
 bridge but it's exactly the same 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:15.979
 then the arrangements go one more time and 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.800
 from there already with those arrangements the 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:21.020
 song you can listen to and give yourself 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800
 account of how it is structured and already 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.590
 can touch her 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.779
 just as good now I already 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.000
 you learned the song to practice 

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:30.830
 practice since you have it well mastered 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.449
 you start to practice it together with the 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.610
 song you are looking for the video on youtube the 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:36.860
 song is right to touch on the 

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:38.930
 accordion of fa then since you have it 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.129
 complete you dance to all you
