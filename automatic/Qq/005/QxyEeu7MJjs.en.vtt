of explaining what's in the prestige
shop<00:01:47.549> but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> thought<00:01:48.180> I'd<00:01:48.329> go<00:01:48.420> through<00:01:48.630> these

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
shop but I thought I'd go through these

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
shop but I thought I'd go through these
a<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:48.990> bit<00:01:49.200> longer<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.310> figure<00:01:50.520> out

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
a little bit longer and and figure out

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.429 
a little bit longer and and figure out
what<00:01:50.759> these<00:01:50.909> things<00:01:51.119> really<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.570> extra<00:01:52.110> custom

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
what these things really do extra custom

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.200 
what these things really do extra custom
class<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.070> all<00:01:53.100> sort<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.060> we

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
class I think we all sort of get that we

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.700 
class I think we all sort of get that we
know<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.450> extra<00:01:54.659> custom<00:01:54.960> classes<00:01:55.140> because

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
know what extra custom classes because

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
know what extra custom classes because
we've<00:01:55.920> been<00:01:56.040> seeing<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.850> couple<00:01:57.210> call

the<00:02:04.649> same<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.189> thought<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.670> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the same and I thought it was going to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.010 
the same and I thought it was going to
be<00:02:05.850> double<00:02:06.090> XP<00:02:06.329> throughout<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> entire

challenge and title and emblem stuff

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.900

right so title and emblem it said in the
description<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.630> video<00:03:31.750> we<00:03:32.019> just<00:03:32.049> watched

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
description of the video we just watched

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.039 
description of the video we just watched
that<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.340> regular<00:03:33.760> edition<00:03:34.090> only<00:03:34.359> had<00:03:34.690> title

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
that the regular edition only had title

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.900 
that the regular edition only had title
and<00:03:35.170> emblems<00:03:35.440> in<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.950> don't<00:03:36.489> know<00:03:36.640> if<00:03:36.790> it

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
and emblems in it I don't know if it

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.340 
and emblems in it I don't know if it
includes<00:03:37.209> challenges<00:03:37.750> but<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.930> think<00:03:38.230> it's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
includes challenges but I think it's

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.009 
includes challenges but I think it's
safe<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.620> assume<00:03:38.859> that<00:03:39.579> challenge<00:03:40.540> is<00:03:40.630> one<00:03:40.660> two

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
safe to assume that challenge is one two

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.690 
safe to assume that challenge is one two
and<00:03:41.170> three<00:03:41.470> have<00:03:41.920> been<00:03:41.950> bundled<00:03:42.340> together

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.180 
and three have been bundled together
with<00:03:43.239> title<00:03:43.570> and<00:03:43.989> emblem<00:03:44.350> one<00:03:44.650> two<00:03:44.829> and<00:03:44.980> three

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
with title and emblem one two and three

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.920 
with title and emblem one two and three

two hours and that's what's been implied

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.759 
two hours and that's what's been implied
then<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:04.000> wonder<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.600> the<00:04:04.720> challenges<00:04:05.230> are<00:04:05.260> even
