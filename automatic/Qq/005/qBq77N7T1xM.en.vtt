00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.630 

so<00:00:02.639> maybe<00:00:03.000> just<00:00:03.389> maybe<00:00:04.370> you<00:00:05.370> thought<00:00:05.580> that

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
so maybe just maybe you thought that

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.709 
so maybe just maybe you thought that
that<00:00:05.910> was<00:00:06.150> actually<00:00:06.540> real<00:00:07.309> probably<00:00:08.309> not<00:00:08.719> so

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
that was actually real probably not so

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.450 
that was actually real probably not so
when<00:00:10.170> Sam<00:00:10.380> was<00:00:10.410> doing<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.740> VFX<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.250> talked

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
when Sam was doing the VFX we talked

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.430 
when Sam was doing the VFX we talked
warfare<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.389> came<00:00:12.780> up<00:00:12.929> with<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.110> idea

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
warfare to you I came up with the idea

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.129 
warfare to you I came up with the idea
to<00:00:13.679> have<00:00:13.860> one<00:00:13.889> our<00:00:14.160> videos<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:15.000> sort<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.780> like<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
to have one our videos I sort of like a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.279 
to have one our videos I sort of like a
sketch<00:00:16.470> on<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> flipbook<00:00:17.539> every<00:00:18.539> drawing<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
sketch on a flipbook every drawing was a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.670 
sketch on a flipbook every drawing was a
frame<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.490> video<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.320> so<00:00:22.320> basically<00:00:22.560> what

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
frame of the video and so basically what

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.290 
frame of the video and so basically what
I<00:00:22.740> did<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.250> came<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.699> general<00:00:23.910> idea

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
I did was I came up with a general idea

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.660 
I did was I came up with a general idea
and<00:00:24.630> then<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> send<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.199> over<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> Sam<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.519> just

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and then I send it over to Sam and just

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.640 
and then I send it over to Sam and just
like<00:00:26.789> we<00:00:26.910> normally<00:00:27.029> do<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.660> he<00:00:28.080> come<00:00:28.470> up<00:00:28.500> with

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
like we normally do is he come up with

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.050 
like we normally do is he come up with
that<00:00:28.800> idea<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.279> I'd<00:00:29.400> have<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.609> make<00:00:29.789> sure<00:00:29.910> it's

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
that idea and I'd have to make sure it's

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
that idea and I'd have to make sure it's
actually<00:00:30.359> possible<00:00:30.599> for<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> visual<00:00:31.470> effects

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
actually possible for the visual effects

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.799 
actually possible for the visual effects
so<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.250> brought<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.059> idea<00:00:33.329> into<00:00:33.540> After

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so I brought it the idea into After

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.360 
so I brought it the idea into After
Effects<00:00:34.050> when<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.410> clip<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.070> working

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
Effects when that clip so I was working

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.220 
Effects when that clip so I was working
with<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.090> saw<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.870> could<00:00:37.050> add<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
with and I saw that I could add the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.690 
with and I saw that I could add the
cartoon<00:00:37.620> effect<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.070> make<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> look<00:00:38.489> like

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
cartoon effect to make it look like

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.229 
cartoon effect to make it look like
Sharpie<00:00:39.570> drawings<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.969> since<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> was

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
Sharpie drawings so since it was

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.760 
Sharpie drawings so since it was
actually<00:00:42.719> possible<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.440> started

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
actually possible then I started

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.020 
actually possible then I started
thinking<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> like<00:00:44.280> what<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> dialogue<00:00:44.910> can

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
thinking of like what the dialogue can

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.490 
thinking of like what the dialogue can
be<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.780> video<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> actually<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.350> lot

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
be like in this video is actually a lot

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.990 
be like in this video is actually a lot
different<00:00:46.950> from<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> normal<00:00:47.520> videos<00:00:47.789> we're

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
different from the normal videos we're

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.630 
different from the normal videos we're
making<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:49.129> we're<00:00:50.129> having<00:00:50.399> Eric

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
making because we're having Eric

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.950 
making because we're having Eric
actually<00:00:51.000> directly<00:00:51.360> talked<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> audience

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
actually directly talked to the audience

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
actually directly talked to the audience
instead<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> being<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.860> instead<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> being

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
instead of being it instead of it being

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.170 
instead of being it instead of it being
like<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.059> short<00:00:54.570> sketch<00:00:54.870> so<00:00:55.469> normally<00:00:56.250> I'm

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
like a short sketch so normally I'm

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.760 
like a short sketch so normally I'm
doing<00:00:57.539> I'm<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.870> doing<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> visual<00:00:58.350> effects

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
doing I'm off doing the visual effects

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.770 
doing I'm off doing the visual effects
for<00:00:58.920> our<00:00:59.039> main<00:00:59.280> videos<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.969> Eric<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.750> be

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
for our main videos and Eric will be

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170 
for our main videos and Eric will be
working<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.260> behind<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> scenes<00:01:02.180> so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
working on the behind the scenes so

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.390 
working on the behind the scenes so
those<00:01:04.049> don't<00:01:04.320> usually<00:01:04.500> take<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:04.979> long<00:01:05.159> as

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
those don't usually take as long as

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
those don't usually take as long as
doing<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> visual<00:01:05.760> effects<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> video

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
doing the visual effects so this a video

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.460 
doing the visual effects so this a video
kind<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> would<00:01:08.580> represent<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.750> time<00:01:10.049> Eric

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
kind of would represent the time Eric

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.020 
kind of would represent the time Eric
was<00:01:10.650> done<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.250> behind<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> scenes<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
was done with the behind the scenes and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.090 
was done with the behind the scenes and
had<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.450> free<00:01:12.600> time<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.840> that'd<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
had some free time so that'd be kind of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
had some free time so that'd be kind of
cool<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.580> spin<00:01:14.790> off<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.509> make

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
cool to put a spin off on that and make

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
cool to put a spin off on that and make
it<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.530> seem<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:16.979> though<00:01:17.009> he<00:01:17.310> actually

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
it make it seem as though he actually

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.010 
it make it seem as though he actually
drew<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.000> pages<00:01:18.270> out<00:01:18.540> another<00:01:18.810> cool<00:01:18.990> thing

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
drew these pages out another cool thing

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.270 
drew these pages out another cool thing
about<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.470> video<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.159> actually

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
about this video is that we actually

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.070 
about this video is that we actually
filmed<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:20.939> two<00:01:21.240> different<00:01:21.420> parts<00:01:21.900> just

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
filmed it at two different parts just

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.810 
filmed it at two different parts just
like<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.350> our<00:01:22.409> human<00:01:22.680> claw<00:01:22.860> machine<00:01:23.159> video<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
like in our human claw machine video so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.320 
like in our human claw machine video so
we<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.860> actual<00:01:26.100> action<00:01:26.520> scene<00:01:26.790> footage

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
we have the actual action scene footage

00:01:27.330 --> 00:02:28.240 
we have the actual action scene footage
we<00:01:28.080> went<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.350> shot<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> separate<00:01:29.040> day

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.009 

so<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.430> this<00:02:29.519> location<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:30.030> actually<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
so in this location it's actually the

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.530 
so in this location it's actually the
studio<00:02:31.379> of<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.709> sculptor<00:02:32.010> his<00:02:32.549> dog<00:02:32.790> right<00:02:33.330> here

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
studio of a sculptor his dog right here

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.530 
studio of a sculptor his dog right here
he<00:02:34.290> let<00:02:34.409> us<00:02:34.530> do<00:02:34.920> kind<00:02:35.190> enough<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.370> let<00:02:35.580> us<00:02:35.700> come

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540

just made it look as sketchy as I can

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.540 
just made it look as sketchy as I can
pretty<00:03:51.050> much<00:03:51.140> just<00:03:51.319> like<00:03:51.950> an<00:03:52.100> improvised

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
pretty much just like an improvised

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.870 
pretty much just like an improvised
explosive<00:03:52.580> device<00:03:54.130> it<00:03:55.130> wasn't<00:03:55.459> really<00:03:55.640> matter

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
explosive device it wasn't really matter

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.160 
explosive device it wasn't really matter
of<00:03:56.060> what<00:03:56.239> we<00:03:56.390> did<00:03:56.569> because<00:03:57.220> it's<00:03:58.220> basically<00:03:58.640> I

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
of what we did because it's basically I

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.840 
of what we did because it's basically I
had<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.200> remember<00:04:00.500> that<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.400> visual<00:04:01.640> effects

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
had to remember that the visual effects

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.820 
had to remember that the visual effects
only<00:04:02.030> were<00:04:02.269> chilling<00:04:02.630> a<00:04:02.690> block<00:04:02.989> we're<00:04:03.590> just<00:04:03.739> a

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
only were chilling a block we're just a

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.490 
only were chilling a block we're just a
simple<00:04:04.130> outline<00:04:04.280> so<00:04:05.110> what<00:04:06.110> was<00:04:06.230> great<00:04:06.380> about

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
simple outline so what was great about

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.780 
simple outline so what was great about
this<00:04:06.709> video<00:04:06.980> is<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.130> didn't<00:04:07.489> really<00:04:07.640> matter

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
this video is I didn't really matter

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.090 
this video is I didn't really matter
what<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.750> props<00:04:09.019> looked<00:04:09.350> like<00:04:09.560> when<00:04:09.800> we<00:04:09.830> threw

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
what the props looked like when we threw

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
what the props looked like when we threw
them<00:04:10.160> in<00:04:10.340> there<00:04:10.489> all<00:04:10.640> that<00:04:10.730> matter<00:04:10.940> is<00:04:11.060> that

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
them in there all that matter is that

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.000 
them in there all that matter is that
you<00:04:11.360> can<00:04:11.450> get<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.630> basic<00:04:11.989> idea<00:04:12.290> of<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.650> from

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
you can get the basic idea of it from

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.910 
you can get the basic idea of it from
that<00:04:13.190> we<00:04:13.310> had<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.489> flip<00:04:13.790> video
