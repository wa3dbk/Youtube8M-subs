let's<00:02:18.160> break<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.849> all<00:02:20.459> now<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.519> make<00:02:22.090> an

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
let's break this is all now to make an

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.820 
let's break this is all now to make an
admin<00:02:22.870> shop<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.519> can<00:02:24.519> figure<00:02:24.670> out<00:02:24.760> about<00:02:24.910> these

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
admin shop I can figure out about these

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:33.420 
admin shop I can figure out about these
and<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.000> chest<00:02:28.000> down<00:02:28.150> we're<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:28.989> and<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:32.430> think

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and just chest down we're on and I think

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.270 
and just chest down we're on and I think
that<00:02:33.700> works<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:36.760> Donna's<00:02:38.069> then<00:02:39.069> it's

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
that works I think Donna's then it's

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:47.600 
that works I think Donna's then it's
going<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:39.489> be<00:02:39.640> one<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.849> cover<00:02:43.180> one<00:02:45.390> stick<00:02:46.390> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
that's it so

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.790 
that's it so
that's<00:03:55.690> how<00:03:55.840> you<00:03:55.900> create<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.500> shop<00:03:57.450> now<00:03:58.650> I'm<00:03:59.650> not

that's how you create a shop now I'm not
going<00:03:59.950> to<00:04:00.010> go<00:04:00.099> over<00:04:00.130> the<00:04:00.310> config<00:04:00.730> say<00:04:01.180> it's

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
going to go over the config say it's

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.490 
going to go over the config say it's
pretty<00:04:01.540> straightforward<00:04:02.380> and<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.410> should

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
pretty straightforward and so you should

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.540 
pretty straightforward and so you should
be<00:04:05.650> able<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.950> do<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:08.650> that's<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.280> say

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
be able to do that so that's to say

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.530 
be able to do that so that's to say
