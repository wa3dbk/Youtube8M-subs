00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
since modern warfare 2 back when I used

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.140 
since modern warfare 2 back when I used
to<00:00:27.689> play<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.140> ps3<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.920> always<00:00:29.490> dreamt<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to play on the ps3 I always dreamt of

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.420 
to play on the ps3 I always dreamt of
like<00:00:30.480> tramps<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.410> don't<00:00:31.590> know<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:31.920> that's<00:00:32.130> an

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
like tramps I don't know if that's an

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
like tramps I don't know if that's an
actual<00:00:33.120> order<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> pronounced<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.050> right

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
actual order for I pronounced that right

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.220 
actual order for I pronounced that right
but<00:00:34.890> I've<00:00:35.250> always<00:00:35.489> had<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:36.059> idea<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.930> like

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
but I've always had this idea of like

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290 
but I've always had this idea of like
multi-platform<00:00:38.190> games<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.730> Call<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.940> Duty

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
multi-platform games or Call of Duty

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
multi-platform games or Call of Duty
being<00:00:39.510> multi-platform<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.940> even

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
being multi-platform and I'm not even

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.049 
being multi-platform and I'm not even
sure<00:00:42.270> if<00:00:42.329> that's<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.719> correct<00:00:42.989> term<00:00:43.160> but<00:00:44.160> my

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
sure if that's the correct term but my

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.660 
sure if that's the correct term but my
my<00:00:45.420> thesis<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> basically<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.309> back

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
even prestige dead I don't think and it

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.299 
even prestige dead I don't think and it
sucked<00:01:01.230> because<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.620> didn't<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.039> all<00:01:02.190> those

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
sucked because I didn't have all those

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.460 
sucked because I didn't have all those
weapons<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> stuff<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> much<00:01:04.049> preferred

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
weapons and stuff so I much preferred

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
weapons and stuff so I much preferred
playing<00:01:04.739> Call<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:04.979> Duty<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> ps3<00:01:05.869> now<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
playing Call of Duty on the ps3 now the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.780 
playing Call of Duty on the ps3 now the
thing<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> always<00:01:07.770> wanted<00:01:08.369> was<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
thing that I always wanted was to be

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.370 
thing that I always wanted was to be
able<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.240> transfer<00:01:09.689> my<00:01:09.840> stats<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
able to just transfer my stats and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
able to just transfer my stats and
everything<00:01:10.409> over<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.070> Xbox<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> then<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.000> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
everything over to Xbox and then back to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.210 
everything over to Xbox and then back to
ps3<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.710> would<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
ps3 I think that would just be the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.969 
ps3 I think that would just be the
coolest<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.640> ever<00:01:14.880> but<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:16.290> haven't<00:01:16.560> gotten

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
coolest thing ever but we haven't gotten

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.580 
coolest thing ever but we haven't gotten
that<00:01:17.369> advanced<00:01:17.820> dad<00:01:18.119> or<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.900> far<00:01:19.380> into

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that advanced dad or that that far into

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.890 
that advanced dad or that that far into
it<00:01:19.770> but<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.729> thing<00:01:20.939> is<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.330> Call<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.540> Duty

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it but the thing is for Call of Duty

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.300 
it but the thing is for Call of Duty
ghosts<00:01:22.259> they're<00:01:22.380> something<00:01:22.590> similar<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
ghosts they're something similar and I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.450 
ghosts they're something similar and I
think<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:23.700> very<00:01:23.909> cool<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.570> um<00:01:25.320> originally<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
think it's very cool so um originally it

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
think it's very cool so um originally it
was<00:01:26.610> supposed<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.030> work<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.020> Call

coolest thing ever now it was originally
supposed<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.770> be<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.010> I'm<00:02:34.100> not<00:02:34.250> sure<00:02:34.400> if<00:02:34.520> I

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.460 
supposed to be and I'm not sure if I
mentioned<00:02:34.970> this<00:02:35.000> but<00:02:35.300> where<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.320> could

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
mentioned this but where you could

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.410 
mentioned this but where you could
transfer<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.010> back<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.430> forth<00:02:37.700> say<00:02:38.269> you're

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
transfer it back and forth say you're

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.729

playing<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.840> Xbox<00:02:38.870> one<00:02:39.470> you<00:02:39.500> could

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
playing on the Xbox one you could

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.680 
playing on the Xbox one you could
transfer<00:02:40.130> your<00:02:40.250> stats<00:02:40.489> to<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> 360<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.480> then

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
back to the one however that features

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.040 
back to the one however that features
not<00:02:43.670> available<00:02:43.730> right<00:02:44.269> now<00:02:44.330> so<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.930> only

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
not available right now so it's only

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.030 
not available right now so it's only
just<00:02:45.320> 360<00:02:46.100> or<00:02:46.250> ps3<00:02:46.570> to<00:02:47.570> the<00:02:47.690> ps4<00:02:47.959> or<00:02:48.200> Xbox<00:02:48.800> one

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
just 360 or ps3 to the ps4 or Xbox one

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.590 
just 360 or ps3 to the ps4 or Xbox one
so<00:02:49.220> it<00:02:49.340> works<00:02:49.519> for<00:02:49.640> both<00:02:49.880> consoles<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.480> both

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
so it works for both consoles in both

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.750 
so it works for both consoles in both
systems<00:02:51.080> i<00:02:51.290> which<00:02:51.769> i<00:02:51.890> think<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.310> really<00:02:52.489> cool

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
systems i which i think is really cool

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.199 
systems i which i think is really cool
because<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:53.989> just<00:02:54.140> very<00:02:54.440> nice<00:02:54.709> of

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
because it's it's just very nice of
