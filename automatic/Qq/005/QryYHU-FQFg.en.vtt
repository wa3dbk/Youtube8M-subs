00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
potential competition they would look at

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.090 
potential competition they would look at
that<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.689> say<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.140> know<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:01.530> forget<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.040> I

although this is what I want to do and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.859 
although this is what I want to do and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
and I thought to myself well if I can do

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.800 
and I thought to myself well if I can do
it<00:02:15.510> better<00:02:15.720> if<00:02:16.050> I<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.330> handle<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
started way back when without any but I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.059 
started way back when without any but I
had<00:02:33.720> no<00:02:33.900> extra<00:02:34.140> income<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.620> do<00:02:34.769> it<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:34.980> was

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
had no extra income to do it so I was

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.140 
had no extra income to do it so I was
doing<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.670> bootstrap<00:02:36.209> budget<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.840> I

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
doing on a bootstrap budget and I

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.400 
doing on a bootstrap budget and I
realize<00:02:39.150> other<00:02:39.330> guys<00:02:39.599> are<00:02:39.840> being<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.110> same

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
realize other guys are being the same

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.900 
realize other guys are being the same
boat<00:02:40.680> as<00:02:40.830> me<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.190> they'd<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.580> overcome

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
boat as me and they'd have to overcome

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.390 
boat as me and they'd have to overcome
these<00:02:42.090> same<00:02:42.450> obstacles<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:44.099> looked<00:02:44.310> at

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
these same obstacles and I looked at

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.490 
these same obstacles and I looked at
that<00:02:44.519> fear<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.630> know<00:02:45.660> maybe<00:02:45.900> taking<00:02:46.380> all

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
that fear of you know maybe taking all

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.140 
that fear of you know maybe taking all
these<00:02:46.620> steps<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.160> failing<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> positive

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
these steps and failing as a positive

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.850 
these steps and failing as a positive
because<00:02:48.600> other<00:02:48.810> people<00:02:49.230> would<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.650> take

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
because other people would have to take

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.070 
because other people would have to take
them<00:02:50.100> too<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.209> thought<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.690> might<00:02:51.810> thought

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
them too so I thought it might thought

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.780 
them too so I thought it might thought

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
fail so recognizing that I realize that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.460 
fail so recognizing that I realize that
it<00:03:32.549> would<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.819> come<00:03:33.000> down<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.269> me<00:03:33.840> being<00:03:34.200> able

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
it would just come down to me being able

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.680 
it would just come down to me being able
to<00:03:34.650> respond<00:03:35.280> from<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.700> failure<00:03:35.970> and<00:03:36.239> move

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
to respond from that failure and move

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.479 
to respond from that failure and move
forward<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.470> that's<00:03:37.829> where<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.190> got

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
forward and that's where I got

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.670 
forward and that's where I got
inspiration<00:03:38.970> from<00:03:39.540> match<00:03:39.750> where<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.019> rose<00:03:40.350> up

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
inspiration from match where I rose up

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.610 
inspiration from match where I rose up
because<00:03:40.980> I<00:03:41.160> got<00:03:41.400> fired<00:03:42.060> up<00:03:42.329> realizing<00:03:43.139> that<00:03:43.410> if

because I got fired up realizing that if

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.830 
because I got fired up realizing that if
I<00:03:44.010> could<00:03:44.220> respond<00:03:44.760> better<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.120> failure<00:03:45.690> than

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
I could respond better to failure than

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.800 
I could respond better to failure than
everybody<00:03:46.079> else<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.709> could<00:03:47.280> move<00:03:47.459> forward<00:03:47.810> you

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
everybody else I could move forward you

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.720

gap the competition so to speak I could

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.900 
gap the competition so to speak I could
get<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> place<00:03:56.010> where<00:03:56.310> people<00:03:56.430> would<00:03:56.760> be

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
get to a place where people would be

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.879 
get to a place where people would be
like<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.660> know<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.959> could<00:03:58.170> cross<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.650> bridge

going down that road that I would end up
in<00:04:25.500> a<00:04:25.590> place<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:25.890> most<00:04:26.280> people<00:04:26.640> would<00:04:26.789> be

that doesn't work and I always try and

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.550 
that doesn't work and I always try and
look<00:05:18.360> at<00:05:18.510> things<00:05:18.690> from<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.900> positive<00:05:19.110> so<00:05:19.470> it's

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
look at things from a positive so it's

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.510 
look at things from a positive so it's
always<00:05:19.680> just<00:05:19.800> shifting<00:05:20.340> your<00:05:20.490> perspective

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
always just shifting your perspective

looking at failures a positive and

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.220 
looking at failures a positive and
seeing<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.780> ultimately<00:05:24.780> it's<00:05:24.900> gonna<00:05:24.960> get
