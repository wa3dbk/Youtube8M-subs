one looks just as nicely built the focus
is<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:27.029> quick<00:00:27.210> unfortunately<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.019> all

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
is really quick unfortunately the all

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.750 
is really quick unfortunately the all
the<00:00:28.619> cameras<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.010> taped<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.460> we're<00:00:29.640> not

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the cameras are taped up we're not

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.220 
the cameras are taped up we're not
allowed<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> take<00:00:30.179> any<00:00:30.390> footage<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:31.019> them

allowed to take any footage with them

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.580 
allowed to take any footage with them
but<00:00:32.030> it's<00:00:33.030> an<00:00:33.420> absolute<00:00:33.899> beast<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> lens

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
but it's an absolute beast of a lens

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
but it's an absolute beast of a lens
it's<00:00:34.800> huge<00:00:35.100> let<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:35.399> compare<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
it's huge let me compare it to you the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.200 
it's huge let me compare it to you the
the<00:00:36.600> Nikon<00:00:37.469> 51.4<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.730> give<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> sense

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the Nikon 51.4 just to give you a sense

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260 
the Nikon 51.4 just to give you a sense
of<00:00:39.329> scale<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> complexity<00:00:40.760> so<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.120> may

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
of scale and the complexity so it may

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
of scale and the complexity so it may
not<00:00:42.300> look<00:00:42.600> too<00:00:43.079> huge<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.770> something<00:00:44.190> like<00:00:44.370> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
not look too huge on something like a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.590 
not look too huge on something like a
Canon<00:00:45.090> 5d<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.710> size<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.219> maybe<00:00:47.879> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
Canon 5d it's about the size of maybe I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
Canon 5d it's about the size of maybe I
don't<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.399> those<00:00:50.460> really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
don't know like one of those really

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
don't know like one of those really
wide-angle<00:00:51.480> zoom<00:00:51.510> lenses<00:00:52.110> or<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> bit<00:00:52.559> smaller

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
wide-angle zoom lenses or a bit smaller

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.340 
wide-angle zoom lenses or a bit smaller
than<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.250> 24<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> 70<00:00:54.149> s<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.660> compare<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.170> there

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
than the 24 to 70 s but compare it there

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.910 
than the 24 to 70 s but compare it there
to<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.860> Nikon<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.270> 1.4<00:00:58.079> G<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to the Nikon that's the 1.4 G and you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.389 
to the Nikon that's the 1.4 G and you
can<00:00:59.699> see<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.180> much<00:01:00.660> much<00:01:00.960> bigger<00:01:01.230> I<00:01:01.680> would

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
can see it's much much bigger I would

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.740 
can see it's much much bigger I would
expect<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> much

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
expect that this is going to have a much

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
expect that this is going to have a much
higher<00:01:03.989> T<00:01:04.320> stock<00:01:04.619> value<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.369> much

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
higher T stock value with that much

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
higher T stock value with that much
glass<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> chance<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.530> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
glass there you know the chance it is

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.820 
glass there you know the chance it is
able<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> transmit<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.790> full<00:01:09.030> 1.4<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:10.080> light<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
able to transmit a full 1.4 of light I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.910 
able to transmit a full 1.4 of light I
think<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.760> likely<00:01:12.740> interesting<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
think is really likely interesting that

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.850 
think is really likely interesting that
like<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.400> their<00:01:14.700> 85<00:01:15.330> milk<00:01:15.720> Prime<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.680> one

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
like with their 85 milk Prime this one

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
like with their 85 milk Prime this one
comes<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.400> flower<00:01:17.880> shape<00:01:18.210> hood<00:01:18.479> which<00:01:18.869> is

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
comes with a flower shape hood which is

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.399 
comes with a flower shape hood which is
unnecessary<00:01:19.830> for<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.070> prime<00:01:20.340> lens<00:01:20.610> but<00:01:21.299> still<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
unnecessary for a prime lens but still I

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.749 
unnecessary for a prime lens but still I
guess<00:01:22.799> it's<00:01:22.979> pretty<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.490> handy<00:01:23.670> for

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
guess it's pretty and it's handy for

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999 
guess it's pretty and it's handy for
being<00:01:24.030> able<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.330> lift<00:01:24.479> things<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.229> the

being able to lift things up just the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
in size to the 24-105 from Sigma you can

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
in size to the 24-105 from Sigma you can
see<00:01:40.229> they're<00:01:40.439> fairly<00:01:40.740> similar<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.579> course<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
see they're fairly similar of course the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
see they're fairly similar of course the
seek<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.689> zoom<00:01:43.079> gets<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.860> lot<00:01:44.040> longer<00:01:44.189> when

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
seek the zoom gets a lot longer when

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.880 
seek the zoom gets a lot longer when
it's<00:01:44.549> zoomed<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.380> even<00:01:46.380> though<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.680> one
