00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
sounds and see if closing this blind

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.030 
sounds and see if closing this blind
helps<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.390> little<00:01:27.479> bit<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> column<00:01:31.040> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
helps a little bit with a column it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
helps a little bit with a column it
doesn't<00:01:32.340> help<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> much<00:01:32.970> but<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.079> get<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
doesn't help that much but you get the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
doesn't help that much but you get the
general<00:01:34.470> idea<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.369> yeah<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:35.700> basically

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
general idea but so yeah it's basically

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.749 
general idea but so yeah it's basically
