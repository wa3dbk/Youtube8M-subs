00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.400 
want the transition where you it's
noticeable<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:14.380> me<00:04:15.220> I'm<00:04:15.489> gonna<00:04:15.670> just<00:04:15.880> take<00:04:16.060> it

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
noticeable so me I'm gonna just take it

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.979 
noticeable so me I'm gonna just take it
come<00:04:17.410> right<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.950> there<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.630> float<00:04:19.630> it<00:04:19.780> right

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
come right to there and float it right

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.500 
come right to there and float it right
into<00:04:20.200> that<00:04:20.530> joint<00:04:21.070> another<00:04:21.820> thing<00:04:22.030> I<00:04:22.150> can<00:04:22.360> do

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
into that joint another thing I can do

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.080 
into that joint another thing I can do
to<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.620> make<00:04:23.800> my<00:04:23.979> life<00:04:24.190> easier<00:04:24.729> which<00:04:24.940> I

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
to to make my life easier which I

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.580 
to to make my life easier which I
probably<00:04:25.300> will<00:04:25.660> is

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
probably will is

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.100 
probably will is
so<00:04:26.680> this<00:04:27.010> whole<00:04:27.250> thing<00:04:27.580> if<00:04:27.910> I<00:04:28.090> soak<00:04:28.419> it<00:04:28.630> that's

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
so this whole thing if I soak it that's

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.020 
so this whole thing if I soak it that's
the<00:04:29.320> proper<00:04:29.680> way<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:29.830> do<00:04:30.100> it<00:04:30.250> or<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.639> can<00:04:30.880> use

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
the proper way to do it or I can use

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.600 
the proper way to do it or I can use
this<00:04:31.210> float<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:32.050> soak<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.740> existing<00:04:33.310> joint

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
this float you soak the existing joint

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.969 
this float you soak the existing joint
then<00:04:34.540> you<00:04:34.660> take<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.080> new<00:04:35.260> joint<00:04:35.620> right<00:04:35.800> in

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
then you take the new joint right in

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:36.300 
then you take the new joint right in
there

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
there

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.060 
there
no<00:04:36.520> transition<00:04:37.030> but<00:04:37.720> for<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.990> sake<00:04:38.199> of<00:04:38.229> water

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
no transition but for the sake of water

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.280 
no transition but for the sake of water
here<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.610> slippery<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.630> didn't<00:04:40.900> want<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.110> show
