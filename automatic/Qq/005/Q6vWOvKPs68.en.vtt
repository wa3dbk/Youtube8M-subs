00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Welcome to a new video of 

00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:06.870
 auto.de that up to the eighth 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.040
 generation of the VW Passat and if they are 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.170
 hey we've already asked 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.519
 seen correctly larissa and I have 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.639
 you already quite in detail 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.949
 I will introduce this model 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.480
 of the combination of VW passat variants only 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.160
 on the significant differences 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.750
 received one likes the eighth generation of the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.760
 vw passat a bit as a facelift 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.740
 stamp 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 that is actually true too 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.420
 because really much new compared to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.790
 the generation before that but if I have 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.100
 technically very fine full led 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.750
 Spotlights bring in the night 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.270
 of course, a huge advantage 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.710
 beaming range this is very chic color 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.540
 something different as I think 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.190
 in the interior it is then however 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.660
 not quite as good as it was done 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.260
 always put together the configuration 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.440
 has a back important 2.0 tdi that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.850
 means 190 ps in our case 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.649
 front-wheel drive you can passat yes too 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.260
 with frogs get four-wheel drive but 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.090
 here in this case only by drive like 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.890
 I think a very important engine but 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.120
 later more on this variant is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.729
 I would like to show the trunk once 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.490
 because he is huge in and of itself 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.460
 not quite big but good we are 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.880
 have here also this beautiful technology 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.979
 that he rises over a footpath and 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.720
 then in the back neat place to the Rhine 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.119
 The loading edge is pleasantly deep 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.680
 we have several options here 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.270
 just overturn the seats 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.820
 I already mentioned the exterior color 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.710
 is very very chic to them it is 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.979
 but not as fancy we have 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.259
 Here I own you from the beginning 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.390
 can not recommend no matter what car 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.400
 because they are very dirt sensitive and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.820
 In this case, here the car is running out 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.020
 8000 km this seat thinks so already 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.670
 a little bit of other residue 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.200
 and that is actually how it is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.619
 we have a beautiful here in this case 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
 mechanical six-speed can I 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.380
 again with something directly on the way 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.659
 give 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.509
 rather take the money for the dsg 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.799
 box because who stretch long drives the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.600
 would like to switch a vain display 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.159
 we do not have to switch that much 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.460
 he has a lot of torque that very well 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.689
 distributed but you go yes and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.310
 again through the city itself 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.560
 The interior is very clear 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.260
 designed very large we have diverse 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.519
 accept 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.439
 like a steering wheel heater or the let 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.769
 Let's put it with the reference of 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.209
 the ergo comfort seats are in the 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.970
 basic equipment ever longer 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.950
 what people with long legs like that 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.659
 bit favored with this 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.970
 There is also a comfort seat 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.370
 small pressure point massage over diverse 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.010
 Air cushions are quite comfortable though 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.510
 Honestly the extra charge you can 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.790
 saving is actually spending one's time 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.439
 really the bulk of his 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.260
 working time in the car the ergo 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.599
 comfort seats beg as much 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.209
 cozy and very inviting for longer 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.500
 rides as well does the engine if 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.489
 You can never mess with it 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.959
 5.2 liters drive me a bit 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.030
 faster then it's about 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.310
 six is ​​still fine 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.799
 because we are moving a lot of weight here 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.720
 and some are also in length and us 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.239
 can also load accordingly 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.129
 through the active infodisplay I do 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.200
 still better solved than at 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:16.049
 audi we are through the very good 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.790
 Survey always perfect in the picture 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.500
 but I miss the head-up display 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.900
 here in this outfit so a 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.560
 little bit because that makes life still 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.299
 have a tick pleasant dcc 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.480
 we here the possibility of normal 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.910
 sport eco the difference between 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.709
 Comfort and sport is one of the only 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.440
 really fall off the dampers 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.030
 I would have said the dsg eco yet 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.310
 Unfortunately, we do not have this freewheel 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.620
 to conclude a little conclusion to the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.440
 vw passat 2 0 tdi 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.889
 I think the 190 ps machine is something 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.419
 more emotional than the biturbo diesel and 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:55.000
 This makes you feel a bit too 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:58.540
 more connected with the car than possible 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.250
 to step on it goes ahead of consumption 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.780
 he actually goes that well too 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.299
 but if you go all the way 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.060
 technical delicacies would like then 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.370
 one for such a middle-class combination yet 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.370
 lay something neat on the table
