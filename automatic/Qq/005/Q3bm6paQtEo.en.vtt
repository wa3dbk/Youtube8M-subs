00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:13.170
 but about 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.260
 cycle track can be said literally 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.900
 what is sport without brakes stopped 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 only with your weight your body plan for 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.689
 Jarla plan I speed as if you are flying 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:35.309
 they have a closet to sprout wings somewhere 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:39.410
 I jump on my feet but the first feeling 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.000
 that you change from ordinary cars 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.550
 some very cool speed 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.039
 the race car set up here for 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.719
 that the athlete develops 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.489
 incredible speed for bikes in 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.510
 Russian team record 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 persecution 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.170
 4 kilometers four kilometers or 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.210
 minutes pissing spoon 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.429
 always been interested in why a wheel 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.860
 these athletes did so here 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.530
 After all, in the donut and the lower you will be decrepit 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.800
 I will increase my dynamics and pedals of course 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.440
 very peculiar they are very small and 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.050
 the left is the contacts not yes not the pedals so 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.690
 on intermission for pedal contact in this 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.250
 shoes we just spin on the pedals and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:27.870
 all introduced shoes with full contact 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:30.450
 athlete david stretches pulls up 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:34.110
 century and pushes forward at this 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.060
 bike and much less knitting and parma 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.250
 specials if you look it will 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.980
 completely different unusual round 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.870
 sleeping creates twists it's sleeping 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.520
 creates less for them and not that is she 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:52.710
 passes like a mouse how butter cuts it 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.050
 also wheel to port aerodynamic 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.750
 wheel if you go post on the street 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.390
 you can put on 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.920
 and the feeling that the athletes are going 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.900
 literally on the wall 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.479
 would an athlete drive here before us yes 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.610
 he needs to reach a speed of about 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.860
 not less than twenty kilometers per hour 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.980
 there used to be earthen tracks 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.709
 then we went concrete tracks were 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.709
 asphalt stopped at a tree again 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.890
 all the pursuit of hundredths of a second 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.640
 rolling friction on wood is less than 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.550
 concrete 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.130
 Now we will see what is usually different 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.239
 cyclist sneakers like me from a beginner 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:39.890
 athlete track 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:39.890
 gives the score 5 4 3 2 1 march 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.939
 you are
