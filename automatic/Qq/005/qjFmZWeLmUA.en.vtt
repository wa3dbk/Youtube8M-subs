 this video is presented to you by 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.480
 the city of meinzhagen 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.920
 although at the train stations in gummersbach 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.139
 and meinzhagen excitement 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.700
 construction site operation there was the 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.980
 wish the railway functionaries and 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.840
 politicians finally the track to 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.810
 meinzhagen in operation to take 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.880
 tomorrow, Thursday, then the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.590
 be included in regular operation and 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.720
 my days finally back on 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.510
 oberbergischen circle and ultimately 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.730
 also to the rhine metropolis cologne 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.040
 be connected with it now for a long time 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.570
 fought for 27 years waiting for 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.880
 the day and we all look forward to that 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.590
 huge that that worked and that 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.660
 exactly on Weiberfastnacht quasi the 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.180
 opening after today's official 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.530
 Part of course is through the 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.930
 date shift owed but 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.340
 maybe it was a happy coincidence 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.720
 fate that we at veybach what 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.149
 has the two pieces officially in 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.200
 I can take a lot of work 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.180
 finds too old wives all good 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.590
 will ever be opened so that 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.390
 the first train to old women 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.700
 I never thought I had the mess 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.290
 They never do , but they do it very well 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.820
 we managed to get that done 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.860
 he agrees to go to Cologne more often 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.750
 drive and maybe the way to 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.130
 Drink or 2 yes we will then 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.120
 Still, I think was certainly his or her 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.070
 a weekend or so beautiful today 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.420
 invited guests could get a picture of themselves 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.220
 the route between the station 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.530
 make gummersbach and meinzhagen 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.229
 the 27 years at least for the 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.909
 People have lain fallow many 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.710
 the passengers still knew the route 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.350
 from old times because they were then 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.110
 regular passengers either between 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.530
 meinzhagen and in the oberbergischer circle 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.490
 or even the Ruhr area has been 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.450
 I express a compliment to you 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.450
 for her chic cap 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.900
 what a meaning and where do you have them 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.200
 this medium her so this cap is 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.210
 the original stationmaster cap of the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.410
 Mann's push by kierspel heinz willi 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.030
 potter on the then also exists 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.140
 in it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.750
 heinz-willi postage was long years too 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.960
 mayor in kierspe dedicated 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 true friend of course and he has me 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.410
 about six seven years ago this 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.060
 Please give me that cap 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.990
 he promised to wear this cap 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.940
 when the opening trip of the train from 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.290
 marine to meinzhagen and he had 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.360
 at that time also hoping for the first 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.510
 I'll go on and wear this cap 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.400
 today with great gratitude and pride 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.980
 I then went back in the 90s 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.900
 and then the new one 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.150
 century or millennium can one 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.430
 also use me strongly for it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.480
 that this track again 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.640
 is reactivated 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.030
 strong support also the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.250
 mayor of the local region of 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.200
 gummersbach bisky aspen also about it 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.850
 out and then it finally has 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.520
 unfortunately 2005 by a government change 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.340
 to that the plans all 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.350
 were stopped and stop by this 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.360
 of course, was the continuation of the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.950
 from marienheide 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.160
 meinzhagen also stopped and the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.140
 further planning for kierspe and 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.720
 continue to bruges as well 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.290
 that is luckily in the last 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.050
 been revised characterized years has 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.130
 However, a delay of exactly 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.780
 raise ten years 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.790
 because the opening phase after 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.650
 marienheide was exactly on 18 april 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.360
 2004 and that is unfortunately ten now 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.920
 years but we do not want to go back 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:36.520
 look forward but forward we are happy 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:38.290
 that the train now drives you into it's going 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.800
 namely on the new route going on here 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.940
 everything is new so now is the ride 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.739
 even to the end we are fast 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.370
 Arrived here in my days 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.900
 They enjoy it 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.170
 I found it very nice in front of everything 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.700
 on the way to experience the route now 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.570
 after many years where you do not know her 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.380
 answer for 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.870
 the train drove softly and you could hear 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.330
 practically no noise and time 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.700
 flies like in the air and I think so 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.800
 really great so have fun with all those 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.310
 the train in the future to cologne or otherwise 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.310
 wherever we want 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.720
 It was pleasant before all things it was 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.670
 a great pleasure because we are so long 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.280
 have long waited for this 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.110
 the railroad again between the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.270
 oberbergischen or in the Cologne area and 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.980
 meinzhagen drives and we have 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.240
 thank god and thanks 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.010
 therefore it is not only pleasant 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.480
 but only fantastic things we 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.220
 stand here at the station 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.170
 meinzhagen at the moment it is still 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.300
 provisionally we see that we are standing 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.870
 on a wooden platform 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.060
 but of course that will be very quick now 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.160
 be expanded with an attractive 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.600
 situation you speak the bridge to the 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.810
 then connects here our northern 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.640
 district about this train system here with 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.940
 the zob with the central bus station 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.160
 and thus at the same time within walking distance 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.200
 downtown so a better connection 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.880
 you can hardly imagine that takes 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.440
 there will be something else with the bridge now 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.780
 go out the tenders are 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.880
 The award is now done 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.820
 and we hope that we are yes 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.680
 already in 2014 that's us 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.990
 maybe until the middle of next year 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.200
 is a huge construction project then still 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.200
 hinbekommen 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.120
 I am so happy that this day 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.249
 finally came that the 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.499
 track now finally completely again 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:39.849
 normal train operation picks up that we 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.580
 at the hourly back to the 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.050
 oberbergischen circle gummersbach and at 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.819
 cologne are tethered 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.469
 I hope that this is used 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.330
 each of my show the possibility 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:51.879
 Use it is unreal 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.310
 to cologne drives to gummersbach drives 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.229
 and yes, as I said, I'm really happy 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.379
 and I have been waiting for it for years 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.340
 I have the last train here before and 27 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.110
 see you drive away 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.180
 I was just a kid today I am 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.560
 grown up and I am with the first day 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.469
 drove back to meinzhagen whole 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.210
 great really yes of course we want 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.460
 not just here in my days end 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.560
 So like today but we want to go through 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.270
 a connection to lüdenscheid 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.460
 bRUGES 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.339
 the planning is currently underway 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:26.589
 at the moment we are so focused on that we 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:27.909
 end of 2016 driver change 2016 there 

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:29.860
 can start operation 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:33.960
 between meinzhagen and lüdenscheid 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:36.550
 brugge infrastructure in that respect 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.650
 As far as the signal technology is concerned and what the 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.509
 Railway crossings still rebuilt 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.339
 be built or rebuilt 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:45.960
 the track bed so what you here 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:48.339
 see also that's done but the 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.779
 The overall challenge will be the 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.839
 railway crossings are the total have 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.919
 19 railway crossings on the section the 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.909
 we have to rebuild 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:59.069
 and that's what so much time in 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:02.589
 claim 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:05.139
 You can expect that in 2016 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:06.729
 For example, at the end of 2016 on New Year's Eve 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:08.529
 Could drive from the schaltjahr 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:12.689
 the silvesterknaller could then 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:12.689
 maybe enjoy in Cologne 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:23.780
 this video was presented to you by 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.780
 the city works of my tooth
