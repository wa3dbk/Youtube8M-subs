a little while ago somebody my good

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.650 
a little while ago somebody my good
friend<00:00:13.049> raps<00:00:13.290> said<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.860> me<00:00:14.009> sparks<00:00:14.910> if<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.360> put

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
friend raps said to me sparks if you put

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.040 
friend raps said to me sparks if you put
a<00:00:15.890> block<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.190> top<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.940> hopper<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.510> contains

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
a block on top of a hopper that contains

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.980 
a block on top of a hopper that contains
a<00:00:19.350> storage<00:00:19.800> space<00:00:20.000> his<00:00:21.000> example<00:00:21.449> is<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.570> furnace

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
a storage space his example is a furnace

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.650 
a storage space his example is a furnace
since<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.470> quite<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> cheap<00:00:22.859> one<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.130> make<00:00:23.310> and

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
since it's quite a cheap one to make and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.830 
since it's quite a cheap one to make and
it<00:00:24.660> reduces<00:00:25.170> lag<00:00:25.519> and<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.699> like<00:00:26.789> wow<00:00:26.970> ok<00:00:27.539> how

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it reduces lag and I was like wow ok how

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
it reduces lag and I was like wow ok how
and<00:00:28.140> he<00:00:28.230> said<00:00:28.410> well<00:00:28.560> basically<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:29.220> there's<00:00:29.880> a

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
and he said well basically if there's a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.690 
and he said well basically if there's a
block<00:00:30.539> above<00:00:31.050> if<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.250> storage<00:00:32.520> block

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
block above if there's a storage block

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.450 
block above if there's a storage block
above<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.120> hopper<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.840> will<00:00:34.140> stop<00:00:34.680> trying<00:00:35.280> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
above a hopper it will stop trying to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.729 
above a hopper it will stop trying to
detect<00:00:35.760> whether<00:00:36.180> there<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> block<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.440> an

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
detect whether there is a block like an

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709 
detect whether there is a block like an
item<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.219> picked<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.390> would<00:00:39.450> uses

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
item to be picked up and that would uses

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.660 
item to be picked up and that would uses
like<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.320> ah<00:00:40.410> well<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.100> sounds

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
like and it's like ah well that sounds

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
like and it's like ah well that sounds
feasible<00:00:42.530> yeah

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
feasible yeah

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.889 
feasible yeah
so<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.129> started<00:00:44.460> using<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.480> put<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.780> into

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
so I started using it and I put it into

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900 
so I started using it and I put it into
some<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.289> designs<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.890> reduce<00:00:47.160> lag<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> I

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
some of my designs to reduce lag and I

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.040 
some of my designs to reduce lag and I
figured<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.600> doesn't<00:00:48.930> work

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
figured you know if it doesn't work

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.660 
figured you know if it doesn't work
there's<00:00:49.469> no<00:00:49.590> harm<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.070> putting<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> block<00:00:50.489> on

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
there's no harm in putting a block on

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.319 
there's no harm in putting a block on
top<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> then<00:00:52.129> recently<00:00:53.129> Red<00:00:53.760> Lobster

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
top and then recently Red Lobster

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.959 
top and then recently Red Lobster
started<00:00:55.050> doing<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.620> told<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.550> friend<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
started doing it and told a friend of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.930 
started doing it and told a friend of
his<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.920> that<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.010> had<00:00:59.250> told<00:00:59.460> him<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.670> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
his that that I had told him that it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.090 
his that that I had told him that it
helped<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> was<00:01:01.649> thinking<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.039> don't

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
helped and so I was thinking I don't

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.460 
helped and so I was thinking I don't
actually<00:01:02.340> know<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.899> today<00:01:03.960> we're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
actually know so today we're going to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
actually know so today we're going to
test<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.040> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> try<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
test it we're going to try and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.179 
test it we're going to try and
conclusively<00:01:06.479> prove<00:01:06.960> whether<00:01:07.680> pudding

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
conclusively prove whether pudding

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.670 
conclusively prove whether pudding
hopper<00:01:08.610> putting<00:01:08.909> blocks<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.810> top<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
hopper putting blocks on top of the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
hopper putting blocks on top of the
hoppers<00:01:11.100> reduces<00:01:11.610> lag<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.600> I've<00:01:12.900> got<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> little

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
hoppers reduces lag so I've got a little

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.020 
hoppers reduces lag so I've got a little
experiment<00:01:13.650> here<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:14.220> on<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:14.520> side<00:01:14.760> I've

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
experiment here over on this side I've

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
experiment here over on this side I've
got<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> couple<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.780> things<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:17.009> we're

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
got a couple of things and we're

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.980 
got a couple of things and we're
basically<00:01:17.610> doing<00:01:17.939> here<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.900> get

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
basically doing here is if I just get

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.980 
basically doing here is if I just get
rid<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> this<00:01:19.380> hot<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> second<00:01:20.420> if<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.570> press

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
rid of this hot for a second if I press

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
rid of this hot for a second if I press
this<00:01:22.200> button<00:01:22.460> it's<00:01:23.460> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> summon<00:01:24.000> an<00:01:24.479> item

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
this button it's going to summon an item

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
this button it's going to summon an item
just<00:01:25.350> above<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> hopper<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> hub<00:01:26.700> will

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
just above the hopper and the hub will

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.399 
just above the hopper and the hub will
pick<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.930> its<00:01:28.049> lights<00:01:28.229> will

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
pick it up and then all its lights will

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
pick it up and then all its lights will
turn<00:01:28.439> on<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.100> Bob<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.640> definitely<00:01:30.090> picking

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
turn on so Bob is definitely picking

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.390 
turn on so Bob is definitely picking
that<00:01:30.479> item<00:01:30.810> up<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.890> we'll<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> hopper

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that item up and we'll put the hopper

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.969 
that item up and we'll put the hopper
back<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.729> top<00:01:32.880> now<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.390> idea<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.020> if

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
back on top now the idea here is that if

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.140 
back on top now the idea here is that if
it's<00:01:35.610> no<00:01:36.450> longer<00:01:36.720> detecting<00:01:37.939> items<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.060> be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it's no longer detecting items to be

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.850 
it's no longer detecting items to be
picked<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> won't<00:01:39.780> pick<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
picked up it won't pick them up so if I

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.140 
picked up it won't pick them up so if I
press<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.070> button<00:01:41.340> again<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> hopper<00:01:42.090> on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
press the button again with a hopper on

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480 
press the button again with a hopper on
top<00:01:42.210> which<00:01:42.479> has<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> storage<00:01:42.960> slot<00:01:43.340> you'll<00:01:44.340> see

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
top which has a storage slot you'll see

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.630 
top which has a storage slot you'll see
that<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.180> stone<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.509> bounces<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.640> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that the the stone just bounces out so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.789 
that the the stone just bounces out so
that<00:01:48.030> seems<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.600> correct<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that seems to be correct and what I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.910 
that seems to be correct and what I
found<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.340> far<00:01:50.640> appears<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.600> all<00:01:52.530> of

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
found so far appears to be that all of

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.039 
found so far appears to be that all of
the<00:01:53.040> things<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.520> side<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.090> hoppers

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the things on this side here so hoppers

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.709 
the things on this side here so hoppers
droppers<00:01:55.590> furnaces<00:01:56.719> dispensers

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
droppers furnaces dispensers

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.679 
droppers furnaces dispensers
interestingly<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.689> storage

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
interestingly if you have a storage

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
interestingly if you have a storage
minecart<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.380> top<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.890> stops<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.670> picking<00:02:02.909> it

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
minecart on top it stops it picking it

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.969 
minecart on top it stops it picking it
up<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.509> soon<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.810> break<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.229> picks<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.860> up

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
up as soon as I break it it picks it up

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.160 
up as soon as I break it it picks it up
and<00:02:05.189> also<00:02:06.180> basically<00:02:06.719> anything<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.079> an

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and also basically anything with an

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.710 
and also basically anything with an
inventory<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> seems<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.399> didn't<00:02:09.209> try<00:02:09.330> horses

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
inventory it seems I didn't try horses

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.690 
inventory it seems I didn't try horses
it<00:02:09.899> probably<00:02:10.200> won't<00:02:10.379> work<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.830> over<00:02:11.459> on<00:02:11.550> this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it probably won't work and over on this

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.729 
it probably won't work and over on this
side<00:02:11.940> we<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> couple<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.660> other<00:02:12.840> blocks

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
side we have a couple of other blocks

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.110 
side we have a couple of other blocks
so<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.099> already<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.459> with<00:02:14.730> his<00:02:14.879> air

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
so we already know that with his air

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.199 
so we already know that with his air
above<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.540> does<00:02:15.720> pick<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:16.079> so<00:02:16.200> all<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.590> these

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
above it does pick it up so all of these

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.160 
above it does pick it up so all of these
some<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.239> these<00:02:18.390> are<00:02:18.569> things<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.840> thought<00:02:18.930> might

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
some of these are things I thought might

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.869 
some of these are things I thought might
be<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.349> little<00:02:19.590> dubious<00:02:19.860> might<00:02:20.189> pick<00:02:20.430> things<00:02:20.670> up

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
be a little dubious might pick things up

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.179 
be a little dubious might pick things up
all<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.659> those<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.959> can<00:02:22.110> see<00:02:22.319> were<00:02:22.860> picked<00:02:23.099> up

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
all of those you can see were picked up

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.559 
all of those you can see were picked up
by<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.370> hopper<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.909> we've<00:02:24.030> got<00:02:24.209> an<00:02:24.329> enderchest

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
by the hopper so we've got an enderchest

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.470 
by the hopper so we've got an enderchest
an<00:02:24.959> anvil<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.379> jukebox<00:02:25.860> some<00:02:26.549> glass<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.209> stone

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
an anvil a jukebox some glass and stone

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.020 
an anvil a jukebox some glass and stone
and<00:02:27.689> a<00:02:27.840> half<00:02:27.870> slab<00:02:28.319> so<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.610> they're

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
and a half slab so that they're

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.080 
and a half slab so that they're
definitely<00:02:30.409> not<00:02:31.409> being<00:02:31.769> picked<00:02:32.040> up<00:02:32.340> if<00:02:32.670> there

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
definitely not being picked up if there

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.420 
definitely not being picked up if there
is<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.450> block<00:02:33.959> on<00:02:34.140> top<00:02:34.349> with<00:02:34.650> an<00:02:34.739> inventory<00:02:35.220> slot

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
is a block on top with an inventory slot

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.539 
is a block on top with an inventory slot
so<00:02:35.760> some<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.230> Minecraft<00:02:37.680> physics<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
so some of the Minecraft physics and

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.729 
so some of the Minecraft physics and
game<00:02:38.730> code<00:02:38.939> is<00:02:39.150> changing<00:02:39.840> when<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.560> put<00:02:40.709> a

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
game code is changing when you put a

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.220 
game code is changing when you put a
block<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.069> top<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.790> that's<00:02:42.629> good<00:02:42.900> at<00:02:43.079> least

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
block on top so that's good at least

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.289 
block on top so that's good at least
something's<00:02:43.680> happening<00:02:44.069> we<00:02:44.159> know<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.489> now

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
something's happening we know that now

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.430 
something's happening we know that now
I'm<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.629> set<00:02:45.810> up<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.989> little<00:02:46.079> experiment

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
I'm going to set up a little experiment

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.569 
I'm going to set up a little experiment
to<00:02:47.400> try<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.120> work<00:02:48.780> out<00:02:49.109> how<00:02:49.889> much<00:02:50.040> lag<00:02:50.370> is

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
to try and work out how much lag is

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.220 
to try and work out how much lag is
caused<00:02:50.790> by<00:02:50.970> hoppers<00:02:51.389> before<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:51.959> after

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
caused by hoppers before and after

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.569 
caused by hoppers before and after
blocks<00:02:52.440> are<00:02:52.650> placed<00:02:52.709> on<00:02:53.099> top<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.489> them<00:02:55.549> okay<00:02:56.549> so

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
blocks are placed on top of them okay so

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.699 
blocks are placed on top of them okay so
here<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.180> we're<00:02:57.420> currently<00:02:57.659> on<00:02:58.049> one<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.409> my

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
here we are we're currently on one of my

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.280 
here we are we're currently on one of my
multiplayer<00:02:59.370> servers<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.989> reason<00:03:01.200> I'm

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
multiplayer servers and the reason I'm

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.809 
multiplayer servers and the reason I'm
doing<00:03:01.409> this<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:02.099> in<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> bottom<00:03:02.579> right

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
doing this is that in the bottom right

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.369 
doing this is that in the bottom right
you<00:03:02.849> can<00:03:03.090> see<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.359> I've<00:03:03.450> put<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.959> server

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
you can see that I've put the server

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.250 
you can see that I've put the server
status<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:05.189> CPU<00:03:06.030> usage<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.540> RAM<00:03:06.780> usage<00:03:06.989> of

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
status the CPU usage and RAM usage of

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.750 
status the CPU usage and RAM usage of
the<00:03:07.379> server<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:07.950> we<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.069> see<00:03:08.280> what's<00:03:08.400> going<00:03:08.430> on

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the server so we can see what's going on

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.750 
the server so we can see what's going on
this<00:03:09.599> is<00:03:09.659> a<00:03:09.780> frag<00:03:10.500> net<00:03:10.709> server<00:03:10.980> running<00:03:11.430> one

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
this is a frag net server running one

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.460 
this is a frag net server running one
gigabyte<00:03:12.269> is<00:03:12.510> pretty<00:03:12.959> much<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.200> smallest

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
gigabyte is pretty much the smallest

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.809 
gigabyte is pretty much the smallest
server<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:13.859> have<00:03:13.889> so<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.430> thought<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.670> would<00:03:14.760> be

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
server I have so I thought it would be

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.369 
server I have so I thought it would be
the<00:03:14.939> best<00:03:15.150> for<00:03:15.359> seeing<00:03:16.639> changes<00:03:17.639> in<00:03:17.699> in<00:03:18.180> CPU<00:03:19.019> so

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
the best for seeing changes in in CPU so

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.039 
the best for seeing changes in in CPU so
we're<00:03:19.889> now<00:03:20.010> going<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.250> summon<00:03:20.660> 27,000<00:03:21.660> hoppers

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
we're now going to summon 27,000 hoppers

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.289 
we're now going to summon 27,000 hoppers
that's<00:03:22.260> 30<00:03:22.859> by<00:03:23.099> 30<00:03:23.340> by<00:03:23.519> 30<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.910> all<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
that's 30 by 30 by 30 and all the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.150 
that's 30 by 30 by 30 and all the
hoppers<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:25.019> have<00:03:25.169> an<00:03:25.260> air<00:03:25.410> block<00:03:25.590> above<00:03:25.949> them

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
hoppers can have an air block above them

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.640 
hoppers can have an air block above them
so<00:03:26.579> if<00:03:26.970> you<00:03:27.030> look<00:03:27.150> at<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:27.299> CPU<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:28.199> the<00:03:28.290> RAM

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
so if you look at the CPU and the RAM

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.349 
so if you look at the CPU and the RAM
and<00:03:28.889> also<00:03:29.099> my<00:03:29.220> frame<00:03:29.489> rate<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.879> top<00:03:30.060> right

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
and also my frame rate in the top right

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.839 
and also my frame rate in the top right
you<00:03:31.169> can<00:03:31.199> see<00:03:31.349> that<00:03:31.530> we<00:03:31.709> get<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.859> massive<00:03:32.579> frame

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
you can see that we get a massive frame

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.199 
you can see that we get a massive frame
rate<00:03:33.090> drop<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.709> CPU<00:03:35.430> jumps<00:03:35.699> up<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.819> 100%

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
rate drop and the CPU jumps up to 100%

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.210 
rate drop and the CPU jumps up to 100%
and<00:03:36.690> after<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> little<00:03:37.829> while<00:03:38.480> my<00:03:39.480> frames<00:03:40.349> level

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
and after a little while my frames level

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.550 
and after a little while my frames level
out<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.489> 30<00:03:41.730> which<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.299> what<00:03:42.449> is<00:03:42.900> locks<00:03:43.229> to<00:03:43.440> when

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
out of 30 which is what is locks to when

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.240 
out of 30 which is what is locks to when
I'm<00:03:43.650> recording<00:03:43.790> our<00:03:44.790> CPU<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.359> now<00:03:45.739> 93<00:03:46.739> percent

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
I'm recording our CPU is now 93 percent

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.550 
I'm recording our CPU is now 93 percent
or<00:03:47.430> thereabouts<00:03:47.609> which<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.479> pretty<00:03:48.989> crazy

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
or thereabouts which is pretty crazy

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.319 
or thereabouts which is pretty crazy
so<00:03:50.599> the<00:03:51.599> question<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.370> if<00:03:53.370> we<00:03:53.519> put<00:03:53.699> furnaces<00:03:54.239> on

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
so the question is if we put furnaces on

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.780 
so the question is if we put furnaces on
top<00:03:54.479> of<00:03:54.599> all<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.840> these<00:03:54.959> what<00:03:55.620> happens<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.310> I

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
top of all of these what happens and I

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.119 
top of all of these what happens and I
was<00:03:57.090> astonished<00:03:57.810> because<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.109> I<00:03:58.319> failed<00:03:58.949> this

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
was astonished because I I failed this

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.530 
was astonished because I I failed this
recording<00:03:59.609> that's<00:03:59.849> why<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.000> already<00:04:00.269> know<00:04:00.389> what

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
recording that's why I already know what

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.819 
recording that's why I already know what
happens<00:04:00.840> but<00:04:01.019> I'm<00:04:01.109> just<00:04:01.199> going<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.470> do<00:04:01.560> a<00:04:01.590> blind

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
happens but I'm just going to do a blind

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.680 
happens but I'm just going to do a blind
butter<00:04:02.220> if<00:04:02.639> I<00:04:02.940> summon<00:04:03.209> all<00:04:03.299> those<00:04:03.419> furnaces

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
butter if I summon all those furnaces

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.119 
butter if I summon all those furnaces
again<00:04:04.019> we<00:04:04.109> get<00:04:04.199> a<00:04:04.260> framerate<00:04:04.530> drop<00:04:04.829> as<00:04:04.949> all<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
again we get a framerate drop as all the

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.409 
again we get a framerate drop as all the
items<00:04:05.370> drop<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.699> then<00:04:05.879> if<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.120> look<00:04:06.269> at<00:04:06.359> the

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
items drop it then if you look at the

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:13.339 
items drop it then if you look at the
CPU<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.560> drops<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.810> 15%<00:04:10.669> that's<00:04:11.669> crazy<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.449> is

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
CPU it drops to 15% that's crazy that is

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.670 
CPU it drops to 15% that's crazy that is
a<00:04:13.669> huge<00:04:14.669> drop<00:04:15.060> we're<00:04:15.540> kind<00:04:15.720> of<00:04:15.750> up<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.900> 35<00:04:16.409> now

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
a huge drop we're kind of up to 35 now

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.330 
a huge drop we're kind of up to 35 now
but<00:04:16.949> it's<00:04:17.459> sort<00:04:17.669> of<00:04:17.760> it's<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.180> lot<00:04:18.570> lower

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
but it's sort of it's a lot lower

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.250 
but it's sort of it's a lot lower
considering<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.489> like<00:04:20.789> tile<00:04:21.479> entities<00:04:21.989> like

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
considering that like tile entities like

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.140 
considering that like tile entities like
furnaces<00:04:22.800> cause<00:04:23.219> more<00:04:23.520> like<00:04:23.700> than<00:04:23.909> regular

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
furnaces cause more like than regular

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.290 
furnaces cause more like than regular
blocks<00:04:24.719> as<00:04:24.900> far<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.139> I'm<00:04:25.229> aware<00:04:25.529> and<00:04:25.909> that's

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
blocks as far as I'm aware and that's

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.029 
blocks as far as I'm aware and that's
that's<00:04:27.780> fantastic<00:04:28.050> now<00:04:28.620> obviously<00:04:28.919> you're

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
that's fantastic now obviously you're

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.219 
that's fantastic now obviously you're
not<00:04:29.129> gonna<00:04:29.220> have<00:04:29.370> 37,000<00:04:30.270> poppers<00:04:30.599> but<00:04:31.020> it's

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
not gonna have 37,000 poppers but it's

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.700 
not gonna have 37,000 poppers but it's
sort<00:04:31.410> of<00:04:31.470> a<00:04:31.620> way<00:04:32.129> of<00:04:32.690> exaggerating<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:34.110> lag

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
sort of a way of exaggerating the lag

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.860 
sort of a way of exaggerating the lag
cause<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:35.550> you<00:04:35.699> can<00:04:35.879> better<00:04:36.569> see<00:04:36.659> the

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
cause so you can better see the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.619 
cause so you can better see the
difference<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.909> I<00:04:39.060> get<00:04:39.120> rid<00:04:39.360> of<00:04:39.419> those

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
difference so if I get rid of those

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.029 
difference so if I get rid of those
furnaces<00:04:39.990> again<00:04:40.349> we<00:04:40.470> should<00:04:40.530> see<00:04:40.800> that<00:04:40.979> the

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
furnaces again we should see that the

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.930 
furnaces again we should see that the
the<00:04:41.789> frame<00:04:42.000> rate<00:04:42.180> rises<00:04:43.520> horribly<00:04:44.520> sorry<00:04:44.729> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
the frame rate rises horribly sorry the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.960 
the frame rate rises horribly sorry the
frame<00:04:45.180> rate<00:04:45.330> drops<00:04:45.599> under<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:46.139> CPU<00:04:46.530> will<00:04:46.650> rise

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
frame rate drops under the CPU will rise

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.540 
frame rate drops under the CPU will rise
quite<00:04:47.970> drastically<00:04:48.930> so<00:04:49.379> just<00:04:49.919> as<00:04:50.009> a<00:04:50.039> tester

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
quite drastically so just as a tester

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.830 
quite drastically so just as a tester
I'm<00:04:50.699> going<00:04:50.879> to<00:04:51.000> sell<00:04:51.180> them<00:04:51.300> some<00:04:51.419> ordinary

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
I'm going to sell them some ordinary

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.339 
I'm going to sell them some ordinary
blocks<00:04:52.349> on<00:04:52.979> top<00:04:53.310> as<00:04:53.520> well<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:54.990> can<00:04:55.110> see

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
blocks on top as well so you can see

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.939 
blocks on top as well so you can see
what<00:04:56.129> that<00:04:56.280> does

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
what that does

00:04:57.949 --> 00:04:59.899 
what that does
alright<00:04:58.949> let's<00:04:59.129> try<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.400> again<00:04:59.520> we're<00:04:59.819> going

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
alright let's try it again we're going

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.600 
alright let's try it again we're going
to<00:05:00.000> use<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.330> purple<00:05:00.930> wool<00:05:01.380> this<00:05:01.650> time<00:05:01.949> so<00:05:02.370> let's

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
to use a purple wool this time so let's

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.890 
to use a purple wool this time so let's
start<00:05:03.300> off<00:05:03.389> by<00:05:03.419> summoning<00:05:03.810> our<00:05:04.050> hoppers<00:05:05.419> so<00:05:06.419> oh

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
start off by summoning our hoppers so oh

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.089 
start off by summoning our hoppers so oh
my<00:05:07.500> goodness

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
my goodness

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:14.330 
my goodness
that<00:05:08.970> brings<00:05:09.300> us<00:05:09.630> up<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:11.030> 87<00:05:12.440> 91%<00:05:13.440> ram<00:05:14.009> so

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
that brings us up to 87 91% ram so

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.379 
that brings us up to 87 91% ram so
pretty<00:05:14.580> much<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.789> same<00:05:14.909> as<00:05:15.030> we<00:05:15.150> had<00:05:15.270> before

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
pretty much the same as we had before

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.620 
pretty much the same as we had before
and<00:05:15.810> if<00:05:16.289> we<00:05:16.409> bring<00:05:16.560> in<00:05:16.710> our<00:05:16.830> purple<00:05:17.340> wool<00:05:17.630> we

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
and if we bring in our purple wool we

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.270 
and if we bring in our purple wool we
should<00:05:19.020> see<00:05:19.259> that<00:05:19.289> there<00:05:19.590> really<00:05:19.620> isn't<00:05:20.009> any

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
should see that there really isn't any

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.379 
should see that there really isn't any
difference

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
difference

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539 
going to end soon there we go so we're

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.909

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
still at 100% CPU so in conclusion

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:39.100

any<00:05:59.159> difference<00:05:59.219> but<00:05:59.729> if<00:05:59.880> you're<00:06:00.000> just<00:06:00.090> trying

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
any difference but if you're just trying

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:02.659 
any difference but if you're just trying
to<00:06:00.419> get<00:06:00.930> rid<00:06:01.139> of<00:06:01.169> lag<00:06:01.440> wherever<00:06:01.860> you<00:06:02.069> can<00:06:02.310> and

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
to get rid of lag wherever you can and

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.279 
to get rid of lag wherever you can and
this<00:06:03.389> is<00:06:03.449> definitely<00:06:03.750> something<00:06:04.020> worth

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
this is definitely something worth
