 hope unboxing also does hd pvr 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.099
 necessary robert portable game with 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 deeds eg smoking you can record gameplay 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.150
 from your game console or your game pc and that 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.410
 everything in full hd 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 and then can upload clips 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.400
 to youtube 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.350
 compared to earlier models hd pvr 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.570
 The roccat has the advantage that it 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.580
 is completely portable and therefore not a PC 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.199
 or laptop need more to your game 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.579
 to make recordings 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.890
 In addition, we also have a 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.210
 built-in audio mixer and on this you can 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.489
 for example the microphone of your headset 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.640
 connect so that you also have your own child 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.660
 the word my recordings 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.399
 we will now first go to tell 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.320
 what we found in the box 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.239
 first of course the hd pvr it too 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.879
 this hardware is a lot smaller than 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.770
 from previous hd pvr models 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 nowadays get the nutrition via usb 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.940
 she comes with a usb power cable 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.289
 that is quite a progress because correct 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.120
 to doctor used or is 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.250
 problem with the hd pvr 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.760
 also see an hdmi cable with which 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.780
 Your Kempen will be able to connect and component 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.820
 av adapter 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.560
 you need this for example if you have the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.390
 want to connect playstation 3 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.299
 the playstation 3 has deeds that output 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.600
 secured and therefore also have one 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.100
 component room at may preseli 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.290
 we also find a quick start guide 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.229
 which thing slaats procedure stands for 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.060
 you have http on it, this is possible 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.100
 two ways you can both standalone 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.140
 make it work as connect to the PC 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.790
 for the latter you have to go 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 go to the car on website in the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.270
 so-called hubble capture software 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.470
 free to download 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.750
 I would need to show which 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.360
 connections or there 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.210
 is there a hdmi input for it 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.560
 connecting your hd kent puzzle 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.540
 for example the xbox one 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.120
 you connect your television to the hdmi 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.920
 have practically all televisions 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.870
 Present namibiÃ« connection so 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.369
 that should not be a problem 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.290
 do you have a playstation 3 then close 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.050
 him on the av component input with the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.640
 cables in the bee ago 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.880
 and lastly the back we see the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.380
 USB connection with the USB power cable 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.090
 then make connections with your child could 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.039
 or your PC 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.500
 we are going to the front here too 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.690
 see a usb connection again 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.310
 but now of the type A on which you 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.050
 for example, a USB stick 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.290
 so that you can record directly on one 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.030
 USB stick and microphone input 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.209
 immunity recording your game play 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.200
 the game comment directly record that 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.060
 being able to do well is also one 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.530
 built-in audio mixer 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.420
 which your input level of the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.650
 can determine the microphone 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.300
 with 1 push of a button you can change the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.460
 also switch the microphone off again 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.200
 you have found the right settings 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.360
 then you can get it up and how we do it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.310
 not do it again next time if you 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.950
 have everything connected picture easily 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.060
 a usb stick on the hd pvr suggests 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.130
 you wait a while until it becomes 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.750
 initialized that you can see as soon as the 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.010
 led green 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.920
 now you just need him on the home button 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.780
 and can start recording 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.630
 your gameplay will be directly on the usb stick 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.220
 written with mp4 format 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.020
 as soon as i'm done with gamer you press 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.520
 press the red button again and you can 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.580
 images on a pc or mac 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.260
 work on upload to youtube 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.260
 I will briefly show you around 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.370
 room 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.240
