00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.880
 or the next one from minecraft and we're in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.820
 another tutorial on how to make a lamp 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.310
 an automatic lamp or if a lamp 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.890
 automatic that is made by a sensor 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.689
 daylight is a rich that creates a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.369
 logical video signal that depends on the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.199
 sunlight or the one of the good that 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.219
 is not I'm not going to do a test yes 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.960
 but but because I have the cycle of 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.160
 daylight so you're never going to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.530
 to become night 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 and it may not happen anything but I'm going 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.510
 to explain more or less how it works 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.050
 all that we are going to put here this 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.809
 the light sensor what it does 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.300
 is to give energy when the sun is 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:59.980
 is not the sun is not giving us energy 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:03.219
 for example here the stone is activated 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.619
 reddish to activate the piston because the 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:09.550
 Sun gives power to the panel 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.490
 this light and activates what has been 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.610
 the piston 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.409
 but when there is no sun this right now 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.729
 It's going to happen because as I say, I do not have 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.710
 activated that this deactivates is going to 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.229
 deactivate the piston because there is no light 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.950
 What is a light panel? 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.579
 understanding 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.890
 this so when it's off, take advantage 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.110
 then we take advantage of that to do the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.100
 lamp like this we do it good let's go 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:45.439
 to put it say the quartz well for 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:51.020
 do this fast this and we're going to put 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:53.750
 well three like this end and we put here a 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.619
 block it and we put stairs 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.619
 serving up 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:08.080
 now let's put the lamp here and 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.080
 let's put the stairs sorry 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.080
 great now what we are going to do is 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 put sticky sticky piston watching 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 down or be good but while 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.470
 from here from here 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.000
 and how am I going to put the light sensor on 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.240
 day to activate the piston 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.760
 he just activated it 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.860
 ok since I just activated it which is 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.090
 what is going to happen we are going to put a 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.360
 stone block crucis here as you can see 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.570
 we can appear this as you see 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.170
 It is on what is still the the 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.410
 lamps are you because the sun is 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.020
 giving energy to the panel is what it does 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.840
 that the piston activates is activated and 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.360
 the reddish stone that we say is the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.120
 source of energy that from here when 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.090
 when the sun is removed or becomes 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.310
 night the light sensor stops working 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.420
 so the piston rises and and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.310
 would be here in what is the wall already 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.190
 learn and automatically it would be more or 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.640
 less so it is done at night and 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.640
 clothing 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.300
 but as the day is going to activate it was 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.250
 but if it is night will be activated is 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.740
 a lamp very easy to make the sensor 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.600
 daylight I think that is harnessed 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:35.250
 Wall things can also be done with 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.630
 a farm circuit or things like that and nothing 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.390
 guys, I hope you liked the 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.720
 video you know if they give line this is 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.120
 thank and then if you are not subscribed 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.820
 subscribe to the channel are many things 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.290
 tutorial and if all these things many 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.120
 things to shit and then a fact and when 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.360
 we see until the next video of the 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.360
 like
