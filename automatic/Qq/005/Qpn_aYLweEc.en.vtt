I<00:03:12.280> went<00:03:13.280> with<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.430> six<00:03:13.790> inch<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.329> I'm<00:03:14.930> hoping

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I went with a six inch and I'm hoping

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.729 
I went with a six inch and I'm hoping
that<00:03:16.190> I<00:03:16.730> can<00:03:16.970> keep<00:03:17.540> my<00:03:17.840> standard<00:03:18.530> velocity

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
that I can keep my standard velocity

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.909 
that I can keep my standard velocity
rounds<00:03:19.669> from<00:03:19.790> going<00:03:20.470> supersonic<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.620> hearing

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
rounds from going supersonic and hearing

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:22.300 
rounds from going supersonic and hearing
that

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
that

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.750 
that
crack<00:03:22.520> when<00:03:23.090> I<00:03:23.120> use<00:03:23.510> my<00:03:23.540> suppressor<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.760> and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
crack when I use my suppressor that and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.960 
crack when I use my suppressor that and
I<00:03:25.940> wanted<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.300> keep<00:03:26.599> the<00:03:26.870> build<00:03:27.430> kind<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.580> small

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
I wanted to keep the build kind of small

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.670 
I wanted to keep the build kind of small
and<00:03:29.440> when<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.470> use<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:32.050> when<00:03:33.050> I<00:03:33.080> use<00:03:33.410> the

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
and when I use the when I use the

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.339 
and when I use the when I use the
suppressor<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.940> adds<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.420> other<00:03:35.540> 5<00:03:35.870> inches<00:03:36.290> of

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
suppressor it adds the other 5 inches of

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
inch barrel and the 5 inch suppressor I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.800 
inch barrel and the 5 inch suppressor I
am<00:03:51.050> keeping<00:03:51.590> that<00:03:51.769> barrel<00:03:52.480> about<00:03:53.480> what<00:03:53.690> the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
am keeping that barrel about what the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:02.559 
am keeping that barrel about what the
factory<00:03:54.260> setting<00:03:54.620> was<00:04:00.489> that's<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.610> nice<00:04:01.790> it's<00:04:02.450> a

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
factory setting was that's a nice it's a

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:21.840 
factory setting was that's a nice it's a
heavy<00:04:02.930> heavy<00:04:03.230> barrel<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:04.100> nice

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.510 

and<00:04:22.850> now<00:04:23.390> I'm<00:04:23.600> pretty<00:04:24.560> much<00:04:24.740> where<00:04:25.040> I<00:04:25.070> would<00:04:25.310> be

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
and now I'm pretty much where I would be

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.700 
and now I'm pretty much where I would be
if<00:04:26.000> I<00:04:26.390> would<00:04:26.450> have<00:04:26.720> ordered<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.140> 10<00:04:27.380> inch<00:04:27.560> I

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
if I would have ordered the 10 inch I

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.340 
if I would have ordered the 10 inch I
met<00:04:27.920> probably<00:04:28.160> about<00:04:28.400> 11<00:04:28.820> inches<00:04:28.970> here<00:04:29.420> so<00:04:29.570> I'm

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
met probably about 11 inches here so I'm

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.740 
met probably about 11 inches here so I'm
only<00:04:30.560> an<00:04:30.710> inch<00:04:30.980> further<00:04:31.370> out<00:04:31.730> rather<00:04:32.390> than<00:04:32.660> the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
only an inch further out rather than the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.420 
only an inch further out rather than the
5<00:04:32.990> inches<00:04:33.410> further<00:04:33.650> out<00:04:33.920> than<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.190> would<00:04:34.400> have

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
5 inches further out than I would have

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.970 
5 inches further out than I would have
been<00:04:34.670> had<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.210> got<00:04:35.420> the<00:04:35.570> 10<00:04:35.750> inch<00:04:35.930> barrel<00:04:36.140> so

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
been had I got the 10 inch barrel so

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.390 
been had I got the 10 inch barrel so
we'll<00:04:37.640> see<00:04:37.850> hopefully<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.750> keep<00:04:39.080> those

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
we'll see hopefully I can keep those

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.480 
we'll see hopefully I can keep those
those<00:04:40.400> rounds<00:04:41.060> from<00:04:41.240> going<00:04:42.010> supersonic<00:04:43.010> and

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
those rounds from going supersonic and

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.950 
those rounds from going supersonic and
hearing<00:04:43.730> that<00:04:43.850> crack<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.420> can<00:04:44.570> keep<00:04:44.780> this

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
hearing that crack and I can keep this

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.100 
hearing that crack and I can keep this
quiet<00:04:45.790> or<00:04:46.790> as<00:04:46.940> quiet<00:04:47.360> as<00:04:47.540> if<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.780> was<00:04:47.930> using

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
quiet or as quiet as if I was using

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
quiet or as quiet as if I was using
subsonic<00:04:48.890> ammunition<00:04:49.960> not<00:04:50.960> real<00:04:51.290> well-versed

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
subsonic ammunition not real well-versed

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.070 
subsonic ammunition not real well-versed
in<00:04:52.400> all<00:04:52.610> of<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:53.980> particulars<00:04:54.980> of<00:04:55.280> what<00:04:56.150> keeps

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
in all of the particulars of what keeps

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.360 
in all of the particulars of what keeps
a<00:04:58.090> standard<00:04:59.090> velocity<00:04:59.240> bullet<00:05:00.100> subsonic<00:05:01.100> and

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
a standard velocity bullet subsonic and

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.330 
a standard velocity bullet subsonic and
I<00:05:01.610> talked<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.750> guys<00:05:02.930> over<00:05:03.140> at<00:05:03.440> Silencerco

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
I talked to the guys over at Silencerco

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.650 
I talked to the guys over at Silencerco
they<00:05:04.670> were<00:05:04.730> like<00:05:04.940> wow<00:05:05.120> there's<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:05.540> many

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
they were like wow there's so many

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.550 
they were like wow there's so many
variables<00:05:06.110> with<00:05:06.620> humidity<00:05:07.460> sea<00:05:08.390> level<00:05:08.900> all

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
variables with humidity sea level all

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.440 
variables with humidity sea level all
that<00:05:09.860> stuff<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.370> it's<00:05:10.550> it's<00:05:10.850> hard<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.210> say

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
that stuff that it's it's hard to say

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.070 
that stuff that it's it's hard to say
without<00:05:12.350> trying<00:05:12.860> it<00:05:13.220> what<00:05:14.090> kind<00:05:14.390> of<00:05:14.510> barrel<00:05:14.900> is

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
without trying it what kind of barrel is

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.980 
without trying it what kind of barrel is
gonna<00:05:15.200> keep<00:05:15.590> standard<00:05:16.100> velocity<00:05:16.270> subsonic<00:05:17.270> so

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
gonna keep standard velocity subsonic so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.230 
gonna keep standard velocity subsonic so
we'll<00:05:18.620> try<00:05:18.800> it<00:05:18.830> out<00:05:19.040> see<00:05:19.430> if<00:05:19.580> I<00:05:19.730> can<00:05:19.940> keep<00:05:20.120> it

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
we'll try it out see if I can keep it

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.750 
we'll try it out see if I can keep it
pretty<00:05:20.450> quiet<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:21.830> have<00:05:22.280> some<00:05:22.520> sonic

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
pretty quiet I have some sonic

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.100 
pretty quiet I have some sonic
ammunition<00:05:23.390> it's<00:05:23.540> just<00:05:23.660> a<00:05:23.750> little<00:05:23.960> more

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
ammunition it's just a little more

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.380 
ammunition it's just a little more
expensive<00:05:24.470> than<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:25.930> standard<00:05:26.930> velocity<00:05:28.390> so

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
expensive than the standard velocity so

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.440 
expensive than the standard velocity so
I<00:05:29.900> figured<00:05:30.830> I'd<00:05:30.920> give<00:05:31.130> you<00:05:31.220> guys<00:05:31.370> a<00:05:31.400> look<00:05:31.700> at<00:05:31.940> my

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
I figured I'd give you guys a look at my

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:33.760 
I figured I'd give you guys a look at my

back side of it one of the nice things

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.550 
back side of it one of the nice things
that<00:05:41.030> I've<00:05:41.240> noticed<00:05:41.480> about<00:05:41.720> this<00:05:42.050> trigger

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
that I've noticed about this trigger

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.120 
that I've noticed about this trigger
guard<00:05:42.800> here<00:05:43.010> is<00:05:43.160> it's<00:05:43.730> got<00:05:43.910> a<00:05:43.940> lot<00:05:44.240> thicker

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
guard here is it's got a lot thicker

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.080 
guard here is it's got a lot thicker
trigger<00:05:46.130> guard<00:05:46.430> than<00:05:47.330> on<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:49.070> regular<00:05:49.520> or<00:05:49.790> the

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090
