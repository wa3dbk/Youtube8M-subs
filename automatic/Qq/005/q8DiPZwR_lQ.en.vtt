00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
first I'm gonna jump off the ramp

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
first I'm gonna jump off the ramp
without<00:00:29.039> using<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.269> second<00:00:30.630> time<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
without using it and the second time I

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.060 
without using it and the second time I
jump<00:00:31.050> off<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> ramp<00:00:31.500> I'm<00:00:31.650> gonna<00:00:31.800> try<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> use

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
jump off the ramp I'm gonna try to use

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.700 
jump off the ramp I'm gonna try to use
the<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.640> flying<00:00:32.910> glitch<00:00:33.360> or<00:00:33.930> trick<00:00:34.410> or

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the little flying glitch or trick or

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
whatever you want to call it so not only

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.450 
whatever you want to call it so not only
does<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.930> allow<00:00:37.170> you<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.500> fly<00:00:37.710> higher<00:00:37.980> but<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
does it allow you to fly higher but it

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.639 
does it allow you to fly higher but it
also<00:00:38.640> allows<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> fly<00:00:39.420> further<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:40.469> it's

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
also allows you to fly further now it's

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
also allows you to fly further now it's
kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> hard<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.250> explain<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.270> you're

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
kind of hard to explain and you're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.610 
kind of hard to explain and you're
probably<00:00:42.750> gonna<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.590> couple

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
probably gonna have to do it a couple

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.650 
probably gonna have to do it a couple
tries<00:00:44.040> before<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> timing<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
tries before you get the timing of it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750 
tries before you get the timing of it
because<00:00:46.500> you're<00:00:47.100> gonna<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> press

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
because you're gonna have to press

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
because you're gonna have to press
certain<00:00:48.270> buttons<00:00:48.629> at<00:00:48.840> certain<00:00:49.590> times<00:00:49.829> in

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
certain buttons at certain times in

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.130 
certain buttons at certain times in
order<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> work<00:00:50.969> alright<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
order for it to work alright so the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.840 
order for it to work alright so the
method<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.620> use<00:00:52.829> for<00:00:53.010> flying<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> ev32

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
method that I use for flying the ev32

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.110 
method that I use for flying the ev32
blur<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.570> I'm<00:00:54.989> assuming<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.469> l2<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.280> r2<00:00:56.430> are

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
blur and I'm assuming that l2 and r2 are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.819 
blur and I'm assuming that l2 and r2 are
the<00:00:57.420> buttons<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:57.930> used<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.379> your<00:00:58.469> super

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the buttons that's used for your super

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.130 
the buttons that's used for your super
ability<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> case<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.359> l1<00:01:00.870> will

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
ability if that's the case then l1 will

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.529 
ability if that's the case then l1 will
be<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.739> acceleration<00:01:02.399> button<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.359> going

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
be your acceleration button you're going

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.050 
be your acceleration button you're going
to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.719> holding<00:01:03.899> l1<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.769> entire<00:01:05.129> time<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.970> if

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
to be holding l1 the entire time and if

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
to be holding l1 the entire time and if
you<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> buttons<00:01:06.780> map<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.320> same<00:01:07.470> way

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you have the buttons map the same way

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.730 
you have the buttons map the same way
that<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.970> r1<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.619> the

the entire time if you do you will

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.389 
the entire time if you do you will
inevitably<00:02:05.060> create<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.270> tiny<00:02:06.600> black<00:02:06.960> hole<00:02:07.399> from

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
inevitably create a tiny black hole from

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609 
inevitably create a tiny black hole from
which<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.759> will<00:02:08.940> never<00:02:09.119> escape<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:10.259> way<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
which you will never escape the way that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.650 
which you will never escape the way that
I<00:02:10.709> did<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.160> would<00:02:11.340> let<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.849> r1<00:02:12.360> right

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
I did it I would let go of r1 right

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.520 
I did it I would let go of r1 right
before<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:13.050> pressed

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
or two and then after I pressed r2 I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500 
or two and then after I pressed r2 I
would<00:02:16.440> hold<00:02:16.620> our<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.160> again<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.850> order<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.270> do

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
would hold our one again in order to do

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.300 
would hold our one again in order to do
another<00:02:18.780> spin<00:02:19.140> like<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.890> mentioned<00:02:20.190> earlier

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
another spin like I mentioned earlier

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.830 
another spin like I mentioned earlier
it's<00:02:20.700> probably<00:02:20.970> gonna<00:02:21.060> take<00:02:21.300> you<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> few<00:02:21.510> tries

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
it's probably gonna take you a few tries

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.080 
it's probably gonna take you a few tries
in<00:02:22.170> order<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.530> get<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.830> timing<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.520> but<00:02:23.940> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
in order to get the timing of it but it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.449 
in order to get the timing of it but it
definitely<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.810> possible<00:02:25.440> as<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.069> see<00:02:26.340> in
