hey guys it's been almost two weeks

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.860 
hey guys it's been almost two weeks
since<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:05.250> mother<00:00:05.700> condors<00:00:06.330> been<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.779> the

since the mother condors been to the
nest<00:00:07.109> do<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:07.710> think<00:00:07.919> something<00:00:08.429> might<00:00:08.550> be

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
nest do you think something might be

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.530 
nest do you think something might be
wrong<00:00:08.700> with<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.120> egg

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
wrong with the egg

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.919 
wrong with the egg
something<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.469> it's<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.490> our<00:00:11.519> website<00:00:11.929> no

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
something is it's on our website no

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.650 
something is it's on our website no
really<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> mean<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.920> think<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.030> should<00:00:15.210> call<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
really I mean I think I should call the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.150 
really I mean I think I should call the
museum<00:00:15.750> see<00:00:16.289> if<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.619> normal

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
museum see if this is normal

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.859 
museum see if this is normal
Jared<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.970> want<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.300> egg<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> be<00:00:18.660> alive

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
Jared you want that egg to be alive

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.140 
Jared you want that egg to be alive
right<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.590> course<00:00:20.010> well<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:20.850> because

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
right of course well right now because

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.400 
right of course well right now because
you<00:00:21.300> don't<00:00:21.449> know<00:00:21.539> whether<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:21.990> or<00:00:22.140> not<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
you don't know whether it is or not it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.370 
you don't know whether it is or not it
exists<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.039> both<00:00:23.220> states<00:00:23.840> like<00:00:24.840> Schrodinger's

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
thought experiment that an Austrian

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.070 
thought experiment that an Austrian
physicist<00:00:30.179> came<00:00:30.420> up<00:00:30.599> with<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> help

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
physicist came up with to help

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.920 
physicist came up with to help
understand<00:00:31.619> quantum<00:00:32.009> states<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.149> he<00:00:33.420> imagined

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
understand quantum states so he imagined

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.410 
understand quantum states so he imagined
putting<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.260> cat<00:00:34.500> into<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> box<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.850> poisoned

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
putting a cat into a box with poisoned

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.590 
putting a cat into a box with poisoned
food<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.530> 50/50<00:00:38.430> chance<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.910> cat<00:00:39.120> eats<00:00:39.329> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
food as a 50/50 chance the cat eats it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.360 
food as a 50/50 chance the cat eats it
that<00:00:39.930> does<00:00:40.110> sound<00:00:40.290> rather<00:00:40.469> Austrian<00:00:41.100> so

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
that does sound rather Austrian so

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.340 
that does sound rather Austrian so
according<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> Schrodinger<00:00:42.480> if<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.989> open<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
according to Schrodinger if you open the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.470 
according to Schrodinger if you open the
box<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.040> confirm<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.640> cat<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.120> dead

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
box and confirm that the cat is dead

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.619 
box and confirm that the cat is dead
then<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> sense<00:00:46.710> you've<00:00:47.430> killed<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> cat<00:00:48.090> or

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
then in a sense you've killed the cat or

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.569 
then in a sense you've killed the cat or
if<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.500> call<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.829> museum<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
if you call the museum and get the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.290 
if you call the museum and get the
information<00:00:50.820> then<00:00:51.809> you've<00:00:52.350> killed<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> egg

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
information then you've killed the egg

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.610 
information then you've killed the egg
no<00:00:54.300> that's<00:00:55.199> silly

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
no that's silly

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
no that's silly
is<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:57.620> okay<00:00:59.840> I'm<00:01:00.840> just<00:01:00.989> gonna<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.410> it

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
is it okay I'm just gonna think about it

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.910 
is it okay I'm just gonna think about it
for<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> minute<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:06.350> think<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.710> made<00:01:07.890> a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
for a minute I think I just made a

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.390 
for a minute I think I just made a
mistake<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.909> was<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> museum<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:10.220> decided<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
mistake that was the museum I decided to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.210 
mistake that was the museum I decided to
call<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.970> check<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> Condor<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.220> they

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
call and check on the Condor and they

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
call and check on the Condor and they
said<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.909> very<00:01:14.970> unlikely<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
said that it's very unlikely that the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.410 
said that it's very unlikely that the
Condor<00:01:16.290> egg<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.860> still<00:01:17.070> alive<00:01:17.369> but<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.030> phone

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Condor egg is still alive but my phone

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.499 
Condor egg is still alive but my phone
call<00:01:18.659> itself<00:01:19.580> drew<00:01:20.580> their<00:01:20.759> attention<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
call itself drew their attention to the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
call itself drew their attention to the
low<00:01:21.630> viewing<00:01:21.990> numbers<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> they've<00:01:22.770> decided

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
low viewing numbers and they've decided

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640 
low viewing numbers and they've decided
to<00:01:23.280> take<00:01:23.520> down<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> cameras<00:01:24.210> today<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> by

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
to take down the cameras today so by

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.890 
to take down the cameras today so by
making<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> phone<00:01:26.100> call<00:01:26.549> you've<00:01:27.090> most<00:01:27.420> likely

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
making the phone call you've most likely

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.719 
making the phone call you've most likely
killed<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.259> Condor<00:01:28.650> egg<00:01:28.680> oh<00:01:29.009> come<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.610> mean

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
killed the Condor egg oh come on I mean

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.920 
killed the Condor egg oh come on I mean
that<00:01:29.880> sure<00:01:30.090> digger<00:01:30.329> stuffs<00:01:30.570> all<00:01:30.720> just

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that sure digger stuffs all just

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.630 
that sure digger stuffs all just
theoretical<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.740> doesn't<00:01:32.100> apply<00:01:32.250> here

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
theoretical it doesn't apply here

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120 
theoretical it doesn't apply here
doesn't<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.509> mean<00:01:33.720> look<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.049> Richard<00:01:34.380> he

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
doesn't it I mean look at Richard he

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
doesn't it I mean look at Richard he
didn't<00:01:35.430> know<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.939> he<00:01:36.150> had<00:01:36.240> tested<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
didn't know that he had tested on a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.039 
didn't know that he had tested on a
hooli<00:01:37.140> computer<00:01:37.549> until<00:01:38.549> Monahan<00:01:39.390> opened<00:01:39.600> that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
hooli computer until Monahan opened that

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.929 
hooli computer until Monahan opened that
box<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.470> emails<00:01:40.799> right<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.340> Richard<00:01:41.610> was<00:01:41.729> both

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
box of emails right so Richard was both

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.480 
box of emails right so Richard was both
innocent<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> guilty<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.829> as<00:01:43.950> soon<00:01:44.280> as

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
innocent and guilty but as soon as

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.330 
innocent and guilty but as soon as
Monahan<00:01:45.060> opened<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.659> box

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
Monahan opened that box

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.149 
Monahan opened that box
it<00:01:47.340> made<00:01:47.759> Richard<00:01:48.240> guilty<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.380> mean<00:01:49.590> by

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
it made Richard guilty but I mean by

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.440 
it made Richard guilty but I mean by
that<00:01:50.280> logic<00:01:50.460> anyone<00:01:50.939> who<00:01:51.030> goes<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> an

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that logic anyone who goes to an

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.120 
that logic anyone who goes to an
open-casket<00:01:51.840> funeral<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> murderer

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
open-casket funeral is a murderer

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.530 
open-casket funeral is a murderer
