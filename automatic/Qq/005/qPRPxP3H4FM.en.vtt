00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.430 

I<00:00:06.270> thought<00:00:07.270> that<00:00:07.480> the<00:00:07.569> English<00:00:07.930> version<00:00:08.350> of

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
I thought that the English version of

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.799 
I thought that the English version of
escape<00:00:08.830> from<00:00:08.950> New<00:00:09.130> York<00:00:09.340> for<00:00:09.520> the<00:00:09.610> c64<00:00:10.210> wasn't

running out of negative adjectives here
in<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.799> first<00:02:27.010> level<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.430> steer<00:02:27.819> the<00:02:27.940> glider

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
in the first level you steer the glider

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:29.880 
in the first level you steer the glider
with<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.510> directional<00:02:29.019> pad<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.470> deploy<00:02:29.709> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
with the directional pad and deploy the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.339 
with the directional pad and deploy the
brakes<00:02:30.129> using<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.580> control<00:02:30.940> button<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:32.230> the

brakes using the control button and the
steering<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> little<00:02:33.280> stiff<00:02:33.610> but<00:02:33.640> not<00:02:33.879> too

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
steering is a little stiff but not too

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.300 
steering is a little stiff but not too
bad<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:35.080> problem<00:02:35.290> comes<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:35.860> with<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.069> brakes

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
bad the problem comes in with the brakes

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.580 
bad the problem comes in with the brakes
however<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:37.569> you<00:02:37.780> don't<00:02:37.959> deploy<00:02:38.170> them<00:02:38.440> at<00:02:38.560> just

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
however if you don't deploy them at just

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.430 
however if you don't deploy them at just
the<00:02:38.950> right<00:02:39.099> time<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.790> will<00:02:39.910> crash<00:02:40.440> deploy

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
the right time you will crash deploy

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.930 
the right time you will crash deploy
them<00:02:41.650> too<00:02:41.799> early<00:02:41.830> in<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.400> plane<00:02:42.610> will<00:02:42.790> crash

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
them too early in the plane will crash

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.990 
them too early in the plane will crash
before<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.450> even<00:02:43.599> reaches<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.170> skyscraper

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
before it even reaches the skyscraper

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.039 
before it even reaches the skyscraper
deploy<00:02:46.000> them<00:02:46.150> too<00:02:46.329> late<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:46.720> you'll<00:02:46.840> ride

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
deploy them too late and you'll ride

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.830 
deploy them too late and you'll ride
right<00:02:47.290> over<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.590> skyscrapers<00:02:48.400> edge

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
right over the skyscrapers edge

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.789 
right over the skyscrapers edge
furthermore<00:02:49.840> if<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:49.989> don't<00:02:50.230> line<00:02:50.409> the<00:02:50.560> glider

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
furthermore if you don't line the glider

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.650 
furthermore if you don't line the glider
up<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.310> right<00:02:51.610> you'll<00:02:51.879> miss<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.269> building

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
up just right you'll miss the building

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.199 
up just right you'll miss the building
and<00:02:52.780> crash<00:02:53.459> admittedly<00:02:54.459> landing<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.090> plane

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
and crash admittedly landing the plane

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.180 
and crash admittedly landing the plane
is<00:02:55.510> not<00:02:55.629> as<00:02:55.780> hard<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.140> say<00:02:56.349> Top<00:02:56.650> Gun<00:02:56.860> for<00:02:57.099> the

is not as hard to say Top Gun for the
nest<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:57.730> it's<00:02:57.879> still<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.090> pain<00:02:58.359> in<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.480> ass

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
nest but it's still a pain in the ass

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.259 
nest but it's still a pain in the ass
then<00:02:59.769> there's<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.099> second<00:03:00.519> levels<00:03:00.790> controls

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
then there's the second levels controls

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.520 
then there's the second levels controls
and<00:03:01.540> here's<00:03:01.720> where<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> real<00:03:02.200> clusterfuck

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
and here's where the real clusterfuck

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.309 
and here's where the real clusterfuck
occurs<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:04.180> move<00:03:04.390> snake<00:03:04.660> left<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.170> right

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
occurs you move snake left and right

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.869 
occurs you move snake left and right
with<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> directional<00:03:06.129> pad<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.519> control

allows you to jump but the controls are

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.180 
allows you to jump but the controls are
so<00:03:10.090> stiff<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:11.019> you<00:03:11.140> can<00:03:11.319> hardly<00:03:11.590> move<00:03:11.829> snake

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
so stiff that you can hardly move snake

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.979 
so stiff that you can hardly move snake
left<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:12.670> right<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.120> sometimes<00:03:13.720> when<00:03:13.900> you

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
left and right and sometimes when you

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
hit the control button he won't even

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.880 
hit the control button he won't even
jump<00:03:15.910> or<00:03:16.569> if<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.840> hit<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.109> control<00:03:17.530> button

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.740 
jump or if you hit the control button
too<00:03:18.069> often<00:03:18.519> he'll<00:03:18.700> jump<00:03:18.970> two<00:03:19.120> or<00:03:19.269> three<00:03:19.450> times

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
too often he'll jump two or three times

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.479 
too often he'll jump two or three times

make the game at all

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.400 
make the game at all
and<00:05:15.669> the<00:05:16.300> only<00:05:16.450> reason<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.960> game<00:05:17.169> is<00:05:17.320> gonna

take a half an hour to an hour to plays

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.180 
take a half an hour to an hour to plays
because<00:05:19.450> the<00:05:19.630> controls<00:05:20.050> are<00:05:20.229> so<00:05:20.350> fucked<00:05:20.710> up
