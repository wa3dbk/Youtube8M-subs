00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.929
 Portuguese to right 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.599

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.950
 Mariano Marcelo Jurar Rodrigues Paulinho 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.869
 everton ribeiro talks bap benzema this 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.179
 Ok, let's go to the game. 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.069
 then he came with a touch of ball 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.209
 modric ti uploaded and launched alexandre 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:11.180
 population not'm Everton Ribeiro 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.150
 who crossed to the problem area that made 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.980
 this headed goal was 1-0 for 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.650
 to talk we were starting to look 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.200
 very badly our game but we managed 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.470
 and up to 20 minutes is not like 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.160
 if you see that there has been progress 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.389
 Right? 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.680
 before the match against the 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.810
 evident that there 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.420
 in one more pitch Benzema launched with the 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.579
 law a triangle cry that crossed to 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.950
 area and the duck scored the goal we were 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.620
 losing from 2 to 0 and then more 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.530
 about 20 minutes right there 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.049
 at 43 and 55 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.170
 I decided to play a little bit, I did not 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.010
 the ball with lewandowski has this turn of 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.769
 body 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.400
 I threw the blush pits that came in the line 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:03.590
 He crossed from bottom to the area and made this goal 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.209
 and I was 2 to 1 in prof speak that right 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.930
 we managed to make his goal with 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.900
 head ribÃ©ry is one thing is not so 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.450
 constant so it is not very normal but it is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.950
 That's when you see all three goals until 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.620
 now they have left crossroads 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.590
 in one more plastic throw that in the line 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.810
 background I crossed to the area 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.420
 I thought he nodded perfectly 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.510
 in the corner of the goalkeeper, that's it guys 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.360
 we were tying to talk about it 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.650
 the pain of the touch team my goal and the 60 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.640
 minutes and 28 seconds approximately 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.629
 game 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.700
 he plays very well even if he speaks and 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.190
 there you will see the replay I think 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.200
 reached the bottom line crossed to 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.510
 lewandowski scored until I decided 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.019
 stop crossing I said it's not getting 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.599
 boring we're playing for more 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.540
 for fun is not even positioned then 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:03.319
 I'm going to play normal and the alexandre duck 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.430
 arrived crossed and the benzema was played by 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:10.639
 Head, I 'm going to change it for a little bit there. 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.730
 I speak neither of the player but if much of the game 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:16.010
 It's fifa is a lot of it and one more 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.500
 goal than to speak in 4 to 2 for him 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:22.160
 80 minutes and 57 seconds again 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.789
 in about one more throw the duck 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.370
 on the logo on the bottom line he is 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:31.720
 I gave the cart and the judge whistled it 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.699
 penalty prof speak in thesis 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.430
 I think it was really cheap 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:42.139
 so yellow for the dante but that's it 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.840
 Let's believe, let's go, I know. 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.940
 I watch the games of the end of the videos of the 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.680
 that talk he always beat in that field 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.460
 We were in part, I told him. 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.260
 huh 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.570
 and I jumped but my keeper did not catch 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.820
 so this is amazing is like the goalie 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:02.210
 It can be so naive because it was right 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.090
 in the right corner but nothing that would hinder 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.599
 then our our fun plus a defeat 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.940
 and pleasure then we have a balance of 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:16.690
 two defeats and one win 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.690
 negative balance is -1 and 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.870
 Those bids go deep in there and you go 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.150
 seeing the reality of how the game was, right? 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.100
 actually talking to us just gave it is 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.730
 I managed to make two goals still 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:36.450
 Nothing so well deserved head to speak 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:39.660
 The truth, and then guys, I still left. 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.030
 the bids at the end there is for you to see 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.930
 a little like what was in the game 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.150
 true, right? 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.640

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.520
