let's test out Oh would it max it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.179 
let's test out Oh would it max it
checked<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.960> yet<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.439> wondering<00:01:16.979> the

checked it yet as you are wondering the
too<00:01:17.369> many<00:01:17.580> items<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:19.170> point<00:01:19.409> I

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
too many items for the one point I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.660 
too many items for the one point I
pre-release<00:01:20.070> part<00:01:20.400> 3<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.939> been<00:01:21.920> has<00:01:22.920> been<00:01:23.189> put

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
pre-release part 3 has been has been put

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.929 
pre-release part 3 has been has been put
in<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> crystal<00:01:26.400> blocking<00:01:26.729> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
in and this is the crystal blocking I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.880 
in and this is the crystal blocking I
don't<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:27.960> know<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.619> better

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
don't actually know what that is better

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
don't actually know what that is better

let's let's put it down so also this is
the<00:01:34.320> black<00:01:34.650> goo<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:36.270> were<00:01:36.420> trying<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
the black goo that we were trying to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.899 
the black goo that we were trying to
find<00:01:38.329> ok<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.390> let's<00:01:39.659> say<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.890> break<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.380 

well<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> appears<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:45.990> breakable<00:01:46.530> but

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
well it appears that it is breakable but

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
well it appears that it is breakable but
oh<00:01:52.430> ok<00:01:54.229> let's<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.470> i<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> darn<00:01:56.490> pickaxe

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
oh ok let's do i do like a darn pickaxe

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.020 
oh ok let's do i do like a darn pickaxe
or<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.610> some<00:01:59.759> kind<00:02:00.000> of

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
or this is it is do it is some kind of

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.999 
or this is it is do it is some kind of
like<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.210> new<00:02:00.420> texture<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.079> bedrock

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.619 

well<00:02:07.009> it<00:02:07.100> doesn't<00:02:07.280> appear<00:02:07.759> to<00:02:07.820> be<00:02:07.939> breaking

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
well it doesn't appear to be breaking

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.089 
well it doesn't appear to be breaking
and<00:02:08.869> you<00:02:09.019> can<00:02:09.200> walk<00:02:09.379> through<00:02:09.440> it<00:02:11.319> okay<00:02:12.319> but<00:02:12.950> now

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
and you can walk through it okay but now

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.190 
and you can walk through it okay but now
let's<00:02:13.129> test<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.790> enchanted<00:02:14.720> X<00:02:15.129> and<00:02:16.129> uh<00:02:17.200> can

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
let's test the enchanted X and uh can

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.100 
let's test the enchanted X and uh can
you<00:02:18.230> see<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.769> changes<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.459> hotbar<00:02:20.150> like

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
you see that it changes the hotbar like

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.160 
you see that it changes the hotbar like
the<00:02:21.260> way<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.530> looks<00:02:22.480> what<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> lot<00:02:24.819> but<00:02:25.819> uh<00:02:26.170> let's

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
the way it looks what a lot but uh let's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.690 
the way it looks what a lot but uh let's
see<00:02:27.349> what<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.590> does<00:02:30.010> ok<00:02:31.010> so<00:02:31.069> we<00:02:31.370> are<00:02:31.400> now<00:02:31.670> using

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
see what it does ok so we are now using

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.160 
see what it does ok so we are now using
the<00:02:32.299> chats<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.080> would<00:02:33.920> attacks<00:02:34.250> let's<00:02:34.610> see<00:02:34.760> if

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the chats it would attacks let's see if

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.570 
the chats it would attacks let's see if
doesn't<00:02:36.170> hit<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.290> difference<00:02:36.860> well<00:02:37.370> it

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
doesn't hit the difference well it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.030 
doesn't hit the difference well it
doesn't<00:02:38.000> appear<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.780> do<00:02:39.170> anything<00:02:39.500> different

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
doesn't appear to do anything different

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:54.600 
doesn't appear to do anything different
oh<00:02:47.769> do<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.829> need<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.010> reload<00:02:49.579> it<00:02:49.819> somehow<00:02:50.150> oh

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.890 

let's<00:02:55.610> see<00:02:55.700> where<00:02:55.879> that<00:02:56.000> Edgar<00:02:56.450> been<00:02:56.629> weds

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
let's see where that Edgar been weds
