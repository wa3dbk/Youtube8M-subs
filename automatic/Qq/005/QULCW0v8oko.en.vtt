00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:20.100
 for a long time could not win the main 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:24.779
 time today for the team was like one 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.289
 whole all very nicely played in 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.260
 defense 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:35.719
 he did well rotax played revenue want 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:38.550
 congratulate pass your victory 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:43.050
 four games in a row to lose at home 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.210
 Of course it is in no gate climbs into 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.450
 how could we not actually set up 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.600
 guys like you did not say gaming 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.480
 disciplines have moments when it means 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 need to go on the attack when it means 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.199
 somewhere curl up this such i'm very 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.470
 I have not seen and of course this is abandoned 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.810
 Washers are we today again 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.360
 abandoned 0 general it seems to be 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.810
 advantage somewhere was on our side 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.780
 but 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.330
 nora would play so well against us 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.020
 all goalkeepers play very well the team 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.570
 very disciplined 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.259
 so they said they need internal 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.540
 yourself on each can customize not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.540
 only we have to tune you but you 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.700
 I have all kept your defense know 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.630
 what conclusions were drawn from the previous one 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.520
 match my guests 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.149
 seeing 4 new 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.100
 water did not prepare for each game 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.200
 all these 13 match every game 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.649
 This is set up in a high way 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.750
 happened to not 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:02.750
 this hockey everything happens today prepared 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.719
 by the night arranged to win I think that 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:14.450
 yes this victory should push guys 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:17.870
 and give confidence 1 zina angle and over 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.489
 the most important hockey ground is probably this 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.060
 slaughter you win drank not 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.420
 you score hard to play on defense and on 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.420
 goalkeeper
