as<00:00:04.509> you've<00:00:04.810> learned<00:00:05.050> in<00:00:05.230> our<00:00:05.290> knuckles<00:00:05.560> down

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:05.950 
as you've learned in our knuckles down

as you've learned in our knuckles down
logo<00:00:06.430> down<00:00:06.640> video<00:00:07.410> really<00:00:08.410> what<00:00:08.590> we're<00:00:08.679> trying

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800 
logo down video really what we're trying

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.410 
logo down video really what we're trying
to<00:00:08.889> do<00:00:09.040> to<00:00:09.190> control<00:00:09.550> the<00:00:09.670> club<00:00:09.880> face<00:00:10.059> is<00:00:10.090> all

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
to do to control the club face is all

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.060 
to do to control the club face is all
done<00:00:10.660> with<00:00:10.780> that<00:00:10.900> pulling<00:00:11.530> motion<00:00:11.710> of<00:00:11.980> the

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.070 
done with that pulling motion of the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.730 
done with that pulling motion of the
left<00:00:12.309> hand<00:00:12.610> is<00:00:12.730> very<00:00:13.150> important<00:00:13.749> for<00:00:14.349> that<00:00:14.530> to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
left hand is very important for that to

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.980 
left hand is very important for that to
be<00:00:14.860> trained<00:00:15.309> to<00:00:15.610> keep<00:00:15.789> the<00:00:15.969> clubface<00:00:16.390> moving

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
be trained to keep the clubface moving

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.300 
be trained to keep the clubface moving
in<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.110> correct<00:00:17.410> direction<00:00:17.470> to<00:00:18.010> keep<00:00:18.190> the

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
in the correct direction to keep the

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.849 
in the correct direction to keep the
clubface<00:00:18.640> stable<00:00:19.300> because<00:00:20.080> that's<00:00:20.619> the

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
clubface stable because that's the

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:22.560 
clubface stable because that's the
dominant<00:00:21.340> hand<00:00:21.580> in<00:00:21.849> controlling<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.420> club

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
dominant hand in controlling the club

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.480 
dominant hand in controlling the club
based<00:00:22.810> in<00:00:23.019> terms<00:00:23.470> of<00:00:23.619> being<00:00:23.830> able<00:00:23.949> to<00:00:24.099> control

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
based in terms of being able to control

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.820 
based in terms of being able to control
it<00:00:24.670> very<00:00:24.849> easily<00:00:25.349> simple<00:00:26.349> way<00:00:26.410> to<00:00:26.439> think<00:00:26.679> about

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
it very easily simple way to think about

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.279 
it very easily simple way to think about
this<00:00:27.070> is<00:00:27.130> if<00:00:27.369> you're<00:00:27.640> pulling<00:00:28.480> a<00:00:28.630> pull<00:00:29.019> cart

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
this is if you're pulling a pull cart

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.470 
this is if you're pulling a pull cart
down<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.859> fairway<00:00:30.130> in<00:00:30.699> the<00:00:30.880> pool<00:00:31.119> car<00:00:31.300> so<00:00:31.419> you

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
down the fairway in the pool car so you

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.390 
down the fairway in the pool car so you
pull<00:00:31.689> behind<00:00:31.869> it<00:00:32.230> or<00:00:32.380> push<00:00:32.860> in<00:00:33.040> front<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.340> your

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
pull behind it or push in front of your

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.610 
pull behind it or push in front of your
depending<00:00:33.730> on<00:00:33.790> how<00:00:33.880> you<00:00:33.940> use<00:00:34.090> it<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:35.110> carries

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
depending on how you use it that carries

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.229 
depending on how you use it that carries
your<00:00:35.770> clubs<00:00:36.010> for<00:00:36.280> you<00:00:36.399> so<00:00:36.520> you<00:00:36.579> can<00:00:36.760> walk<00:00:37.030> and

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
your clubs for you so you can walk and

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.430 
your clubs for you so you can walk and
not<00:00:37.390> have<00:00:37.570> to<00:00:37.690> carry<00:00:37.840> your<00:00:37.989> clubs<00:00:38.200> on<00:00:38.320> your

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
not have to carry your clubs on your

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.920 
not have to carry your clubs on your
shoulder<00:00:38.800> if<00:00:38.980> you<00:00:39.910> pull<00:00:40.270> that<00:00:40.570> down<00:00:40.750> the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
shoulder if you pull that down the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.350 
shoulder if you pull that down the
fairway<00:00:41.200> it<00:00:41.739> will<00:00:42.250> track<00:00:42.579> directly<00:00:43.059> behind

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
fairway it will track directly behind

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.119 
fairway it will track directly behind
you<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.690> basically<00:00:44.020> moving<00:00:44.710> almost<00:00:44.890> a

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
you and basically moving almost a

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.529 
you and basically moving almost a
perfectly<00:00:45.520> straight<00:00:45.699> line<00:00:45.760> because<00:00:46.149> always

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
perfectly straight line because always

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.770 
perfectly straight line because always
moving<00:00:46.930> towards<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:48.219> force<00:00:48.520> of<00:00:48.699> movement<00:00:49.149> now

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
moving towards the force of movement now

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.389 
moving towards the force of movement now
when<00:00:49.989> you<00:00:50.140> push<00:00:50.500> something<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:51.039> get<00:00:51.219> behind

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
when you push something you get behind

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.639 
when you push something you get behind
it<00:00:51.879> which<00:00:52.210> is<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:52.449> more<00:00:52.600> dominant<00:00:52.840> motion<00:00:53.500> if

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
it which is the more dominant motion if

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.950 
it which is the more dominant motion if
you're<00:00:54.399> not<00:00:54.520> pushing<00:00:54.760> directly<00:00:55.570> behind<00:00:55.719> the

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
you're not pushing directly behind the

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.959 
you're not pushing directly behind the
center<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.350> gravity<00:00:56.859> it's<00:00:57.370> always<00:00:57.760> going<00:00:57.879> to

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
center of gravity it's always going to

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.639 
center of gravity it's always going to
turn<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.690> it's<00:00:58.960> going<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.109> be<00:00:59.260> moving<00:00:59.620> down

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
turn and it's going to be moving down

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.080 
turn and it's going to be moving down
the<00:00:59.859> fairway<00:01:00.070> like<00:01:00.340> this<00:01:00.550> so<00:01:00.699> if<00:01:00.789> you<00:01:00.910> watch

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
the fairway like this so if you watch

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.459 
the fairway like this so if you watch
somebody<00:01:01.329> pushing<00:01:01.809> one<00:01:01.929> it'll<00:01:02.140> kind<00:01:02.289> of<00:01:02.350> have

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
somebody pushing one it'll kind of have

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.380 
somebody pushing one it'll kind of have
a<00:01:02.500> zigzag<00:01:03.070> pattern<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.850> relatively

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
a zigzag pattern to it relatively

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.060 
a zigzag pattern to it relatively
compared<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.230> someone<00:01:05.379> who's<00:01:05.590> just<00:01:05.680> pulling

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
compared to someone who's just pulling

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.380 
compared to someone who's just pulling
it<00:01:06.280> will<00:01:06.400> follow<00:01:06.640> directly<00:01:06.970> in<00:01:07.120> a<00:01:07.150> straight

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
it will follow directly in a straight

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.600 
it will follow directly in a straight
line<00:01:07.420> that's<00:01:08.259> why<00:01:08.409> we<00:01:08.530> learn<00:01:08.799> to<00:01:09.009> use<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.430> left

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
line that's why we learn to use the left

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.760 
line that's why we learn to use the left
hand<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.030> same<00:01:10.270> thing<00:01:10.509> as<00:01:10.630> true<00:01:10.869> in<00:01:10.990> golf<00:01:11.229> if<00:01:11.680> I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
hand the same thing as true in golf if I

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.260 
hand the same thing as true in golf if I
start<00:01:12.009> pushing<00:01:12.460> at<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.729> while<00:01:12.880> it's<00:01:13.030> a<00:01:13.090> more

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
start pushing at it while it's a more

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.749 
start pushing at it while it's a more
dominant<00:01:13.479> motion<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:14.350> if<00:01:15.070> everything's<00:01:15.610> not

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
dominant motion it's if everything's not

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.160 
dominant motion it's if everything's not
dialed<00:01:16.119> in<00:01:16.210> there<00:01:16.330> perfectly<00:01:16.509> it's<00:01:16.960> going<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
dialed in there perfectly it's going to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.929 
dialed in there perfectly it's going to
be<00:01:17.259> very<00:01:17.500> hard<00:01:17.860> for<00:01:17.920> me<00:01:18.130> to<00:01:18.250> control<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.729> club

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
be very hard for me to control the club

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.429 
be very hard for me to control the club
and<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.150> tends<00:01:19.390> to<00:01:19.570> break<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.020> left<00:01:20.229> wrist

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
and it tends to break the left wrist

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:22.890 
and it tends to break the left wrist
down<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.070> make<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.090> impossible<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.630> control

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
down and make it impossible to control

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.539 
down and make it impossible to control
the<00:01:23.110> loft<00:01:23.350> on<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.619> club<00:01:23.680> face<00:01:24.040> so<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.280> can't

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
the loft on the club face so you can't

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.670 
the loft on the club face so you can't
control<00:01:24.820> your<00:01:24.939> trajectory<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.200> everything

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
control your trajectory so everything

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.800 
control your trajectory so everything
we're<00:01:26.799> doing<00:01:26.829> is<00:01:27.210> predominantly<00:01:28.210> left<00:01:28.509> hand

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
we're doing is predominantly left hand

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.660 
we're doing is predominantly left hand
when<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.020> comes<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.320> club<00:01:29.500> face<00:01:29.710> control<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.549> as

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
when it comes to club face control so as

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.700 
when it comes to club face control so as
you<00:01:30.700> look<00:01:30.790> at<00:01:31.030> drawing<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.600> ball<00:01:31.750> we<00:01:32.470> need<00:01:32.619> to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
you look at drawing the ball we need to

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.710 
you look at drawing the ball we need to
start<00:01:32.890> understanding<00:01:33.549> exactly<00:01:34.090> how<00:01:34.659> that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
start understanding exactly how that

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.660 
start understanding exactly how that
works<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.320> look<00:01:35.740> at<00:01:35.860> making<00:01:36.130> a<00:01:36.189> couple<00:01:36.460> little

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
works and look at making a couple little

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.490 
works and look at making a couple little
adjustments<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.299> draw<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.540> box<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.960> very<00:01:38.290> very

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
adjustments to draw the box is very very

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.560 
adjustments to draw the box is very very
simple<00:01:38.770> hit<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.040> draw<00:01:39.310> a<00:01:39.520> couple<00:01:40.299> things<00:01:40.420> that

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
simple hit a draw a couple things that

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.200 
simple hit a draw a couple things that
we're<00:01:40.750> going<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.930> adjust<00:01:41.200> first<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.950> all<00:01:42.210> I'm

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
we're going to adjust first of all I'm

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.440 
we're going to adjust first of all I'm
at<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.479> top<00:01:43.659> of<00:01:43.720> my<00:01:43.990> swing<00:01:44.350> are<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:46.299> could

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
at the top of my swing are you could

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.450 
at the top of my swing are you could
back<00:01:46.630> up<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:46.930> step<00:01:46.990> at<00:01:47.350> impact<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:48.130> know<00:01:48.189> that<00:01:48.369> my

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
back up a step at impact I know that my

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.730 
back up a step at impact I know that my
club<00:01:48.729> face<00:01:48.939> needs<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.270> be<00:01:49.390> relatively<00:01:49.869> shut<00:01:50.469> in

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
club face needs to be relatively shut in

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.219 
club face needs to be relatively shut in
relations<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.610> where<00:01:51.939> I'm<00:01:52.060> wanting<00:01:52.329> to<00:01:52.540> hit

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
relations to where I'm wanting to hit

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.420 
relations to where I'm wanting to hit
the<00:01:53.350> ball<00:01:53.469> so<00:01:53.710> there's<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> couple<00:01:54.040> things<00:01:54.310> to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
the ball so there's a couple things to

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.270 
the ball so there's a couple things to
think<00:01:54.610> about<00:01:54.729> here<00:01:54.909> first<00:01:55.270> of<00:01:55.450> all<00:01:56.280> understand

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
think about here first of all understand

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.760 
think about here first of all understand
that<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.820> vast<00:01:58.149> majority<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:59.079> the<00:01:59.320> most

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
that the vast majority the the most

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.730 
that the vast majority the the most
influencing<00:02:00.610> factor<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.020> initial<00:02:02.500> ball

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
influencing factor of the initial ball

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.289 
influencing factor of the initial ball
flight<00:02:03.009> direction<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.520> club<00:02:03.759> face<00:02:04.030> angle

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
flight direction is the club face angle

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:05.639 
flight direction is the club face angle
the<00:02:04.659> path<00:02:04.899> has<00:02:05.170> about<00:02:05.350> twenty<00:02:05.619> percent

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
the path has about twenty percent

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.770 
the path has about twenty percent
clubface<00:02:06.369> is<00:02:06.430> about<00:02:06.820> eighty<00:02:06.969> percent<00:02:07.060> roughly

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
clubface is about eighty percent roughly

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.420 
clubface is about eighty percent roughly
a<00:02:07.930> little<00:02:08.619> bit<00:02:08.710> different<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.070> there<00:02:09.160> because

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
a little bit different in there because

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.980 
a little bit different in there because
the<00:02:09.550> ball<00:02:09.729> compresses<00:02:10.210> on<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.420> face<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.869> so

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
the ball compresses on the face and so

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.840 
the ball compresses on the face and so
on<00:02:11.140> but<00:02:11.380> if<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:12.040> just<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.700> the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
on but if you just think that the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.580 
on but if you just think that the
majority<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> starting<00:02:13.870> direction<00:02:14.470> of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
majority of the starting direction of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.940 
majority of the starting direction of
your<00:02:14.710> ball<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:15.160> going<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.340> be<00:02:15.430> club<00:02:15.670> face

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
your ball is going to be club face

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.190 
your ball is going to be club face
single<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:17.000> can<00:02:17.150> manipulate<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.750> path<00:02:17.989> a

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
single you can manipulate the path a

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.479 
single you can manipulate the path a
little<00:02:18.470> bit<00:02:18.620> in<00:02:18.800> order<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:19.069> get<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.250> ball<00:02:19.400> to

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
little bit in order to get the ball to

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.949 
little bit in order to get the ball to
start<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.790> little<00:02:19.940> bit<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.360> right<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.810> draw

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
start a little bit to the right and draw

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.780 
start a little bit to the right and draw
back<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.709> depends<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.190> type<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.370> draw

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
back just depends on the type of draw

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.339 
back just depends on the type of draw
that<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.090> want<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.330> hit<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:24.019> want<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.260> hit

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
that you want to hit if you want to hit

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.500 
that you want to hit if you want to hit
basically<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.800> straight<00:02:25.250> draw<00:02:25.550> where<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.360> ball

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
basically a straight draw where the ball

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.360 
basically a straight draw where the ball
is<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.810> basically<00:02:26.989> start<00:02:27.680> where<00:02:28.250> your

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
is going to basically start where your

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.770 
is going to basically start where your
path<00:02:28.610> isn't<00:02:28.879> going<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.120> change<00:02:29.180> you're<00:02:29.660> not

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
path isn't going to change you're not

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.869 
path isn't going to change you're not
going<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:29.959> try<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.170> swing<00:02:30.530> more<00:02:30.739> into<00:02:31.069> out<00:02:31.250> to

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
going to try and swing more into out to

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.570 
going to try and swing more into out to
get<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.209> start<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> right<00:02:33.050> then<00:02:33.950> very

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
get it to start to the right then very

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.920 
get it to start to the right then very
little<00:02:34.730> adjustment<00:02:35.330> your<00:02:35.420> swing<00:02:35.630> needs<00:02:35.810> to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
little adjustment your swing needs to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.420 
little adjustment your swing needs to
make<00:02:36.080> other<00:02:36.260> than<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.560> club<00:02:36.739> face<00:02:36.920> angle<00:02:37.190> and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
make other than the club face angle and

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.040 
make other than the club face angle and
the<00:02:37.489> release<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.239> you<00:02:38.300> can<00:02:38.510> set<00:02:38.720> up<00:02:38.840> dead

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
the release so you can set up dead

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.509 
the release so you can set up dead
square<00:02:39.440> just<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:39.739> you<00:02:39.830> always<00:02:39.980> do<00:02:40.190> make<00:02:40.370> your

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
square just like you always do make your

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.460 
square just like you always do make your
normal<00:02:40.819> swing<00:02:41.030> path<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.569> square<00:02:41.870> just

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
normal swing path is square just

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.780 
normal swing path is square just
understand<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.010> ball<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.340> going<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.489> start<00:02:43.700> a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
understand the ball is going to start a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.369 
understand the ball is going to start a
little<00:02:43.910> bit<00:02:44.090> left<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.540> your<00:02:44.660> target<00:02:44.870> line<00:02:45.080> and

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
little bit left of your target line and

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.650 
little bit left of your target line and
draw<00:02:45.530> further<00:02:46.040> left<00:02:46.430> if<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:47.420> want<00:02:47.569> to

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
draw further left if you want to

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.150 
draw further left if you want to
manipulate<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.410> get<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.739> ball<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.980> start

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
manipulate it and get the ball to start

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.830 
manipulate it and get the ball to start
slightly<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.910> right<00:02:50.030> of<00:02:50.510> your<00:02:50.660> target

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
slightly to the right of your target

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.110 
slightly to the right of your target
line<00:02:51.049> and<00:02:51.440> draw<00:02:51.590> back<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.519> have<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.849> make<00:02:52.940> an

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
line and draw back you have to make an

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.640 
line and draw back you have to make an
adjustment<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.660> set<00:02:53.930> up<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:54.200> all<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.440> means

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
adjustment and set up and all that means

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.920 
adjustment and set up and all that means
is<00:02:54.799> just<00:02:54.950> moving<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.430> ball<00:02:55.579> back<00:02:55.880> slightly<00:02:56.630> in

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
is just moving the ball back slightly in

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.809 
is just moving the ball back slightly in
your<00:02:57.079> stance<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.739> will<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:58.760> the

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
your stance that will get you to the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.729 
your stance that will get you to the
point<00:02:58.910> where<00:02:59.239> you're<00:02:59.329> coming<00:02:59.720> slightly<00:03:00.470> from

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
point where you're coming slightly from

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.770 
point where you're coming slightly from
the<00:03:00.769> inside<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.640> then<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.269> all<00:03:02.390> we<00:03:02.480> need<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.630> do

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
the inside and then we all we need to do

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.720 
the inside and then we all we need to do
is<00:03:02.900> worry<00:03:03.079> about<00:03:03.140> club<00:03:03.530> face<00:03:03.739> angle<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.519> it's<00:03:04.670> a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
is worry about club face angle so it's a

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.850 
is worry about club face angle so it's a
very<00:03:05.000> very<00:03:05.060> small<00:03:05.329> adjustment<00:03:06.110> even<00:03:06.769> just

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
very very small adjustment even just

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.559 
very very small adjustment even just
moving<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.280> ball<00:03:07.400> back<00:03:07.670> an<00:03:07.880> inch<00:03:08.180> in<00:03:08.420> your

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
moving the ball back an inch in your

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.390 
moving the ball back an inch in your
stance<00:03:08.840> maybe<00:03:09.170> two<00:03:09.470> will<00:03:10.040> get<00:03:10.130> you<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
stance maybe two will get you to the

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.729 
stance maybe two will get you to the
point<00:03:10.489> where<00:03:10.760> you're<00:03:10.880> coming<00:03:11.150> fairly<00:03:11.840> quite<00:03:12.709> a

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
point where you're coming fairly quite a

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.930 
point where you're coming fairly quite a
bit<00:03:12.890> more<00:03:13.040> from<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> inside<00:03:13.670> than<00:03:13.849> you

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
bit more from the inside than you

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.729 
bit more from the inside than you
normally<00:03:14.060> would<00:03:14.299> be<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.780> be<00:03:15.319> able<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.590> hit<00:03:15.680> a

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
normally would be and be able to hit a

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.199 
normally would be and be able to hit a
drawl<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.160> starts<00:03:16.489> to<00:03:16.579> the<00:03:16.670> right<00:03:16.849> and<00:03:17.030> comes

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
drawl it starts to the right and comes

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.569 
drawl it starts to the right and comes
back<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.709> from<00:03:18.920> there<00:03:19.069> it's<00:03:19.250> all<00:03:19.400> just

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
back so from there it's all just

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.949 
back so from there it's all just
worrying<00:03:19.730> about<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.090> club<00:03:20.239> face<00:03:20.420> angle<00:03:20.660> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
worrying about the club face angle and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.440 
worrying about the club face angle and
that's<00:03:21.590> simple<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:22.160> rst<00:03:22.609> swing<00:03:23.000> pattern<00:03:23.209> is

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
that's simple the rst swing pattern is

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.229 
that's simple the rst swing pattern is
such<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.780> simple<00:03:24.139> swing<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:25.310> you're<00:03:25.970> really

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
such a simple swing that you're really

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.940 
such a simple swing that you're really
doing<00:03:26.359> so<00:03:26.810> little<00:03:27.019> manipulation<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.829> you

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
doing so little manipulation that you

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.860 
doing so little manipulation that you
have<00:03:28.190> the<00:03:28.340> freedom<00:03:28.819> to<00:03:28.970> start<00:03:29.299> adjusting<00:03:29.389> what

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
have the freedom to start adjusting what

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.870 
have the freedom to start adjusting what
you<00:03:29.959> do<00:03:30.079> at<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.230> club<00:03:30.440> face<00:03:30.590> angle<00:03:30.829> so<00:03:31.220> long

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
you do at the club face angle so long

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.550 
you do at the club face angle so long
story<00:03:32.180> short<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.720> only<00:03:32.900> two<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.200> things<00:03:33.410> that

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
story short the only two of things that

story short the only two of things that
I'm<00:03:33.650> going<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.889> do<00:03:34.040> different<00:03:34.459> my<00:03:34.549> swing<00:03:34.850> other

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
I'm going to do different my swing other

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.629 
I'm going to do different my swing other
