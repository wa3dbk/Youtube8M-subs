about these engines that kind of thing

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.229 
about these engines that kind of thing
people<00:00:58.050> should<00:00:58.410> know<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.090> is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
people should know is that this is

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.009 
people should know is that this is
technically<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:01.050> premium<00:01:01.620> engine<00:01:01.980> yeah

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
technically a for premium engine yeah

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.850 
technically a for premium engine yeah
but<00:01:04.019> uh<00:01:04.939> shit<00:01:05.939> oh<00:01:06.210> yeah<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> got<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> crank

but uh shit oh yeah I got the crank

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.359 
but uh shit oh yeah I got the crank
pulley

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
pulley

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.690

I'll skew the crank pulley yeah Bolton

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.969 
I'll skew the crank pulley yeah Bolton
back<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.170> that's<00:01:13.260> interesting<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
back but one thing that's interesting is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.399 
back but one thing that's interesting is
the<00:01:14.970> Pistons<00:01:15.330> are<00:01:15.479> up<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> actually<00:01:15.990> see

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
the Pistons are up you can actually see

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.230 
the Pistons are up you can actually see
how<00:01:16.560> far<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.310> come<00:01:17.659> from<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.580> the<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
how far out they come from the the the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.399 
how far out they come from the the the
block<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.970> reason<00:01:24.299> why<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.479> because<00:01:24.780> it's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
block and the reason why is because it's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.530 
block and the reason why is because it's
a<00:01:25.500> HL<00:01:25.890> motor<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.520> raises<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.970> compression

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a HL motor and it raises the compression

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.630 
a HL motor and it raises the compression
ratio<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:28.170> damn<00:01:28.320> well<00:01:28.350> not<00:01:29.100> pretty<00:01:29.369> damn

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
ratio pretty damn well not pretty damn

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.160 
ratio pretty damn well not pretty damn
high<00:01:29.850> pretty<00:01:30.329> damn<00:01:30.540> high<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.869> nineteen

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
high pretty damn high for nineteen

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.380 
high pretty damn high for nineteen
eighty<00:01:31.320> freaking<00:01:31.860> eight<00:01:31.979> early<00:01:32.880> 1988<00:01:33.600> um<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
eighty freaking eight early 1988 um and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.700 
eighty freaking eight early 1988 um and
the<00:01:36.390> great<00:01:36.570> thing<00:01:36.720> about<00:01:36.810> these<00:01:37.170> pistons<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the great thing about these pistons that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.550 
the great thing about these pistons that
I<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.189> much<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> they're

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
I like so much is that they're

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.050 
I like so much is that they're
non-interference<00:01:40.560> business<00:01:40.979> those<00:01:41.729> release

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
non-interference business those release

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.800 
non-interference business those release
pretty<00:01:43.049> much<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> where<00:01:44.810> regardless

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
pretty much make it to where regardless

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.190 
pretty much make it to where regardless
how<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> engine<00:01:47.100> time<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.960> spin

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
how you have the engine time if you spin

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.710 
how you have the engine time if you spin
it<00:01:49.229> over<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.920> try<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.399> start<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> you're<00:01:51.570> not

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it over and try to start it you're not

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.090 
it over and try to start it you're not
going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> finish<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.530> your<00:01:52.710> vows<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
going to finish it all your vows and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560 
going to finish it all your vows and
your<00:01:53.220> cylinder<00:01:53.610> head<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.000> that's<00:01:54.119> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
your cylinder head so that's kind of a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.319 
your cylinder head so that's kind of a
good<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.899> really<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.189> makes<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.060> easier

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
good I really like that makes it easier

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
good I really like that makes it easier
to<00:01:57.420> work<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.229> makes<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.500> easier<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.920> clear

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to work on it makes it easier to clear

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.670 
to work on it makes it easier to clear
if<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.430> ever<00:01:59.549> flooded<00:02:00.439> when<00:02:01.439> you're<00:02:01.560> first

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
if it's ever flooded when you're first

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.870 
if it's ever flooded when you're first
starting<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.250> you're<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.549> serious

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
starting it and you're going serious
