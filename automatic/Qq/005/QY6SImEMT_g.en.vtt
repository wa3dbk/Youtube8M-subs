00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.840 
kind of because the interface somewhat
works<00:00:30.359> however<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:31.170> won't<00:00:31.529> actually<00:00:31.890> register

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
the right to use Sri so you can still go

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.360 
the right to use Sri so you can still go

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
general and Nanette Sri and it looks

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400 
general and Nanette Sri and it looks
like<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.550> settings<00:00:45.390> general<00:00:45.690> surgery<00:00:46.170> for

like the settings general surgery for

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.040 
like the settings general surgery for
the<00:00:46.530> iphone<00:00:46.950> 4s<00:00:47.399> however<00:00:47.820> again<00:00:48.539> nothing

the iphone 4s however again nothing

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.959 
the iphone 4s however again nothing
really<00:00:49.559> works<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.070> mean<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.489> still<00:00:50.760> hold

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
really works I mean you can still hold

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.400 
really works I mean you can still hold
down<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> home<00:00:51.329> button<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:51.960> bring

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
down the home button and you can bring

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.369 
down the home button and you can bring
up<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.370> Sri<00:00:54.120> button<00:00:54.570> but<00:00:54.899> nothing<00:00:55.289> really

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
up the Sri button but nothing really

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
up the Sri button but nothing really
happens<00:00:55.800> other<00:00:55.949> than<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
happens other than that because you

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
happens other than that because you
can't<00:00:56.940> give<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.239> commands<00:00:57.809> also<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> did<00:00:58.440> an

quick summary I said that it's
definitely<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.350> best<00:01:10.920> camera<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.580> I've

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
definitely the best camera that I've

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.179 
definitely the best camera that I've
ever<00:01:11.700> used<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.510> any<00:01:12.780> smartphone<00:01:13.290> however

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
ever used on any smartphone however

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
ever used on any smartphone however
depending<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.700> your<00:01:14.820> particular<00:01:15.000> needs<00:01:15.630> for

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
depending on your particular needs for

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.260 
depending on your particular needs for
taking<00:01:16.530> pictures<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:17.040> recording<00:01:17.460> video<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
taking pictures or recording video you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.550 
taking pictures or recording video you
might<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:18.990> still<00:01:19.229> keep<00:01:19.500> your

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
might want to still keep your

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
might want to still keep your
point-and-shoot<00:01:20.100> camera<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:20.909> camcorder

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
point-and-shoot camera or your camcorder

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
point-and-shoot camera or your camcorder
because<00:01:22.140> obviously<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.680> doesn't<00:01:22.830> have

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
because obviously it doesn't have

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
because obviously it doesn't have
optical<00:01:23.430> zoom<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> digital<00:01:24.150> zoom

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
optical zoom and the digital zoom

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.630 
optical zoom and the digital zoom
doesn't<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.020> work<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.290> well<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
doesn't really work that well and the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
doesn't really work that well and the
auto<00:01:26.909> image<00:01:27.360> stabilization<00:01:27.780> doesn't<00:01:28.350> work

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
auto image stabilization doesn't work

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.710 
auto image stabilization doesn't work
very<00:01:28.500> well<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:28.979> taking<00:01:29.460> videos<00:01:29.850> either<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
very well for taking videos either so it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.850 
very well for taking videos either so it
really<00:01:30.869> wouldn't<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.200> comparable<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
really wouldn't be comparable to a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
really wouldn't be comparable to a
camcorder<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.640> image<00:01:33.000> stabilization<00:01:33.110> but

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
camcorder with image stabilization but

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.140 
camcorder with image stabilization but
again<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.409> definitely<00:01:34.439> did<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.549> depth<00:01:35.970> on

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
again I definitely did go into depth on

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.600 
again I definitely did go into depth on
that<00:01:36.570> camera<00:01:37.229> review<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> if<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> guys<00:01:38.310> want

completely<00:03:02.459> different<00:03:02.850> design<00:03:03.239> overall<00:03:03.720> an

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
completely different design overall an

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
other features well apparently that idea

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.420 
other features well apparently that idea
has<00:03:09.300> been<00:03:09.360> shelved<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.080> now<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.680> I'm<00:03:11.190> going

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
has been shelved for now and I'm going

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.340 
has been shelved for now and I'm going
to<00:03:11.459> go<00:03:11.700> over<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:12.000> reasoning<00:03:12.510> for<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.260> to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
to go over the reasoning for that so to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.229 
to go over the reasoning for that so to
start<00:03:13.470> off<00:03:13.709> it's<00:03:13.920> easier<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.459> talk<00:03:14.640> about<00:03:14.850> how

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
start off it's easier to talk about how

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.720 
start off it's easier to talk about how
the<00:03:15.269> iphone<00:03:15.900> 4s<00:03:16.440> came<00:03:16.769> into<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.070> picture<00:03:17.280> so

iOS team was working around the clock to

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.039 
iOS team was working around the clock to
try<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.040> push<00:03:35.190> out<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.400> relatively<00:03:36.120> bug<00:03:36.510> free

holidays now I'm sure as most of you

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.300 
holidays now I'm sure as most of you
already<00:03:54.810> know<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.500> current<00:03:55.680> iteration<00:03:56.070> of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
already know the current iteration of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.060 
already know the current iteration of
Sri<00:03:56.579> is<00:03:56.820> actually<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.690> beta<00:03:58.109> version<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.769> it

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
Sri is actually a beta version and it

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.190 
Sri is actually a beta version and it
only<00:03:59.190> works<00:03:59.609> with<00:03:59.880> three<00:04:00.329> different<00:04:00.570> spoken

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200

languages<00:04:01.769> as<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.220> now<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.790> Apple<00:04:03.209> either<00:04:03.390> had

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
languages as of now so Apple either had

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.449 
languages as of now so Apple either had
a<00:04:03.660> choice<00:04:03.989> they<00:04:04.530> could<00:04:04.709> release<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.010> iphone

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
a choice they could release the iphone

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.090 
a choice they could release the iphone
4s<00:04:06.299> with<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> slightly<00:04:06.930> modified<00:04:07.260> version<00:04:07.590> of

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
4s with a slightly modified version of

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.819 
4s with a slightly modified version of
iOS<00:04:08.310> four<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.120> without<00:04:09.450> Sri<00:04:10.170> or<00:04:10.590> they<00:04:10.769> could

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
iOS four and without Sri or they could

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.530 
iOS four and without Sri or they could
just<00:04:10.980> wait<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.790> push<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.120> back<00:04:12.299> until

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
just wait and push it back until

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.479 
just wait and push it back until
mid-october<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.530> they<00:04:13.739> figured<00:04:14.070> that<00:04:14.220> people

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
mid-october and they figured that people

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.130 
mid-october and they figured that people
just<00:04:14.730> wouldn't<00:04:14.880> want<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.299> buy<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.510> if<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
just wouldn't want to buy it if it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.870 
just wouldn't want to buy it if it
didn't<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.560> substantial<00:04:17.310> software

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
didn't have a substantial software

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.940 
didn't have a substantial software
upgrade<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.600> if<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.810> didn't<00:04:19.079> have<00:04:19.200> Sri<00:04:19.620> so

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
upgrade and if it didn't have Sri so

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.529 
upgrade and if it didn't have Sri so
again<00:04:20.190> that's<00:04:20.310> why<00:04:20.640> everything<00:04:21.150> was<00:04:21.180> pushed

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
again that's why everything was pushed

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.080 
again that's why everything was pushed
back<00:04:21.780> until<00:04:22.109> mid-october<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:23.310> all<00:04:23.729> this<00:04:23.880> time

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
back until mid-october and all this time

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.600 
back until mid-october and all this time
they<00:04:24.210> were

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
they were

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.040 
they were
the<00:04:24.879> iphone<00:04:25.300> 5<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:25.569> they<00:04:25.780> were<00:04:25.840> actually

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
the iphone 5 and they were actually

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.540 
the iphone 5 and they were actually
ahead<00:04:26.319> of<00:04:26.500> schedule<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:27.069> all<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.460> the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
ahead of schedule and all of the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.309 
ahead of schedule and all of the
prototypes<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.240> they<00:04:28.449> had<00:04:28.659> tested<00:04:29.169> and

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
prototypes that they had tested and

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.350 
prototypes that they had tested and
built<00:04:29.560> were<00:04:30.189> exceeding<00:04:30.789> all<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.210> their

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
built were exceeding all of their

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.899 
built were exceeding all of their
expectations<00:04:32.319> so<00:04:32.770> everything<00:04:33.400> was<00:04:33.639> looking

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
expectations so everything was looking

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.119 
expectations so everything was looking
good<00:04:34.120> for<00:04:34.479> the<00:04:34.569> iphone<00:04:35.020> 5<00:04:35.289> however<00:04:35.830> their

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:36.129 
good for the iphone 5 however their

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:38.700 
good for the iphone 5 however their
manufacturing<00:04:36.939> partner<00:04:37.389> Foxconn<00:04:37.719> said<00:04:38.560> that

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
manufacturing partner Foxconn said that

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.020 
manufacturing partner Foxconn said that
the<00:04:38.800> yield<00:04:39.009> rate<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.400> their<00:04:39.520> touchscreen

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
the yield rate of their touchscreen

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.450 
the yield rate of their touchscreen
devices<00:04:40.389> wasn't<00:04:41.379> profitable<00:04:41.650> enough<00:04:42.250> for

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
devices wasn't profitable enough for

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.070 
devices wasn't profitable enough for
them<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.610> continue<00:04:42.909> making<00:04:43.300> them<00:04:43.629> because

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
them to continue making them because

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.260 
them to continue making them because
they<00:04:44.259> were<00:04:44.289> so<00:04:44.710> small<00:04:45.159> because<00:04:45.729> they<00:04:45.969> had<00:04:46.090> been

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
they were so small because they had been

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.300 
they were so small because they had been
making<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.629> iphone<00:04:47.020> 4<00:04:47.349> for<00:04:47.620> about<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.860> year<00:04:48.159> at

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
making the iphone 4 for about a year at

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.890 
making the iphone 4 for about a year at
that<00:04:48.490> point<00:04:48.729> it<00:04:49.060> was<00:04:49.120> obviously<00:04:49.509> clear<00:04:49.750> that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
that point it was obviously clear that

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.420 
that point it was obviously clear that
he<00:04:49.960> wasn't<00:04:50.199> talking<00:04:50.500> about<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:51.039> because<00:04:51.219> he

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
he wasn't talking about that because he

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.459 
he wasn't talking about that because he
said<00:04:51.639> that<00:04:51.759> it<00:04:51.849> was<00:04:52.060> smaller<00:04:52.569> and<00:04:52.840> that<00:04:53.259> things

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
said that it was smaller and that things

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.320 
said that it was smaller and that things
were<00:04:53.620> more<00:04:53.800> compact<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:54.819> he<00:04:54.939> could<00:04:55.090> have<00:04:55.180> only

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
were more compact so he could have only

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.809 
were more compact so he could have only
been<00:04:55.479> talking<00:04:56.050> about<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.439> iphone<00:04:56.979> 5<00:04:57.279> and<00:04:57.610> then

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
been talking about the iphone 5 and then
