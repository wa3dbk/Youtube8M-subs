00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.980
 moin moin and hello here is again 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.049
 eifel 22 as you have already seen in the title 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.330
 I have information about that 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.940
 new call of duty what is going on there 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.700
 yes i just watched a video from 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:27.530
 drifter an American youtube 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.850
 commentator and he has out of his sight 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.370
 from a reliable source 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.860
 Information about the new call of duty 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.320
 get and I do not guarantee here 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.060
 for the accuracy of the information 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.710
 but I will link the video so 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.480
 you can arrive yourself I have 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.880
 quasi just times as short 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.160
 summarizes in a nutshell and 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.130
 translated into German so the new 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.260
 call of duty is call of duty goes 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:57.710
 So there are a lot of it at the end 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.730
 does not mean just four times what's up there 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.829
 happens then more detailed information 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.499
 it should be on the first may so 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.630
 something like trailer title announcement and 

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:11.479
 something to until the first mai comes 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.249
 It was earlier or last years 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.679
 actually so mid-april 

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.509
 or at the beginning of april 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.889
 Of course, information was still available 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.630
 not really official because of that 

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:21.670
 we are actually even this year 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.209
 a little earlier 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.499
 he told the campaign that they were 

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.959
 again in the future game will be so 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:32.119
 maybe to whom black ops 2 though 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:35.060
 use the weapons of today's time 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.670
 and that's what surprised him and he 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.159
 has also been in demand and that of 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.770
 which you have the information meant 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.829
 that maybe it belongs to the plot 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.529
 that could only be the weapons of today 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.119
 so could use that again 

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:52.159
 which as in the black ops 2 be the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.409
 some tail was used or something 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:58.039
 and the weapons used against one 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.229
 somehow we will become something like that then 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.999
 Definitely see to the multiplayer 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.810
 It was said that one now 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:08.329
 dynamic loading animation has quasi so 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.009
 if you come in a card that 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.690
 you 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.670
 from the helicopter should be off to 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.110
 example that was just as an example 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.129
 called maybe there is still 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.840
 other possibilities 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.610
 but that is quite interesting so 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.430
 not the boring map anymore 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.860
 but the content by a 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.810
 build helicopter rheins 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.940
 However, this is only at the beginning of the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.349
 map and not somehow everytime 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.489
 when you build that new from us 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.599
 helicopters offside 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.959
 that was kind of a bit 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.819
 confusing maybe too will be a kind 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.319
 Slip implies that means 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.760
 you almost run and then squats down 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.819
 and then a little slips 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.920
 continue how exactly that will work 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.450
 was not said now but is up 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.430
 every case I find interesting 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.560
 also should be implemented again 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.340
 that you can watch so so to 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.530
 can lay side 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.390
 that exists in the pc version of 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.879
 However, all call of duty share 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.349
 not on the console version and that 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.290
 should now also implemented there again 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.010
 that too may be quite 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.840
 interesting you can if you on the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.340
 Soil is also rolling to the side 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.950
 that's a bit like daisy 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.200
 Since already played so has one 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.700
 Roll a little bit aside 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.319
 I do not know how exactly that he is with the 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.639
 The weapon should work 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.430
 somehow around the corner one brings you 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.950
 one shoots content directly from that is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.379
 I do not think so well 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.510
 there should be no spec ops mode for it 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:38.420
 should there be something new so a new one 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:42.440
 kind of mode 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.599
 So besides mission it should also more 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.849
 giving destruction means that if one does 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:50.599
 for example, the helicopter one 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.970
 opponent from the sky shoots and so on 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.950
 in a house ill that parts of the house 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.590
 should fall off, so to speak, and maybe 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.110
 to beat a player 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.880
 they did that in the campaign 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.340
 implemented, however, there are still 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.930
 problems multiplayer and that seems 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.920
 maybe not so cool 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.560
 as we hope 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.030
 but at least they try that one 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.090
 to make little in battlefield 3 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.889
 besides, it was suspected by him resp 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.590
 from another source has greatest 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.070
 just stop that new call of duty 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.040
 the current 1 or emerged the next 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.840
 should come gen consoles so ps4 xbox 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.070
 720 or whatever gets hot 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.470
 Let's expect one 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:36.350
 announcement and on the pc of course 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.080
 so of course that's one too 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.300
 interesting point because it will be yes 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.120
 this year is the new call of duty 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.820
 and that means all new consoles xbox 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.010
 ps4 and so on and now also comes 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.600
 by the end of this year all the out 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.330
 did we know of a ps4 from the xbox 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.150
 especially now and apparently 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.570
 maybe also until the middle of november or 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.550
 like this 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.580
 because actually lies the release of 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.830
 call of duty yes always in november 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.600
 area that apparently want to take place 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.060
 are meant to be launch titles 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.760
 yes what do you think of these 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.900
 information do you believe that it 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.729
 I can be realistic as I said 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.680
 not bent for the source i know 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.060
 drifter not personally but if he does 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.320
 think that 's from a reliable 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.950
 I can do that quite well 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.110
 understand 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.169
 Of course I will get the video from him 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.910
 link and yes what would you for 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.440
 the new call of duty would wish that 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.750
 I'm interested in you or you will 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.900
 do not buy at all so interested 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.810
 you somehow maybe not 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.160
 In addition to edge information I would 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.470
 like to know how the new intro 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.270
 I found myself sitting there a bit yesterday 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.970
 That's why 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.970
 've just done the tutorial but 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.640
 that is not true that was mine 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.090
 I hope you have a nice day and see you 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.090
 next time
