00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
and repeat that now after you've done

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.639

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
do your interval training we're gonna

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.029 
do your interval training we're gonna
stick<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.750> very<00:02:07.929> similar<00:02:08.259> recommendations

that we use for advanced we'll talk

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.630 
that we use for advanced we'll talk
about<00:02:10.989> intensity<00:02:11.379> in<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.650> bit<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.370> want<00:02:12.549> to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
about intensity in a bit but I want to

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.490 
about intensity in a bit but I want to
show<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.819> two<00:02:13.090> ways<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.989> doing<00:02:14.110> interval

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
show you two ways of doing interval

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.869 
show you two ways of doing interval
training<00:02:14.860> there's<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.310> little<00:02:15.489> more<00:02:15.580> beginner

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
training there's a little more beginner

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.000 
training there's a little more beginner
and<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:17.019> first<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.379> is<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.530> instead<00:02:17.950> of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
and the first one is just instead of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.979 
and the first one is just instead of
sprinting<00:02:18.610> Hills<00:02:18.849> we're<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.569> gonna<00:02:19.690> walk

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
sprinting Hills we're just gonna walk

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.420 
sprinting Hills we're just gonna walk
them<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.379> want<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.650> walk<00:02:20.860> as<00:02:21.010> fast<00:02:21.220> as

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
them and I want you to walk as fast as

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.180 
them and I want you to walk as fast as
you<00:02:21.519> can<00:02:21.730> going<00:02:22.540> up<00:02:22.780> with<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.019> nice<00:02:23.260> Hill<00:02:23.560> it's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
you can going up with a nice Hill it's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.620 
you can going up with a nice Hill it's
going<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.489> little<00:02:24.730> less<00:02:24.849> impactful<00:02:25.510> on

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
going to be a little less impactful on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.059 
going to be a little less impactful on
your<00:02:25.810> joints<00:02:26.140> rather<00:02:26.380> than<00:02:26.590> walking<00:02:26.980> on

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
your joints rather than walking on

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.100 
your joints rather than walking on
concrete<00:02:27.310> or<00:02:27.700> on<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> sidewalk<00:02:28.120> or<00:02:28.900> on<00:02:28.930> the

concrete or on the sidewalk or on the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.319 
concrete or on the sidewalk or on the
road<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.069> know<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.519> walk<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:30.940> fast<00:02:31.120> as

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
road so you know just walk as fast as

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:39.260 
road so you know just walk as fast as
you<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.599> pump<00:02:32.319> those<00:02:32.470> arms

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.690 

I<00:02:39.330> really<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.230> mean<00:02:40.430> probably<00:02:41.430> didn't<00:02:41.580> need<00:02:41.670> a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
I really I mean probably didn't need a

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.060 
I really I mean probably didn't need a
video<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:42.180> see<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:43.590> what<00:02:43.770> you're<00:02:43.920> doing

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
video to see that but what you're doing

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.750 
video to see that but what you're doing
is<00:02:45.680> hitting<00:02:46.680> interval<00:02:47.220> training<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.670> an

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
is hitting interval training and an

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.930 
is hitting interval training and an
intensity<00:02:48.240> that<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.540> right<00:02:48.750> for<00:02:48.960> you

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
intensity that is right for you

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.280 
intensity that is right for you
now<00:02:50.940> I'll<00:02:51.060> talk<00:02:51.240> about<00:02:51.300> intensity<00:02:51.870> again<00:02:52.170> in

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
now I'll talk about intensity again in

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.200 
now I'll talk about intensity again in
just<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> second<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.700> other<00:02:53.850> thing<00:02:54.120> I

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
just in a second but the other thing I

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.180 
just in a second but the other thing I
want<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.510> mention<00:02:54.600> was<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.350> eight<00:02:55.680> second

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
want to mention was the eight second

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.210 
want to mention was the eight second
interval<00:02:56.580> twelve<00:02:57.210> second<00:02:57.630> recovery<00:02:58.050> now<00:02:59.010> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
interval twelve second recovery now this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.160 
interval twelve second recovery now this
is<00:02:59.460> what<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.060> used<00:03:00.390> in<00:03:00.720> one<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.020> most

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
is what was used in one of the most

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.750 
is what was used in one of the most
famous<00:03:01.470> interval<00:03:02.070> training<00:03:02.430> research

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
famous interval training research

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.540 
famous interval training research
studies<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.390> showed<00:03:04.160> interval<00:03:05.160> training

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
studies that showed interval training

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.490 
studies that showed interval training
worked<00:03:05.850> better<00:03:06.060> than<00:03:06.180> cardio<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.380> was

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
worked better than cardio and that was

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.130 
worked better than cardio and that was
from<00:03:07.680> Australian<00:03:08.190> researchers<00:03:09.140> specifically

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
from Australian researchers specifically

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.260 
from Australian researchers specifically
a<00:03:10.170> guy<00:03:10.320> named<00:03:10.500> Steve<00:03:10.770> Boucher<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.670> now<00:03:11.910> people

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
a guy named Steve Boucher and now people

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.830 
a guy named Steve Boucher and now people
always<00:03:12.420> say<00:03:12.690> Oh

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
always say Oh

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.150 
always say Oh
beginners<00:03:13.500> can't<00:03:13.740> do<00:03:13.830> interval<00:03:14.100> training

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
beginners can't do interval training

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.100 
beginners can't do interval training
it's<00:03:14.610> too<00:03:14.790> intense<00:03:15.060> but<00:03:15.660> what<00:03:15.780> he<00:03:15.900> actually

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
it's too intense but what he actually

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.410 
it's too intense but what he actually
said<00:03:16.560> was<00:03:16.760> everybody<00:03:17.760> can<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.210> the<00:03:18.390> eight

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
said was everybody can do the eight

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.610 
said was everybody can do the eight
seconds<00:03:19.140> on<00:03:19.260> twelve<00:03:19.800> seconds<00:03:20.280> off<00:03:21.620> interval

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
seconds on twelve seconds off interval

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.950 
seconds on twelve seconds off interval
method<00:03:23.010> because<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.330> go<00:03:24.510> hard<00:03:24.750> for<00:03:24.930> a

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
method because you just go hard for a

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.870 
method because you just go hard for a
little<00:03:25.200> bit<00:03:25.350> then<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:25.950> get<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.130> recovery<00:03:26.640> and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
little bit then you get a recovery and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.180 
little bit then you get a recovery and
you<00:03:27.210> don't<00:03:27.510> build<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.960> that<00:03:28.200> high<00:03:28.560> level<00:03:29.070> of

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
you don't build up that high level of

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.670 
you don't build up that high level of
lactic<00:03:29.670> acid<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.240> you<00:03:30.390> do<00:03:30.630> if<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:31.320> went<00:03:31.530> and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
lactic acid that you do if you went and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.700 
lactic acid that you do if you went and
did<00:03:31.740> intervals<00:03:32.280> for<00:03:32.550> 30<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.970> 45<00:03:33.450> seconds<00:03:33.960> so

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
did intervals for 30 to 45 seconds so

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.050 
did intervals for 30 to 45 seconds so
there's<00:03:34.830> gonna<00:03:34.920> be<00:03:35.010> less<00:03:35.250> buildup<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:35.880> that

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
there's gonna be less buildup in that

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.020 
there's gonna be less buildup in that
and<00:03:36.570> so<00:03:37.380> what<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.010> recommend<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.640> would<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:38.880> if

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
and so what I recommend you would do if

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.670 
and so what I recommend you would do if
you're<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.210> beginner<00:03:39.600> moving<00:03:40.500> into

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
you're a beginner moving into

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.310 
you're a beginner moving into
intermediate<00:03:41.040> level<00:03:41.520> or<00:03:41.940> if<00:03:42.360> you're<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:43.230> know

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
intermediate level or if you're you know

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.890 
intermediate level or if you're you know
you<00:03:43.380> have<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:43.650> little<00:03:43.890> extra<00:03:44.160> body<00:03:44.310> fat<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:45.840> is

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
you have a little extra body fat this is

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.660 
you have a little extra body fat this is
what<00:03:46.110> you're<00:03:46.230> gonna<00:03:46.320> do<00:03:46.500> just<00:03:46.740> gonna<00:03:46.920> run<00:03:47.190> for

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
what you're gonna do just gonna run for

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.380 
what you're gonna do just gonna run for
eight<00:03:47.820> seconds<00:03:48.800> and<00:03:49.800> then<00:03:50.670> your<00:03:50.850> timer<00:03:51.150> will

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
eight seconds and then your timer will

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.860 
eight seconds and then your timer will
go<00:03:51.510> off<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.930> you'll<00:03:52.020> walk<00:03:52.200> for<00:03:52.530> twelve<00:03:52.800> and

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
go off and you'll walk for twelve and

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.830 
go off and you'll walk for twelve and
then<00:03:54.870> run<00:03:55.080> eight<00:03:55.260> seconds<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:57.360> walk<00:03:57.570> for

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
then run eight seconds and walk for

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.170 
then run eight seconds and walk for
twelve<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.470> again<00:03:59.040> it's<00:03:59.190> because<00:03:59.820> there's

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
twelve and again it's because there's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.970 
twelve and again it's because there's
just<00:04:00.240> so<00:04:00.540> much<00:04:00.660> starting<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.320> stopping<00:04:01.560> there

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
just so much starting and stopping there

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.130 
just so much starting and stopping there
you're<00:04:02.580> gonna<00:04:02.670> have<00:04:02.940> less<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.630> that

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
you're gonna have less of that

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.830 
you're gonna have less of that
continuous<00:04:04.950> buildup<00:04:05.520> of<00:04:05.640> exercise<00:04:06.600> and

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
continuous buildup of exercise and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.540 
continuous buildup of exercise and
intensity<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.800> will<00:04:07.950> increase<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
intensity that really will increase the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.000 
intensity that really will increase the
lactic<00:04:08.880> acid<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:09.360> make<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.110> fatigued<00:04:10.650> faster

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
lactic acid and make you fatigued faster

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.910 
lactic acid and make you fatigued faster
and<00:04:11.490> want<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.090> quit<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:12.510> it'll<00:04:12.630> be<00:04:12.720> less<00:04:12.959> impact

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
and want to quit so it'll be less impact

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.220 
and want to quit so it'll be less impact
of<00:04:14.130> fatigue<00:04:14.520> on<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:15.000> type<00:04:15.240> of<00:04:15.270> training<00:04:15.630> so

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
of fatigue on that type of training so

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.060 
of fatigue on that type of training so
even<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.650> you<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:16.980> walk<00:04:17.250> really<00:04:17.520> fast

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
even if you just walk really fast

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.360 
even if you just walk really fast
for<00:04:19.670> eight<00:04:19.790> seconds<00:04:20.270> and<00:04:20.510> then<00:04:20.930> 12<00:04:21.200> second<00:04:21.650> you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
for eight seconds and then 12 second you

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.120 
for eight seconds and then 12 second you
should<00:04:22.400> have<00:04:22.640> that<00:04:22.790> gym<00:04:23.120> boss<00:04:23.330> interval

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
should have that gym boss interval

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.240 
should have that gym boss interval
training<00:04:25.130> timer<00:04:25.370> that<00:04:25.940> will<00:04:26.090> beep<00:04:26.300> every<00:04:27.250> 12

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
training timer that will beep every 12

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.920 
training timer that will beep every 12
seconds<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.760> recovery<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.390> then<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.840> will

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
seconds of recovery and then it will

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.200 
seconds of recovery and then it will
beep<00:04:30.140> after<00:04:30.350> eight<00:04:30.620> seconds<00:04:31.070> of<00:04:31.130> exercise<00:04:31.580> and

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
beep after eight seconds of exercise and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.970 
beep after eight seconds of exercise and
that's<00:04:32.390> one<00:04:32.690> way<00:04:32.900> for<00:04:32.930> beginners<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.680> get<00:04:33.770> into

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
that's one way for beginners to get into

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.440 
that's one way for beginners to get into
interval<00:04:34.340> training<00:04:34.730> without<00:04:35.210> the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
interval training without the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.450 
interval training without the
traditional<00:04:35.840> oh<00:04:36.350> you<00:04:36.560> got<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.710> run<00:04:36.980> as<00:04:37.130> hard<00:04:37.340> as

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
traditional oh you got to run as hard as

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.000 
traditional oh you got to run as hard as
you<00:04:37.550> can<00:04:37.730> for<00:04:38.030> 35<00:04:38.900> 30<00:04:39.260> seconds<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.890> a<00:04:39.920> minute

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
you can for 35 30 seconds to a minute

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.070 
you can for 35 30 seconds to a minute
and<00:04:40.460> then<00:04:41.030> you're<00:04:41.090> gonna<00:04:41.240> feel<00:04:41.450> like<00:04:41.570> puking

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
and then you're gonna feel like puking

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.930 
and then you're gonna feel like puking
you<00:04:42.290> won't<00:04:42.560> with<00:04:42.830> this<00:04:43.070> method<00:04:43.490> of<00:04:43.580> interval

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
you won't with this method of interval

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.820 
you won't with this method of interval
training<00:04:43.970> it's<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.780> really<00:04:45.080> great<00:04:45.260> way<00:04:45.470> for<00:04:45.500> you

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
training it's a really great way for you

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.120 
training it's a really great way for you
to<00:04:45.920> get<00:04:46.040> started<00:04:46.450> so<00:04:47.450> those<00:04:47.840> are<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.440> beginner

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
to get started so those are the beginner

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.550 
to get started so those are the beginner
implement<00:04:49.880> implications<00:04:50.720> there<00:04:50.930> for<00:04:51.470> our

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
implement implications there for our

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.470 
implement implications there for our
interval<00:04:51.860> training<00:04:52.160> just<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.400> show<00:04:52.700> you<00:04:52.760> that

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
interval training just to show you that

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.390 
interval training just to show you that
everyone<00:04:54.080> can<00:04:54.320> do<00:04:54.530> interval<00:04:54.830> training<00:04:54.890> and

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
everyone can do interval training and

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.220 
everyone can do interval training and
now<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:55.850> be<00:04:56.090> even<00:04:56.300> more<00:04:56.450> specific<00:04:56.630> with

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
now to be even more specific with
