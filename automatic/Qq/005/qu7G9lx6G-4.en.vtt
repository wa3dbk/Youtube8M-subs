00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:03.920
 hey people what's up with you trying 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.040
 today it's about this beautiful 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.860
 Battery alkaline batteries so double 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.660
 Worker and these usually cost 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.550
 Not much because you only have them once 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.460
 can discharge and not recharge 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.019
 but now there are different ones 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.999
 devices say that for example here 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.179
 april will be for ordinary alkali 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.919
 Batteries and the promise that one 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.999
 that's just his exaggerated 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.589
 can charge 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.729
 but now you have to know that is 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.199
 namely for such chargers 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:32.660
 usually other batteries exist 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.880
 namely batteries that you just put 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.520
 here in such a device pure and then has 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.330
 the whole thing after hours again 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.890
 charged 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.780
 the problem is only superficial 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.850
 these batteries are all made out of one 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.050
 created completely different material and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.250
 also with a very different 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.010
 charged voltage 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.330
 as these alkaline batteries are these 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.550
 Of course, often cheaper 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.640
 that's why they are cheaper too 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.110
 produces and have the energy you 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.090
 they can deliver once 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.860
 then a chemical process is going on in the 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.239
 Battery off and then you can in 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.549
 which usually does not stop recognizing 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.310
 Of course you can if the battery 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.170
 not completely empty you can put them in 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.390
 a charger and then three four five 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.549
 do not refresh something completely 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.109
 charge but refresh something that is 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.759
 quite possible you can also 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.289
 just poke it in your pocket or 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.939
 in a warm place then invite yourself 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.299
 partly due to this heat energy 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.979
 A little further on, however 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.770
 the problem is if you have one now 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.270
 normal battery al khali volturi in 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.920
 this battery is the battery 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.170
 Charger hat he has the problem 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.450
 that in this with DC 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.069
 that means that it will work 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.899
 charged with the voltage built up 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.889
 the device recognizes of course, ok rich 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.179
 battery in it can not 

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.509
 distinguish whether that is a battery or 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.399
 Not 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.439
 and just let's say the tension 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.020
 since a battery is at some point 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.930
 the maximum reaches then says 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.670
 easy 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.280
 He simply notices the battery by saying that 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.650
 there is no energy flowing through it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.410
 that the battery is full and that happens 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.730
 in these alkaline batteries not the 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.590
 they do not have that kind of stuff 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.240
 completely different material and where 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.800
 At some point, a foam comes out 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.760
 a fluid that one knows yes if 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.650
 We've seen each other like one 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.020
 battery in outlook as the leaked out 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.709
 and in principle, they are all this 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.959
 get here 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.430
 and that's why it's very important 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.780
 Of course, he can do that for a short time 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.280
 cleaning and a bit recharge it 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.990
 but it does not make sense what they are 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.400
 not created for that and so beautiful 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.750
 also because it could be easy 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.430
 and could say just popping here 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.590
 the community so easy it is 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.150
 unfortunately not as I said if you the one 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.560
 wanted to recharge the life 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.060
 If you want to extend it then do it 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.650
 not quite ready for a few 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.420
 minutes sitting next to it and take care that 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.100
 nothing happened to me that started 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.600
 Smoke or something to take out immediately 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.270
 or just put a trouser pocket 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.950
 or on top of it to call in the warm 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.140
 of course not here too 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.790
 getting hot is clear 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.870
 but otherwise it is relatively dangerous 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.860
 if you are here on such but well 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.510
 promises ordinary batteries 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.880
 recharge pure field and its easy 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.799
 reinsteckt you see it, too on the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.100
 customer reviews two people is that 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.540
 Whole device broke because not 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.310
 then they fall in front of your eyes 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.720
 Keep that whole already meaningful 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.280
 maybe you already have them all 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.390
 other experience with batteries 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.170
 how to go back a bit 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.269
 can charge 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.739
 or you just use normal batteries 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.620
 It is worthwhile for a longer time mostly 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.580
 rather more one writes in the comments 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.200
 and I would like to know what 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.549
 Everyone knows so many tricks in the euro 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.840
 Do not you charge batteries ? 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.400
 mostly in the pants pocket 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.230
 or send them for a very short time 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.090
 but always a charger just always 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.650
 otherwise watch out with his battery 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.410
 Doing the whole thing that was it for today 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.320
 acute brigadier there is also that 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.850
 srh alkali must be how can you 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.019
 namely a little recharge and 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.260
 That's it for today until the next one 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.260
 matches
