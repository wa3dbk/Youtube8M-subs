00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.340
 love is all you lend, you taste good 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.050
 first of all I wanted to answer to a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.330
 question that you have asked me many of 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.279
 you asked frames because 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 they put the intro of machinima 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.810
 I just put the intro because I 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.579
 love it once signed the contract with 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.800
 machinima what this company does is 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:28.349
 parents send all the same a 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.540
 user manual a logo a banner 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.870
 an intro etcetera etcetera and more things 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.239
 and they force us in quotes so 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.640
 least recommend us to put the asus 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.530
 box thing that I have already done and if we also 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.300
 they facilitate an intro and to me that intro I 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 love and many of my youtubers 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.769
 American favorites my idols what 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.570
 They also do and I like it as I say 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.149
 so I'm going to put it so there's no more 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.440
 complications there is nothing behind it 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 I feel here you do not like it but to me it is 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 something that I love and I'll put it like that 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 that I hope I have solved that little 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.480
 I doubt you had many of you and you 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.999
 I propose something different I propose a 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.670
 challenge is something that I do not think I do in 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.590
 many times but today you could 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.150
 upload two videos a day and it depends on 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.940
 all of you yes 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.670

 likes before 9 o'clock at night in this 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 same time drugs would rise night 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.910
 another video or upload that is something that 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.250
 you have also asked many of you 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.900

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.120
 warfare 3 puree have been my classes 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 preferred throughout this year and which are 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.540
 my proportions what is being the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.460
 barrack what is being the 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560
 proportions of victories and defeats the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.940
 of casualties and deaths the longest streak 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.860
 etcetera etcetera everything you see in 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.650
 barracks and all my favorite houses 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 you can see them tonight at the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.270
 second video of the day as long as

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.920
 how simple guys, guys, like, 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 you want to see that so give it to the like and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 there is nothing else and now that you are 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.580
 watching from behind you are watching a motorbike 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.369
 of impressive assault on the new 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.680
 mind that I created myself and boats because 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.020
 you create another new account with all the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.760
 What do you have already since yesterday I was with Rubén 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.610
 this we were playing almost all the 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.229
 late and lumen I proposed my son frames 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.630
 you want to play with only us 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.160
 how much you do not feel like escaping a 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.990
 little bit of all the hubbub that is 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.310
 having lately on the channel with 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.230
 all messages with your new ones 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.060
 subscribers et cetera etcetera because already 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.910
 as you already know many of you 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.560
 those who take the most time with me 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.540
 I love playing only rubén also will 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.940
 love to play alone and if we play both 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.640
 do the two together because we did not have it 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.280
 well we do not concentrate much better and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.500
 we communicate very well then by 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.959
 that same ruben proposed us to create a 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.480
 new account both he and I m rockies 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.670
 mine r rockies yours is frames me 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.560
 r ruben are obvious things do not 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.630
 it is not necessary to say them but well I said 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.880
 so that's why we have created ourselves 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.830
 a lithium account to play alone which is 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.380
 what we like to do from time to time 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.770
 and if you have also fixed us at the end 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.110
 of the game I'm at level 25 with 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.330
 a practically predetermined class 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.489
 but it's quick-drawn fingering 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.709
 shooter that is pretty much what you 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.170
 they give once you start a new class 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.900
 with the spy plane the predictor the cobra 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.110
 are things that are very very basic and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.480
 what 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.040
 this has been a very good I hope that 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.930
 have enjoyed this new account 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 on a superba level it fucks the first 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.640
 prestigious prestige but I'm going to 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.440
 leave now behind with exercising with 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.930
 something pretty funny a bonus clip 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.700
 I hope you like it assigned see you 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.050
 the next video a greeting and any 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.520
 doubt you already know you in the section of 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.700
 comments to ask me until the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.700
 little ones 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:49.400
 among other sources dancing with the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:59.630
 naturalness in proportion and I so 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:04:05.060
 kites when he promoted his 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:07.360
 proportion with new account by two very 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.360
 good ones
