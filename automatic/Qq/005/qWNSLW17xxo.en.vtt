 Hello everyone, Evgeny dropped the phone

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.769
 5 thousand rubles the choice 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.389
 either buy a gadget from official 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 In Russia, supplies even beat off 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.890
 brand either for the same money order 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.609
 but offer more interesting 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.529
 specifications than most local 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.719
 alternatives link to online store 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 is in the description come see 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.230
 an assortment of stupid phone calls with 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.230
 five and a half inches screen 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.450
 compactness albeit huge of 222 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.390
 I would not name it in size 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.000
 how about fan 7 and a little more than lg g3 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.190
 one hand with him probably not handle 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.739
 this will not contribute to a low 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.620
 Placed buttons on the right side 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.660

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940

 LED indicator camera not under 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.740
 the screen has three touch keys 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.930

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 the cover is removed from the bottom it is quite 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.020
 dense 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.020
 sits well 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.010
 but you will not lift it all

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.120

 micro sd memory on the circuit everything is clear 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.150
 served as material for enclosures 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.280
 glossy plastic with white color 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.560
 The solution is combined well with a little scratch 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.810
 noticeable fingerprints don't rush into 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.520
 eyes true and behind a glossy surface 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.250
 the device is very slippery 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.649
 ergonomics further worsened tight 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.050
 high battened button to gripe 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.910
 Assembly, meanwhile, no though aesthetes 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.760
 may confuse the displacement of the cover from 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.500
 metal ring camera 5 s

 720p resolution 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.000
 which gives the average pixel density on

 1,267 ppi 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.750
 look at what area of ​​the panel 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.560
 size would certainly be nicer however 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.720
 high brightness 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.700
 lack of air gap pleasant 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.310
 colors and good viewing angles this 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.260
 compensates for android 4 2 2 platforms 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.450
 jellibin represented in the charger see 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.610
 the interface is devoid of any modifications with 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 software chip companies 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.959
 able to distinguish the device from other 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.360
 no settings too 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.489
 There is a standard SIM card point 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.730
 for default actions degraded to 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.709
 sound i was not mistaken bss audio or something 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.160
 so called inclusion schedule 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.840
 off and on update set 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.239
 firmware is not very big 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.030
 There are almost no google services available 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.019
 with play market if there is a desire 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.760
 the only third offer 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.430

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.680

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.780
 programs in general kubot with 222 definitely 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.540

 has flash records video full hd 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.220
 Most likely the resolution is fair and not 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.140
 achieved by interpolating so and 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.180
 detailing is not bad though licked and 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.459
 due to not very high quality optics 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 color rendition in general is also nothing though 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.330
 a number of situations the contrast is taken away 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400
 white balance problem 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.200
 center exposure 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.299
 footage has the same drawbacks 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.769
 color stabilization cannot 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.930
 boast sound efficiency 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.360
 not bad but instead of tracking autofocus 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.980
 implemented touch focus see examples

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.289
 I strongly recommend not to twist 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.940
 brightness to maximum otherwise risk 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.160
 stay in a lifeless phone already 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.440
 after a couple of hours of continuous usa 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.449
 for example, at 100 percent brightness of all 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.919

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.830

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.340
 70 percent result was already 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.380
 more than 400 hours at a brightness of about 50

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.639
 accounted for half an hour 17 percent was 85 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.190
 became 68 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.710
 but it's almost like in classmates 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.479
 In other words, the battery you do not 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.520
 disappoint if you stick 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:23.849

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.990

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:14.270
 you can play 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.490
 such visual effects however 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:24.040
 Of course I can not say that somehow 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:24.040
 nice to watch or jerks a lot 3 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:33.880

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:44.300
 however, FPS sags and now 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:46.910
 especially well play if you have a jackpot yet 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.660
 it was possible to reconcile somehow here 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.660
 unreal 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.620
 I thought that the optimization poured fell 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.689
 or 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.669

 if you don't want to take the cat in the bag then 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:26.750
 it is worth considering without giving 22 from cubot
