00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.500
 the biggest technological disadvantage of 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.730
 summer is that with the sun not always 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.970
 we can see the screen of our 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.429
 smartphone presents us galaxy s 4 and 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.869
 at htc equal two terminals that stops 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.420
 tackle this problem use different 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.210
 technologies on their lcd screens and 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.470
 amoled to start in an interior there 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.550
 that put the brightness one hundred percent 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.239
 so that they are equal 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.710
 terms 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.239
 once we do that we can 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.649
 check that we do not see quite well 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.540
 because the two screens are left 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.000
 too clear first let's access 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.220
 to the application panel the differences 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.899
 that if they are seen are something minimal can that 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.120
 in the htc one show a little more 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.129
 Of course we try it again but this time 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.390
 with the browser if we go on the page 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.100
 of android pit de espaÃ±a ' 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.679
 the difference becomes much more visible 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.140
 the htc one shows a very much image 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.210
 clearer the colors of galaxy s 4 it 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.609
 they see darker and clearer the same 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.320
 happens with google maps for example a 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.809
 map of ds4 is much more visible and 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.120
 show more contrast let's check 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.530
 how they behave outdoors when 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.239
 they are really bad we will have to 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.130
 put us in the shade to enjoy more 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.630
 of our smartphone really shows 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.369
 lcd their advantage over ground 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
 in our little experiment in the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.700
 Application box do not look 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.979
 differences in the browser looks 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.560
 different although the htc tends towards 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.990
 lighter and whiter shades the s4 is more 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.149
 grayish in terms of google maps the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.280
 htc one lcd screen looks pretty 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.829
 better than in the mole of samsung 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.509
 we come to the final test we are going to 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.970
 try these two screens under the light 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.159
 solar I have the two phones with the sun 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.439
 giving them directly none is left 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.390
 see always we will have reflection and it is 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.000
 difficult to recognize something on the screens 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.220
 in our analyzes the two screens 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.619
 they are hard to see but the lcd panel 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.450
 has an obvious advantage at least 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.679
 as for google maps , the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.319
 difference is remarkable versus the 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.240
 galaxy s 4 screen after this 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.770
 small demonstration it is clear that if 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.599
 We will be outside especially in summer 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.580
 It is convenient to opt for a smartphone with 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.360
 lcd screen or stay at the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.159
 shadow 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.159
