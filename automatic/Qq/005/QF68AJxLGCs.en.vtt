00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.390
 Gustav I have nothing to do I can't think 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.980
 to do the whole journey so that is how 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:43.370
 it occurred to you to take this 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:45.140
 old but we have to run 30 is not 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 a brand whatever a brand is 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:01:09.710
 known throughout the world for thousand euros 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:01:13.670
 500 we have old ones are there 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 stopped no it's not just that i don't like it is 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.280
 that it's not okay to air this 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.280
 stuff 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.369
 and now because you've stopped there is the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.369
 red light 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.510
 agusta still did not understand in Italy 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.670
 signage you must interpret more than one 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.880
 hint how a new one is understood 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.880
 imposition 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.650
 that it was a more welcoming country 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.830
 you 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.080
 and it's right it doesn't even bring us closer 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:06.060
 in the church you have we are like 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.420
 worth blasi that I know a lot 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.830
 well all the topics for which 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.910
 would want to escape from this 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.390
 country 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.750
 I believe you have a duty not to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.140
 to run away but to stay there and not 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.140
 never give up
