00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:12.510
 Hello everyone going over things I found what 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:15.450
 interesting backpack interesting to those 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.710
 that seven or eight years ago, I'm his shell and 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.270
 already forgot even his existence why 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.430
 I didn't use it because 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.610
 was originally chosen incorrectly 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.310
 The material for this backpack is the case 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.260
 that at that time it was very difficult to find 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.379
 good stuff it and now sort of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.449
 principle is not very easy to find but at that 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.969
 time it was even more difficult therefore 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.280
 I used the material that was 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.739
 in stock in stock was such here 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.039
 thin thin fabric that i use 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.530
 For tailoring mostly forms a lot 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.909
 I spent time and energy on him 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.829
 search for accessories sling again 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:01.109
 material on the development of this backpack 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.350
 solving some problems which principle 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.710
 were decided by me for the first time on 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.009
 front side there is a small 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.810
 pocket for I had I planned 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.979
 use a card that is here 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.979
 the card was inserted and 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.420
 was there safe and sound 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.000
 the tooth was attached to a sapper blade 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.929
 on these lines here and closed 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.240
 on top of this valve is also a secret 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:39.890
 pocket on this whole valve and in 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.049
 principle, almost invisible, he is here 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.630
 that's what these lines here for 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.539
 I can't tell you, I'm just not 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.609
 I remember what they were made for but 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.109
 most likely in order to be here 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.740
 there was an insert maybe some 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.780
 cape or 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:03.049
 awning some or something film 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:09.660
 maybe well, something like this with one block 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:14.690
 2 slimming shoulder straps that would serve 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.640
 for attaching a tent for example or 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:22.610
 something like that other pocket too 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.500

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.090

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.200
 other side is a big pocket and also 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.200

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.599

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:53.450
 leather stitch stitched to enhance 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:56.230
 strengths of the straps themselves soft pillows for 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.870

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:04.880

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:58.340
