here we're going to cut right to the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.859 
here we're going to cut right to the
part<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.170> cleaning<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.830> fish<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.750> if<00:00:21.750> you

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
part of cleaning the fish and if you

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.240 
part of cleaning the fish and if you
don't<00:00:22.020> want<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> watch<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.590> part<00:00:22.830> that's

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
don't want to watch this part that's

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.550 
don't want to watch this part that's
fine<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.689> believe<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:24.990> everybody<00:00:25.470> should

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
fine but I believe that everybody should

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.620 
fine but I believe that everybody should
know<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.160> if<00:00:26.550> you're<00:00:26.699> leading<00:00:26.939> live<00:00:27.240> animals

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
know that if you're leading live animals

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.179 
know that if you're leading live animals
then<00:00:27.840> they<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.230> be<00:00:28.260> killed

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
then they have to be killed

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.500 
then they have to be killed
and<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> be<00:00:30.060> cleaned<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> they

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and they have to be cleaned and they

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.089 
and they have to be cleaned and they
have<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.840> prepared<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:31.769> think<00:00:31.859> it's<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
have to be prepared so I think it's a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.139 
have to be prepared so I think it's a
good<00:00:32.189> thing<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.520> know<00:00:32.640> especially<00:00:33.000> field

what you do on fish is you can hold them
through<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> gills<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.789> safest

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
through the gills and that's the safest

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.029

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.940 
little stream and the other fish will
eat<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.369> becomes<00:01:42.729> food<00:01:42.939> for<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.270> fish

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
eat that that becomes food for the fish

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.020 
eat that that becomes food for the fish
you<00:01:44.950> remove<00:01:45.220> all<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.520> innards<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:45.880> there

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
you remove all the innards and there

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
isn't a whole lot on a fish reach behind

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.539 
isn't a whole lot on a fish reach behind
the<00:01:55.179> gills<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:59.289> if<00:01:59.830> you<00:01:59.920> grab<00:02:00.130> right<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.399> there

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
the gills and if you grab right in there

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.429 
the gills and if you grab right in there
with<00:02:00.700> your<00:02:00.819> fingers<00:02:00.880> you<00:02:01.630> can<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:01.929> take<00:02:02.289> that

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
whole piece right out of there then you

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.759 
whole piece right out of there then you
take<00:02:09.610> your<00:02:09.640> thumb<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.290> scrape<00:02:11.290> all<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.590> blood
