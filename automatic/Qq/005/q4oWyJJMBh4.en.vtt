00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello dear friends with you drive and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.629
 let's go through a couple of krutitsky today 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.059
 clones and let's start now with a huge 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.030
 spirals oh my god it's all bibic 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.610
 just can't concentrate yes we have 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 there will be a huge spiral now and honestly 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.619
 Speaking with spiral I always have cases 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.840
 was bad could i ok 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.519
 go there I do not speak the first time 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.199
 and do not speak from the second time and not at all 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.070
 I can pass them for me it is unreal 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.410
 hard missed turn look good 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.760
 that here is a non-contact mode one more 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.690
 just meat would be sure i doc 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.430
 we really need to get this spiral 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.840
 there really is no rush 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.079
 necessarily because on helix in 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.510
 Anyway, everyone will go to bed and Denmark 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.820
 the main thing is just b to the same need to fry 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.090
 need to include all your cool skills 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.350
 racer in gta 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:01.739
 ok fire wolrayd yes and so another one 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.519
 attempt I didn't even drive into the right one 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.150
 the ramp is now gone 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.820
 she will try with a view from the hood 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.189
 they say it is so easy to come such 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.170
 stuff just need to look ahead 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.409
 go ahead so here and going forward going 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.369
 forward going forward we go oh my goodness me 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.300
 already scary 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.160
 I took the label guys except 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.080
 so calmly music month plays if 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.430
 do not take the first time when just 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.100
 didn't come right on the springboard, then I 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.790
 passed this spiral from the second time 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.730
 quite good so what about us now 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.460
 will you have something ordinary here 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.860
 the race will be to the end the finish is already my 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.210
 blow yes I think the most important piece was 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.670
 this 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.750
 this is a spiral 5 times the word is not important 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:58.700
 Well, we are going in second place again for a long time 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.120
 first did not come therefore it is necessary 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.070
 quietly correct honestly 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.980
 tired of the second to come all the time and 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.140
 they may have probably noticed that I am the second 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.660
 constantly come well and 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.180
 this race is no exception so see you 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.240
 after a couple of seconds the guys next 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.510
 race 10 people joined this 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.520
 race and again it is contactless nache 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.350
 it's just that you were all flying up as usual 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:31.730
 everybody starts beeping oh my god why so 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:36.500
 we do n't have a damn ramp here 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:41.900
 officer scared about gave yes yes yes yes all 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.230
 clearly flew so so so so he took 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.550
 label and what do we have here now 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.780
 crap and I'm flying out 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.890
 from the hood again we try prius while successfully 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.959
 nichrome se 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.410
 no shit myself so I understood it I understood 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.489
 there it will be necessary to land neatly 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.950
 again, you must land normally 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.590
 let's try now oh you're perfect 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.370

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.290
 I took the label I took the label cool now 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.170
 you can normally pretend to be familiar 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:24.220
 to everyone and what happens i thought i am now 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.459
 in the first place I will 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.350
 do I need to race for easier to choose 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.550
 but who is our rivalry for now? 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.550

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:01.739
 parking a little clear and I'm already the third

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.319
 another runner zaymom why we do not 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.870
 I think the same 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:13.830
 the rival is really far away from us he 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:17.040
 somehow it goes fast and what if it hits me 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:21.079
 his position no he has already finished well 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.580
 okay, we finish the third position 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.430
