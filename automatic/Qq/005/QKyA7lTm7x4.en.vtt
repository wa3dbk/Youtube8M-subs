00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
hi this is Antonio Sanchez and welcome

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:42.369 
hi this is Antonio Sanchez and welcome
to<00:00:09.770> the<00:00:09.860> Meridian<00:00:10.309> sweet

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.810 

this<00:00:43.379> record<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.829> wanted<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.190> experience<00:00:44.699> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this record I wanted to experience the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.819 
this record I wanted to experience the
equivalent<00:00:45.269> of<00:00:45.329> writing<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> novel<00:00:46.019> instead<00:00:46.739> of

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
equivalent of writing a novel instead of

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.189 
equivalent of writing a novel instead of
a<00:00:46.890> collection<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.399> short<00:00:47.610> stories<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.390> found

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
a collection of short stories I found

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.170 
a collection of short stories I found
that<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.980> long-form<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.879> writing

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
that this long-form way of writing

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
that this long-form way of writing
brought<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.659> a<00:00:51.690> wide<00:00:52.050> range<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.680> inferences

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
brought out a wide range of inferences

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.430 
brought out a wide range of inferences
from<00:00:53.339> a<00:00:53.519> musical<00:00:53.909> identity<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.629> would<00:00:55.320> have

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
from a musical identity that would have

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
from a musical identity that would have
probably<00:00:55.800> been<00:00:56.100> very<00:00:56.430> hard<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.909> put<00:00:57.089> into<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
probably been very hard to put into a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
probably been very hard to put into a
cohesive<00:00:57.719> album<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.979> terms<00:00:59.219> existed<00:00:59.820> as

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
cohesive album if the terms existed as

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:13.709 
cohesive album if the terms existed as
separate<00:01:00.449> entities

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.230 

this<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.829> my<00:01:14.979> most<00:01:15.280> ambitious<00:01:15.640> project<00:01:16.210> to

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
this is my most ambitious project to

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.120 
this is my most ambitious project to
date<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.750> my<00:01:17.049> band<00:01:17.289> migration<00:01:17.859> was<00:01:18.009> the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
date and my band migration was the

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.679 
date and my band migration was the
perfect<00:01:18.549> vehicle<00:01:18.700> for<00:01:18.969> it<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.359> come<00:01:19.539> to

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
perfect vehicle for it to come to

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.709 
perfect vehicle for it to come to

fruition I'm very lucky to have a group

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.270 
fruition I'm very lucky to have a group
of<00:01:22.899> musicians<00:01:23.079> with<00:01:23.590> me<00:01:23.710> that<00:01:23.890> can<00:01:24.070> play

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
of musicians with me that can play

pretty much anything I throw at them and

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.410 
pretty much anything I throw at them and
this<00:01:27.009> album<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.579> proof<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:28.000> their<00:01:28.149> amazing

through the earth the sky and our bodies

ways that we can perceive and this piece
I<00:02:01.290> tried<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.770> portray<00:02:02.010> how<00:02:02.430> these<00:02:02.610> lines<00:02:02.910> exist

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
I tried to portray how these lines exist

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
I tried to portray how these lines exist
to<00:02:03.780> live<00:02:04.080> all<00:02:04.230> around<00:02:04.350> us<00:02:04.740> even<00:02:05.010> though<00:02:05.160> they

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
to live all around us even though they

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.550 
to live all around us even though they
can<00:02:05.580> really<00:02:05.730> be<00:02:05.940> seen<00:02:06.270> or<00:02:06.600> touched

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
can really be seen or touched

can really be seen or touched
I<00:02:07.970> wanted<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.030> create<00:02:09.330> imaginary<00:02:09.690> lines<00:02:10.380> in

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
I wanted to create imaginary lines in

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.880 
I wanted to create imaginary lines in
which<00:02:10.800> motifs<00:02:11.540> emotions<00:02:12.540> ideas<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.530> melodies

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
which motifs emotions ideas and melodies

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.030 
which motifs emotions ideas and melodies
flow<00:02:14.250> meet<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.360> intertwine<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.860> way

flow meet and intertwine the way

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.760 
flow meet and intertwine the way
meridians<00:02:17.580> do
