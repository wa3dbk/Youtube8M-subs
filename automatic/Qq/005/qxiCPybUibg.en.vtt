take<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.860> easy<00:03:45.890> way<00:03:46.250> out<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.730> what<00:03:47.540> we've<00:03:47.690> got

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
take the easy way out and what we've got

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.250 
take the easy way out and what we've got
here<00:03:47.930> is<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.800> power<00:03:49.010> all<00:03:49.280> powering<00:03:49.880> for<00:03:50.840> line

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
we've connected all four units we're

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.949 
we've connected all four units we're
using<00:04:15.830> for<00:04:16.250> cable<00:04:16.700> greens<00:04:17.030> which<00:04:17.690> is<00:04:17.840> the

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.460 
correct jumper cable to power these
pedals<00:04:20.120> up<00:04:20.270> and<00:04:20.660> I'm<00:04:20.870> just<00:04:20.989> going<00:04:21.109> to<00:04:21.170> strum<00:04:21.440> a

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
pedals up and I'm just going to strum a

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.160 
pedals up and I'm just going to strum a
few<00:04:21.709> chords<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.280> show<00:04:22.970> you<00:04:23.030> how<00:04:23.930> this<00:04:24.110> thing

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
few chords and show you how this thing

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.360 
few chords and show you how this thing
sounds<00:04:24.770> nice<00:04:24.980> and<00:04:25.190> clean<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:25.430> quiet

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370

[Music]

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.000 

once<00:04:41.810> again<00:04:41.930> I'll<00:04:42.169> roll<00:04:42.320> off<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.530> volume<00:04:42.830> on

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
once again I'll roll off the volume on

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.460 
once again I'll roll off the volume on
the<00:04:43.100> guitar<00:04:43.400> and<00:04:43.790> turn<00:04:44.090> up<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.330> ant<00:04:44.510> volume<00:04:44.900> so

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
the guitar and turn up the ant volume so

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.790 
the guitar and turn up the ant volume so
you<00:04:45.530> could<00:04:45.680> hear<00:04:45.889> just<00:04:46.389> dead<00:04:47.389> quiet<00:04:47.800> little

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
you could hear just dead quiet little

00:04:48.800 --> 00:05:00.159 
you could hear just dead quiet little
resonation<00:04:49.340> from<00:04:49.729> the<00:04:49.880> modulator<00:04:58.330> okay<00:04:59.330> so<00:04:59.389> we

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
resonation from the modulator okay so we

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.200 
resonation from the modulator okay so we
wanted<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.680> push<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.490> envelope<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.970> little<00:05:02.000> bit

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
wanted to push the envelope a little bit

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.240 
wanted to push the envelope a little bit
and<00:05:02.479> test<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.870> outer<00:05:03.050> limits<00:05:03.590> of<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:04.070> power

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
and test the outer limits of the power

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.120 
and test the outer limits of the power
all<00:05:04.550> power<00:05:05.330> all<00:05:05.540> capability<00:05:06.169> so<00:05:06.710> what<00:05:06.860> we<00:05:06.979> did

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
all power all capability so what we did

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.540 
all power all capability so what we did
was<00:05:07.310> we<00:05:07.340> added<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.940> boss<00:05:08.330> tu-2<00:05:09.160> tuner<00:05:10.160> at<00:05:10.310> the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
was we added a boss tu-2 tuner at the

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.250 
was we added a boss tu-2 tuner at the
end<00:05:10.699> of<00:05:10.910> our<00:05:11.120> signal<00:05:11.570> chain<00:05:11.780> with<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.080> four

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
end of our signal chain with the four

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.390 
end of our signal chain with the four
line<00:05:12.470> six<00:05:12.770> modelers

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
line six modelers

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.920 
line six modelers
so<00:05:13.520> basically<00:05:13.820> we're<00:05:14.000> doing<00:05:14.090> four<00:05:14.450> line<00:05:14.630> six

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
so basically we're doing four line six

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.280 
so basically we're doing four line six
modelers<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:15.530> a<00:05:15.979> boss<00:05:16.190> tu-2<00:05:16.520> off<00:05:17.120> of<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.780> single

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
modelers and a boss tu-2 off of a single

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.820 
modelers and a boss tu-2 off of a single
power<00:05:18.470> all<00:05:18.770> and<00:05:19.900> here<00:05:20.900> you<00:05:20.990> go<00:05:21.139> it<00:05:21.350> powers<00:05:21.650> them

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
power all and here you go it powers them

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:31.540 
power all and here you go it powers them
all<00:05:21.919> up<00:05:22.130> and<00:05:22.570> it's<00:05:23.570> dead<00:05:23.840> quiet<00:05:30.310> mute<00:05:31.310> on<00:05:31.520> the

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
all up and it's dead quiet mute on the

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.219 
all up and it's dead quiet mute on the
TU<00:05:32.510> two<00:05:33.370> back<00:05:34.370> zero<00:05:35.330> volume<00:05:35.720> on<00:05:35.810> the<00:05:35.900> guitar

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
TU two back zero volume on the guitar

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.129 
TU two back zero volume on the guitar
you<00:05:36.470> can<00:05:36.950> hear<00:05:37.389> turn<00:05:38.389> it<00:05:38.539> up<00:05:38.660> we're<00:05:38.870> getting<00:05:39.080> a

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
you can hear turn it up we're getting a

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.050 
you can hear turn it up we're getting a
little<00:05:39.199> swirly<00:05:39.800> swarm<00:05:40.400> the<00:05:40.520> modulation

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
little swirly swarm the modulation

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.719 
little swirly swarm the modulation
modeler<00:05:41.630> besides<00:05:42.440> that<00:05:42.680> it's<00:05:43.160> nice<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:43.400> dead

signal<00:06:09.050> chain<00:06:09.289> so<00:06:09.650> I<00:06:09.889> think<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.400> choice<00:06:10.580> is

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
signal chain so I think the choice is

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.040 
signal chain so I think the choice is
obvious<00:06:10.940> what<00:06:11.300> would<00:06:11.389> you<00:06:11.450> rather<00:06:11.539> carry<00:06:11.810> to<00:06:12.020> a

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
obvious what would you rather carry to a

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030
