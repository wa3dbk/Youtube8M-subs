00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.870
 Go theory this equation 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:13.769
 Confirm 1 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:18.710
 Even if the finalized student goes through the procedure 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.710
 Say an event where no change occurs 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.840
 I will explain using the figure 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.520
 Suppose that it is a scene like this now 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.770
 Next is Kudo cancer 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.470
 This stone is not alive yet 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.670
 Strike here 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.760
 It will continue for some time steps out but then White 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:18.320
 Procedure proceeds Tsu clone 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:26.920
 When the head is such not this Kuroiko is 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.920
 It will not be taken anymore It is said that the condition which can not be taken in this way is complete 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:37.110
 When the doctor lives completely, there is no change in the scene here 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.340
 eh 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.590
 Next Ueno 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.590
 You and the progress of the procedure 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.459
 It is supposed that this kind of scene 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:12.950
 Then this stone can not escape anymore 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.610
 It can be considered that this was also confirmed 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.290
 in this way 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:22.720
 The state of the scene is that the procedure goes on 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.320
 Can not change in 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.600
 I will not be able to strike again 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.600
 This is called the thing as determinism 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.720
