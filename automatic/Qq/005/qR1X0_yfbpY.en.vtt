 ideas and about economic prospects 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.830
 because they are all quite recently 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.780

 main theses of presidential speeches 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.819
 now almost know by heart and easy 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.380
 they are quoted we all know these numbers 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:13.560
 the country's GDP growth over the past year 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.840
 accounted for 6 percent GDP rate 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.239

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.959

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.150
 billion dollars how are we today 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.130
 heard already reached 100 billion 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.890
 dollars nursultan nazarbayev today 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.840
 addressed all 67 countries that have 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.819
 representation in astana but one of 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.590
 he considered it necessary to highlight them 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.060
 and give an example of how not to 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.489
 set up your own life 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.930
 it turns out Kiev in its time it was necessary 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.250
 just listen carefully 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.920
 President of Kazakhstan 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.340
 who knows the economy of the Soviet Union 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.900
 remember that Ukraine was stable 2 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.019
 powerful republic after russia today 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.670
 Ukraine’s total economy is almost 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.040
 twenty five percent inferior 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.980
 Kazakhstan’s economy should not 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.940
 had a powerful economy happen almost 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.940
 50 million people 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.900
 should have been the first to do 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.080
 economy 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.270
 and then politics as I say and yet 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.460
 one thesis was addressed more likely to 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.500
 who are overseas politicians there are quite 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.660
 worries soon and the creation of the Eurasian 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.180
 Union documents must already be signed 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.060
 after three months there Nazarbayev is not 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.270
 tired to explain why and why we 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.850
 hear and see different interpretations 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.080
 expert opinions on eurasian 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.920
 economic union 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.400
 I think it's better to protect him more deeply 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.360
 fields 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.250
 it is not a political organization and 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.890
 maybe all can be in Europe 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.080
 things are going ahead now 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.110
 being today is pure economic 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.840
 cooperation which is caused 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.570
 a necessity for our states is 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.800
 need on my neighbors 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.540
 huge horn for kazakhstan it is very 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.790
 important questions at such events 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.310
 usually do not ask immediately go to 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.530
 dessert wine and informal communication all 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.340
 it happens to the sounds of classical 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.930
 music is hard to imagine 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.780
 diplomatic reception without violins and 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.700
 cellos and of course without any of the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.980
 churches then this role is now the second year 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.810
 performs ripe Almaty aport 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.419
 selected apples the president handed out 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.370
 diplomats personally besides these edibles 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.680
 souvenirs foreign diplomats today 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.070
 received from the president also clearly a month 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.419
 on foreign policy priorities 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.400
 Kazakhstan official Astana of course 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.440
 will remain multi-vector but main 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.710
 Partners will be Russia and China 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.450
 countries of asia then usa and europe here 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.430
 exactly in that order by degree 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.590
 descending priority and it is obvious that 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.930
 It is this thesis that will form the basis of the reports. 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.450
 who are foreign ambassadors today 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.669
 will start cooking for their leadership and 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.380
 krasin grew oblique it becomes for the chief
