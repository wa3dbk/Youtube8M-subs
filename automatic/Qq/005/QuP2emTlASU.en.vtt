00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:09.210
 yes hello come that vaccinations our review Zumthor is the rehabilitation 25th 

00:00:09.739 --> 00:00:12.989
 But the covenant is looking like the first installation of a television 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:14.139
 goes on 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.189
 So he had to unpacked installed power connected antenna cable 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.380
 affiliated 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.070
 yes-sager turned on 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.310
 worldwide it continues after another 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.349
 especially in the leadership asked 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.980
 "Of course we always turn out German 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.609
 if they optimized the TV location Wilhelmshaven we are there 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:32.840
 in a shop 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.660
 Details on this you will find your text what's up with this one too 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110
 secures 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.960
 new are interviewed after choosing Landersum region code setting here 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.400
 it's about the percent 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.320
 TV reception China 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.320
 then in Germany are a praise of Germany 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.480
 do this search «We are asked if percent digital or analog 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.890
 Program to be looked for the Nikkei lost shock waves clue the 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.550
 Try out 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.430
 Now the question of whether he and all this to spin but when have something 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.160
 can happen connection 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.100
 if he still cables out 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.400
 So he kept asking if we also had encrypted programs 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 We would like to search 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.310
 not in this case 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.130
 and then just managed it 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.130
 the visit was 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.150
 Registration forms is looking for new Apple TV Weisel got the dance guard in March 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.290
 which individual frequencies through 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.880
 Here we do Kleinschmidt 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 Whatever country is going to be a bit boring 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.430
 and then let's see how long history 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.950
 Son so channel search 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.729
 Process Day I went through so mined so three to four minutes 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.080
 then we have chances 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.240
 the TV must have found 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.280
 Viniar 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.990
 and write speed 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.350
 not the fastest 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.350
 Toscani third programs 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.639
 won at that time 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.099
 Wells Wells 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.720
 the first time the programs had a production time at number two was 6 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:20.239
 East Germany was able to count program again 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.400
 going through the programs 3 4 5 6 7 and so on will be easy 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.419
 why is and start electricity 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.329
 presumably were program slots or encrypted programs will be 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.739
 encrypted Oberbillig not looking 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.739
 Of course this is not the purpose of the thing differently 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.249
 but well encrypted programs are meanwhile want to create 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.279
 look what happens if now just program three lawyers 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.869
 number keys 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:50.779
 Focus Online 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.600
 yes second spilled left 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.959
 I should also as a program point 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.329
 that he is 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.329
 Of course not so fast 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.459
 because you can also see how we can sort these channelized 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.949
 "I'll check 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:10.949
 this also lasts 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:16.039
 now comes camera settings 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.059
 program settings 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.369
 Set digitization 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.589
 No, drive 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:27.389
 To run 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.709
 Ron Hubbard long settings after 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.199
 bribe yes 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.349
 there is our program of the 10th 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.349
 that's enough 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.950
 Mitterlehner and what sort together winter program 16 still open 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.859
 then probably have to cross pad 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.809
 bring elsewhere yes 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:56.059
 but the programs still remain existing Singapore 1 2 Roddick 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.299
 he continues 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.639
 we can not simply fill this up retrospectively 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.539
 which is of course impractical 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:06.539
 almost all programs want to miss funds others would like 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.400
 So this sorting of channels 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.519
 we've seen better somewhere before that everything is a bit awkward 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.879
 why are the accident numbers between 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:30.390
 HD 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.650
 but normal program is 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.879
 some TVs need switching too fast 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.899
 from the paper but also first broadcast with the choice between 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.129
 Nelson Mandela was as the dissolution 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.330
 Tonsheide programs 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
 Schäuble must have seen the program next to it 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.300
 yes that was successful 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.520
 Players and fans program between normal
