00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:00.921
Hi Friends

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.620
Welcome to Priyanka's kitchen

00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:07.234
Today I am going to show you how to make Chickpea Flour Balls Raita

00:00:07.354 --> 00:00:09.114
This is very easy by the way

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:13.414
but when the tempering we give to it adds a different taste to it

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.300
So lets start making Chickpea flour balls raita

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.240
Ingredients we need are

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.140
take curd about 100gms

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.600
You can take more if you want

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.080
Balck Salt

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:33.125
Regular salt to taste

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.800
Chickpea flour balls("Boondi")

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.020
Red chilli powder

00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:44.054
Cumin seeds

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.280
and little bit of sugar

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.880
So lets start making

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:52.333
Take curd in a bowl

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.880
blend curd properly

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.620
you can blend it with hand beater 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.000
once it is blended properly

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.840
then add

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.460
1/2 tsp of black salt

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.020
you can use spiced salt

00:01:27.593 --> 00:01:28.873
Little bit of sugar

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:36.273
and little bit of regular salt

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.640
Mix it properly

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480
You can mix chickpea flour balls in 2 ways

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.953
One you can add it directly

00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:54.140
second if you prefer Chickpea balls soft

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.160
take warm water add Chickpea balls in it 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.280
the take out that with your hand and squeeze it to remove water and then add it 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.240
and if you add as it is it will eventually become soft after sometime

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.100
Now lets tempered this

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.880
Take oil in a pan

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.000
when oil is heated properly add cumin seeds in it

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.260
After that add red chilli powder

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.620
While adding red chilli powder keep in mind

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.520
keep flame low or else it will burn your cumin seeds

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.520
Pour it bowl as soon as you add red chilli powder

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.140
So our Tadka boondi raita is ready

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.980
Do taste it and tell us how did you like it

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.993
Thank you so much
