00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
think that that gameplay is just an

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.109 
think that that gameplay is just an
awesome<00:01:49.959> reason<00:01:50.679> number<00:01:50.770> two<00:01:50.969> the<00:01:51.969> new

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
awesome reason number two the new

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.050 
awesome reason number two the new
expanded<00:01:52.479> world<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:53.109> what<00:01:53.289> plague<00:01:53.500> night<00:01:53.740> is

some<00:03:48.349> outcry<00:03:48.739> for<00:03:48.799> something<00:03:49.250> like<00:03:49.370> that

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
some outcry for something like that

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:50.890 
some outcry for something like that
right<00:03:49.579> on<00:03:49.849> people<00:03:50.120> wanting<00:03:50.329> to<00:03:50.359> re-experience

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
right on people wanting to re-experience

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.539 
right on people wanting to re-experience
those<00:03:51.260> boss<00:03:51.530> fights<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.159> that's<00:03:52.370> something

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
those boss fights and that's something

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.210 
those boss fights and that's something
that<00:03:52.669> we're<00:03:52.819> going<00:03:52.909> to<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.209> and<00:03:54.169> then<00:03:54.620> as<00:03:55.099> you

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
that we're going to have and then as you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.819 
that we're going to have and then as you
said<00:03:55.430> there<00:03:55.849> are<00:03:55.879> going<00:03:56.030> to<00:03:56.090> be<00:03:56.439> both<00:03:57.439> shovel

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
said there are going to be both shovel

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.429 
said there are going to be both shovel
Knight<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.250> play<00:03:58.549> ignite<00:03:58.819> stages<00:03:59.450> so<00:03:59.930> it's

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
Knight and play ignite stages so it's

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.559 
Knight and play ignite stages so it's
going<00:04:00.560> to<00:04:00.620> be<00:04:00.680> just<00:04:00.889> a<00:04:01.189> big<00:04:01.639> bunch<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.239> pumped

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
going to be just a big bunch of pumped

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.110 
going to be just a big bunch of pumped
and<00:04:02.689> that's<00:04:02.870> completely<00:04:03.340> separate<00:04:04.340> from<00:04:04.370> the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
and that's completely separate from the

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.429 
and that's completely separate from the
regular<00:04:05.269> shovel<00:04:05.750> knight<00:04:05.840> adventure<00:04:06.260> but

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 
regular shovel knight adventure but

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.349 
regular shovel knight adventure but
hopefully<00:04:06.799> it<00:04:07.129> should<00:04:07.310> keep<00:04:07.549> people<00:04:07.909> really

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
hopefully it should keep people really

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.229 
hopefully it should keep people really
occupied<00:04:09.349> for<00:04:09.620> quite<00:04:09.919> a<00:04:09.950> while<00:04:10.159> it's<00:04:10.819> excuse

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
occupied for quite a while it's excuse

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:12.789 
occupied for quite a while it's excuse
