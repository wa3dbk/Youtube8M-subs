00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
that you know with the fact that in the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:35.900 
that you know with the fact that in the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
very well you know that gives us that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.180 
very well you know that gives us that
that<00:00:38.760> belief<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.899> can<00:00:40.140> produce<00:00:40.469> two

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that belief that we can produce two

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.069
