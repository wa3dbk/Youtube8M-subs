00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.490
 be second with peace 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.849
 how to make a compass let's put 2 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.559
 200-2 tablitas these is very short I 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.170
 I want to piste make it longer because it's 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:23.970
 good if you want our 30 meters the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.920
 child compass to work 35 centimeters 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.730
 we're going to make you we can double the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:35.130
 surfers this has two by 12 for about 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.740
 good of stability we choose 22 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.060
 taquitos 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.340
 two taquitos and we are going to paste them 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.270
 each one to its respective tip list we 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.510
 we paste so in this way stuck 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.510
 all right 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.550
 after we have stuck it and 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.810
 after it is stuck well stuck 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.160
 let's make the holes 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.890
 buildings that is for the screw and for 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.250
 the api seen when you are stuck 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.670
 we make the holes 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.470
 Here we already have it. 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.610
 let's move on to make the politicians of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.980
 this world 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.350
 of a quarter 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.350
 we make the hole for the pencil 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.320
 this is not have teeth 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 Y 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.780
 this style needs in the neighborhood has 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.780
 been because we have to see 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.150
 do not 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.860
 the building for a carpet 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.450
 our a little bit liked but now 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:03.030
 that I've seen now and then we flip it 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.030
 and we make the screw building 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.980
 if we take out the service, it will be left there 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.980
 we work 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.709
 more from this list the young field 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.709
 now let's rest the drill 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.939
 we already have the hole for the pencil and 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.040
 the hole for the screw after 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.900
 this we go to the mountains without end other 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.629
 for the sierra has been very important 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.160
 sierra if you have very important friends 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.720
 the civil sierra 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.720
 and we can program it 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:48.209
 we can not cut it 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:53.760
 to connect to cut it by the 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:55.610
 we can half do it in such a way that the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.540
 half 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.540
 I clarify 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.769
 he dug he regrets the cortecito then 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.769
 we start 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.780
 once we have made the cut by the 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.580
 half once our cut by the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.510
 half and we are now available for 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.239
 put the pencil 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.730
 in this way and we look for a screw 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.720
 that we have a screw of a gantry 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.720
 we work them 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.650
 this one that will give us support for the 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.390
 web to go up or down the track but 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.950
 we put in the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.330
 but we are and since the pencil 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.330
 after this we have this screw 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.270
 with tip 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.750
 with point is that we are going to go through here 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.540
 this the have bars to serve as axis 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.329
 as 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.980
 as it is main so that it is a 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:21.430
 our circles and we have our 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:24.880
 our tool is your tv and it 's 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.670
 My friend tell him to do it because he is 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.890
 very important our workshop have them and 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.240
 that occurs when someone sees it and won 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.240
 Well, I did tips, we have our 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.240
 system 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:44.310
 we have the pencil height as we close 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.810
 and we started we marked him in the center like this 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.810
 because the tool does not move us 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.690
 and tells you media this I can lift 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.690
 as I have the center already marked 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:01.520
 what beauty then what happens 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.940
 well then for today 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.910
 We end up with 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.220
 why share the knowledge 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.470
 of what I have learned every day 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.010
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:22.760
 liked these so rickety and nobodies 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.780
