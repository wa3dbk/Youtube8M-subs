00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.190
 accommodation houses operated in residential buildings in the 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
 ordinary apartments 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.660
 narrowness and range of services far from those 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.970

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.570
 international hostal moscow 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.489
 Ads often call themselves 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.170
 accommodation for illegal migrants 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.510
 total have not registered your 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 no one recognized us like that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.150
 compete 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.130
 or dubious hostels which 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.470
 open up right in the apartments despite 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.740
 to disturb the neighbors constantly noise-din 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.420
 at night the bottles are flying with 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.970
 the station is generally incomprehensible rabble 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.950
 some kind of alcoholics all and not drag 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.840
 foreign tourists from such tired of 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.299
 just run to neighbors run nowhere 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.220
 complain to the police but outfits coming 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.159
 on calls to close these docks 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 hurry though the violation is obvious hotels 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.150
 and store restaurants can not be placed in 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.240
 residential buildings if the room is not specifically 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.399
 equipped and do not have a separate entrance 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.860
 not allowed 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.380
 placements of objects that worsen 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.210
 living conditions and are 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.579
 noise sources 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 vibration to close such a business 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.689
 you must first prove that it is 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.579
 mini-hotel according to the ownerâ€™s documents 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.799
 hostels are simply the owners of the apartment 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.350
 who give it to hire and it does not matter that 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.329
 tenants time 25 law this is not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.520
 prohibits not prohibit it and hang on 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.140
 flat plate h became in no 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.300
 state to us document definition 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.490
 this word until recently 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.400
 there was simply no time to eat 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.850
 the concept of accommodation services and there 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.650
 was not there were hotels there 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.780
 tourist resorts 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.820
 there was not any has to love is now 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.770
 such a concept appeared technical 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.990
 Inspection has developed a year where clearly 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.490
 prescribed requirements for the tables in which 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.560
 indoors they may be located 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.150
 how much to their room can be placed 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.370
 even the minimum distance is indicated 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.020
 between the beds and the number of sinks on 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.150
 floor starting next year 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.400
 the hostel will offer to be tested for 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.350
 match guests and get licensed 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.310
 to start working on completely 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.580
 legal grounds 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.670
 so that we have from, we also knew our rights 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.680
 what yes here we are he is certified and we 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.840
 we have the right to exist here 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.360
 such such all of us is impossible 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.580
 not 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.800
 in no way chase yes no 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.750
 close anything those who refuse to quit 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.670
 from the shadows will close and to this 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.980
 the process went away and the Moscow City Duma 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.140
 together with Rospotrebnadzor plans 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.210
 eliminate a loophole in the law and clearly 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.400
 share those who simply rent apartments in 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.650
 hiring and those who actually transforms 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.760
 them in the hostel but for now living in 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.490
 adjacent to rubber flats 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.500
 there are two options to try 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.570
 negotiate with their owners preferably 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.430
 before I could take my own 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.410
 first visitors had them strangers 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.580
 people in our entrance 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.690
 heads to walk yet until we 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.560
 see django persons here will be fatal 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:42.600
 I am and if you still can not turn 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.950
 for help to Themis I now have a question 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.300
 closing each of these apartments 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.750
 hotels remains at the discretion of the judge 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.750
 darek you before
