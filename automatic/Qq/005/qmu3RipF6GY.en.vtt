00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
else and then if you miss the game and
you<00:00:38.370> didn't<00:00:38.700> have<00:00:38.820> PlayStation<00:00:39.450> Plus<00:00:39.660> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
you didn't have PlayStation Plus that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.080 
you didn't have PlayStation Plus that
month<00:00:40.320> then<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.430> go<00:00:41.579> ahead<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.760> purchase

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.959 
month then you can go ahead and purchase
it<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.350> I<00:00:43.620> believe<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.250> rumored<00:00:44.760> more

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
it so I believe this is rumored more

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
it so I believe this is rumored more
than<00:00:45.149> anything<00:00:45.480> else<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.440> was

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
than anything else because it was

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
than anything else because it was
already<00:00:46.890> released<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.910> went<00:00:48.120> straight

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
already released and it went straight

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.080 
already released and it went straight
for<00:00:48.930> sale<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.980> did<00:00:50.160> pretty<00:00:50.370> good<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.820> the
