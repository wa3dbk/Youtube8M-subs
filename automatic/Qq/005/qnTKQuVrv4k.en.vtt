00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.720
 we are going to need painting enamel its 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.720
 acrylic paint 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.580
 the glue 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.359
 rings 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.050
 these are medium and we are a little 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.050
 more girls 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.130
 chains 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.720
 scissors 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.720
 roller 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.660
 cold porcelain and a toothpick 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.160
 let's take a little ball and let's do 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.380
 a rectangle 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.380
 that is rounded off the edges 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.410
 and let's break it in half 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.410
 ah 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.570
 and with a knife we ​​will form the part 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.310
 d 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.310
 of the holes in the lenses 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.570
 to do it a little more start we're going to 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.960
 help us with a toothpick 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:35.350
 and we are going to rotate around all the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.350
 circle of the entire lens gap 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.280
 ah 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.640
 we do not make holes in the 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.640
 corners 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.159
 and in the bottom 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.359
 do not 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.359
 and let it dry 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.130
 to make the mustache 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.130
 let's make a rectangle 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.870
 ah 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.049
 and return from half above and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.049
 down 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.989
 but at the bottom it's going to be a 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.989
 little more separated than the one above 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.640
 and we are going to pull the banks 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.640
 making a peak shape 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.980
 plus 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.720
 with help of some stage or something round 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.200
 let's put it in the back 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.510
 this is for 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.510
 give it a kind of volume 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.490
 we're going to make two holes 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.030
 in the height of where we made the two 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.030
 of the lens 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.060
 ah 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.260
 we let it dry 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.099
 we are going to form a ball and we are going to 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.099
 crush it 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.060
 and let's help, let's go with the scissors 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.060
 to do as a half circle 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.140
 and let's make another little ball 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.150
 but this time we're going to make a strip 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.150
 thin 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.290
 and we are going to put glue in the 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.290
 the middle of the circle 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:37.550
 and we are going to place the strip 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.090
 just let's wrap it from the other side 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.090
 ah 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.230
 that's how the hat looks 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.520
 and on the edge of the part of the 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.520
 hat corners 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.790
 we're going to make two holes one in 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.790
 each side 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.630
 and let's do 2 up 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:17.120
 is the hat we are going to wait for 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.169
 dry 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.169
 the lenses 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.620
 and the mustache 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.260
 once dry we will paint it 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.460
 let's give two to three passes of 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.330
 painting 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.710
 and so we're going to paint the lenses and the 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.870
 moustache 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.200
 as it is dry we will put 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.200
 rings 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.440
 we are going to put a large one and 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.440
 little girl 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:09.289
 and so we are going to do it in all 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.180
 holes for example this one that goes down 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:13.520
 in the lens is not going to put 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.270
 the little girl nothing more in the putting the 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.270
 large hoop 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.120
 ah 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.610
 and in this we are going to put the ring 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.189
 little 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.189
 to join the lenses with the mustache 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.920
 and so we 're going to do it with the hat and 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:40.010
 now let's put the chain 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.010
 ah 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.120
