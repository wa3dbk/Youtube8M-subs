00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.740
 here on this stretch ensued to 6 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.989
 brushes fruits are very small but pay 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.989
 attention they all turned to the sun then 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.170
 there are all the leaves that are shaded 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.330
 brushes we removed note that 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.180
 on the leaves there is such a bluish 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.190
 raid in the month of July spread 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.050
 diseases gray days and brown 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.860
 spotting here is a manifestation of brown 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.160
 spotted top of the sheet light 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.370
 yellowish yellowish color and on the other 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.600
 leaf sides such a gray brown patina 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.430
 spotting is very fast 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.100
 spreads eats up literally the whole 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.700
 leaf apparatus and the plant dies it 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.180
 macro fucking with concentric specks 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.369
 tissue dries up and there is also a leaflet 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.560
 what are the ways to fight 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.509
 but first of all it is known to all 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.170
 Bordeaux mixture spraying 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.440
 held 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.619
 since July every two 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.630
 weeks so the plant we protect from 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.050
 many many diseases including 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.630
 blight what other ways to care 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.270
 for tomatoes and feeding you need to do in 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.160
 this period from flowering to 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.170
 fruit formations in tomatoes are very 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.770
 big need first of all is 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.770
 taste avery 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.539
 and in feces and therefore fertilizing fertilizers 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.090
 good to do and root and foliar 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.009
 but foliar feeding the same 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.649
 superphosphate can only be done 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.330
 If there is no gray rot and brown 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.880
 spotting if the plant is absolutely 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.789
 healthy and if the plant is weak 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.989
 leaves are weak and yellowish 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.759
 that is 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.500
 and nitrogen deficiency therefore need 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.840
 apply complex fertilizer such 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.880
 like nitroammofoska nitrophoska 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.560
 It often happens that tomato plants 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.780
 often fall off and brought 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.550
 and flowers what is it connected but in 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.430
 First of all on the poppy does not like very much 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.920
 Strongly 3 moisturizing especially if very 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.569
 often a person is absent in the country 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.030
 the overdried soil comes and immediately 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.150
 plentifully start watering just such 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.819
 teachers and cause as a fall and ovary 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.160
 and flowers well, and the second is a disadvantage 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.910
 magnesium so keep on hand 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.980
 magnesium sulphate 0 2 100 percent 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.159
 the solution needs to be done 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.780
 feeding magnesium in irrigation of tomatoes 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.330
 try to do so in no way 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.980
 case, the water did not fall on the leaves and 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.049
 water especially with long 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.299
 cool down try warm water 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.819
 because with a lack of phosphorus you 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.709
 very often noticed the downside 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.840
 leaflet even in adult plants 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.950
 becomes slightly purple it 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.530
 says that the root system 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.200
 stopped working so came on 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.959
 your plot your greenhouse must 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.019
 make watering with warm water even further 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.329
 with fruit rot, see 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.280
 often it is dry then this 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.170
 secondary infection it gets wet 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.420
 from what it comes in the first place 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.290
 it is calcium deficiency therefore 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.720
 use 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.090
 calcium nitrate but if you have 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.099
 the motto on the hall which contains a huge 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.140
 quantity and trace elements and such 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.879
 essential elements like calcium and potassium 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.310
 and phosphorus then be sure to do a 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.760
 top dressing with ash in soil 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:37.250
 a good handful of the hall and around the plant 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.079
 then you close up the hall with a hopper 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.750
 at the same time spend and loosening 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.639
 surface soil layer and after that 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.099
 already do watering when applying 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.530
 fertilizers such as Kemer Kombik 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.840
 mineral wagon ring saltpeter it 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.480
 physiological acid fertilizers therefore 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.530
 Do not forget that tomatoes do not like 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.299
 acidic soil and therefore do or 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.690
 sprinkle with chalk or you can 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.669
 do 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.250
 dolomite flour look like this 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.380
 just make sprinkle too between 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.260
 plant but sprinkle need not only 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.510
 near the plants and the top is all superficial 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.419
 layer of your greenhouse after this 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:19.880
 close up the soil and watering do here 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.859
 such dressing dolomite flour or 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.630
 chalk construction needs to be done for the season 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.030
 at least two or three times but it is also 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.190
 depends on your soil and condition 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.660
 grows tomatoes in our greenhouse we 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.639
 care must do shaking 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.770
 plants you know what's there and you yourself 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.050
 dust optional pollinator itself 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.830
 shaking plants just at noon 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.270
 when good sunny weather she 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.070
 allows the plant to tie more 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.380
 the amount of fruit however not the leaves 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.229
 tomato than it is connected this too 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.120
 physiological process and very often 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.569
 if you go into the greenhouse and it looks 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.639
 on 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:54.589
 plants in the morning a crown plant 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.479
 twisted and for dinner she remember 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:58.639
 straightens up means everything is in order and 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.919
 worry about anything don't forget about 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.729
 which is very important for tomatoes moderately and 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.300
 moisturizing 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:06.919
 if excessive sheet apparatus that is 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.809
 leaves are removed not only to 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.699
 fruits ripen faster but it 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.830
 promotes mesh spread 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.349
 diseases and plants feels 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.589
 much better from the moment of flowering to 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:21.020
 fruit ripening takes 45â€“50 days 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.969
 so at the end of July as soon as the 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.649
 charge the last brush you need 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:26.599
 must do bagging 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:28.879
 try to keep the temperature in the greenhouse 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.499
 never exceeded 10 degrees finger 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.899
 becomes sterile and the fruit is not 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:36.639
 tied up here is the basic conditions for 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.639
 Tomato care for the third period
