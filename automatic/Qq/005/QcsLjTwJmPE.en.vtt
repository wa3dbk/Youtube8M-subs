they're<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> try<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> back<00:01:47.149> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
they're going to try to get it back to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.630 
they're going to try to get it back to
its<00:01:48.180> original<00:01:48.420> flight<00:01:49.049> path<00:01:49.340> which<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.490> going

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
its original flight path which is going

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.380 
its original flight path which is going
to<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:50.909> some<00:01:50.939> time<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:53.119> while<00:01:54.119> they're

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
to take some time and while they're

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.649 
to take some time and while they're
doing<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:56.610> may<00:01:56.939> take<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.329> several

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
doing this it may take up to several

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.620 
doing this it may take up to several
days<00:01:58.430> they<00:01:59.430> will<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.820> be<00:02:00.030> able<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> collect

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
days they will not be able to collect

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
days they will not be able to collect
any<00:02:00.840> scientific<00:02:01.469> data<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.979> what<00:02:02.130> they're

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
any scientific data is what they're

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.490 
any scientific data is what they're
saying

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.940 

so<00:02:07.100> they<00:02:07.400> get<00:02:07.550> this<00:02:07.820> close<00:02:08.470> they<00:02:09.470> say<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:09.830> is

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
so they get this close they say this is

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.560 
so they get this close they say this is
what<00:02:10.130> happens<00:02:10.490> when<00:02:10.550> you're<00:02:10.759> 3<00:02:10.970> billion<00:02:11.390> miles

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
what happens when you're 3 billion miles

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.700 
what happens when you're 3 billion miles
from<00:02:11.780> home<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.480> know<00:02:14.630> out<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.900> all<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.200> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.880
