00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Off the coast of Norway,  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
scientists onboard the 'Star Atlantic'

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
are investigating a strange phenomenon. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The once huge cod are getting smaller and smaller...

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The case of the shrinking cod

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Scientists want to find out why this is happening.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The Case of the Shrinking Cod

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For centuries, Bergen in Norway has been the centre of the fishing trade in northern Europe. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Many generations of fishermen have been wrestling cod from the sea. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Cod has become a staple of the european diet 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and a way of life for people living on the coast of Norway. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but in the 1950s, something happened. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The cod, which the fishermen found in their nets, became smaller. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The large cod had disappeared.  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The scientists on the 'Star Atlantic' haul in a fishing net full of cod for analysis.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Since the 1930s scientists have been recording the size and age of the cod. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
To determine the age of the fish, they study the cod's ear bones, better known as otoliths.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Ear bones or otoliths, they grow a bit like trees. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So, as the fish grows, it lays rings. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And you can age a fish on the basis of this growth rings in Otoliths.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
After 1940s you see an increase in the fishing intensity, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and a continuous decline in age and size of maturation. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And that is the big discussion, like one hypothesis is that when you have less fish in the Ocean, 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
it is more resources for the fish that is left. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, they can have more food and etc., so they can grow faster and reach maturation faster.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This ecological hypothesis says that the cod is shrinking because its surroundings have changed...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That more and more fish are being caught than before.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
To let the cod stock recover, cod fishing was strongly regulated through minimum mesh sizes and quotas, 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
limiting the amount of fish the fishermen were allowed to catch. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But the fish stayed small. The norwegian cod stock was in trouble. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
However, evolutionary biologists have an ingenious theory:

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That the cod had evolved to escape the fishermens nets!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
They expected it to recover quite soon, 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it would if it had been only an ecological effect, but it didn't. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Then people started considering indeed it might have some evolutionary effect that was happening here, evolutionary changes.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
With this special camera, which has been attached to a fishing net, 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
we can see that only the large fish are being caught. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The small fish can easily escape through the mesh, but the large fish are trapped inside. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So small fish, they can generally escape, and thats even the idea with these large meshes. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
They want to be sure that the small fish escape and can grow larger. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
In a natural situation, usually it is an advantage to be big, because then you are safe from more predators. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Small fish are eaten by almost anybody, but big fish can escape.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Fishing reverses this situation. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Because we preferentially target large fish, because they are more valuable as food and resource. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
That makes it dangerous to be large, because those are targeted. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So, it pays to stay a bit smaller, because then you are less exposed to fishing.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
If these scientists are right, then fishing induces evolution, evolution towards smaller cod. 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And the more we fish this way, the smaller the cod will become.  

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
When we are fishing, we are doing the opposite of what is done in animal breeding. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
An interesting way of understanding how fishing is influencing fish stock, is to think of animal breeding. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And in animal breeding, breeders select the best animals to breed. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So, their genes are passed on and over time you get better and better cattle or whatever. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Whereas in fishing, it is pretty much the opposite. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So, we fish the best individuals, the large fish, and prevent them from spawning. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
So, instead those fish that are not so attractive, they get the chance to spawn and spread their genes.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
For a nation that relies heavily on the fishing industry to drive its economy, the shrinking cod is worrying news. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
After all, the biggest cod bring the biggest profits at market.  

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Since the cod is economically important, then we want to find out, what is the economic impact of the fishery. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
They are maturing earlier, they are smaller, does this have an economic impact? 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And then, since everyone wants to have a large yield as possible, and the fish is getting smaller, is this effecting the yield?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And for the economic impact, evolutionary changes are especially bad, because this could mean that the cod will stay small. 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Is this only driven by ecology or are there also evolutionary effects? 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Because if there are evolutionary effects, these are more difficult to reverse.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The evolutionary scientists are close to proving their theory, 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
but their critics say that without genetic proof they won't believe the theory.  

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Evolutionary change is always a genetic change, but in the case of the cod, not much is known about the genetics. 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
We are now sequencing the cod genome, and that is interesting in itself. 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But it might help us understand what the genetic basis for this is. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So, we do not have a genetic understanding of this at the present, but we are working towards that, 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
we are working toward that, other groups in the world are also working towards that. 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So my expectation will be that in a few years we will have a much better understanding of the genetic basis for this.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It remains to be seen if norway's cod will ever return to the size it was at the beginning of the 20th century. 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
However, studying the evolutionary theory will help scientists better understand what is happening in the northern european seas, 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and go some way to ensure that future stocks of cod are protected.
