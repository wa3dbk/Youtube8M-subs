00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
it was originally a car factory and came

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.179 
it was originally a car factory and came
a<00:00:18.480> military<00:00:18.990> barracks<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.770> there's<00:00:19.950> still

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
a military barracks and there's still

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.580 
a military barracks and there's still
some<00:00:20.850> hopping<00:00:21.180> barracks<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.720> Jason<00:00:22.140> maybe

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
some hopping barracks at Jason maybe

some hopping barracks at Jason maybe
they're<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:22.830> news<00:00:23.189> anymore<00:00:23.750> so<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> idea<00:00:24.930> was

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
they're not news anymore so the idea was

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.589 
they're not news anymore so the idea was
that<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.040> keep<00:00:26.340> some<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.450> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
that going to really keep some of the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.840 
that going to really keep some of the
existing<00:00:27.840> building<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:29.070> kind<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.340> compress

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
new building would be so the many

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
way it was very critical because it's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.100
