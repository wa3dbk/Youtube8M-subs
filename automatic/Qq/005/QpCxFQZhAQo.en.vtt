really stick out and be unique well I
think<00:00:45.840> there's<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> lot<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.070> areas<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.030> we're

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
think there's a lot of areas that we're

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.940 
think there's a lot of areas that we're
trying<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> do<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.930> two<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.500> big<00:00:49.710> ones

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
trying to do that in two of the big ones

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.850 
trying to do that in two of the big ones
one<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.610> combat<00:00:51.230> you<00:00:52.230> if<00:00:52.469> you've<00:00:52.649> seen

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
one is combat you if you've seen

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
one is combat you if you've seen
anything<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:53.460> our<00:00:53.579> combat<00:00:53.940> lately<00:00:54.270> we<00:00:54.420> have

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
anything about our combat lately we have

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.200 
anything about our combat lately we have
a<00:00:54.690> pretty<00:00:55.140> unique<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.770> dynamic<00:00:55.920> system<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
a pretty unique and dynamic system they

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
a pretty unique and dynamic system they
did<00:00:57.750> just<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> seem<00:00:59.850> pretty

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
did just see it you seem pretty

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
did just see it you seem pretty
impressed<00:01:00.480> when<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.719> say<00:01:01.280> but<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
impressed when you say but that's one of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
impressed when you say but that's one of
the<00:01:02.940> big<00:01:03.420> differentiators<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.379> we're

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the big differentiators that we're

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.410 
the big differentiators that we're
focusing<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.129> combat<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.180> something

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
focusing on combat is something

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.090 
focusing on combat is something
obviously<00:01:06.570> you're<00:01:06.990> doing<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> time<00:01:07.740> in

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
obviously you're doing all the time in

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.670 
obviously you're doing all the time in
MMOs<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.570> wanted<00:01:09.810> our<00:01:09.930> combat<00:01:10.350> system

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
MMOs and so we wanted our combat system

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
MMOs and so we wanted our combat system
to<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.920> something<00:01:11.640> unique<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.119> memorable<00:01:12.360> and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
to be something unique and memorable and

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.450 
to be something unique and memorable and
we<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.740> we've<00:01:13.920> sort<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.250> hit<00:01:14.340> on

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
we think that we've sort of hit on

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.100 
we think that we've sort of hit on
something<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.820> people<00:01:15.150> seem<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.360> enjoy<00:01:15.509> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
something that people seem to enjoy and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
something that people seem to enjoy and
that<00:01:16.409> kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> hinges<00:01:17.100> around<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.700> idea<00:01:17.909> of

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
that kind of hinges around this idea of

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.210 
that kind of hinges around this idea of
Telegraph's<00:01:19.229> right<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.770> explain<00:01:20.070> what

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
Telegraph's right can you explain what

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.670 
Telegraph's right can you explain what
those<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.490> yeah<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.270> while<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.259> play<00:01:22.470> our

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
those are yeah so while you play our

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.710 
those are yeah so while you play our
game<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.130> you're<00:01:23.340> engaging<00:01:23.850> hostile<00:01:24.509> mobs

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
game and you're engaging hostile mobs

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
game and you're engaging hostile mobs
you<00:01:25.110> will<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.470> Telegraph's<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> ground

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you will see Telegraph's on the ground

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.920 
you will see Telegraph's on the ground

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
from those indicators can take different

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440 
from those indicators can take different

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
they engage you with and so because of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
they engage you with and so because of
that<00:01:44.009> our<00:01:44.310> combat<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.270> pretty<00:01:45.630> dynamic<00:01:45.840> it's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that our combat is pretty dynamic it's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.510 
that our combat is pretty dynamic it's
that<00:01:46.500> there's<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> lot<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.890> movement

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that there's a lot of movement

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.719 
that there's a lot of movement
associated<00:01:48.329> with<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> we<00:01:49.049> design<00:01:49.439> our

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
associated with it we design our

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.980 
associated with it we design our
abilities<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.880> our<00:01:50.970> classes<00:01:51.450> around<00:01:51.570> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
abilities in our classes around the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.039 
abilities in our classes around the
system<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:53.220> think<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> something

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
system and we think that it's something

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.270 
system and we think that it's something
something<00:01:55.049> different<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.470> there<00:01:55.530> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
something different out there that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
something different out there that
people<00:01:56.310> haven't<00:01:56.700> seen<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.689> lot<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.960> the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
people haven't seen and a lot of the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
people haven't seen and a lot of the
combat<00:01:58.469> also<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.159> hinges<00:01:59.460> around<00:01:59.640> using

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
combat also kind of hinges around using

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.749 
combat also kind of hinges around using
the<00:02:00.600> environment<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> your<00:02:01.320> advantage<00:02:01.729> yeah<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
the environment to your advantage yeah I

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.330 
the environment to your advantage yeah I
mean<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.420> we<00:02:03.990> talked<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> lot<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:05.219> we

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
mean so we talked a lot about what we

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.670 
mean so we talked a lot about what we
call<00:02:05.520> dynamic<00:02:05.820> play<00:02:06.390> spaces<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.079> not<00:02:07.290> only<00:02:07.469> do

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
call dynamic play spaces so not only do

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.410 
call dynamic play spaces so not only do
we<00:02:07.799> have<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> sort<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.610> new<00:02:08.789> end<00:02:08.970> dynamic

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
we have a sort of a new end dynamic

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.780 
we have a sort of a new end dynamic
combat<00:02:09.810> system<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.830> try<00:02:11.039> to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
combat system but we try to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.449 
combat system but we try to
design<00:02:12.420> play<00:02:12.659> spaces<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.260> have<00:02:13.319> things<00:02:14.310> that

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
design play spaces that have things that

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.949 
design play spaces that have things that
you<00:02:14.549> can<00:02:14.700> take<00:02:14.819> advantage<00:02:14.969> of<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.599> one<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
you can take advantage of so one of the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.619 
you can take advantage of so one of the
things<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.349> our<00:02:16.469> demo<00:02:16.829> we<00:02:17.099> have<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.849> minefield

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
things in our demo we have a minefield

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.530 
things in our demo we have a minefield
and<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.829> draw<00:02:20.159> NPCs<00:02:21.030> into<00:02:21.390> those

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and so you can draw NPCs into those

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.240 
and so you can draw NPCs into those
minefields<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.260> then<00:02:22.709> as<00:02:22.859> long<00:02:22.890> as<00:02:23.159> you're

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
minefields and then as long as you're

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.679 
minefields and then as long as you're
not<00:02:23.310> getting<00:02:23.670> blown<00:02:23.849> up<00:02:24.000> by<00:02:24.150> them<00:02:24.359> you<00:02:24.390> can

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
not getting blown up by them you can

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.539 
not getting blown up by them you can
draw<00:02:24.930> enemies<00:02:25.560> in<00:02:25.709> and<00:02:25.890> blow<00:02:26.010> them<00:02:26.189> up<00:02:26.310> using

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
draw enemies in and blow them up using

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.240 
draw enemies in and blow them up using
that<00:02:27.079> that's<00:02:28.079> just<00:02:28.260> an<00:02:28.379> exam<00:02:28.709> one<00:02:28.920> example

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
that that's just an exam one example

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.830 
that that's just an exam one example
those<00:02:29.519> kind<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.819> mind<00:02:30.060> figure<00:02:30.359> or<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.569> sort<00:02:30.780> of

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
those kind of mind figure or the sort of

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.720 
those kind of mind figure or the sort of
dynamic<00:02:31.260> play<00:02:31.680> spaces<00:02:31.920> are<00:02:32.159> all<00:02:32.250> over<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
dynamic play spaces are all over the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.910 
dynamic play spaces are all over the
game<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.870> think<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.620> think<00:02:34.709> people

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
game and so I think that I think people

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.800 
game and so I think that I think people
are<00:02:35.189> going<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> enjoy<00:02:35.579> so<00:02:36.090> obviously<00:02:36.569> there's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
are going to enjoy so obviously there's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.539 
are going to enjoy so obviously there's
a<00:02:36.900> lot<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.260> accommodating<00:02:37.950> for<00:02:38.099> different

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
a lot of accommodating for different

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.030 
a lot of accommodating for different
play<00:02:38.760> styles<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.329> here<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:40.379> speaking<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:40.920> that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
play styles in here and speaking to that

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.309 
play styles in here and speaking to that
you<00:02:41.370> also<00:02:41.519> have<00:02:42.090> introduced<00:02:42.719> this<00:02:42.840> idea<00:02:42.989> of

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
you also have introduced this idea of

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.440 
you also have introduced this idea of
paths<00:02:43.680> right<00:02:44.069> right<00:02:44.579> so<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:45.030> was<00:02:45.209> sort<00:02:45.359> of

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
paths right right so that was sort of

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.000 
paths right right so that was sort of
the<00:02:45.599> other<00:02:45.780> way<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.319> think<00:02:46.620> we're<00:02:46.769> really

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the other way that I think we're really

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.750 
the other way that I think we're really
trying<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.489> innovate<00:02:47.700> our<00:02:48.030> path<00:02:48.810> system<00:02:49.379> is

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
trying to innovate our path system is

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.979 
trying to innovate our path system is
designed<00:02:50.760> around<00:02:51.209> different<00:02:51.780> play<00:02:51.959> styles

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
designed around different play styles

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.009 
designed around different play styles
and<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.220> along<00:02:53.939> with<00:02:53.970> choosing<00:02:54.329> your<00:02:54.599> race<00:02:54.810> in

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
and so along with choosing your race in

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.330 
and so along with choosing your race in
your<00:02:55.139> class<00:02:55.379> at<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.680> beginning<00:02:56.010> of<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.189> game

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
your class at the beginning of the game

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.449 
your class at the beginning of the game
you<00:02:56.549> also<00:02:56.819> get<00:02:56.939> to<00:02:57.060> choose<00:02:57.090> your<00:02:57.269> path<00:02:57.599> and

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
you also get to choose your path and

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.740 
you also get to choose your path and
each<00:02:59.459> path<00:02:59.849> there<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.239> four<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.510> them

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
each path there are four of them

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.890 
each path there are four of them
scientist<00:03:01.439> soldier<00:03:01.919> settler<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.269> explore

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
scientist soldier settler and explore

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.539 
scientist soldier settler and explore
each<00:03:04.230> one<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.560> them<00:03:04.709> has<00:03:04.769> different<00:03:05.400> play

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
each one of them has different play

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.909 
each one of them has different play
styles<00:03:05.599> that<00:03:06.599> their<00:03:06.840> content<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.470> designed

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
styles that their content is designed

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.770 
styles that their content is designed
around<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.730> you're<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:08.909> soldier<00:03:09.180> obviously

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
around so if you're a soldier obviously

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.690 
around so if you're a soldier obviously
you're<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.530> kind<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.799> player<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.280> likes<00:03:11.549> to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
you're the kind of player that likes to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.550 
you're the kind of player that likes to
fight<00:03:11.909> and<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:12.870> we're<00:03:13.109> going<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.319> throw<00:03:13.500> you

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
fight and so we're going to throw you

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.589 
fight and so we're going to throw you
into<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:13.889> lot<00:03:14.189> of<00:03:14.370> situations<00:03:14.519> that<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.359> to<00:03:15.480> do

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
into a lot of situations that have to do

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.689 
into a lot of situations that have to do
with<00:03:15.750> combat<00:03:16.139> if<00:03:16.379> you're<00:03:16.590> an<00:03:16.680> explorer<00:03:17.129> we're

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:17.699 
with combat if you're an explorer we're

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.069 
with combat if you're an explorer we're
going<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.940> send<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.810> highest

going to send you to the highest
mountains<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.829> deepest<00:03:20.220> caves<00:03:20.459> and

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
mountains and the deepest caves and

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.610 
mountains and the deepest caves and
you're<00:03:20.879> going<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.440> rewarded<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.590> doing

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
you're going to be rewarded for doing

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.819 
you're going to be rewarded for doing
that<00:03:23.329> all<00:03:24.329> of<00:03:24.659> the<00:03:24.780> mechanics<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.620> things

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
that all of the mechanics and the things

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:26.869 
that all of the mechanics and the things
that<00:03:25.889> you're<00:03:26.040> doing<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.459> each<00:03:26.579> one<00:03:26.729> of<00:03:26.760> those

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
that you're doing in each one of those

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.559 
that you're doing in each one of those
paths<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.359> paths<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.139> unique<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.729> we<00:03:30.329> also

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
paths is paths is unique and so we also

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.149 
paths is paths is unique and so we also
think<00:03:30.959> that's<00:03:31.199> something<00:03:31.769> else<00:03:32.040> that's

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
think that's something else that's

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.500 
think that's something else that's
different<00:03:32.639> about<00:03:32.699> our<00:03:32.849> game<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.269> you're<00:03:33.389> not

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
different about our game that you're not

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.509 
different about our game that you're not
going<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.780> get<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.109> any<00:03:34.500> other<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:35.159> definitely

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
going to get in any other it definitely

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.069 
going to get in any other it definitely
seems<00:03:35.729> like<00:03:35.940> there's<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.180> lot<00:03:36.329> more<00:03:36.389> variation

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
seems like there's a lot more variation

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.050 
seems like there's a lot more variation
environments<00:03:37.650> especially<00:03:37.849> vertically<00:03:38.849> you

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
environments especially vertically you

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.550 
environments especially vertically you
know<00:03:39.180> we're<00:03:39.329> at<00:03:39.479> the<00:03:39.629> top<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:40.109> mountain<00:03:40.229> one

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
know we're at the top of a mountain one

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.020 
know we're at the top of a mountain one
second<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.159> then<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.519> next<00:03:41.639> we<00:03:41.879> were

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
second and then the next we were

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.170 
second and then the next we were
underwater<00:03:42.629> in<00:03:43.109> a<00:03:43.199> cave<00:03:43.669> what<00:03:44.669> what<00:03:44.909> are<00:03:45.000> some

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
underwater in a cave what what are some

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.189 
underwater in a cave what what are some
of<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.299> different<00:03:45.569> kinds<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.810> environments

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
of the different kinds of environments

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.689 
of the different kinds of environments
that<00:03:46.379> people<00:03:46.709> can<00:03:46.889> expect<00:03:47.159> to<00:03:47.280> see<00:03:47.489> here<00:03:47.669> that

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
that people can expect to see here that

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.110 
that people can expect to see here that
are<00:03:48.000> kind<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.239> out<00:03:48.389> of<00:03:48.419> the<00:03:48.569> norm<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:49.709> have

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
are kind of out of the norm we have

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.069 
are kind of out of the norm we have
archaeological<00:03:51.120> digs<00:03:51.359> with<00:03:51.599> massive

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
archaeological digs with massive

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.710 
archaeological digs with massive
hundred-foot<00:03:52.620> Elden<00:03:53.609> robots<00:03:54.090> and<00:03:54.359> we<00:03:54.479> have

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
hundred-foot Elden robots and we have

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.490 
hundred-foot Elden robots and we have
you<00:03:55.379> know<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:57.109> canyon<00:03:58.109> where<00:03:58.290> there's

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
you know a canyon where there's

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.259 
you know a canyon where there's
tornadoes<00:03:59.099> that<00:03:59.129> go<00:03:59.519> from<00:03:59.729> one<00:03:59.970> end<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.180> the

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
tornadoes that go from one end to the

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.729 
tornadoes that go from one end to the
other<00:04:00.359> that<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.989> can<00:04:01.139> use<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.560> get<00:04:01.680> to

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
other that you can use to get to

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.740 
other that you can use to get to
different<00:04:02.159> places<00:04:02.310> there<00:04:02.639> so<00:04:02.849> lots<00:04:03.540> of

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
different places there so lots of

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.210 
different places there so lots of
different<00:04:04.079> variations<00:04:04.650> you<00:04:04.919> know<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.189> really

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
different variations you know we really

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.149 
different variations you know we really
think<00:04:05.729> that<00:04:06.530> rewarding<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.650> player<00:04:07.889> with

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
think that rewarding the player with

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.149 
think that rewarding the player with
different<00:04:08.549> visual<00:04:09.949> unique<00:04:10.949> visual

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
different visual unique visual

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.550 
different visual unique visual
experience<00:04:11.729> is<00:04:11.819> important<00:04:12.329> and<00:04:12.479> so<00:04:12.840> every<00:04:13.409> one

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
experience is important and so every one

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.080 
experience is important and so every one
of<00:04:13.680> our<00:04:13.859> subs<00:04:14.280> owns<00:04:14.489> is<00:04:14.669> going<00:04:14.879> to<00:04:14.970> be

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
of our subs owns is going to be

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.089 
of our subs owns is going to be
something<00:04:15.269> that<00:04:15.419> you<00:04:15.569> haven't<00:04:15.750> seen<00:04:16.019> before

something that you haven't seen before

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.490 
something that you haven't seen before

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
but it's really important for us when

super cool but be that they have a bunch

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.970 
super cool but be that they have a bunch
of<00:04:34.070> different<00:04:34.930> behaviors<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.230> attacks<00:04:36.620> right

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
of different behaviors and attacks right

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.030 
of different behaviors and attacks right
so<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.370> as<00:04:37.550> you've<00:04:38.150> gone<00:04:38.330> through<00:04:38.630> if<00:04:38.810> you're

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
so that as you've gone through if you're

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.590 
so that as you've gone through if you're
let's<00:04:40.040> say<00:04:40.160> you're<00:04:40.370> at<00:04:40.460> level<00:04:40.700> 6<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.180> you<00:04:41.240> you

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
let's say you're at level 6 and you you

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.900 
let's say you're at level 6 and you you
could<00:04:41.870> do<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.020> boss<00:04:42.230> at<00:04:42.410> level<00:04:42.650> 7<00:04:42.980> everything

could do a boss at level 7 everything
that<00:04:44.030> you've<00:04:44.120> learned<00:04:44.270> from<00:04:44.540> one<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:44.870> six<00:04:45.020> is

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
that you've learned from one to six is

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.900 
that you've learned from one to six is
going<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.680> be<00:04:45.830> necessary<00:04:46.460> in<00:04:46.580> order<00:04:46.670> to

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
going to be necessary in order to

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.850 
going to be necessary in order to
overcome<00:04:47.120> that<00:04:47.660> boss<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.260> each<00:04:48.440> one<00:04:48.710> will

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.150 
I think the only question that people
have<00:06:15.080> left<00:06:15.290> is<00:06:15.440> probably<00:06:15.740> when<00:06:15.950> is<00:06:16.040> this

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
have left is probably when is this

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.480 
have left is probably when is this
