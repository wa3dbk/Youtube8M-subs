can<00:02:10.819> either<00:02:11.140> just<00:02:12.430> pry<00:02:13.430> apart<00:02:13.550> or<00:02:14.000> pry<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.450> from

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
can either just pry apart or pry it from

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.130 
can either just pry apart or pry it from
the<00:02:14.750> frame<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.260> then<00:02:16.190> remove<00:02:16.520> these<00:02:16.730> two<00:02:17.140> 13

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the frame and then remove these two 13

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:28.940 
the frame and then remove these two 13
millimeter<00:02:18.650> bolts

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.860 

you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.650 

now<00:02:34.870> unhook<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:36.100> compressor<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.300> pull<00:02:37.540> it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
now unhook the compressor and pull it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:52.160 
now unhook the compressor and pull it
down

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.009 

once<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.260> get<00:02:53.379> it<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.620> certain<00:02:53.830> point

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
once you get it to a certain point

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.790 

I<00:02:56.049> just<00:02:56.290> want<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.560> angle<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.040> downwards

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.950 

pull<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.520> around<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.970> wheel<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:01.570> if<00:03:01.720> you<00:03:01.810> can

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
pull out around the wheel and if you can

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.390 
pull out around the wheel and if you can
remove<00:03:02.200> your<00:03:02.350> spare<00:03:02.560> tire<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:03.040> will<00:03:03.190> help

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
remove your spare tire that will help

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.850 
remove your spare tire that will help
but<00:03:03.940> because<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.930> condition<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.410> ours<00:03:05.590> we

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
but because of the condition of ours we

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.400 
but because of the condition of ours we
can't<00:03:06.100> really<00:03:06.280> do<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:06.940> then<00:03:07.870> using<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.230> 10

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
can't really do that and then using a 10

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.440 
can't really do that and then using a 10
millimeter<00:03:08.710> wrench<00:03:08.890> just<00:03:09.490> loosen<00:03:09.910> up<00:03:10.000> these

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
millimeter wrench just loosen up these

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.600 
millimeter wrench just loosen up these
two<00:03:10.750> hoses<00:03:13.320> and<00:03:14.320> you're<00:03:15.280> really<00:03:15.520> only

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
two hoses and you're really only

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.760 
two hoses and you're really only
loosening<00:03:16.270> them<00:03:16.450> so<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.140> can<00:03:17.290> let<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.620> air

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
loosening them so you can let the air

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.560 
loosening them so you can let the air
out<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.460> let<00:03:21.670> all<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.850> air<00:03:22.090> flow<00:03:22.360> out<00:03:22.540> of

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
out and just let all the air flow out of

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.760 
out and just let all the air flow out of
each<00:03:22.900> side<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:24.840> then<00:03:25.840> remove<00:03:26.140> those<00:03:26.320> hoses

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
each side and then remove those hoses

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.330 
each side and then remove those hoses
the<00:03:26.920> rest<00:03:27.100> of<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.340> way

left is the old air compressor on the
right<00:04:09.150> is<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.390> new<00:04:09.420> one<00:04:09.599> from<00:04:09.629> 1a<00:04:09.930> auto<00:04:10.140> you

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
right is the new one from 1a auto you

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.930 
right is the new one from 1a auto you
can<00:04:10.680> see<00:04:10.829> they're<00:04:11.010> identical<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.730> they'll

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
can see they're identical and they'll

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.039 
can see they're identical and they'll
fit<00:04:12.090> exactly<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.690> same<00:04:14.360> loosen<00:04:15.360> up<00:04:15.510> these

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
fit exactly the same loosen up these

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:25.480 
fit exactly the same loosen up these

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:35.740 

now<00:04:26.000> reconnect<00:04:26.419> the<00:04:26.600> harness

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.660 

and<00:04:35.840> one<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:36.680> these<00:04:36.830> has<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.100> white<00:04:37.400> ring<00:04:37.640> around

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
one with the black ring and you force

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.670 
one with the black ring and you force
those<00:04:46.640> hoses<00:04:47.120> as<00:04:47.270> far<00:04:47.660> in<00:04:47.840> as<00:04:47.930> you<00:04:48.080> can<00:04:48.290> into

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
those hoses as far in as you can into

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.100 
those hoses as far in as you can into
the<00:04:49.010> fittings<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:49.640> then<00:04:50.420> you<00:04:50.570> tighten<00:04:50.840> up<00:04:50.990> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
the fittings and then you tighten up the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.050 
the fittings and then you tighten up the
fittings<00:04:51.410> you<00:04:52.280> want<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.550> just<00:04:52.700> tighten<00:04:52.880> them

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
fittings you want to just tighten them

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.580 
fittings you want to just tighten them
up<00:04:53.150> until<00:04:53.360> they<00:04:53.600> give<00:04:53.750> some<00:04:53.900> resistance<00:04:54.410> it's

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
up until they give some resistance it's

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.660 
up until they give some resistance it's
only<00:04:54.740> supposed<00:04:54.980> to<00:04:55.070> be<00:04:55.220> one<00:04:55.250> or<00:04:55.640> two

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
only supposed to be one or two

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.650 
only supposed to be one or two
foot-pounds<00:04:56.600> that<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:56.780> tighten<00:04:56.990> those<00:04:57.200> two

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
foot-pounds that you tighten those two

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.970 
foot-pounds that you tighten those two
so<00:04:59.660> you<00:04:59.750> can<00:04:59.810> see<00:04:59.990> the<00:05:00.080> black<00:05:00.200> when<00:05:00.440> I<00:05:00.470> force<00:05:00.800> it

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
so you can see the black when I force it

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.160 
so you can see the black when I force it
in<00:05:01.070> as<00:05:01.190> far<00:05:01.370> as<00:05:01.430> I<00:05:01.550> can<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:02.000> then<00:05:02.780> tighten<00:05:03.140> up

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
in as far as I can and then tighten up

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.440 
in as far as I can and then tighten up
the<00:05:03.290> fitting<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.800> repeat<00:05:04.520> the<00:05:04.670> same<00:05:04.910> for<00:05:05.300> the

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
the fitting and repeat the same for the

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:15.710 
the fitting and repeat the same for the
white<00:05:05.630> one<00:05:05.810> which<00:05:05.960> is<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.230> other<00:05:06.380> side

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.350 

you
