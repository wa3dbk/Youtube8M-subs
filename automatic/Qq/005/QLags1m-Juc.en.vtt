 welcome to a new demovic tutorial to the point net 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.920
 today as you see on the screen 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.319
 we have the new 

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:12.669
 Nokia 6 5 and the 0 3 currently locked comfortable font 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.509
 that we are going to release by code 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.640
 thanks to the good toner location 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.960
 we simply defend a terminal 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.059
 and so far as you see percent we are the initial screen 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.380
 We can not understand if a card 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.550
 then proceed to mark the purchase code of the web that is done without any 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.220
 another post 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.860
 moncho phone does not leave the dial and we mark the code pad 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.020
 w 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.570
 plus 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.970
 some marked this 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.380
 while juan carlos 15 digits of the release code 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.380
 purchase of our website that is 31 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 0 1 7 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.980
 6 8 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.520
 5 6 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.890
 7 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.870
 7 4 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.550
 7 8 say that you are unique and exclusive codes for each model 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.820
 that is, this code does not work for other terminals so do not try 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.700
 release it 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.250
 because they only have three attempts and each exclusive public codes 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.650
 when we mark all the code we think it well and before mark kelly 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.250
 before marking the last pad because we only have three opportunities 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.170
 tusk what once reviewed well we mark the last move 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.260
 and as is the terminal indicates sim card restriction disabled 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.370
 and it will restart 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.460
 a reboot and the terminal will be operative for ford with any 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.230
 card of any operator 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.860
 say that it is very important that all current terminals clients of 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.910
 data then once released what we have to do is for a hundred 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.790
 simply 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.200
 configure with our new operator the settings for internet 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.660
 for this we must call the new operator and provide us with how to do
