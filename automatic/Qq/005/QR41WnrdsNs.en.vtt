seems like an odd policy to me that
mm-hmm<00:02:45.070> it's<00:02:45.520> a<00:02:45.640> rule<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.390> pretty

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
mm-hmm it's a rule that is pretty

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.570 
mm-hmm it's a rule that is pretty
universal<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.380> examination<00:02:47.980> rooms<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.430> don't

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
universal in examination rooms you don't

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.860 
universal in examination rooms you don't
use<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.880> phone<00:02:49.030> yeah<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:49.390> understand<00:02:49.780> it's

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
use the phone yeah I understand it's

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
use the phone yeah I understand it's
just<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.230> rule<00:02:50.380> doesn't<00:02:50.650> make<00:02:50.770> any

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
just that the rule doesn't make any

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.229 
just that the rule doesn't make any
sense<00:02:51.100> that's<00:02:51.370> all<00:02:51.520> really<00:02:51.670> makes<00:02:51.910> sense<00:02:52.030> to

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
sense that's all really makes sense to

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.870 
sense that's all really makes sense to
us<00:02:52.650> okay<00:02:53.650> fine<00:02:53.980> yeah<00:02:54.190> we<00:02:54.489> don't<00:02:54.640> have<00:02:54.760> many

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
rules here that's one of them seems a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.750 
rules here that's one of them seems a
little<00:02:56.590> odd<00:02:56.830> though<00:02:57.100> that<00:02:57.370> if<00:02:57.489> you're<00:02:57.610> making

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
little odd though that if you're making

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.820 
little odd though that if you're making
a<00:02:57.970> local<00:02:58.150> call<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.900> anybody<00:02:59.320> would<00:02:59.530> care<00:02:59.800> but
