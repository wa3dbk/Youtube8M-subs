on<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.040> self<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.370> said<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> lot<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.880> times<00:00:51.090> for

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
on you be self I said a lot of times for

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.940 
on you be self I said a lot of times for
me<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.810> the<00:00:51.840> game<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> year<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
me this is the game of the year but I

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.020 
me this is the game of the year but I
think<00:00:53.040> there's<00:00:53.310> a<00:00:53.370> lot<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.520> things<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:53.850> could

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
think there's a lot of things they could

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
think there's a lot of things they could
do<00:00:54.150> to<00:00:54.300> make<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.660> lot<00:00:54.870> better<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.650> make

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
do to make it a lot better and make

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.710 
do to make it a lot better and make
people<00:00:56.010> play<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> for<00:00:56.700> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:56.880> longer<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
people play it for a lot longer so the

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.210 
people play it for a lot longer so the
first<00:00:57.870> thing<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.739> good<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.160> it's

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
first thing is that it's good but it's

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.310 
first thing is that it's good but it's
not<00:00:59.340> amazing<00:00:59.790> we've<00:01:00.360> had<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.540> lot<00:01:00.720> of<00:01:00.780> good<00:01:01.020> ship

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
not amazing we've had a lot of good ship

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.110 
not amazing we've had a lot of good ship
customization<00:01:02.220> stuff<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.730> nothing<00:01:02.850> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
customization stuff but nothing to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.340 
customization stuff but nothing to
really<00:01:03.270> change<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.780> game<00:01:04.110> that

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
really change your game that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990 
really change your game that
dramatically<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:05.700> could<00:01:05.850> add<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
dramatically so I think they could add a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.910 
dramatically so I think they could add a
lot<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> new<00:01:06.450> things<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.990> upgraded<00:01:07.500> cannons

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
lot of new things like upgraded cannons

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
lot of new things like upgraded cannons
and<00:01:08.130> things<00:01:08.340> like<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.970> something<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and things like that just something to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.270 
and things like that just something to
strive<00:01:09.810> for<00:01:09.930> when<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.560> grinding<00:01:10.829> so

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
strive for when you're grinding so

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.649 
strive for when you're grinding so
there's<00:01:11.430> something<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.180> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
there's something to do and to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.910 
there's something to do and to
facilitate<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.649> they<00:01:13.740> need<00:01:13.889> to

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
facilitate that I think they need to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410 
facilitate that I think they need to
have<00:01:14.069> a<00:01:14.100> lot<00:01:14.369> better<00:01:14.549> ships<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.149> actually

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
have a lot better ships to actually

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.059 
have a lot better ships to actually
fight<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.289> fully<00:01:16.409> upgraded

00:01:17.059 --> 00:01:17.069 
fight because when you're fully upgraded

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:19.399 
fight because when you're fully upgraded
you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.670> take<00:01:17.850> out<00:01:18.060> about<00:01:18.179> three<00:01:18.600> man-of-wars

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you can take out about three man-of-wars

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
you can take out about three man-of-wars
really<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.280> easily<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.670> there's<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:21.060> no

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
really really easily and there's just no

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.639 
really really easily and there's just no
challenger<00:01:21.810> tool<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> think<00:01:22.319> they<00:01:22.499> should

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
challenger tool so I think they should

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:23.840 
challenger tool so I think they should
definitely<00:01:22.979> keep<00:01:23.100> trying<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.490> add<00:01:23.579> things

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
definitely keep trying to add things

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.429 
definitely keep trying to add things
into<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> game<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:24.749> that<00:01:24.899> is<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> good<00:01:25.229> segue

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
into the game and that is a good segue

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.889 
into the game and that is a good segue
into<00:01:25.889> my<00:01:26.159> next<00:01:26.369> point<00:01:26.609> i<00:01:26.850> don't<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.450> dlc

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
into my next point i don't think the dlc

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.719 
into my next point i don't think the dlc
is<00:01:28.049> ambitious<00:01:28.590> enough<00:01:28.799> for<00:01:28.859> assassin's<00:01:29.459> creed

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
is ambitious enough for assassin's creed

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.160 
is ambitious enough for assassin's creed
i<00:01:29.759> think<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.179> you<00:01:30.209> look<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.569> price<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
i think if you look at the price of the

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.069 
i think if you look at the price of the
season<00:01:31.530> pass<00:01:31.679> which<00:01:32.459> is<00:01:32.609> about<00:01:32.789> 16<00:01:33.209> 17<00:01:33.479> pounds

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
season pass which is about 16 17 pounds

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.840 
season pass which is about 16 17 pounds
and<00:01:34.229> then<00:01:34.319> for<00:01:34.530> cod<00:01:34.709> is<00:01:34.950> about<00:01:35.130> twice<00:01:35.399> as<00:01:35.670> much

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and then for cod is about twice as much

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
and then for cod is about twice as much
you<00:01:36.149> can<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.689> had<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> lot<00:01:37.109> more<00:01:37.289> into

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you can see they had a lot more into

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.719 
you can see they had a lot more into
things<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.859> Call<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> Duty<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.670> Battlefield

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
things like Call of Duty and Battlefield

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
things like Call of Duty and Battlefield
after<00:01:39.569> release<00:01:39.840> whereas<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.289> Assassin's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
after release whereas for Assassin's

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410 
after release whereas for Assassin's
Creed<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.100> seems<00:01:41.279> like<00:01:41.459> all<00:01:41.639> of<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.819> dlc<00:01:42.299> was

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
Creed it seems like all of this dlc was

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.419 
Creed it seems like all of this dlc was
made<00:01:42.659> before<00:01:42.899> release<00:01:43.469> and<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.369> of

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
made before release and that kind of

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:45.590 
made before release and that kind of
sucks<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.209> I<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.479> they've

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
sucks just because I think they've

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.629 
sucks just because I think they've
misjudged<00:01:46.139> how<00:01:46.409> good<00:01:46.679> this<00:01:46.829> game<00:01:47.069> is<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.549> how

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:47.639 
misjudged how good this game is and how

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:49.160 
misjudged how good this game is and how
much<00:01:47.880> people<00:01:48.090> would<00:01:48.299> want<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.539> play<00:01:48.749> it<00:01:48.929> and<00:01:49.049> I

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
much people would want to play it and I

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.510 
much people would want to play it and I
think<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.499> an<00:01:49.590> opportunity<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.189> them<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
think it's an opportunity for them to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
think it's an opportunity for them to
make<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> lot<00:01:51.029> more<00:01:51.090> DLC<00:01:51.749> them<00:01:51.899> they<00:01:52.020> currently

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
make a lot more DLC them they currently

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.199 
make a lot more DLC them they currently
have<00:01:52.619> sasson<00:01:53.279> screwed<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.670> always<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:54.209 
have sasson screwed is always one of the

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:55.910 
have sasson screwed is always one of the
biggest<00:01:54.450> games<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.229> year<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:55.859> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
biggest games of the year and I think a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.280 
biggest games of the year and I think a
lot<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.189> people<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.759> willing<00:01:57.060> to

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
lot of people be willing to

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.750 
lot of people be willing to
pay<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:57.440> new<00:01:57.770> stuff<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.370> works<00:01:58.580> for

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
pay for new stuff and that works for

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.880 
pay for new stuff and that works for
