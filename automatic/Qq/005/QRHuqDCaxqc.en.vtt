in a treehouse I quickly whipped up it's
not<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.370> best<00:00:05.460> an<00:00:05.730> interior<00:00:06.150> design<00:00:06.480> but

there you get my point is to show you my

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.919 
there you get my point is to show you my
new<00:00:11.010> railway<00:00:11.460> track<00:00:11.880> which<00:00:12.330> I've<00:00:12.570> created<00:00:12.870> him

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
new railway track which I've created him

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.060 
new railway track which I've created him
there<00:00:15.929> are<00:00:16.080> some<00:00:16.199> interesting<00:00:16.350> things<00:00:16.800> which

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
there are some interesting things which

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.779 
there are some interesting things which
we<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.340> probably<00:00:17.520> notice<00:00:17.850> about<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:19.070> so<00:00:20.070> yep

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
we can probably notice about it so yep

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.320 
we can probably notice about it so yep
just<00:00:21.240> demonstrate<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.109> works<00:00:22.289> first

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
just demonstrate that it works first

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.759 
just demonstrate that it works first

there's only works for occupied carts as
you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> see<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.110> cart<00:00:34.739> fell<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.309> soon<00:00:35.820> as<00:00:35.940> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you can see the cart fell down soon as I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.850 
you can see the cart fell down soon as I
got<00:00:36.149> out<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:37.760> but<00:00:38.760> yep<00:00:39.000> these<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.860> railroad

any boots two rails are for let's link
the<00:00:54.930> track<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.320> can<00:00:55.530> keep<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.520> far<00:00:56.789> as

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
the track you can keep going as far as

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
the track you can keep going as far as
you<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.120> doing<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.730> because<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.840> mine

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you like doing this because the mine

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.979 
you like doing this because the mine
cart<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.280> always<00:01:02.520> falling<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
cart is always falling it kind of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
cart is always falling it kind of
glitches<00:01:04.439> from<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> bottom<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.820> top

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
glitches from the bottom one was on top

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
glitches from the bottom one was on top
of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> other<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.450> keeps<00:01:06.780> falling<00:01:07.260> down<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of the other and keeps falling down and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.230 
of the other and keeps falling down and
down<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.860> down<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> yep<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.909> mean

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
down and down so yep the mean

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.030 
down and down so yep the mean
interesting<00:01:12.780> points<00:01:13.290> here<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.470> guess<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.010> that

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
interesting points here I guess is that

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.719 
interesting points here I guess is that
I've<00:01:14.610> managed<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.540> floating<00:01:15.930> rails

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
I've managed to get the floating rails

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.300 
I've managed to get the floating rails
I'll<00:01:17.729> show<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> consistent<00:01:19.250> way<00:01:20.250> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I'll show you this consistent way of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.660 
I'll show you this consistent way of
doing<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.740> can't<00:01:22.770> actually<00:01:23.250> make

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
doing that you can't actually make

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.969 
doing that you can't actually make
joined-up<00:01:24.330> rail<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.020> why<00:01:25.229> I've<00:01:25.590> got

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
joined-up rail which is why I've got

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.420 
joined-up rail which is why I've got
this<00:01:26.220> bumpy<00:01:26.670> setup<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.470> works<00:01:28.770> fine<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
this bumpy setup but this works fine and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090 
this bumpy setup but this works fine and
yeah<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:31.049> good<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.829> don't<00:01:32.009> need

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
yeah it is good because you don't need

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.609 
yeah it is good because you don't need
booster<00:01:32.460> rails<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:36.079> only<00:01:37.079> thing<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:37.439> notes

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
booster rails the only thing two notes

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.560 
booster rails the only thing two notes
as<00:01:37.770> well<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.220> as<00:01:39.030> soon<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.360> there's<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
as well is that as soon as there's a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.920 
as well is that as soon as there's a
block<00:01:39.810> update<00:01:40.340> next<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> any<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.930> rails

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
block update next to any of these rails

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.340 
block update next to any of these rails
they'll<00:01:43.350> pop<00:01:43.829> off<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.060> we've<00:01:46.049> got<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> be

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
they'll pop off and so we've got to be

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.420 
they'll pop off and so we've got to be
careful<00:01:46.500> around<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:48.290> but<00:01:49.290> yep<00:01:49.500> there

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
careful around these but yep there

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.179 
careful around these but yep there
hopefully<00:01:51.270> useful<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:52.020> lets<00:01:52.829> them<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.009> nice

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
hopefully useful that lets them a nice

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.760 
hopefully useful that lets them a nice
or<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.850> then<00:01:54.090> having<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.630> large<00:01:55.259> drink<00:01:55.619> of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
or I think then having a large drink of

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.030 
or I think then having a large drink of
blocks<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:57.360> entirely<00:01:57.810> up<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
blocks but that's entirely up to the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.609 
blocks but that's entirely up to the
viewer<00:01:59.850> Olivia<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:00.990> that's<00:02:01.200> drawn<00:02:01.439> up

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
viewer Olivia you think that's drawn up

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.060 
viewer Olivia you think that's drawn up
and<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.329> looks<00:02:03.360> pretty<00:02:03.509> cool<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.860> yes

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and I think it looks pretty cool but yes

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.249 
and I think it looks pretty cool but yes
ok<00:02:05.670> i'll<00:02:06.030> show<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.509> how<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.869> create<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.409> now<00:02:09.259> ok

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
ok i'll show you how to create it now ok

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
ok i'll show you how to create it now ok
so<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.039> basic<00:02:11.400> principle<00:02:11.819> behind<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.180> is

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
so the basic principle behind this is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.440 
so the basic principle behind this is
that

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
that

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.140 
that
to<00:02:13.690> get<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.080> rail<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.830> flute<00:02:15.069> over<00:02:15.340> here<00:02:15.520> it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
to get this rail to flute over here it

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.600 
to get this rail to flute over here it
needs<00:02:16.450> to<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:16.599> pushed<00:02:16.840> using<00:02:17.709> just<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.370> half

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
needs to be pushed using just a half

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.960 
needs to be pushed using just a half
tech<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.209> redstone<00:02:21.150> particles<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:24.519> this<00:02:24.730> is

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
tech of redstone particles so this is

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.949 
tech of redstone particles so this is
the<00:02:25.239> half<00:02:25.510> tick<00:02:25.840> written<00:02:26.590> pulse<00:02:26.800> generator<00:02:27.959> we

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
the half tick written pulse generator we

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.110 
the half tick written pulse generator we
just<00:02:29.620> need<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.860> place<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.250> block<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.760> face

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
just need to place the block on the face

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.979 
just need to place the block on the face
of<00:02:31.150> this<00:02:31.360> piston<00:02:31.980> when<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.010> do<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.030> wire

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
of this piston when I do that the wire

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.650 
of this piston when I do that the wire
will<00:02:35.019> be<00:02:35.500> cut<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.190> which<00:02:36.970> means<00:02:37.239> that<00:02:37.510> this

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
will be cut here which means that this

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.570 
will be cut here which means that this
wire<00:02:37.959> will<00:02:37.989> face<00:02:38.380> into<00:02:38.680> this<00:02:38.769> block<00:02:39.040> her<00:02:39.459> on

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
wire will face into this block her on

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.449 
wire will face into this block her on
the<00:02:39.730> piston<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.709> so<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.769> basement<00:02:42.220> will

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
the piston and so the basement will

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.570 
the piston and so the basement will
extend<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.440> piston<00:02:44.739> on<00:02:44.860> doesn't<00:02:45.430> cut

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
extend but the piston on doesn't cut

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.390 
extend but the piston on doesn't cut
this<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.420> it<00:02:47.290> immediately<00:02:47.709> unpause<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
this one so it immediately unpause the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.960 
this one so it immediately unpause the
piston<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.180> piston<00:02:49.690> will<00:02:49.900> retract<00:02:50.200> again

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
piston and the piston will retract again

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.559 
piston and the piston will retract again
so<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.480> block<00:02:52.720> will<00:02:53.530> be<00:02:53.739> over<00:02:54.130> this<00:02:54.280> torch<00:02:55.269> for

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
so the block will be over this torch for

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.729 
so the block will be over this torch for
any<00:02:55.720> heart<00:02:56.019> fatigue<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.790> any<00:02:57.790> powering<00:02:58.329> this

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
any heart fatigue and any powering this

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.500 
any heart fatigue and any powering this
red<00:02:59.739> soon<00:03:00.010> for<00:03:00.340> half<00:03:00.519> tick<00:03:02.670> yep<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:04.120> I'll<00:03:04.450> just

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
red soon for half tick yep so I'll just

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.690 
red soon for half tick yep so I'll just
please<00:03:05.349> work<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.769> here<00:03:06.239> so<00:03:07.239> yeah<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:09.160> there<00:03:09.549> are

please work on here so yeah so there are
hot<00:03:10.209> chick<00:03:10.660> going<00:03:10.959> on<00:03:11.049> here<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.739> it's<00:03:12.250> ending

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
hot chick going on here and it's ending

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.819 
hot chick going on here and it's ending
this<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:13.599> can<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.200> business<00:03:14.470> is

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
this you can see the business is

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.069 
this you can see the business is
expanding<00:03:14.920> even<00:03:15.700> though<00:03:15.880> it's<00:03:16.660> not<00:03:16.900> lighting

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
expanding even though it's not lighting

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:20.080 
expanding even though it's not lighting
up<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.380> red<00:03:17.500> soon

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.550 

so<00:03:20.840> if<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.050> place<00:03:21.319> my<00:03:21.890> rail<00:03:22.129> here<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:23.379> then<00:03:24.379> I've

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
so if I place my rail here and then I've

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.440 
so if I place my rail here and then I've
got<00:03:24.590> splits<00:03:25.129> and<00:03:25.370> destroy<00:03:25.940> your<00:03:26.090> restaurant

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
got splits and destroy your restaurant

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.009 
got splits and destroy your restaurant
equipment<00:03:27.400> because<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.970> fits<00:03:29.300> business<00:03:29.690> signs

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
equipment because it fits business signs

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.440 
equipment because it fits business signs
again<00:03:30.319> it'll<00:03:30.860> update<00:03:31.010> that's<00:03:31.459> block<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.239> to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
again it'll update that's block and to

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.080 
again it'll update that's block and to
pop<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.900> rail<00:03:33.110> off<00:03:33.430> so<00:03:34.430> yeah<00:03:34.580> that's<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
pop the rail off so yeah that's the

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.240 
pop the rail off so yeah that's the
basic<00:03:35.360> principle<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:36.110> can<00:03:36.470> get<00:03:36.950> flirty

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
basic principle you can get flirty

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.460 
basic principle you can get flirty
morels<00:03:37.610> by<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.239> pushing<00:03:38.540> them<00:03:38.810> with<00:03:39.200> fire

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
morels by just pushing them with fire

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.650 
morels by just pushing them with fire
protect<00:03:39.860> pots<00:03:41.560> so<00:03:42.560> yeah<00:03:43.150> when<00:03:44.150> we're<00:03:44.360> trying

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
protect pots so yeah when we're trying

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.729 
protect pots so yeah when we're trying
to<00:03:44.840> make<00:03:44.989> my<00:03:45.230> track<00:03:45.590> theme<00:03:45.940> we<00:03:46.940> need<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.739> move

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
to make my track theme we need to move

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.220 
to make my track theme we need to move
this<00:03:49.010> onto<00:03:49.640> a<00:03:49.670> lot<00:03:50.390> of<00:03:50.599> tracks<00:03:50.900> at<00:03:51.080> the<00:03:51.140> same

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
this onto a lot of tracks at the same

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.199 
this onto a lot of tracks at the same
time<00:03:51.410> well<00:03:52.190> they<00:03:52.489> don't<00:03:52.610> need<00:03:52.790> to<00:03:52.880> be<00:03:52.940> done<00:03:53.060> at

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
time well they don't need to be done at

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.460 
time well they don't need to be done at
the<00:03:53.269> same<00:03:53.360> time<00:03:53.540> it's<00:03:53.780> just<00:03:53.989> more<00:03:54.140> convenient

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
the same time it's just more convenient

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.860 
the same time it's just more convenient
to<00:03:54.680> do<00:03:54.769> at<00:03:54.860> the<00:03:54.980> same<00:03:55.130> time<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:56.299> we<00:03:56.420> have<00:03:56.569> the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
to do at the same time so we have the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.770 
to do at the same time so we have the
same<00:03:57.110> pretty<00:03:57.829> soon<00:03:58.780> tick-tock-tick

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
same pretty soon tick-tock-tick

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.009 
same pretty soon tick-tock-tick
generator<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:03.400> i'll<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.640> put<00:04:05.030> rail<00:04:05.420> on<00:04:05.780> all

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
generator and i'll just put rail on all

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:13.390 
generator and i'll just put rail on all
of<00:04:06.140> these<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:09.640> yes<00:04:10.640> if<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.569> then<00:04:12.200> get<00:04:13.099> set

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
of these and yes if you then get set

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.259 
of these and yes if you then get set
that's<00:04:13.579> going<00:04:18.010> we<00:04:19.010> need<00:04:19.039> to<00:04:19.430> place<00:04:19.940> and

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
that's going we need to place and

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.760 
that's going we need to place and
destroy<00:04:20.750> or<00:04:21.079> it's<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.470> here<00:04:21.680> very<00:04:22.160> quickly

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.670 

right<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:26.310> all<00:04:26.789> of<00:04:26.849> these<00:04:27.289> piece<00:04:28.289> of<00:04:28.470> rail

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
right and all of these piece of rail

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.659 
right and all of these piece of rail
have<00:04:29.039> nap<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.550> me<00:04:30.210> to<00:04:30.270> flip<00:04:31.189> as<00:04:32.189> we<00:04:32.460> want<00:04:34.669> you

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
have nap in me to flip as we want you

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:41.679 
have nap in me to flip as we want you
note<00:04:35.879> that<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:38.569> angle<00:04:39.569> of<00:04:39.719> the<00:04:39.780> track<00:04:40.259> is

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
note that the angle of the track is

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.089 
note that the angle of the track is
preferential<00:04:42.689> towards<00:04:43.139> this<00:04:43.949> direction<00:04:44.689> this

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
preferential towards this direction this

preferential towards this direction this
depends<00:04:47.099> on<00:04:47.189> if<00:04:47.310> you're<00:04:47.430> doing<00:04:47.610> it<00:04:47.699> not<00:04:47.879> south

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
depends on if you're doing it not south

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.439

or<00:04:48.539> east<00:04:48.659> west<00:04:49.669> there's<00:04:50.669> going<00:04:51.000> to<00:04:51.060> be<00:04:51.120> one

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
or east west there's going to be one

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:52.700 
or east west there's going to be one
direction<00:04:51.840> which<00:04:51.960> is<00:04:52.050> preferred<00:04:52.439> over<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.260 
other fortunately though it's fairly
easy<00:04:58.379> to<00:04:59.780> update<00:05:00.780> this<00:05:01.169> you<00:05:01.409> just<00:05:01.590> um<00:05:02.240> at<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
easy to update this you just um at the

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.920 
easy to update this you just um at the
end<00:05:03.419> of<00:05:03.659> this<00:05:03.870> if<00:05:04.139> you're<00:05:04.469> wanting<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.919> make<00:05:05.069> a

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
end of this if you're wanting to make a

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.730 
end of this if you're wanting to make a
track<00:05:06.930> which<00:05:07.289> goes<00:05:07.830> in<00:05:08.840> this<00:05:09.840> direction<00:05:09.900> so

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
track which goes in this direction so

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.439 
track which goes in this direction so
you're<00:05:11.159> falling<00:05:11.520> down<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:12.000> down<00:05:12.150> and<00:05:12.210> down

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
you're falling down and down and down

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.399 
you're falling down and down and down
going<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:13.169> way<00:05:13.379> then<00:05:14.190> that's<00:05:14.550> fine<00:05:14.699> you<00:05:15.150> just

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
going this way then that's fine you just

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.519 
going this way then that's fine you just
leave<00:05:16.409> to<00:05:16.620> sit<00:05:16.860> as<00:05:17.219> it<00:05:17.370> is<00:05:17.520> and<00:05:17.960> or<00:05:18.960> while<00:05:19.409> you

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
leave to sit as it is and or while you

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.409 
leave to sit as it is and or while you
remove<00:05:19.770> these<00:05:20.039> top<00:05:20.400> ones<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.879> then<00:05:21.029> that

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
remove these top ones and then that

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.499 
remove these top ones and then that
that's<00:05:21.810> done<00:05:21.900> if<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:23.550> want<00:05:23.729> to<00:05:23.879> update<00:05:25.219> the

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
that's done if you want to update the

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.899 
that's done if you want to update the
things<00:05:27.509> to<00:05:27.719> fix<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:28.020> the<00:05:28.080> opposite<00:05:28.379> direction

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
things to fix in the opposite direction

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:35.019 
things to fix in the opposite direction
it's<00:05:29.909> a<00:05:30.270> simple<00:05:30.599> case<00:05:30.960> of<00:05:32.000> just<00:05:33.000> doing<00:05:33.270> another

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:35.029 
it's a simple case of just doing another

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.190 
it's a simple case of just doing another
tick<00:05:36.110> up

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
tick up

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.610 
tick up
placing<00:05:39.010> another<00:05:39.100> rail<00:05:40.230> in<00:05:41.230> each<00:05:41.380> one<00:05:41.590> of

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
placing another rail in each one of

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.170 
placing another rail in each one of
these<00:05:42.030> because<00:05:43.770> actually<00:05:44.940> then<00:05:45.940> change

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
these because actually then change

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.620 
these because actually then change
direction<00:05:46.420> doesn't<00:05:46.990> cause<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:47.350> backup<00:05:47.770> date

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
direction doesn't cause a backup date

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:56.999 
direction doesn't cause a backup date
it's<00:05:49.630> probably<00:05:49.930> easier<00:05:50.260> sharing<00:05:50.770> things

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:57.009 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:05:59.850 

so<00:05:57.639> yeah<00:05:57.789> that's<00:05:58.119> updated<00:05:58.419> this<00:05:58.960> one<00:05:59.229> to<00:05:59.589> fit

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
so yeah that's updated this one to fit

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.339 
so yeah that's updated this one to fit
into<00:06:00.099> the<00:06:00.219> opposite<00:06:00.490> direction<00:06:00.580> and<00:06:01.180> it<00:06:02.139> just

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
into the opposite direction and it just

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:06.269 
into the opposite direction and it just
need<00:06:02.559> to<00:06:02.710> go<00:06:03.039> along<00:06:03.159> my<00:06:03.460> car<00:06:04.860> making<00:06:05.860> sure<00:06:06.189> you

00:06:06.269 --> 00:06:06.279 
need to go along my car making sure you

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.089 
need to go along my car making sure you
don't<00:06:06.460> actually<00:06:07.270> do<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.080> block<00:06:08.379> update<00:06:08.740> on<00:06:08.949> any

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
don't actually do a block update on any

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:20.170 
don't actually do a block update on any
of<00:06:09.219> the<00:06:09.460> existing<00:06:10.029> track

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.240 

so<00:06:21.180> yeah<00:06:21.300> that<00:06:22.289> creates<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.740> track<00:06:22.979> which<00:06:23.130> we

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
so yeah that creates the track which we

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.909 
so yeah that creates the track which we
gave<00:06:23.430> that<00:06:23.460> mean<00:06:23.990> the<00:06:24.990> other<00:06:25.229> thing<00:06:25.530> to<00:06:25.770> note

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
gave that mean the other thing to note

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.340 
gave that mean the other thing to note
is<00:06:26.130> that<00:06:26.250> you<00:06:27.180> can<00:06:27.389> only<00:06:27.509> create<00:06:27.870> this<00:06:28.050> half

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
is that you can only create this half

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.400 
is that you can only create this half
tech<00:06:28.710> generator<00:06:29.220> when<00:06:29.610> your<00:06:29.820> feet<00:06:30.720> when<00:06:31.229> the

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.410 
tech generator when your feet when the

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.900 
tech generator when your feet when the
piston<00:06:31.800> is<00:06:31.949> facing<00:06:32.400> in<00:06:32.610> the<00:06:33.919> X<00:06:34.919> direction

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
piston is facing in the X direction

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.659 
piston is facing in the X direction
which<00:06:36.030> is<00:06:36.240> positive<00:06:36.840> negative<00:06:37.520> so<00:06:38.520> I<00:06:38.550> think

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
which is positive negative so I think

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:44.840 
which is positive negative so I think
that's<00:06:38.910> not<00:06:39.419> south<00:06:39.660> am<00:06:40.169> I<00:06:40.350> wrong<00:06:41.840> if<00:06:42.840> you<00:06:43.850> try

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850 
that's not south am I wrong if you try

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.120 
that's not south am I wrong if you try
and<00:06:44.970> set<00:06:45.270> up<00:06:45.419> this<00:06:45.630> generator<00:06:46.380> facing<00:06:47.070> the

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
and set up this generator facing the

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.969 
and set up this generator facing the
other<00:06:47.190> way<00:06:47.870> he'll<00:06:48.870> just<00:06:49.110> create<00:06:49.440> a<00:06:49.500> glitch<00:06:49.770> art

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
other way he'll just create a glitch art

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:57.830 
other way he'll just create a glitch art
piston<00:06:54.139> yeah<00:06:55.139> I'll<00:06:55.919> just<00:06:56.280> need<00:06:56.970> to<00:06:57.180> power<00:06:57.599> and

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
piston yeah I'll just need to power and

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:03.529 
piston yeah I'll just need to power and
I'm<00:06:58.050> partha<00:06:59.599> lips<00:07:00.599> turn<00:07:01.340> see<00:07:02.340> ya<00:07:02.460> it<00:07:02.849> that

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
I'm partha lips turn see ya it that

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.050 
I'm partha lips turn see ya it that
doesn't<00:07:03.870> work<00:07:04.020> at<00:07:04.410> Tony<00:07:04.650> works<00:07:04.860> facing<00:07:05.699> in<00:07:05.820> the

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 
doesn't work at Tony works facing in the

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.300 
doesn't work at Tony works facing in the
positive<00:07:06.900> negative<00:07:07.650> x<00:07:08.130> direction<00:07:08.840> um<00:07:10.310> but

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
positive negative x direction um but

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.740 
positive negative x direction um but
yeah<00:07:11.490> I<00:07:11.520> think<00:07:11.610> that's<00:07:11.940> about<00:07:12.030> it<00:07:12.120> if<00:07:12.539> you<00:07:12.630> have

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
yeah I think that's about it if you have

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.300 
yeah I think that's about it if you have
any<00:07:12.900> questions<00:07:13.320> then<00:07:13.500> feel<00:07:13.560> free<00:07:13.889> to<00:07:14.160> leave<00:07:14.250> a
