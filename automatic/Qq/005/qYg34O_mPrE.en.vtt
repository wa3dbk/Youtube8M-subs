 the projects to make the dvd of the session of the 2nd dvd rosanah 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.739
 it's a project that we have enough time 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.409
 We are in a very big battle. 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:19.740
 to get it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.970
 raise funds to do 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.119
 this dvd 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.099
 and we wanted to do it with the best conditions 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.699
 for a matter also one day 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.449
 we have to give the baby face we have to overcome 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.980
 people learn a lot and we also have 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.440
 I'll be very happy if it's like this 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.970
 in your project 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.370
 from all sides is precisely everyone is everybody god 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.060
 not only me but all the actors all the people work in our team 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.080
 and even the fans 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.540
 the enthusiasts 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.860
 the two teens were voting 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.370
 clear river 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.070
 more doctor 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.150
 Ahhh 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.350
 kaka 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.460
 is the reluctance of the village 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.289
 but at the time the pn action 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.799
 I do not want her 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.980
 wants to know who is the favorite since we start to notice the 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.570
 government concern 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.610
 How many times do you get now we're gonna do it and we can not do it 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.860
 so in the mean time it was very cool because we see things 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.990
 firearms were used against the right people 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.660
 is wrong very happy pointed out 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.080
 face him 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 before wrote I think we're the house he is the director 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.560
 here and there 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.430
 adds that together 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.450
 I love language very much in the decision he has in view that he understands gravity 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.010
 who needed to falk 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.410
 and dealing with the image system picking up our character choices was 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.640
 the same 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.390
 they should have 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.949
 is 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:09.409
 clear with 1 cabbage 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:13.799
 with more hits than we already knew what would work what not 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.269
 It would work, I love how I like language and such. 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.789
 time also 

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:21.689
 but I feel that the decision of max guidelines 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.609
 we try to be faithful 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:24.819
 Paulo 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.699
 until today in the seventh year of project 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.060
 to these guidelines we tried 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.149
 chosen for the dissociation scope 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.589
 spa tarot 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.199
 that is which are approached and shot 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.309
 the show of mine is here in SÃ£o Paulo 

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.519
 fact that people could have a record 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.909
 from where accident acquisition as subject that we are sharp 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:49.909
 the idea 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.169
 fabi one of the guidelines of the petition is to create original characters that you 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.649
 A character from the movie brings a character 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:01.020
 if she appeared as a maid as she had to earn 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.440
 she has a qi communicate and she has that she can not have thousands already have 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.250
 actors and actresses who have already created the maid chile 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.459
 they are cool 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.380
 I do not want anything that interferes with anything that has already happened 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.540
 It has to be general. 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.280
 so if you get into the character that someone else has thought the piocerÃ¡ afp 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.929
 professional arbitrator type 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.949
 it is necessary for society to be 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.789
 absolutely or regionally in your approach you can only visit it 

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:30.909
 ah 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.880
 and in its way of interpreting 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.979
 So 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.389
 this for example is 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:39.679
 is a vital sector company originality 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.739
 of the characters the scope of themes and he 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.459
 and versatility of the actors 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.569
 I think you're the first person I have to talk to. 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:59.109
 it's wrong 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.969
 the roberto camargo 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.669
 the little town 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:06.499
 we know each other well that we do college there 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:10.119
 in wrong order in that he is my colleague of college I left him 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:15.039
 continued and robertinho hours was always a very dedicated guy who always created 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:17.760
 things very accurate and very 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.860
 he is very focused in order to make the person very creative and also 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.580
 and he will sit with me from the first day of insane Tuesday 

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.139
 we have to meet again today in sÃ£o paulo 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.919
 working together in the xpto group when the customer did not access or need them 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.710
 ceremonies besides opening this 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.630
 so I started to live in peace because the little robertinho 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.340
 character attached to them make us suspect that he arranges for ceremonies a cabaret 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.610
 french and such 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.699
 and with time robertinho came 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.800
 like every week of a different theme every week everything different was created 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.539
 also new characters 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.610
 Hefner of ceremonies was what had been improving was getting sophisticated fares 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.199
 transforming into several resellers of the brand creating small texts to lead 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.460
 here in the show my 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.710
 he is the best 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.060
 my part debuting on the page brain state brasilia and left arm 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.150
 finally 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.069
 she 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.889
 he is fundamental to 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.580
 Only I got twisted. 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.090
 with this work so far in ubirici even though 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.960
 in the online parental control minutes with the lions will enter 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.729
 a network more often 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.269
 the morning luque marco would have already sent a sequel to next 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:39.029
 he sent a tape was and he entering the house of his friends make some bullshit 

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:42.809
 Let me know that the rally is a very interesting finish but it is not 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.670
 exactly this we need gay characters do not have more weight 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.850
 he came to pass the characters and I said I will not work for it 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.529
 never showed up again and then 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.529
 he came in 2006 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:00.879
 to accumulate red tape shows more access of the agents over the city on 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.000
 worked 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.349
 initiated 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:08.189
 developed a lot of things better and we invite and the research ah and 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.839
 of course and arriving here I give my required and marco luque bc was very 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:16.349
 legal the idea will agree once again yet again within the law 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.189
 in the law 

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:21.189
 and he has been a very very person 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:24.779
 so many so many facial in here 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:29.629
 vigorous 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.199
 she is very united 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.019
 these increases
