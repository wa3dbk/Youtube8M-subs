and<00:00:08.910> turn<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.269> into<00:00:09.480> jelly<00:00:10.070> so<00:00:11.070> what<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.700> did

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
and turn it into jelly so what I did

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.539 
and turn it into jelly so what I did
here<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.480> had<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> print<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.530> had<00:00:13.889> an<00:00:14.009> order<00:00:14.370> for

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
here is I had a print I had an order for

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.369 
here is I had a print I had an order for
a<00:00:14.580> print<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.179> do<00:00:15.299> full<00:00:15.570> size<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.049> my<00:00:16.109> thing<00:00:16.289> I'm

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
a print to do full size of my thing I'm

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.640 
a print to do full size of my thing I'm
addict<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:17.240> he<00:00:18.240> wanted<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.660> tipton<00:00:19.230> acetone

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
addict and he wanted it tipton acetone

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.179 
addict and he wanted it tipton acetone
and<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.039> said<00:00:20.939> okay<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.470> I<00:00:22.470> dipped<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and I said okay and I dipped it in the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.630 
and I said okay and I dipped it in the
acetone<00:00:23.640> him<00:00:23.730> for<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:23.970> little<00:00:24.090> too<00:00:24.300> long<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:25.640> took

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
acetone him for a little too long I took

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.700 
acetone him for a little too long I took
it<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:26.939> he<00:00:27.330> looked<00:00:27.570> fine<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.050> then<00:00:28.170> after

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it out and he looked fine and then after

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.290 
it out and he looked fine and then after
a<00:00:28.740> while<00:00:28.800> she<00:00:28.949> started<00:00:29.519> eroding<00:00:29.970> more<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
a while she started eroding more and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.799 
a while she started eroding more and
more<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.470> characteristics<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.809> acetone

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
more so the characteristics of acetone

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.590 
more so the characteristics of acetone
on<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:34.050> abs<00:00:34.320> prints<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> printed<00:00:36.420> mine

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
on your abs prints so I printed mine

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.049 
on your abs prints so I printed mine
with<00:00:36.780> only<00:00:37.020> two<00:00:37.380> shells<00:00:37.760> actually<00:00:38.760> no<00:00:38.850> one

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
with only two shells actually no one

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.180 
with only two shells actually no one
show<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.540> seven<00:00:40.320> percent<00:00:40.590> infill<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.070> can

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
show and seven percent infill so you can

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
show and seven percent infill so you can
kind<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> see<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.700> effect<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.149> has<00:00:42.270> here

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
kind of see the effect that it has here

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.010 
kind of see the effect that it has here
so<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.860> actually<00:00:44.719> thought<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.870> can

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so it really actually thought you can

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.880 
so it really actually thought you can
see<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.780> used<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.379> super<00:00:49.620> hard

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
see you know this used to be super hard

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
see you know this used to be super hard
abs<00:00:50.280> no<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:52.230> jelly<00:00:52.850> so<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.449> gonna

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
abs no it's just like jelly so I'm gonna

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.840 
abs no it's just like jelly so I'm gonna
show<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.750> something<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> cool<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.850> want

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
print was ruined because this acetone

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.050 
print was ruined because this acetone
totally<00:01:32.369> collapsed<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.939> me<00:01:33.200> but<00:01:34.200> although<00:01:34.350> I

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
totally collapsed on me but although I

printing the other one

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.440 
printing the other one
so<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.280> was<00:01:40.370> actually<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.670> really<00:01:40.850> great<00:01:41.060> model

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
so it was actually a really great model

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.270 
so it was actually a really great model
it's<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:41.930> scan<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.530> i<00:01:42.620> did<00:01:42.770> with<00:01:42.800> kinect

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's a scan that i did with kinect

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.910 
it's a scan that i did with kinect
during<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.090> face<00:01:44.270> massive<00:01:44.540> expedition<00:01:44.930> at

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
during the face massive expedition at

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.460 
during the face massive expedition at
the<00:01:46.040> zoo<00:01:46.190> be<00:01:46.340> art<00:01:46.520> center<00:01:46.790> in<00:01:46.880> chicago<00:01:47.470> so

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
the zoo be art center in chicago so

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.730 
the zoo be art center in chicago so
actually<00:01:48.800> has<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> really<00:01:49.280> great<00:01:49.610> deep<00:01:49.820> go<00:01:50.740> we

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
actually has a really great deep go we

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.630 
actually has a really great deep go we
can<00:01:51.920> see<00:01:52.100> what<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.370> was<00:01:52.490> supposed<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:52.850> be<00:01:54.640> and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
can see what it was supposed to be and

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.230 
can see what it was supposed to be and
then<00:01:55.940> what<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.960> turned<00:01:57.260> out<00:01:57.770> to<00:01:58.160> be<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.090> end

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
then what it turned out to be in the end

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.390 
then what it turned out to be in the end
after<00:01:59.530> acetone<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.560> i<00:02:00.740> don't<00:02:00.890> think<00:02:01.190> i'll<00:02:01.370> be

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
after acetone and i don't think i'll be

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.900 
after acetone and i don't think i'll be
doing<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:02.030> again<00:02:02.620> or<00:02:03.620> else<00:02:03.740> be<00:02:04.040> drizzling

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
doing that again or else be drizzling

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:11.170 
doing that again or else be drizzling
