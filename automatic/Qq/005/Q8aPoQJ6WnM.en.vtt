00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that it's hard to see right here but you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.690 
that it's hard to see right here but you
can<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> little<00:00:37.829> bit<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.160> closer<00:00:38.399> look

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
can get a little bit of a closer look

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.020 
can get a little bit of a closer look
right<00:00:39.000> there<00:00:39.500> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> cylindrical<00:00:41.489> shape

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
right there this is a cylindrical shape

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.779 
right there this is a cylindrical shape
it<00:00:42.270> will<00:00:42.420> roll<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.050> place<00:00:43.320> on<00:00:43.559> an<00:00:43.739> angle<00:00:44.129> or<00:00:44.309> on

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it will roll if place on an angle or on

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.490 
it will roll if place on an angle or on
a<00:00:44.820> flat<00:00:45.120> surface<00:00:45.360> that's<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.200> part<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
a flat surface that's just part of the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.110 
a flat surface that's just part of the
design<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.129> it's<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.460> big<00:00:47.520> deal

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
design of this it's not a big deal

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.790 
design of this it's not a big deal
but<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> keep<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.780> mind<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> could<00:00:49.500> roll

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
but I keep in mind that it could roll

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.200 
but I keep in mind that it could roll
away<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.370> situations

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
away in some situations

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.630 
away in some situations
now<00:00:51.809> Ankur<00:00:52.199> does<00:00:52.410> describe<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.160> ultra

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
now Ankur does describe this as ultra

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.229 
now Ankur does describe this as ultra
compact<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.420> portable<00:00:54.800> lipstick<00:00:55.800> style<00:00:56.460> so

compact and portable lipstick style so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
compact and portable lipstick style so
here<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.140> compared<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.620> chapstick

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
here I have it compared with a chapstick

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
here I have it compared with a chapstick
and<00:00:59.399> although<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.910> is<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.329> taller
