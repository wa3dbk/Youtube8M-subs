house and that powder burn it sounds too

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840 
house and that powder burn it sounds too
good<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:31.140> be<00:00:31.260> true<00:00:31.289> but<00:00:32.009> inventor<00:00:32.579> John

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
good to be true but inventor John

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.970 
good to be true but inventor John
Christie<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.390> convinced<00:00:34.050> his<00:00:34.200> machine<00:00:34.649> will

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
Christie is convinced his machine will

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440 
Christie is convinced his machine will
change<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.730> world

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
change the world

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060 
change the world
so<00:00:36.930> John<00:00:37.140> basically<00:00:37.559> you're<00:00:37.710> saying<00:00:37.860> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
so John basically you're saying this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.160 
so John basically you're saying this
machine<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.579> produce<00:00:38.730> five<00:00:39.300> times<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:40.020> much

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
machine can produce five times as much

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.920 
machine can produce five times as much
power<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.100> consumes<00:00:41.430> yes<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.360> does

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
power as it consumes yes it does

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
power as it consumes yes it does
this<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.350> exactly<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.610> does

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this one exactly as we see it it does

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
this one exactly as we see it it does
and<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.300> fact<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.840> produce<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.829> than

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and in fact it can produce more than

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.240 
and in fact it can produce more than
that<00:00:50.780> once<00:00:51.780> kick-started<00:00:52.530> from<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.829> battery

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that once kick-started from a battery

what the the technology speaks for

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.620 
what the the technology speaks for
itself<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.009> mean<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.640> householder<00:01:30.299> could<00:01:30.479> buy

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
itself I mean a householder could buy

way to describe it I think the the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.850

just<00:01:53.130> using<00:01:53.759> principles<00:01:54.619> that<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.950> guess<00:01:56.250> are
