00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
you know this is a process you can't get

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.219 
you know this is a process you can't get
bored<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> process<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.689> look<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.020> we

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
bored with the process if you look at we

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.600 
bored with the process if you look at we
played<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.619> New<00:01:43.680> York<00:01:43.890> last<00:01:44.100> night<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.520> then

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
played in New York last night and then

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.359 
played in New York last night and then
having<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.939> fly<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:46.470> three<00:01:46.890> hours<00:01:47.159> here<00:01:47.280> in

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
having to fly the three hours here in

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.399 
having to fly the three hours here in
Minnesota<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.030> come<00:01:48.240> out<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> kind<00:01:49.350> of

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
Minnesota you come out and you kind of

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.859 
Minnesota you come out and you kind of
lay<00:01:49.560> an<00:01:49.619> egg<00:01:49.770> against<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> team<00:01:50.460> who<00:01:51.210> may<00:01:51.780> or

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
lay an egg against the team who may or

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.870 
lay an egg against the team who may or
may<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.020> make<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> playoffs<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.640> it's

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
may not make the playoffs it's just it's

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.359 
may not make the playoffs it's just it's
another<00:01:54.090> game<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.439> no<00:01:55.590> no<00:01:55.950> win<00:01:56.159> is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
another game and I think no no win is

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.639 
another game and I think no no win is
greater<00:01:57.030> than<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.299> next<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.869> that's

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
greater than the next so that's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.230 
greater than the next so that's
something<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.189> got<00:01:59.340> always<00:01:59.640> value<00:02:00.060> is

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
something that we got always value is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.270 
something that we got always value is
starting<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.140> gain<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.500> same<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:01.890> come<00:02:02.130> with

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
starting to gain the same way come with

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.770 
starting to gain the same way come with
the<00:02:02.369> same<00:02:02.549> energy<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.180> making<00:02:03.390> sure<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.540> our

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the same energy and making sure that our

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
the same energy and making sure that our
opponents<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.259> outwork<00:02:04.649> us<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.670> clear

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
opponents don't outwork us I can clear

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.830
