00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
graduated system of times that a guy can

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.860 
graduated system of times that a guy can
work<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> progress<00:00:47.820> through<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
work on and progress through the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.060 
work on and progress through the
standards<00:00:49.290> in<00:00:49.379> different<00:00:49.409> levels<00:00:49.769> you<00:00:49.979> want

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
standards in different levels you want

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.410 
standards in different levels you want
to<00:00:50.190> tell<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> little<00:00:50.399> more<00:00:50.550> about<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.879> Jason

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
idea with MCMAP and they made a belt

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
idea with MCMAP and they made a belt
system<00:01:09.119> out<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.450> martial<00:01:09.810> arts<00:01:09.990> program

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
