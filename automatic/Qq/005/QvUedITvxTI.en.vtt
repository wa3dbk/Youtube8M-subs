salad<00:00:14.059> and<00:00:15.059> I<00:00:15.540> picked<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:15.960> because<00:00:16.170> it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
salad and I picked it up because it

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.179 
salad and I picked it up because it
should<00:00:17.039> fit<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.640> standard<00:00:18.300> carry<00:00:18.869> on

should fit in standard carry on

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.189 
should fit in standard carry on
specifications<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.240> right<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.900> limit

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
specifications it is right to the limit

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.580 
specifications it is right to the limit

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
of the 14 inch width but I think it'll

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.109

be<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:25.920> right<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.410> top<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.910> got<00:00:29.910> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
be all right so up top here got this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.799 
be all right so up top here got this

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
laptop compartment not terribly large

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.490 
laptop compartment not terribly large
but<00:01:10.920> big<00:01:11.130> enough<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> reasonable<00:01:12.659> maybe<00:01:13.020> 14

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
but big enough for a reasonable maybe 14

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.090 
but big enough for a reasonable maybe 14
inch<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.500> medium<00:01:16.770> sized

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100

version of this bag should say here's a
simple<00:01:21.900> size<00:01:22.229> comparison<00:01:23.150> see<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> seat

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
simple size comparison see a seat

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.990 
simple size comparison see a seat
standard<00:01:24.990> CD

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.240 

so<00:01:31.000> there<00:01:31.180> with<00:01:31.510> the<00:01:31.659> laptop<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.380> like<00:01:32.920> the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
so there with the laptop I like the

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.280 
so there with the laptop I like the
yellow<00:01:33.850> it's<00:01:34.540> easy<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.870> see<00:01:35.110> things<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:38.020> you

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
yellow it's easy to see things then you

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.260 
yellow it's easy to see things then you
go<00:01:38.560> down<00:01:38.770> one<00:01:39.010> more<00:01:39.160> level<00:01:39.220> with<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:39.970> zipper

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
go down one more level with a zipper

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.070 
go down one more level with a zipper
this<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.200> pretty<00:01:41.710> much<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:41.950> main<00:01:42.250> zipper<00:01:43.080> and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
this is pretty much the main zipper and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.790 
this is pretty much the main zipper and
that<00:01:44.200> opens<00:01:44.500> up<00:01:47.490> some<00:01:48.490> more<00:01:48.640> departments<00:01:49.800> just

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
that opens up some more departments just

a configured funny right now but all

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.370 
a configured funny right now but all
this<00:02:19.450> stuff<00:02:19.750> comes<00:02:19.989> out<00:02:20.220> pretty<00:02:21.220> standard

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
this stuff comes out pretty standard

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.410 
this stuff comes out pretty standard
it's<00:02:23.380> nice<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.769> deep<00:02:23.950> in<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> back<00:02:24.420> although

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
it's nice and deep in the back although

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:33.810 
it's nice and deep in the back although
gets<00:02:25.709> thinner<00:02:26.709> up<00:02:26.830> top<00:02:27.250> here<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:31.019> d7000<00:02:32.820> with

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
gets thinner up top here is a d7000 with

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.960 
gets thinner up top here is a d7000 with
a<00:02:33.850> 50<00:02:34.209> millimeter<00:02:34.390> f<00:02:34.840> 1.8<00:02:35.910> nice<00:02:36.910> thing<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.480> fits

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
a 50 millimeter f 1.8 nice thing it fits

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.750 
a 50 millimeter f 1.8 nice thing it fits
vertically<00:02:40.019> in<00:02:41.019> the<00:02:41.080> back<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.519> could

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
vertically in the back so you could

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.270 
vertically in the back so you could
probably<00:02:43.000> fit<00:02:43.299> two<00:02:43.450> camera<00:02:43.780> bodies<00:02:44.280> back

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
probably fit two camera bodies back

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.229 
probably fit two camera bodies back
there

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.910 

this<00:02:51.239> whole<00:02:51.540> compartment<00:02:51.959> actually<00:02:52.680> comes

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
this whole compartment actually comes

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.009 
this whole compartment actually comes
out<00:02:54.080> it's<00:02:55.080> just<00:02:55.170> velcro<00:02:55.530> inside<00:02:56.750> it's<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.870> nice

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
out it's just velcro inside it's a nice

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.360 
out it's just velcro inside it's a nice
feature<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.440> that's<00:03:01.560> about<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.800> for<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.190> main

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
feature so that's about it for the main
