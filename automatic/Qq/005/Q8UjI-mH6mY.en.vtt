00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
is on this track let me tell you it's

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.240 
is on this track let me tell you it's
all<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.299> here<00:02:16.620> all-in-one<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.829> know<00:02:17.950> it's<00:02:18.159> a

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
all on here all-in-one you know it's a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.550 
all on here all-in-one you know it's a
pretty<00:02:18.430> long<00:02:18.700> lap<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:20.170> might<00:02:20.379> get

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
pretty long lap so you might get

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.770 
pretty long lap so you might get
frustrated<00:02:21.250> until<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.610> learn<00:02:21.819> it<00:02:22.060> because

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
frustrated until you learn it because

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.860 
frustrated until you learn it because
it's<00:02:23.170> pretty<00:02:23.409> tough<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.680> learn<00:02:24.069> I<00:02:24.790> had<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.659> put

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
it's pretty tough to learn I had to put

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.289 
it's pretty tough to learn I had to put
a<00:02:26.019> few<00:02:26.590> laps<00:02:26.860> down<00:02:27.159> on<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.640> even<00:02:27.879> really<00:02:28.120> put

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
a few laps down on to even really put

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.949 
a few laps down on to even really put
together<00:02:28.599> a<00:02:28.720> lap<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:30.180> that's<00:02:31.180> one<00:02:31.780> of<00:02:31.810> those

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
together a lap so that's one of those

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.690 
together a lap so that's one of those
jumps<00:02:32.349> right<00:02:32.470> there<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.829> tabletop<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.579> was

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
jumps right there that tabletop it was

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.539 
jumps right there that tabletop it was
Al<00:02:33.819> it's<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.180> little<00:02:34.450> bit<00:02:34.569> weird<00:02:35.129> like<00:02:36.129> going<00:02:36.159> up

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
Al it's a little bit weird like going up

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.520 
Al it's a little bit weird like going up
the<00:02:36.670> face<00:02:36.879> of<00:02:36.909> it<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.390> sometimes<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.049> lose<00:02:38.470> all

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
the face of it so sometimes you lose all

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.589 
the face of it so sometimes you lose all
your<00:02:38.859> momentum<00:02:39.220> like<00:02:39.790> as<00:02:40.030> soon<00:02:40.209> as<00:02:40.359> you<00:02:40.450> go<00:02:40.569> up

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
your momentum like as soon as you go up

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.599 
your momentum like as soon as you go up
to<00:02:40.720> jump<00:02:41.079> you<00:02:41.260> know<00:02:41.379> there's<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.189> pretty<00:02:42.370> cool

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
to jump you know there's a pretty cool

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.170 
to jump you know there's a pretty cool
uphill<00:02:43.120> triple<00:02:43.569> right<00:02:43.750> here<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:45.099> may<00:02:45.819> be

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
uphill triple right here I may be

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.149 
uphill triple right here I may be
sounding<00:02:46.599> like<00:02:46.720> I'm<00:02:46.959> saying<00:02:47.319> this<00:02:47.440> tracks<00:02:47.739> not

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
sounding like I'm saying this tracks not

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.890 
sounding like I'm saying this tracks not
good<00:02:48.459> or<00:02:48.730> too<00:02:48.760> crazy<00:02:49.209> or<00:02:49.390> whatever<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:49.840> it's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
good or too crazy or whatever but it's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.530 
good or too crazy or whatever but it's
it's<00:02:50.409> awesome<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.190> mean<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:51.609> really<00:02:51.639> is<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.329> just

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
frustrated me because it's a little bit

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.839 
frustrated me because it's a little bit
harder<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.680> learn<00:02:56.829> it<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.099> know<00:02:57.400> but

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
little bit on how sections and stuff can

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.729 
little bit on how sections and stuff can
be<00:03:11.769> so<00:03:12.269> there's<00:03:13.269> also<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.659> cool<00:03:13.989> sand<00:03:14.470> section

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
be so there's also a cool sand section

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.789 
be so there's also a cool sand section
right<00:03:15.040> here<00:03:15.099> but<00:03:16.060> so<00:03:16.810> overall<00:03:17.319> I'm<00:03:17.590> going<00:03:17.739> to

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
right here but so overall I'm going to

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.759 
right here but so overall I'm going to
give<00:03:17.889> this<00:03:17.919> track<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:19.139> I'm<00:03:20.139> going<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.379> give<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.590> a

that bike because there's a lot of

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.439 
that bike because there's a lot of
sections<00:03:42.519> where<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:42.849> like<00:03:43.000> you're<00:03:43.209> kind<00:03:43.329> of

off-camber kind of sections so you got

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.439 
off-camber kind of sections so you got
to<00:03:47.290> watch<00:03:47.410> out<00:03:47.560> for<00:03:47.620> that<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:48.099> 10<00:03:48.430> overall<00:03:48.760> and
