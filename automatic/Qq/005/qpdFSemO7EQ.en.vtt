00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.289 
off and one half always comes off the
seed<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:48.689> I'm<00:01:49.140> splitting<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.130> half<00:01:50.460> by

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
seed so then I'm splitting this half by

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.850 
seed so then I'm splitting this half by
cutting<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.720> down<00:01:51.750> there<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.409> he<00:01:52.500> has<00:01:52.649> two

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
cutting it down there so he has two

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
cutting it down there so he has two
pieces<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:53.939> I'm<00:01:54.060> gonna<00:01:54.210> dry<00:01:54.689> those<00:01:55.079> two

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
pieces and then I'm gonna dry those two

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.679 
pieces and then I'm gonna dry those two
half<00:01:55.740> flat<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> other

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
half flat like that and then the other

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.480 
half flat like that and then the other
side<00:01:57.930> it's<00:01:58.110> hard<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.409> cut<00:01:58.590> off<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.280> what<00:01:59.369> I'm

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
side it's hard to cut off so what I'm

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.810 
side it's hard to cut off so what I'm
doing<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.420> just<00:02:00.479> cutting<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.380> little

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
doing is I'm just cutting it in little

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
doing is I'm just cutting it in little
wedges<00:02:02.820> off<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.960> seed<00:02:04.229> because<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> comes<00:02:04.860> off

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
wedges off the seed because it comes off

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.219 
wedges off the seed because it comes off
easier<00:02:05.549> so<00:02:06.149> we're<00:02:06.240> gonna<00:02:06.329> have<00:02:06.600> dried<00:02:07.350> wedge

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
easier so we're gonna have dried wedge

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.950 
easier so we're gonna have dried wedge
and<00:02:08.350> then<00:02:09.039> dried<00:02:09.490> yeah<00:02:10.300> what<00:02:10.630> I've<00:02:10.720> done<00:02:10.899> now

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
and then dried yeah what I've done now

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.100 
and then dried yeah what I've done now
is<00:02:11.319> I'm<00:02:11.710> dumped<00:02:12.160> my<00:02:12.420> lecturing<00:02:13.420> my<00:02:13.600> juice<00:02:13.840> into

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
is I'm dumped my lecturing my juice into

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.350 
is I'm dumped my lecturing my juice into
a<00:02:14.380> bowl<00:02:14.470> of<00:02:14.830> lemon<00:02:15.160> juice<00:02:15.310> I'm<00:02:15.819> gonna<00:02:16.030> let<00:02:16.180> them

a bowl of lemon juice I'm gonna let them

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.940 
a bowl of lemon juice I'm gonna let them
sit<00:02:16.600> in<00:02:16.690> there<00:02:16.870> for<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.170> few<00:02:17.380> minutes<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.860> then

there's five trays and all I've done
both<00:03:00.100> slices<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.450> halves<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:02.320> we're<00:03:02.410> gonna

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
both slices and halves and we're gonna

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.350 
both slices and halves and we're gonna
see<00:03:02.860> how<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:03.250> turn<00:03:04.090> out

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
see how they turn out

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.410 
see how they turn out
so<00:03:04.830> make<00:03:05.830> sure<00:03:06.010> they<00:03:06.190> stack<00:03:06.580> well<00:03:09.120> wanna<00:03:10.120> get

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
bit too thick the hazard slice well and

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.070 
bit too thick the hazard slice well and
as<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.270> can<00:03:49.630> see<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:51.160> was<00:03:51.370> just<00:03:51.670> on<00:03:51.940> low<00:03:52.600> heat

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080

these are the halves actually the lemon
juice<00:03:55.720> drill<00:03:55.990> worked<00:03:56.530> really<00:03:56.890> well<00:03:57.040> you<00:03:57.340> see

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
juice drill worked really well you see

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.390 
juice drill worked really well you see

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
they're still bright yellow and the rack

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.070 
they're still bright yellow and the rack
is<00:04:00.610> disappearing<00:04:01.240> my<00:04:01.390> baby<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:01.840> everyone

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
is disappearing my baby and everyone

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.530

else<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.560> eating<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:02.980> honey<00:04:03.100> too<00:04:03.430> so<00:04:04.390> they're

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
else is eating the honey too so they're

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.770 
else is eating the honey too so they're
really<00:04:04.840> good<00:04:05.050> look<00:04:05.800> at<00:04:05.980> all<00:04:06.100> these<00:04:06.780> they're

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
really good look at all these they're

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.410 
really good look at all these they're
dried<00:04:08.110> up<00:04:08.260> really<00:04:08.620> nicely<00:04:08.970> so<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.000> think<00:04:10.180> you

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
dried up really nicely so I think you

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.600 
dried up really nicely so I think you
could<00:04:10.570> try<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.870> use<00:04:11.200> lemon<00:04:11.620> juice<00:04:11.650> and<00:04:12.220> then

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
could try that use lemon juice and then

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.070 
could try that use lemon juice and then
you<00:04:12.730> don't<00:04:12.850> have<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.060> use<00:04:13.180> any<00:04:13.390> inorganic

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
you don't have to use any inorganic

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.380 
you don't have to use any inorganic
compounds<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.010> keep<00:04:15.190> them<00:04:15.340> fresh<00:04:15.610> so<00:04:16.000> and

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
compounds to keep them fresh so and

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.140 
compounds to keep them fresh so and
there's<00:04:17.170> the<00:04:17.350> wedges<00:04:17.560> so<00:04:18.010> they<00:04:18.520> dried<00:04:18.790> up<00:04:18.940> well

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
there's the wedges so they dried up well

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.590 
there's the wedges so they dried up well
too<00:04:19.420> so<00:04:20.280> they<00:04:21.280> taste<00:04:21.580> really<00:04:21.880> good<00:04:22.240> even

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
too so they taste really good even

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
though you dip them in lemon juice

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.100
