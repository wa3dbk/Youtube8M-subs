00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.160
 we go to the key booth to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.179
 check out the new iso technology 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.340
 consisting of a semiconductor aimed at 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.770
 provide lower energy consumption 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.900
 for tablet smartphone displays 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.609
 computers and televisions 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.340
 besides the absurd reduction of consumption of 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.019
 energy, the Indian also provides a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.859
 much greater sensitivity of all 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.109
 critics 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.030
 here in this panel we can see how 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.450
 that with an ordinary pencil it is possible to have a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.500
 absurd accuracy 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.950
 writing on a screen made with a 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.649
 indian besides compatible with lcd screens 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.649
 the elderly can be implemented in 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.960
 led and oled displays how can we 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.989
 check here with a screen 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.780
 3.4 inch flexible 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.930
 here we are in front of a panel of the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.049
 sharp comparing power consumption 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.530
 between a normal lcd screen and one with 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.070
 peaks are displayed between the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.500
 projections of images is perceptibly 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.299
 much smaller on the screen with this 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.450
 in addition it maintains a consumption 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.860
 constant while the scene 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.320
 is static 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.680
 the great advantage of this new technology 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.630
 of sharp is actually reducing 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 the power consumption of the screen 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.340
 which today is the great problem of 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.659
 smartphones and tablets 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.210
 feel that you are already using technology 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.979
 ipi in some commercialized products 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.369
 We are here in front of two 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 monitors one of them conventional and others 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.000
 both screen with both resolution 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.939
 4k two cars one 32 monitor 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.219
 inches of the conventional 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.960
 available from February one 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.890
 price that should vary between five and six 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.740
 one thousand dollars 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.700
 meanwhile the touchscreen monitor should 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.729
 to reach the market in the second quarter 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.340
 for about a thousand dollars more others 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.489
 cool features of this monitor is 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.629
 that like the model seen in samsung 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:20.069
 it is usable and has support for 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.069
 recognize up to 10 touches on the screen
