 good family and Nastya thought that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.039
 money could be needed by someone on 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 treatment or payment for studying at a bank where 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.600
 Nastya brought money said this 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.360
 day none of their clients are so big 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.490
 the amount of money did not take off therefore thick 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.189
 a pack of five thousandth bills employees 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.979
 the bank was transferred to the police to be there 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.290
 found out who they belong to when 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.570
 the parents' good deed learned 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.240
 Nastya they were not surprised at all 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.530
 how would your life from scratch so many years 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.590
 lived in a dorm 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.080
 themselves have built a house for a child 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.299
 lives with us all saw that not in 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.450
 money probably happiness and what you need 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.220
 achieve in life is always the most but in 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.229
 school where the girl is in school 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.630
 disputes as all the same to proceed in 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.460
 a situation made 6 maths class 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.560
 reconsider their views on life not 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.710
 only classmates but adults 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.740
 the situation is amazing 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.380
 nobody sees you find so big 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.140
 amount of money a completely young person 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.420
 or such a choice and this choice 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.690
 he impressed us all and I think that 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.060
 many of us brought up the story Nastya 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.400
 now knows almost the whole course to the police 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 where is the money stored now already arrived 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.729
 several people claiming a loss 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.250
 wads of large bills 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.770
 but after checking the police assured 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.350
 the owner is not found yet and they will do everything 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.500
 to establish the present owner 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.269
 if it's losing that money they somehow 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 way this person got hit before 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.570
 under some circumstances they were 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.480
 lost they were somewhere somewhere 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.380
 cashed or going anywhere about 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.959
 their availability 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.959
 probably should have known some other 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.000
 faces and about their loss also according to 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.560
 police officers they are with such 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.080
 situations never before 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.780
 faced but the law says that 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.300
 if the owners do not find the fate of money 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.239
 the court will decide and it is quite possible that Nastya 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.690
 will be put 25 percent of the found 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.730
 amounts 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.650
