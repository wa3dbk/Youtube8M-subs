00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
center front mark this is the bottom hem

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.970 
center front mark this is the bottom hem
line<00:01:52.000> this<00:01:52.300> is<00:01:52.480> the<00:01:52.570> bottom<00:01:52.870> hem<00:01:53.080> line<00:01:53.320> so<00:01:53.770> I'm

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
line this is the bottom hem line so I'm

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.730 
line this is the bottom hem line so I'm
going<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.250> connect<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:55.600> center<00:01:55.960> front<00:01:56.230> to<00:01:56.590> the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
going to connect the center front to the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.380 
going to connect the center front to the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
bottom back hemline and I'm going to

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.950 
bottom back hemline and I'm going to
draw<00:01:58.690> a<00:01:58.869> curved<00:01:59.380> line<00:02:02.280> towards<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.460> place

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
draw a curved line towards that place

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.070 
draw a curved line towards that place
and<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.729> reason<00:02:06.880> why<00:02:07.180> I'm<00:02:07.300> doing<00:02:07.360> a<00:02:07.660> curved

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and the reason why I'm doing a curved

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.910 
and the reason why I'm doing a curved
line<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.920> so<00:02:09.250> that<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.520> creates<00:02:09.700> more<00:02:10.209> swing

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
line is so that it creates more swing

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:22.800 
line is so that it creates more swing
for<00:02:11.920> your<00:02:12.010> crop<00:02:12.220> top

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.180 

now<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:24.110> stretch<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.680> out<00:02:24.739> a<00:02:24.890> little

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
now you can stretch that out a little

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.559 
now you can stretch that out a little
bit<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:27.190> you'll<00:02:28.190> see<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:28.730> will<00:02:28.849> curve

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
bit and you'll see that it will curve

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.220 
bit and you'll see that it will curve
