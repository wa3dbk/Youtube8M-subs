00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.080
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.400
 in making waves 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.960
 first 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.960
 is in web data 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.720
 and they put the one that does 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.260
 the second 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.399

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.780
 stretches 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.780
 let's ride this 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.710
 and we put it in 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.570
 system data form and cache 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.500
 when they have done that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 they are called here 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.960

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.770
 it seems because I already did it and it's rice 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.299

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.299

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.740

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:59.670

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.670

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 this law 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.670
 I'm just installing things 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.060
 extras that I had 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.060

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.790

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.610
 I experienced with the newly compiled 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.100

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.030

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.070
 LED bars that do not turn on 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.420
