objects<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> match<00:01:35.880> will<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.420> working

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
objects in the match will be working

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
objects in the match will be working
with<00:01:37.140> physics<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.829> everything<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.850> look

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
with physics and so everything will look

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.190 
with physics and so everything will look
different<00:01:39.119> every<00:01:39.420> single<00:01:39.509> time<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> play

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
different every single time you play

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
different every single time you play
it's<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:41.009> tables<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.700> break<00:01:41.939> different

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it's the tables will break different

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's the tables will break different
ways<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:43.079> won't<00:01:43.200> see<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.680> scripted

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
ways you won't see the same scripted

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
ways you won't see the same scripted
moves<00:01:44.549> break<00:01:44.970> through<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.180> tables<00:01:45.509> every

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
moves break through the tables every

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
moves break through the tables every
single<00:01:45.960> time<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.790> recreate

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
single time we really want to recreate

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.510 
single time we really want to recreate
those<00:01:48.450> crazy<00:01:48.930> TLC<00:01:49.409> matches<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.829> see<00:01:49.950> ando<00:01:50.189> w

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
those crazy TLC matches you see ando w

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.690 
those crazy TLC matches you see ando w
program<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.079> we're<00:01:53.040> able<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.549> with

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
program so we're able to do that with

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
program so we're able to do that with
smacked<00:01:53.970> immersive<00:01:54.270> Rob<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.570> year<00:01:54.810> 2011<00:01:55.350> the

smacked immersive Rob this year 2011 the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.010 
smacked immersive Rob this year 2011 the
TLC<00:01:56.610> match<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.360> completely

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
TLC match is going to be completely

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.810 
TLC match is going to be completely
blown<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:59.310> gonna<00:01:59.520> be<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> lot<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
blown out and that's gonna be a lot of

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.700 
blown out and that's gonna be a lot of
fun<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.390> fans<00:02:00.600> gonna<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:00.960> able<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.229> you

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
fun we think fans gonna be able to you

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.170 
fun we think fans gonna be able to you
know<00:02:01.770> create<00:02:02.009> some<00:02:02.159> crazy<00:02:02.579> moments<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.090> their

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
know create some crazy moments of their

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.209 
know create some crazy moments of their
own<00:02:03.329> on<00:02:03.740> alright<00:02:04.740> well<00:02:04.860> let's<00:02:05.009> talk<00:02:05.159> about

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
own on alright well let's talk about

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.530 
own on alright well let's talk about
exactly<00:02:05.759> how<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.240> going<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.420> work

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
exactly how this is going to work

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
exactly how this is going to work
because<00:02:06.750> what<00:02:07.500> what<00:02:07.740> does<00:02:07.860> dynamic<00:02:08.310> physics

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
because what what does dynamic physics

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.279 
because what what does dynamic physics
do<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> objects<00:02:09.390> that<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.720> didn't<00:02:10.050> do<00:02:10.140> in

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
do for the objects that it didn't do in

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.730 
do for the objects that it didn't do in
years

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
years

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.470 
years
yeah<00:02:11.250> what's<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.820> happen<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.210> that<00:02:12.330> each

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
yeah what's going to happen is that each

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.600 
yeah what's going to happen is that each
you<00:02:12.840> know<00:02:12.930> each<00:02:13.110> object<00:02:13.350> itself<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.490> to

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
you know each object itself is going to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.790 
you know each object itself is going to
be<00:02:14.730> moving<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:15.840> physics<00:02:16.230> system<00:02:16.620> so

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
be moving with this physics system so

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.230 
be moving with this physics system so
every<00:02:17.040> single<00:02:17.280> time<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.430> interact<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:18.000> it

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
every single time you interact with it

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.150 
every single time you interact with it
it's<00:02:18.900> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.110> be<00:02:19.200> dynamic<00:02:19.740> it's<00:02:19.920> not<00:02:20.040> going

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
it's going to be dynamic it's not going

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.800 
it's going to be dynamic it's not going
to<00:02:20.250> be<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> scripted<00:02:20.820> events<00:02:20.910> when<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.360> pick<00:02:21.570> up<00:02:21.690> a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
to be a scripted events when I pick up a

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.600 
to be a scripted events when I pick up a
ladder<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.710> throw<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.100> at<00:02:23.220> someone<00:02:23.430> is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
ladder and I throw it at someone is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.850 
ladder and I throw it at someone is
going<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.820> throw<00:02:24.210> like<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> normal<00:02:25.260> platter

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
going to throw like a normal platter

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.470 
going to throw like a normal platter
with<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.160> throne<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.330> hit

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
with the throne and it's going to hit

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.550 
with the throne and it's going to hit
your<00:02:27.630> opponent<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:28.110> going<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.290> go<00:02:28.380> flying

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
your opponent it's going to go flying

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.790 
your opponent it's going to go flying
down<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.190> also<00:02:30.060> we<00:02:30.180> break<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> table<00:02:30.900> sometimes

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
down and also we break a table sometimes

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.320 
down and also we break a table sometimes
it<00:02:32.010> doesn't<00:02:32.430> always<00:02:32.490> break<00:02:32.850> right<00:02:33.060> middle

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
it doesn't always break right middle

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.880 
it doesn't always break right middle
right<00:02:33.660> sometimes<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.350> breaks<00:02:34.470> off<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
right sometimes it breaks off to the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.500 
right sometimes it breaks off to the
side<00:02:35.100> sometimes<00:02:35.730> doesn't<00:02:35.970> even<00:02:36.060> break<00:02:36.210> maybe

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
side sometimes doesn't even break maybe

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.480 
side sometimes doesn't even break maybe
the<00:02:36.660> legs<00:02:36.870> get<00:02:37.140> swept<00:02:37.500> up<00:02:37.650> from<00:02:37.920> under<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.220> and

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
the legs get swept up from under it and

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.670 
the legs get swept up from under it and
it<00:02:38.670> collapses<00:02:39.180> we<00:02:39.960> really<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.380> bring<00:02:40.560> out

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
it collapses we really want to bring out

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
it collapses we really want to bring out
all<00:02:40.710> those<00:02:41.070> moments<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:42.330> that's<00:02:42.540> what<00:02:42.660> some<00:02:42.810> of

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
all those moments so that's what some of

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.940 
all those moments so that's what some of
the<00:02:42.960> things<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.350> able<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.530> see<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
the things you can be able to see you

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.680 
the things you can be able to see you
build<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.640> folk<00:02:44.820> you'll<00:02:45.030> two<00:02:45.180> ladders<00:02:45.420> and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
build a folk you'll two ladders and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.080 
build a folk you'll two ladders and
ladders<00:02:45.870> will<00:02:45.990> actually<00:02:46.230> bend<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.650> break<00:02:47.090> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
ladders will actually bend and break and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.120 
ladders will actually bend and break and
you'd<00:02:48.300> be<00:02:48.390> able<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> stack<00:02:48.870> ladders<00:02:49.410> and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
you'd be able to stack ladders and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.180 
you'd be able to stack ladders and
tables<00:02:50.550> onto<00:02:50.850> area<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.620> ring<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.100> if

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
tables onto area of the the ring so if

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.080 
tables onto area of the the ring so if
you<00:02:53.250> want<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.460> stack<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.640> against<00:02:54.030> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
you want to stack it against the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.870 
you want to stack it against the
barricade<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:55.170> ring<00:02:55.380> ropes<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:56.010> corner<00:02:56.460> you

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
barricade the ring ropes the corner you

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.100 
barricade the ring ropes the corner you
want<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.090> stack<00:02:57.240> a<00:02:57.270> ladder<00:02:57.570> against<00:02:57.870> another

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
want to stack a ladder against another

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.840 
want to stack a ladder against another
ladder<00:02:58.380> standing<00:02:58.800> up<00:02:58.950> they'll<00:02:59.400> do<00:02:59.550> all<00:02:59.700> that

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
ladder standing up they'll do all that

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.210

experience<00:04:19.410> so<00:04:20.040> we<00:04:20.580> made<00:04:20.760> sure<00:04:20.790> that<00:04:21.090> it's

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
experience so we made sure that it's

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.290 
experience so we made sure that it's
very<00:04:21.450> easy<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.780> put

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
very easy to put

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.730 
very easy to put
tables<00:04:22.569> that<00:04:22.720> new<00:04:22.900> control<00:04:23.349> is<00:04:23.500> really<00:04:23.650> going

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
tables that new control is really going

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.260 
tables that new control is really going
to<00:04:23.800> be<00:04:23.919> able<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.129> make<00:04:24.460> that<00:04:24.520> happen<00:04:24.699> when

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
to be able to make that happen when

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.580 
to be able to make that happen when
something<00:04:25.479> breaks<00:04:25.690> apart<00:04:26.020> like<00:04:26.199> a<00:04:26.259> ladder<00:04:26.470> or

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
something breaks apart like a ladder or

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.230 
something breaks apart like a ladder or
a<00:04:26.680> table<00:04:26.889> the<00:04:27.129> pizzas<00:04:27.460> stay<00:04:27.639> in<00:04:27.759> the<00:04:27.849> ring<00:04:28.000> the

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
a table the pizzas stay in the ring the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.219 
a table the pizzas stay in the ring the
pieces<00:04:28.539> you<00:04:28.629> can<00:04:28.659> stay<00:04:28.870> in<00:04:28.930> there<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.199> a

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
pieces you can stay in there for a

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.570 
pieces you can stay in there for a
little<00:04:29.409> while<00:04:29.650> we<00:04:29.979> want<00:04:30.159> you<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.310> be<00:04:30.370> able<00:04:30.430> to

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
little while we want you to be able to

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.309 
little while we want you to be able to
have<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.699> lot<00:04:31.000> of<00:04:31.030> tables<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:31.539> lot<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.870> ladder<00:04:32.020> so

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:32.319 
have a lot of tables a lot of ladder so

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.450 
have a lot of tables a lot of ladder so
you<00:04:32.710> know<00:04:32.800> eventually<00:04:32.860> we're<00:04:33.190> gonna<00:04:33.280> have

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
you know eventually we're gonna have

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.520 
you know eventually we're gonna have
them<00:04:33.550> fade<00:04:33.789> out<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.810> we<00:04:34.900> like<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.199> effect<00:04:35.470> of

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
them fade out but we like the effect of

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.279 
them fade out but we like the effect of
time<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:35.830> pieces<00:04:36.159> in<00:04:36.310> there<00:04:36.509> see<00:04:37.509> you<00:04:37.990> check

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
time the pieces in there see you check

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:39.930 
time the pieces in there see you check
out<00:04:38.349> all<00:04:38.470> your<00:04:38.590> carnage<00:04:39.069> out<00:04:39.220> there<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.550> know

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
out all your carnage out there you know

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.149 
out all your carnage out there you know
five<00:04:40.360> broken<00:04:40.659> tables<00:04:41.199> and<00:04:41.530> all<00:04:41.620> that<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:41.979> want

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
five broken tables and all that we want

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.040 
five broken tables and all that we want
you<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.280> be<00:04:42.340> able<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.580> see<00:04:42.699> that<00:04:42.849> but<00:04:43.150> yeah<00:04:43.870> in

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
you to be able to see that but yeah in

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.570 
you to be able to see that but yeah in
order<00:04:44.259> for<00:04:44.349> you<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:44.590> be<00:04:44.710> able<00:04:44.740> to<00:04:44.889> bring<00:04:44.979> out<00:04:45.159> 20

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
order for you to be able to bring out 20

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.770 
order for you to be able to bring out 20
tables<00:04:45.970> whatever<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.300> is<00:04:46.360> won't<00:04:46.509> have<00:04:46.690> to

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
tables whatever it is won't have to

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.510 
tables whatever it is won't have to
eventually<00:04:46.960> fade<00:04:47.289> some<00:04:47.530> out<00:04:47.680> right<00:04:48.009> for

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
eventually fade some out right for

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.129 
eventually fade some out right for
performance<00:04:49.030> analyzer<00:04:49.270> you<00:04:49.449> have<00:04:49.569> stacks<00:04:49.870> of

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
performance analyzer you have stacks of

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.249 
performance analyzer you have stacks of
wood<00:04:50.560> all<00:04:50.740> over<00:04:50.949> the<00:04:51.039> place<00:04:51.990> well<00:04:52.990> let<00:04:53.080> me<00:04:53.139> ask

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
wood all over the place well let me ask

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.290 
wood all over the place well let me ask
you<00:04:53.379> then<00:04:53.590> about<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.370> chairs<00:04:54.639> we've<00:04:55.060> talked

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
you then about the chairs we've talked

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.850 
you then about the chairs we've talked
about<00:04:55.389> tables<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:55.870> ladders<00:04:56.139> but<00:04:56.259> chairs<00:04:56.530> you

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
about tables and ladders but chairs you

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.559 
about tables and ladders but chairs you
have<00:04:56.949> some<00:04:57.129> specific<00:04:57.400> new<00:04:58.090> moves<00:04:58.360> for<00:04:58.539> the

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
have some specific new moves for the

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.209 
have some specific new moves for the
chairs<00:04:58.840> that's<00:04:59.289> right<00:04:59.530> yeah<00:04:59.680> Cheers<00:04:59.979> we've

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219 
chairs that's right yeah Cheers we've

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:01.559 
chairs that's right yeah Cheers we've
also<00:05:00.370> spent<00:05:00.759> some<00:05:00.789> time<00:05:00.879> with<00:05:01.270> that<00:05:01.449> they're

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
also spent some time with that they're

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:02.730 
also spent some time with that they're
also<00:05:01.690> gonna<00:05:01.840> have<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.050> physics<00:05:02.379> working<00:05:02.560> on

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
also gonna have the physics working on

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.529 
also gonna have the physics working on
them<00:05:02.889> as<00:05:03.009> well<00:05:03.159> but<00:05:03.340> we<00:05:03.729> allow<00:05:03.909> you<00:05:03.969> to<00:05:04.300> throw

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
them as well but we allow you to throw

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.270 
them as well but we allow you to throw
the<00:05:04.719> chairs<00:05:04.960> as<00:05:05.199> well<00:05:05.409> now<00:05:05.620> so<00:05:05.889> you<00:05:05.949> can<00:05:06.159> go

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
the chairs as well now so you can go

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.860 
the chairs as well now so you can go
ahead<00:05:06.370> and<00:05:06.490> pick<00:05:06.909> up<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.090> chair<00:05:07.300> throw<00:05:07.539> right<00:05:07.750> at

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
ahead and pick up a chair throw right at

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.719 
ahead and pick up a chair throw right at
your<00:05:07.960> opponents<00:05:08.469> do<00:05:09.099> a<00:05:09.129> lot<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.340> new<00:05:09.460> cool

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
your opponents do a lot of new cool

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:11.459 
your opponents do a lot of new cool
moves<00:05:09.940> about<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:10.449> on<00:05:10.659> everyone's<00:05:11.199> gonna<00:05:11.409> be

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
moves about it on everyone's gonna be

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.260 
moves about it on everyone's gonna be
able<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.680> check<00:05:11.860> out<00:05:11.979> III<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.940> sounds<00:05:13.210> like

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
able to check out III and it sounds like

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.420 
able to check out III and it sounds like
this<00:05:13.449> physics<00:05:13.870> system<00:05:14.169> will<00:05:14.500> apply<00:05:14.830> itself<00:05:15.310> in

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
this physics system will apply itself in

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.860 
this physics system will apply itself in
other<00:05:15.639> types<00:05:15.849> of<00:05:16.000> matches<00:05:16.360> right<00:05:16.509> that's<00:05:16.750> why

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
other types of matches right that's why

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.570 
other types of matches right that's why
I<00:05:16.900> keep<00:05:17.110> saying<00:05:17.319> TLC<00:05:17.889> because<00:05:18.250> that's<00:05:18.460> the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
I keep saying TLC because that's the

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.890 
I keep saying TLC because that's the
match<00:05:18.729> was<00:05:18.940> showing<00:05:19.240> off<00:05:19.330> but<00:05:19.509> really<00:05:19.780> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
match was showing off but really the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.930 
match was showing off but really the
dynamic<00:05:20.530> physics<00:05:20.889> is<00:05:20.979> working<00:05:21.310> through<00:05:21.460> any

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
dynamic physics is working through any

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.700 
dynamic physics is working through any
weapon<00:05:22.419> but<00:05:22.810> there's<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.050> sledgehammer<00:05:23.319> the

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
weapon but there's a sledgehammer the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.010 
weapon but there's a sledgehammer the
steel<00:05:24.039> steps<00:05:24.370> any<00:05:24.909> object<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.389> we<00:05:25.539> have<00:05:25.750> in

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
steel steps any object that we have in

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.899 
steel steps any object that we have in
the<00:05:26.199> ring<00:05:26.440> as<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:26.979> be<00:05:27.130> using<00:05:27.310> these<00:05:27.490> physics

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
the ring as you be using these physics

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.279 
the ring as you be using these physics
we<00:05:28.029> do<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.330> lot<00:05:28.539> of<00:05:28.599> different<00:05:28.930> things<00:05:28.960> with

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
we do a lot of different things with

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.129 
we do a lot of different things with
them<00:05:29.440> very<00:05:29.949> nice<00:05:30.159> and<00:05:30.430> of<00:05:30.699> course<00:05:30.960> we<00:05:31.960> have<00:05:32.110> the

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
them very nice and of course we have the

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.659 
them very nice and of course we have the
match<00:05:32.409> type<00:05:32.710> but<00:05:32.949> we<00:05:33.039> should<00:05:33.250> also<00:05:33.370> talk<00:05:33.610> about

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
match type but we should also talk about

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.879 
match type but we should also talk about
the<00:05:34.000> guys<00:05:34.150> the<00:05:34.930> wrestlers<00:05:35.319> that<00:05:35.349> are<00:05:35.560> in<00:05:35.680> this

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
the guys the wrestlers that are in this
