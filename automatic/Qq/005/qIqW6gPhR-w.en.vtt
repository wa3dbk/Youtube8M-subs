00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.129
You go that way, I'll go this way.

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.129
Ok.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.009
You never know what you may find at a salvage
yard, there is so much old timber waiting

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.710
to be turned into something usefull.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:15.740
It's a great way to take this valuable natural
resource and give it another turn in life.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.750
Ahh!

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.760
Perfect.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.779
Dene top.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:33.000
Having found the timber we want to use we
have asked the guys to dress it for us.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.790
It's a lot easier than hand planing.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.490
It is and it doesn't cost a fortune.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:48.760
Allright lets look at this plan.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.070
Ok, one of the great things about using recycled
material is that you have to be flexable.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.420
Some times you have got to change your design
slightly to fit the material.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.930
So having a basic plan is absolutely essential.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.860
So if we call the overall length of the top
say 1200, that'll use the best part of this

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.330
280 wide Jarrah.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.330
Yep, indeed.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:17.290
Alright, well look if you want to start the
cuts, i'll take this out and strip it.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.840
According to the plans the legs are cut at
660mm from the 50x50mm Jarrah.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.700
We then need 2 lengths of 60x19mm 180mm and
2 at 1100mm.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.400
No matter how natural the ingredients are
in a stripper, it's agressive enough to take

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.690
paint off, so make sure your wear your protective
safety gear.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.610
Very important with stripper.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.870
The stripper has a citrus oil base, and it
smells ok but it is best to do it outside

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.510
where there is plenty of ventilation.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.460
I brush it on generously so it won't dry out
before it has done the job.

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.600
The stripper begins to act fairly quickly.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.380
Once the paint has bubbled and lifted I can
scrape it off.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.850
Ok, that's worked pretty well it's got the
first layer off but as is often the case with

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.550
old bits of material like this, there is several
sorts of paint all one over the other.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.740
So now I'm going to have to do another coat
of stripper to get this next lot off.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.790
Ok, that's got it off very well.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.920
There is a very fine layer of undercoat still
on, but I'm actually going to sand that off

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.200
because I'd like to leave a rather beachy
look.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.110
A bit of an influence of the old paint that
was on this timber.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.790
It's a water based stripper, but it's good
to wrap the waste and dispose of it carefully.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.349
Once that is done I need to wash it down and
decide if we need another coat.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.790
Well we have cut the legs and the top frame
and the mounting blocks, all we have to do

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.340
now is cut the end braces and mark them first.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.150
Ah 4 legs.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.410
Yes David, 4 legs no arms and no brain.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.050
No no, I was joking, I know what it means
to have 4 legs.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.380
How did you get on with the stripper.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.480
Beautifull, it's great it's still drying.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.370
Can you help me mark out the end brace bit's
for this.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.070
Sure sure.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.099
To make the construction of the hall table
fairly strait forward, we are using simple

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.489
but joins.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.930
So with recycled material because there is
a slight variation in material size potentially,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.590
we mark a template off the actual end that
we are going to join together and that ensures

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.310
that it's going to be a perfect fit.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.959
We use the offcuts to make sturdy braces.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:50.340
Once it is assembled, glued and screwed it
will be a very strong hall table.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.490
Right so there we are, that's the end brace
there is the template and it looks like it

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.490
has worked.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.150
So Dene it you want to drill and counter sink
that, I'll give the table top a final sand

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.420
and then we can put it together.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.379
I'm using a fairly course paper it's actually
an 80 grit but don't forget you can actually

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:18.109
wash the sandpaper to get the swarf out of
it and it keeps working.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:27.639
You don't have to change it as often then.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.210
Well it's a fair bit of work but you can see
the grain starting to come through.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.099
Let's have a look.

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.979
There we go, that's what we are looking for.

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.020
A lovely sort of beach look.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.189
Slightly lighter color, we are going to leave
that paint there as it is because I just think

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:47.289
it says so much about the grain.

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.909
Beautiful timber, Jarrah.

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.969
Legs look nice and straight.

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:59.860
Ok, put the blocks in.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.819
We pre-drill and counter sink all of the holes
to avoid splitting the Jarrah.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:14.979
That looks great Dene, good progress.

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:21.360
There is the top, now we are going to use
some 8x8mm beading just around the top between

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.379
the top and the base just to give it a shadow
line.

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.370
It adds a touch of class.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.960
Ok Dene, Ive drilled and cut these ready.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.249
We pre-drill them because if you don't the
beading this fine just splits.

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:43.219
Ok, well why don't you lift the legs up and
I'll see if it fits.

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.800
The mitre saw has ensured that our cuts are
straight and square so once we glue it and

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:59.020
screw the table together, it should pull up
nice and straight.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.119
We have done all the fixings from behind so
you don't see any of the screws, you don't

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:04.119
see any of the nails.

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:08.499
They are all hidden once it is finished.

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.931
And there is just the middle.

00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.460
Ok, well it looks pretty good.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.139
Should we turn it over?

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.280
Yeah lets flip it.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.289
That's nice and straight.

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:25.449
Now we haven't glued it because you really
do need to assemble it before you do.

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.090
Just to make sure it all fits, it all works
and when we glue it and clamp it we will tighten

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.330
it up and it will be perfect.

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.069
What do you think Dene?

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:34.509
Yeah I love it, I love that top.

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:38.110
Yeah I sort of left it beachy and interesting.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.999
Windswept and interesting.

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:45.849
Like the BeeGees

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:51.309
And our beautiful recycled Jarrah hall table
costs just under $60 in materials and dressing.
