silver championship team now this was

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.580 
silver championship team now this was
very<00:00:26.699> very<00:00:27.390> annoying<00:00:27.869> because<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.439> all<00:00:28.560> know

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
very very annoying because we all know

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.380 
very very annoying because we all know
how<00:00:28.949> much<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.279> hate<00:00:29.310> five<00:00:29.699> at<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> back<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
how much I hate five at the back and the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.880 
how much I hate five at the back and the
formation<00:00:30.720> he<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.080> playing<00:00:31.289> i<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.800> was

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
formation he was playing i think it was

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.870 
formation he was playing i think it was
52<00:00:32.309> 21<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:34.020> probably<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.500> best<00:00:34.880> five

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
52 21 and that's probably the best five

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.130 
52 21 and that's probably the best five
at<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> back<00:00:36.090> formation<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.809> there<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
at the back formation that there is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.600 
at the back formation that there is
because<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> others<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.920> don't<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
because the others just don't have the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
because the others just don't have the
same<00:00:38.820> sort<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.600> feel<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.410> does

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
same sort of like feel to it but it does

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.100 
same sort of like feel to it but it does
go<00:00:40.739> ahead<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.550> nil<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.940> Zaha<00:00:42.690> getting<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
go ahead one nil with Zaha getting a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
go ahead one nil with Zaha getting a
nice<00:00:43.260> goal<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.890> if<00:00:44.070> he<00:00:44.250> does<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.670> taken
