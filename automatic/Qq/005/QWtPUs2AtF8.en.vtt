you're<00:01:39.350> interested<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.439> using<00:01:40.590> Moroccan<00:01:41.159> oil

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
but you're afraid it's going to be too

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.240 
but you're afraid it's going to be too
heavy<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:42.990> some<00:01:43.290> other<00:01:43.409> kind<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.710> argon<00:01:44.070> oil

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
heavy or some other kind of argon oil

heavy or some other kind of argon oil
concoction<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.320> think<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.829> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
concoction and you think it's just a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
concoction and you think it's just a
little<00:01:47.130> too<00:01:47.280> much<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.700> tried<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.270> it's

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
little too much if you tried it and it's

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.499 
little too much if you tried it and it's
too<00:01:48.450> much<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:49.770> if<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.579> idea<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:51.030> when

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
too much or if you like the idea of when

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.889 
too much or if you like the idea of when
as<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> leave-in<00:01:52.290> treatment<00:01:53.570> but<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> think

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
as a leave-in treatment but you think

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
as a leave-in treatment but you think
that<00:01:55.049> might<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.259> too<00:01:55.560> heavy<00:01:55.740> also<00:01:56.390> look<00:01:57.390> into

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
lash line and you can still see that's

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.459
