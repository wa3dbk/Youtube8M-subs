know and I had to you know I had to put
the<00:06:37.919> trophy<00:06:38.220> on<00:06:38.400> lefty<00:06:39.030> skills<00:06:39.360> because<00:06:39.720> it

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
the trophy on lefty skills because it

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.100 
the trophy on lefty skills because it
takes

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
takes

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.249 
takes
and<00:06:41.229> immense<00:06:41.919> amounts<00:06:42.610> of<00:06:42.729> dehydration<00:06:43.660> to

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:44.259 
and immense amounts of dehydration to

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.120 
and immense amounts of dehydration to
come<00:06:44.470> up<00:06:44.620> with<00:06:44.740> something<00:06:45.419> like<00:06:46.419> lefty<00:06:47.320> skills

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
come up with something like lefty skills

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.129 
come up with something like lefty skills
so<00:06:48.820> I<00:06:48.850> guess<00:06:49.090> in<00:06:49.180> that<00:06:49.270> case<00:06:49.330> Mayweather<00:06:49.930> has

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
so I guess in that case Mayweather has

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.260 
so I guess in that case Mayweather has
rightie<00:06:50.590> skills<00:06:51.160> the<00:06:51.550> whole<00:06:51.729> thing<00:06:52.060> is

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
rightie skills the whole thing is

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.900 
rightie skills the whole thing is
basically<00:06:52.870> something<00:06:53.590> like<00:06:53.800> buffoonery<00:06:54.520> and

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910 
basically something like buffoonery and
