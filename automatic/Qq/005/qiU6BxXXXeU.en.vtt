Justin<00:00:20.580> oh<00:00:20.699> no<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:20.970> mean<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.630> mix<00:00:21.869> less

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
Justin oh no I mean you can mix less

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.230 
Justin oh no I mean you can mix less
than<00:00:22.410> seven<00:00:22.800> days<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.949> think<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.699> they<00:00:24.029> haven't

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
than seven days I think so they haven't

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.359 
than seven days I think so they haven't
had<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.449> lot<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.720> time<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.619> more<00:00:25.980> importantly

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
had a lot of time and more importantly

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.029 
had a lot of time and more importantly
ahead<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> any<00:00:27.630> multiple<00:00:28.199> days<00:00:28.410> where<00:00:29.010> you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
ahead in any multiple days where you

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.310 
ahead in any multiple days where you
practice<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.910> another<00:00:30.269> prizes<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
practice you have another prizes you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.690 
practice you have another prizes you
have<00:00:31.529> another<00:00:31.800> one<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.520> actually

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
have another one so you can actually

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.600 
have another one so you can actually
work<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.270> stuff<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:35.430> help

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
work on stuff and I think that will help

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
work on stuff and I think that will help
all<00:00:35.880> up<00:00:36.090> now<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.690> opposite<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.140> have

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
all up now it's opposite to have
