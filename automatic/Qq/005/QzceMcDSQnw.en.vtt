00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
but going into houston this week

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.920 
but going into houston this week
Houston's<00:03:35.790> offenses<00:03:36.329> much<00:03:36.569> better<00:03:36.810> than

the<00:03:42.540> giants<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:42.959> think<00:03:42.989> because<00:03:43.319> it's<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:43.530> road

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709

the giants I think because it's a road
game<00:03:43.950> it's<00:03:44.220> not<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.459> new<00:03:44.670> york<00:03:44.880> prime<00:03:45.239> time<00:03:45.480> game

the line was the way it was last week I
don't<00:03:55.230> know<00:03:55.380> why<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:55.920> line<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.579> being

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
don't know why the line and being

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.729 
don't know why the line and being
correcting<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.569> fact<00:03:57.840> that<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.109> giants<00:03:58.500> won

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739

correcting the fact that the giants won
I<00:03:59.069> knew<00:03:59.819> that<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.120> elves<00:04:00.329> were<00:04:00.420> going<00:04:00.569> to

I knew that the elves were going to
happen<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.319> that's<00:04:01.470> why<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.680> made<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.069> pic<00:04:02.280> but

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
happen and that's why I made the pic but

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.430 
happen and that's why I made the pic but
i<00:04:02.970> think<00:04:03.209> this<00:04:03.299> year<00:04:03.359> expect<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:04.019> earth<00:04:04.170> for

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
as an underlying theme the Vikings

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.860 
as an underlying theme the Vikings

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.089 
now and every time I've said that I want
to<00:05:40.150> show<00:05:40.240> that<00:05:40.389> teams<00:05:40.599> lost<00:05:40.810> but<00:05:41.500> this<00:05:41.860> week

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099
