00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
down lately and the first one is this

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.380 
down lately and the first one is this
Sigma<00:02:11.290> F<00:02:11.470> 10<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.430> business<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.970> my<00:02:13.090> past

couple tutorials for my contour and the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.760 
couple tutorials for my contour and the
reason<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.450> because<00:02:16.480> I'm<00:02:16.990> not<00:02:17.140> wanting<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.530> do

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
reason is because I'm not wanting to do

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.710 
reason is because I'm not wanting to do
like<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> super<00:02:18.340> harsh<00:02:18.580> contour<00:02:19.090> anymore<00:02:19.480> and
