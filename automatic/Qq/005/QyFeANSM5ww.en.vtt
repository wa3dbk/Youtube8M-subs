hi i'm alois rosario from pingskills

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.030 
hi i'm alois rosario from pingskills
Chevy<00:00:03.510> from<00:00:03.780> Spain<00:00:04.259> has<00:00:04.529> asked<00:00:04.830> us<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> question

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
Chevy from Spain has asked us a question

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.210 
Chevy from Spain has asked us a question
about<00:00:05.819> Patrick<00:00:06.720> Francisco's<00:00:07.440> reverse

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
about Patrick Francisco's reverse

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.360 
about Patrick Francisco's reverse
pendulum<00:00:08.849> serve<00:00:09.269> into<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> shoe<00:00:10.590> looks

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
pendulum serve into a shoe looks

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
pendulum serve into a shoe looks
something<00:00:11.610> like<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.730> Chevy<00:00:18.000> wanted<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
something like this so Chevy wanted to

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.630 
something like this so Chevy wanted to
know<00:00:18.510> how<00:00:18.960> Patrick<00:00:19.650> gets<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.010> ball<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.430> curve

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
know how Patrick gets that ball to curve

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.840 
know how Patrick gets that ball to curve
so<00:00:21.029> much<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:22.199> table<00:00:22.650> well<00:00:23.430> one<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so much on the table well one of the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.630 
so much on the table well one of the
secrets<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.560> too<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:26.039> forward

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
secrets is to not have too much forward

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
secrets is to not have too much forward
momentum<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.330> hit<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> ball<00:00:27.689> fast<00:00:28.160> even

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
momentum if you hit the ball fast even

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
momentum if you hit the ball fast even
if<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> balls<00:00:29.550> spinning<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.300> fast<00:00:30.480> it's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
if the balls spinning really fast it's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.850 
if the balls spinning really fast it's
still<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.130> to<00:00:32.250> turn<00:00:32.610> quickly<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
still not going to turn quickly so the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.250 
still not going to turn quickly so the
first<00:00:35.100> secret<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.940> hit<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> ball<00:00:36.570> quite

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
first secret is to hit the ball quite

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.910 
first secret is to hit the ball quite
slowly<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.610> forward<00:00:38.910> momentum<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:40.440> second

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
slowly with forward momentum the second

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
slowly with forward momentum the second
really<00:00:41.309> important<00:00:41.910> part<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.570> brush<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
really important part is to brush the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
really important part is to brush the
ball<00:00:43.649> on<00:00:43.890> contact<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.180> needs<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> be<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
ball on contact so it needs to be a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.040 
ball on contact so it needs to be a
really<00:00:46.110> nice<00:00:46.289> fine<00:00:47.149> brushing<00:00:48.149> contact<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
really nice fine brushing contact to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
really nice fine brushing contact to
generate<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.770> lot<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> spin<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.539> need<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
generate a lot of spin so you do need a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.010 
generate a lot of spin so you do need a
lot<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.320> spin<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.460> need<00:00:53.670> less<00:00:54.420> forward

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
lot of spin and you need less forward

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.650 
lot of spin and you need less forward
momentum<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.969> ball<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
momentum and then the ball is going to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.560 
momentum and then the ball is going to
really<00:00:57.930> start<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> curve<00:00:58.770> around<00:00:59.420> the<00:01:00.420> other

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
really start to curve around the other

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.660 
really start to curve around the other
thing<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:00.870> Patrick<00:01:01.770> does<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.219> he<00:01:02.340> puts<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
thing that Patrick does is he puts a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.329 
thing that Patrick does is he puts a
little<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:03.500> backspin<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.559> sidespin<00:01:04.739> on

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
little bit of backspin and sidespin on

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
little bit of backspin and sidespin on
the<00:01:05.460> ball<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.880> by<00:01:06.570> putting<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> little<00:01:07.020> bit<00:01:07.260> more

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the ball so by putting a little bit more

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.890 
the ball so by putting a little bit more
backspin<00:01:08.100> again<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.909> ball<00:01:09.119> is<00:01:09.240> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> stop

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
backspin again the ball is going to stop

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.020 
backspin again the ball is going to stop
quicker<00:01:10.260> it's<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> go<00:01:11.340> off<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.909> end

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
quicker it's not going to go off the end

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.120 
quicker it's not going to go off the end
of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> table<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.110> going<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.439> turn<00:01:14.070> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
of the table and it's going to turn a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.780 
of the table and it's going to turn a
bit<00:01:14.810> quickly<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> that's<00:01:16.740> how<00:01:17.009> he<00:01:17.070> gets<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
bit quickly and that's how he gets it to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.990 
bit quickly and that's how he gets it to
go

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
go

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.170 
go
towards<00:01:18.750> his<00:01:18.930> shoe<00:01:19.490> okay<00:01:20.490> once<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:20.939> was<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
towards his shoe okay once that was a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
towards his shoe okay once that was a
great<00:01:21.390> explanation

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
great explanation

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.350 
great explanation
one<00:01:22.830> thing<00:01:23.040> was<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.610> unclear<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
one thing was a little unclear about is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
one thing was a little unclear about is
you<00:01:24.750> said<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.110> don't<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.430> don't<00:01:26.549> want

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you said you don't want a you don't want

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.850 
you said you don't want a you don't want
a<00:01:26.700> lot<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.820> forward<00:01:27.240> momentum<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.619> still

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
a lot of forward momentum but you still

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.609 
a lot of forward momentum but you still
need<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> lot<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.430> spin<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.320> still<00:01:31.380> need

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
need a lot of spin so do you still need

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.590 
need a lot of spin so do you still need
to<00:01:31.740> swing<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.070> bat<00:01:32.310> fast<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:33.150> not<00:01:33.360> get

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
to swing your bat fast that not get

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.230 
to swing your bat fast that not get
forward<00:01:34.049> momentum<00:01:34.259> yeah<00:01:35.100> those<00:01:35.640> two<00:01:35.880> yeah

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
forward momentum yeah those two yeah

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
forward momentum yeah those two yeah
it's<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.320> difficult<00:01:37.500> thing<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.130> that's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
it's a really difficult thing and that's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730 
it's a really difficult thing and that's
what<00:01:38.700> makes<00:01:38.939> serving<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.570> difficult<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.350> what

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
what makes serving so difficult so what

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.170 
what makes serving so difficult so what
you<00:01:40.920> are<00:01:40.950> trying<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.490> do<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:41.880> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
you are trying to do is you're going to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.870 
you are trying to do is you're going to
get<00:01:42.329> your<00:01:42.570> bat<00:01:42.750> moving<00:01:43.049> really<00:01:43.860> fast<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.579> fast

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
get your bat moving really fast as fast

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.230 
get your bat moving really fast as fast
as<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:46.110> by<00:01:46.680> getting<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.579> fine

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
as you can but by getting a really fine

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.980 
as you can but by getting a really fine
contact<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.680> ball<00:01:49.920> doesn't<00:01:50.220> go<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.689> fast

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
contact the ball doesn't go so fast

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
contact the ball doesn't go so fast
forward<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.790> flat

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
forward so if I get a really flat

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.420 
forward so if I get a really flat
contact<00:01:54.810> then<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.619> ball<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> go

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
contact then the ball is going to go

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.380 
contact then the ball is going to go
