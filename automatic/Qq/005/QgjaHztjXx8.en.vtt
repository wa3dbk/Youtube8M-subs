science earth science logic and

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.170 
science earth science logic and
reasoning<00:00:47.079> so<00:00:47.860> we're<00:00:48.160> going<00:00:48.280> to<00:00:48.340> go<00:00:48.520> ahead<00:00:48.700> and

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
reasoning so we're going to go ahead and

open up the sleepster GS Explorer and

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.389 
open up the sleepster GS Explorer and
see<00:00:52.870> how<00:00:53.110> this<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.500> different<00:00:53.710> from<00:00:54.220> the

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
see how this is different from the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.190 
see how this is different from the
Leapster<00:00:54.730> Explorer<00:00:55.239> all<00:00:55.450> right<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:55.899> we<00:00:56.020> took

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
Leapster Explorer all right so we took

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.229 
Leapster Explorer all right so we took
the<00:00:56.380> Leapster<00:00:56.739> GS<00:00:57.160> Explorer<00:00:57.730> out<00:00:57.940> of<00:00:58.149> the

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
the Leapster GS Explorer out of the

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.440 
the Leapster GS Explorer out of the
package<00:00:58.750> and<00:00:59.170> you<00:01:00.070> can<00:01:00.250> see<00:01:00.489> it<00:01:00.760> has<00:01:00.969> a<00:01:01.000> slimmer

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
package and you can see it has a slimmer

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.990 
package and you can see it has a slimmer
body<00:01:01.750> design<00:01:02.230> so<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.980> is<00:01:03.129> really<00:01:03.370> really

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
body design so this is really really

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.139 
body design so this is really really
nice<00:01:04.239> sleek<00:01:04.659> design<00:01:05.219> on<00:01:06.219> the<00:01:06.430> bottom<00:01:06.610> of<00:01:07.030> the

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
nice sleek design on the bottom of the

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.660

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
GS Explorer we have the cartridge and

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.529 
GS Explorer we have the cartridge and
the<00:01:10.630> stylus<00:01:11.439> right<00:01:11.770> here<00:01:12.039> and<00:01:12.340> if<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.359> recall

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
the stylus right here and if you recall

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.899 
the stylus right here and if you recall
on<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.560> Leapster<00:01:14.889> Explorer<00:01:15.369> they<00:01:15.639> were<00:01:15.700> on

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
on the Leapster Explorer they were on

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.800 
on the Leapster Explorer they were on
the<00:01:16.060> top<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:17.439> that's<00:01:17.619> different<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
the top so that's different the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.739 
the top so that's different the
difference<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.560> that<00:01:21.039> the<00:01:21.850> Leapster<00:01:22.209> GS

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
difference is that the Leapster GS

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.410 
difference is that the Leapster GS
Explorer<00:01:23.439> has<00:01:24.130> it<00:01:24.369> well<00:01:24.579> first<00:01:24.969> of<00:01:25.119> all<00:01:25.149> it<00:01:25.270> has

Explorer has it well first of all it has

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.840 
Explorer has it well first of all it has
a<00:01:25.450> built<00:01:25.749> in<00:01:25.899> motion<00:01:26.380> sensor<00:01:26.889> plus<00:01:27.340> camera<00:01:27.759> and

and it has four times the internal
memory<00:01:35.139> which<00:01:35.829> is<00:01:35.859> two<00:01:36.159> gigabytes<00:01:36.639> worth<00:01:36.849> of

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:37.029 
memory which is two gigabytes worth of

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.679 
memory which is two gigabytes worth of
memory<00:01:37.329> and<00:01:37.630> you'll<00:01:37.779> see<00:01:37.959> the<00:01:38.079> back<00:01:38.229> here<00:01:38.619> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
memory and you'll see the back here to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.300 
memory and you'll see the back here to
that<00:01:40.689> that<00:01:41.079> right<00:01:41.259> there<00:01:41.469> that's<00:01:41.649> where<00:01:42.009> they

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
that that right there that's where they

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.059 
that that right there that's where they
do<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.609> video<00:01:43.799> camera<00:01:44.829> and<00:01:45.749> so<00:01:46.749> I<00:01:47.349> turn<00:01:47.919> it<00:01:48.009> on

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
do the video camera and so I turn it on

00:01:48.069 --> 00:02:05.310 
do the video camera and so I turn it on
real<00:01:48.310> quick<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.630> has<00:01:49.779> really<00:01:49.990> good<00:01:50.169> sound<00:01:50.560> too

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.919 

and<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:07.520> this<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:07.940> screen<00:02:08.300> where<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.660> kids

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
and so this is the screen where the kids

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.719 
and so this is the screen where the kids
will<00:02:09.110> set<00:02:09.410> up<00:02:09.500> their<00:02:09.709> names<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.399> their

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
will set up their names and their

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.860 
will set up their names and their
pictures<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.800> they<00:02:12.800> go<00:02:12.980> from<00:02:13.280> there<00:02:13.490> so<00:02:14.209> we

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
pictures and they go from there so we

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.960 
pictures and they go from there so we
are<00:02:15.050> definitely<00:02:15.230> going<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:16.010> trying<00:02:16.310> out<00:02:16.580> to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
are definitely going to be trying out to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.449 
are definitely going to be trying out to
these<00:02:17.180> games<00:02:18.610> challenge<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:21.590> will<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.100> video

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
these games challenge we will do a video

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.000 
these games challenge we will do a video
of<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.730> as<00:02:22.880> well<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.590> go<00:02:24.770> there's
