so<00:00:36.930> first<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.500> need<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> do<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.980> go<00:00:38.129> down

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
so first what you need to do is go down

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
so first what you need to do is go down
here<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.640> make<00:00:38.910> sure<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.420> profiler<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
here and make sure that your profiler is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
here and make sure that your profiler is
open<00:00:40.410> or<00:00:40.590> yeah<00:00:41.520> profile<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> little

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
open or yeah profile is a little

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450 
open or yeah profile is a little
throttle<00:00:42.570> icon<00:00:42.989> they<00:00:43.320> should<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.190> set<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
throttle icon they should be set to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.450 
throttle icon they should be set to
start<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:47.899> with<00:00:48.899> windows<00:00:49.379> startup<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.250> not

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
start up with windows startup but if not

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.000 
start up with windows startup but if not
you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.449> over<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.079> type<00:00:52.770> in

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
you can go over here and type in

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.740 
you can go over here and type in
profiler<00:00:54.949> and<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.579> should<00:00:56.789> pull<00:00:57.059> up<00:00:57.090> something

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
profiler and it should pull up something

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.740 
profiler and it should pull up something
looks<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.469> joystick<00:00:59.359> but<00:01:00.359> since<00:01:00.660> I

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
looks like a joystick but since I

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to be open at all times so now over here

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880 
to be open at all times so now over here
in<00:01:12.060> flight<00:01:12.420> simulator<00:01:12.869> us<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.830> to

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
in flight simulator us you go to

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.149 
in flight simulator us you go to
settings<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:15.780> can't<00:01:16.229> move<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.770> for<00:01:17.009> some

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
settings and I can't move this for some

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.030 
settings and I can't move this for some
reason<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.520> go<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> settings<00:01:18.000> controls

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
to recap you could open the profiler go

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.500 
to recap you could open the profiler go
over<00:02:28.939> here<00:02:29.329> right<00:02:29.719> click<00:02:29.930> control<00:02:30.439> panel<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
over here right click control panel and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.300 
over here right click control panel and
keep<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.750> open<00:02:32.989> for<00:02:33.170> as<00:02:33.650> long<00:02:34.069> as<00:02:34.129> you're

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310

going<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.459> be<00:02:34.519> using<00:02:34.670> your<00:02:34.849> flight<00:02:35.090> simulator

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
going to be using your flight simulator

I<00:02:35.569> usually<00:02:35.900> just<00:02:36.049> try<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.260> move<00:02:36.379> it<00:02:36.500> out<00:02:36.590> of

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
I usually just try to move it out of

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.179 
I usually just try to move it out of
sight<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:36.980> out<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.069> mind<00:02:38.859> sometimes<00:02:39.859> it<00:02:40.010> works

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:40.189 
sight and out of mind sometimes it works

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:41.740 
sight and out of mind sometimes it works
sometimes<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.669> doesn't

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
sometimes it doesn't

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.490 
sometimes it doesn't

to which functionality had previously
been<00:02:55.819> erased<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:58.239> how<00:02:59.239> you<00:02:59.299> get<00:02:59.510> your<00:02:59.689> clutch
