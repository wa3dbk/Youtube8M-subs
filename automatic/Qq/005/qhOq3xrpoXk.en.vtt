and<00:02:12.530> what<00:02:12.890> I've<00:02:12.980> looked<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.400> manufacturing

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and what I've looked for manufacturing

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.390 
and what I've looked for manufacturing
is<00:02:14.299> that<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.840> factories<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:15.500> dirty<00:02:15.860> and

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
is that the factories and dirty and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.819 
is that the factories and dirty and
people<00:02:17.239> do<00:02:17.420> get<00:02:17.630> well-paid<00:02:17.870> whereas<00:02:18.620> you

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
people do get well-paid whereas you

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.150 
people do get well-paid whereas you
would<00:02:19.010> usually<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.560> horrible

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
would usually think that it the horrible

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.039 
would usually think that it the horrible
and<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.519> get<00:02:22.670> forced<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.150> do<00:02:23.329> things<00:02:23.359> and

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
and you get forced to do things and

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.319 
and you get forced to do things and
people<00:02:24.470> just<00:02:24.799> get<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.130> wrong<00:02:25.280> impression<00:02:25.329> so

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
people just get the wrong impression so

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.509 
people just get the wrong impression so

I actually is what I've learned about

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.180 
I actually is what I've learned about
manufacturing<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.859> not<00:02:31.010> all<00:02:31.160> doom

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
manufacturing is that it's not all doom
