00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 all our doubts about it avis 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.309
 will be resolved because it is already in the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.380
 scenario so it's going to sing how it 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.330
 is going to dress that is going to be that they are going to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.040
 say the judges we do not know he is 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.570
 presents for the first time in this 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.470
 stage and not like its time and everything 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.470
 like him 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.779
 and his songs hopefully you go pretty 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.450
 perfect, we have to wish him 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.579
 the same thing I say to myself I hope you 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.469
 go nice this was the first 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.530
 presentation of I had here in the 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.200
 academia and hopefully hopefully I saw that you go 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.809
 nice with these critics that I have here 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.789
 at recess so it starts with you 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.410
 you go to him yes I will give him the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.600
 opportunity because his first concert and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.180
 the truth to make your first concert 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.180
 and you know it's true 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.379
 no more here that you make your decision 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.009
 but not 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.009
 button 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.880
 as if you do not tell me this and then how 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.020
 we're going to do it I do not know but what do you think 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.240
 If I have the perfect palette in green I 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.350
 I know and I hope someone is very 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.390
 happy because there was action there was 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.569
 interpretation in the national to all and 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.149
 honored father because he has like you 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:39.770
 your biggest plus more than rancher 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.750
 then the song was painted but 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.810
 moan how you saw it 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:52.789
 I think he lacked tuning and I think 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:58.220
 who lacks more charisma and how to do 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:01.750
 well as we could face charisma is 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.750
 the child has that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.330
 yes i would like you to be put 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.160
 a pop challenge hear to see ok I'm from 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.020
 according to a challenge of the road but as 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.380
 says sebas is also his first 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.489
 concert then there that also then 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.790
 the opportunity I would like that ended up 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.750
 it's already happened 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.760
 but good I saw it went very well 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.230
 then he is with us of course 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.270
 at the next concert here at the 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.620
 playtime 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.240
 and thank God we are doing everything 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.420
 facing nothing the easygoing 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.650
 despite the toy he knows I 'm 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.409
 connecting as olive as 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.900
 how he was going to do that for me 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:59.879
 we have concentrated to say that what 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.430
 he does and I just hate him so very well 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.930
 I'm very excited because I myself do not 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.959
 I can believe it what he is 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.959
 doing
