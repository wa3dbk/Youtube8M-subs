00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.909
 A) Yes 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.620
 but everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.720
 trick of the week today 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.830
 let's see how to put our cpu at 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.330
 100% through the terminal 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 for that we're going to use a command 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:34.000
 what am I going to put here 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.770
 yes nul script 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.930
 this command in the terminal when you 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.170
 intro we give what he will do will be 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.340
 put one of the colors of our cpu 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.930
 to the maximum for example 1000 cpu is a and 7 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.879
 and it has 8 virtual cores then I'm going 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.370
 to have to use eight windows of 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.960
 you're one for each core 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.600
 to put it one hundred percent whole 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.920
 Lets put 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.159
 Enter in this window to see how 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.290
 affects this to the use of cpu in this 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.630
 graphic the green squares are going to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.939
 grow let's see it we give the intro 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.670
 and as we see they are growing right now 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.630
 the green squares we are going to create a 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.119
 new terminal window with n command 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.429
 we create a new window and we are going to 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.039
 put exactly the same i have it 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.630
 copied and pasted to not have to be 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.610
 all the time putting but we have 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.549
 write exactly the same 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.740
 we return to the intro and we see again 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.700
 as it grows 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.729
 the cpu bar 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:50.350
 and we repeat the process another six times 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:54.880
 command in the control v enter command n 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:58.869
 control v entro command n control v 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.299
 intro let's see how it goes we have 1 2 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.420
 3 4 and 5 windows 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:09.450
 I have 3 windows missing so that the CPU 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.450
 put 100% control n 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.660
 and me 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.349
 ok we just put the eight windows 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.760
 and now the fans are 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.709
 working and increasingly listen more 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.519
 because this is because the CPU is at 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.519
 one hundred by one hundred 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.270
 what happens that the cpu gets very hot and 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.450
 then the fans start to 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.910
 sound pretty 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.550
 otherwise my machine seems to be 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.750
 it behaves quite well to this rise 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.700
 sudden cpu 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.680
 and it seems that everything else works with 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.280
 normality if we have some 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.010
 problem in the computer because we 're going to 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.250
 can see using this test so 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.990
 say it to see how it behaves 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.300
 through extreme situations of the 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.820
 saler acpu as you can see is all 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.070
 the green squares and now we're going to 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.220
 do one thing that is going to be closing the 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.200
 terminal 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.630
 we are in terminal we are going to give you the 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.020
 cool command to do it and warns us 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.390
 this window as we have eight processes 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.840
 open we are going to finish the all 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.840
 and suddenly 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.200
 the oil of euros at 0% 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.140
 the fans will start to shut up 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.990
 and we will have our computer 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.120
 working normally 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.640
 so here's the video today 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.950
 I hope that it has served you if it has 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.890
 liked to like to comment 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.810
 share it and see you in the next 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.710
 video do not forget to follow them in a 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.710
 dotcom presence
