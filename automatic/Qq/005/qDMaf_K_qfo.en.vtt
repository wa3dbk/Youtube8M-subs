00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
and let's just drop down to the ground

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.280 
and let's just drop down to the ground
and<00:02:53.920> see<00:02:54.099> some<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.610> graphics<00:02:55.569> on<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.900> road

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.990 

okay<00:03:02.290> so<00:03:02.530> if<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.920> run<00:03:03.100> quite<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.430> bit<00:03:03.610> spy<00:03:03.819> mine

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
okay so if you run quite a bit spy mine

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.650 
okay so if you run quite a bit spy mine
starts<00:03:04.270> superspeeding<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.530> running<00:03:05.770> and

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
starts superspeeding and running and

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.150 
starts superspeeding and running and
yeah<00:03:07.660> everything<00:03:08.260> seems<00:03:08.470> to<00:03:08.590> be<00:03:08.650> working

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
yeah everything seems to be working

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.040 
yeah everything seems to be working
quite<00:03:09.190> well<00:03:09.450> there's<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.630> little<00:03:10.900> bit<00:03:11.020> of

quite well there's a little bit of

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.930 
quite well there's a little bit of
dropping<00:03:11.380> frames<00:03:11.590> right<00:03:12.010> there<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.790> that's

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
dropping frames right there but that's

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.340 
dropping frames right there but that's
being<00:03:13.239> really<00:03:13.540> picking<00:03:13.810> hair<00:03:13.989> something<00:03:14.260> is

worked<00:04:03.700> very<00:04:03.880> very<00:04:03.910> well<00:04:04.090> I'm<00:04:04.690> not<00:04:05.170> sure<00:04:05.380> how

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
worked very very well I'm not sure how

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.620 
worked very very well I'm not sure how
would<00:04:05.650> work<00:04:05.769> on<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.130> though<00:04:06.340> however<00:04:06.730> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
would work on this though however the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.229 
would work on this though however the
reason<00:04:07.840> I'm<00:04:07.900> not<00:04:07.930> sure<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.500> because<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:08.859> did<00:04:09.459> try

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
reason I'm not sure is because I did try

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.849 
reason I'm not sure is because I did try
connecting<00:04:10.450> my<00:04:10.660> 360<00:04:11.109> controller<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.530> this<00:04:11.620> but

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
connecting my 360 controller to this but

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
you know use the touch screen such as

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.989 
you know use the touch screen such as
Lego<00:04:59.590> bat

this<00:06:01.589> kind<00:06:01.709> of<00:06:01.829> game<00:06:01.889> is<00:06:02.099> not<00:06:02.249> ideal<00:06:02.849> by<00:06:03.239> any

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449 
this kind of game is not ideal by any

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.179 
this kind of game is not ideal by any
means<00:06:03.719> is<00:06:03.899> much<00:06:04.529> better<00:06:04.860> if<00:06:05.009> you<00:06:05.069> actually

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:05.189 
means is much better if you actually

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.489 
means is much better if you actually
just<00:06:05.339> hook<00:06:05.550> up<00:06:05.639> a<00:06:05.759> controller<00:06:06.179> to<00:06:06.300> it<00:06:06.599> okay<00:06:07.439> so

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:07.499 
just hook up a controller to it okay so

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:11.959 
just hook up a controller to it okay so
let's<00:06:07.860> just<00:06:08.689> launch<00:06:10.429> now<00:06:11.429> let's<00:06:11.699> just<00:06:11.789> skip

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
screen but the game performs very much

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.659 
screen but the game performs very much
better<00:07:10.800> if<00:07:10.889> you're<00:07:10.979> near<00:07:11.219> your<00:07:11.400> internet

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
better if you're near your internet

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.670 
better if you're near your internet
connection<00:07:11.879> obviously<00:07:12.150> but<00:07:13.110> the<00:07:13.349> game<00:07:13.500> will

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
connection obviously but the game will

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.200 
connection obviously but the game will
also<00:07:13.830> feel<00:07:14.250> up<00:07:14.430> there<00:07:14.460> if<00:07:14.699> you<00:07:14.729> use<00:07:14.879> actual

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
also feel up there if you use actual

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.990 
also feel up there if you use actual
controls<00:07:15.690> so<00:07:16.409> you've<00:07:17.370> got<00:07:17.490> the<00:07:17.580> idea<00:07:17.849> that<00:07:17.879> you

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 
controls so you've got the idea that you

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600 
controls so you've got the idea that you
can<00:07:18.210> play<00:07:18.509> some<00:07:18.780> games<00:07:19.590> that<00:07:19.770> actually<00:07:19.800> have

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
can play some games that actually have

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:21.980 
can play some games that actually have
been<00:07:20.849> configured<00:07:21.150> for<00:07:21.389> the<00:07:21.449> touchscreen<00:07:21.719> such

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 
as la noir as well which is probably the

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.510 
as la noir as well which is probably the
best<00:07:24.120> one<00:07:24.300> to<00:07:24.539> choose<00:07:24.830> but<00:07:25.830> as<00:07:26.129> you<00:07:26.310> saw<00:07:26.490> that

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
best one to choose but as you saw that

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.230
