the next one i blanch i'll show you when
the<00:02:10.700> plant<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.360> mature<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.830> can't<00:02:13.100> use

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the plant is more mature you can't use

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.340 
the plant is more mature you can't use
this<00:02:13.550> because<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.850> has<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:15.490> part<00:02:16.490> of<00:02:16.610> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
this because it has the part of the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.470 
this because it has the part of the
blossom<00:02:18.350> of<00:02:18.440> flour<00:02:18.800> little<00:02:19.520> purple<00:02:20.060> part<00:02:20.330> of

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
blossom of flour little purple part of

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.340 
blossom of flour little purple part of
it<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:22.040> it's<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.400> edible<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.810> like<00:02:23.959> fuzzy

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
it and it's not edible it's like fuzzy

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.540 
it and it's not edible it's like fuzzy
stuff<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.810> don't<00:02:26.840> take<00:02:27.260> off<00:02:27.440> this<00:02:27.620> damn<00:02:27.890> for

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
stuff so don't take off this damn for

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:39.020 
stuff so don't take off this damn for
round<00:02:28.880> it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.280 

take<00:02:40.030> off<00:02:40.240> our<00:02:40.980> skin<00:02:41.980> is<00:02:42.250> edible<00:02:42.730> too<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:44.200> is

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
take off our skin is edible too this is

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.400 
take off our skin is edible too this is
a<00:02:44.319> different<00:02:44.620> way<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.740> cook<00:02:45.430> clean<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.410> cioffi

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
a different way to cook clean it cioffi

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:54.330 
a different way to cook clean it cioffi
in<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.590> back<00:02:47.770> with<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.400> mirror<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
in the back with the mirror that's the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.800 
in the back with the mirror that's the
third<00:02:54.580> way<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.850> could<00:02:55.090> do<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.330> take<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.630> whole

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
third way you could do it take the whole

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.410 
third way you could do it take the whole
thing<00:02:55.840> put<00:02:56.350> it<00:02:56.440> in<00:02:56.560> boiling<00:02:56.770> water<00:02:57.420> just

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
thing put it in boiling water just

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.070 
thing put it in boiling water just
blanching<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.220> or<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.280> steamer<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.480> then<00:03:01.840> yeah

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
blanching and or a steamer and then yeah

blanching and or a steamer and then yeah
leave<00:03:02.350> by<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.620> way<00:03:02.739> if<00:03:02.830> you<00:03:02.920> pull<00:03:03.130> off<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
leave by the way if you pull off the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.520 
leave by the way if you pull off the
leap<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:03.910> as<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.390> bite<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.840> depart<00:03:05.200> them<00:03:05.410> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
leap and as you bite it depart them to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.360 
leap and as you bite it depart them to

no good reason why men and should be in

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:20.099 
no good reason why men and should be in
my<00:04:06.250> heart<00:04:06.400> is<00:04:06.549> okay<00:04:06.880> okay<00:04:17.220> yeah<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.970> what<00:04:19.930> man

is and it has

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.350 
is and it has
sits<00:04:21.970> too<00:04:22.150> long<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.630> separate<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:24.460> idea<00:04:24.790> you

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
sits too long to separate the idea you

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.300 
sits too long to separate the idea you
can<00:04:25.570> use<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:26.080> whole<00:04:26.290> pretty<00:04:26.950> much<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:27.280> whole

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
can use the whole pretty much the whole

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.940 
can use the whole pretty much the whole
thing<00:04:28.230> there<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:30.280> we'll<00:04:30.580> have<00:04:30.670> that
