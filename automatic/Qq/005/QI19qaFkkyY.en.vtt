00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.320
 hello I 'm simonis bench press 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.459
 yes one of the round exercises in weight training 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.200
 apparently the willing one of the 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.820
 most important exercises in my opinion 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.389
 one of the simplest and one of the simplest 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.860
 exercises 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.539
 the sticking point with the whole is of course 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.410
 the technique and therefore the exercise can 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:19.939
 the for the 1 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.560
 the easiest part of the 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.490
 another one of the exercises are those 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.109
 they do not come at all clear 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.490
 where the shoulder joints ruin 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.599
 I'll show you the whole time there is 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.800
 namely a mistake of always 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.179
 basically it is always 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.619
 is done and then I get like that 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.880
 an email like me is doing that now 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.320
 Shoulder like I'm doing the third 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.649
 bench press and something is right there 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.820
 Not 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.230
 and the trainers in the gyms 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.760
 locally they are usually so halfway 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.050
 competent to see the competence and 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.160
 still do not know quite how to do that 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.199
 Bench press right now 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.090
 so here's the most made mistake 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.500
 at the bench press and exactly that should 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.059
 Avoid it in any case if you 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.920
 Saddle up what I want right now 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.270
 At the beginning you say you will 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.890
 need to switch back for the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.510
 first few days on the first two 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.800
 weeks around then again one step higher 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.239
 So to be able to weigh the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.859
 only a bit down then you will 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.510
 remember buy relatively strong 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.070
 beyond what the current ones 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.140
 could handle banknotes so you 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.489
 of course, take the same action 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.530
 attack distance I have everything before 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.590
 explain and then a whole now 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.150
 important point you pull your shoulders 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.880
 together yes that's the essential 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.100
 point and exactly the moment is theirs 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.390
 hollow-bottomed shoulder blades contract 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.390
 make high cross 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.020
 he only said such a small one 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.480
 his viewpoint 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.980
 that is exactly the essential point 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.240
 at the moment where you stand in the bar 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.130
 grab the shoulder blades 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.780
 contract and definitely not 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.010
 lying there with the straight shoulder belt 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.570
 that is exactly the fault of always 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.260
 is done again write this 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.150
 behind the ears 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.220
 It is therefore the breast when pressing the bank 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.810
 to put out light hollow cross and 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.070
 the essential and that is the most 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.870
 made mistakes that the 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.760
 shoulder blades not pulled together 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.710
 but with straight 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.200
 shoulder belt performed this exercise 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.850
 the shoulder will be the shoulder joint 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.470
 thinks, however, very sensitive so 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.729
 if your joints think so 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.740
 Exercise always correct and then 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.360
 it will also be something with the games we see 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.360
 race us in the next video pod
