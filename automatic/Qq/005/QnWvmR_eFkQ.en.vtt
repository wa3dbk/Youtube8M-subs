because<00:02:47.150> last<00:02:48.150> time<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.870> replacement<00:02:49.410> panel

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
because last time the replacement panel

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.699 
because last time the replacement panel
came<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> ball<00:02:50.790> right<00:02:50.970> here<00:02:51.319> then<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.349> cut

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
came to a ball right here then I cut

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.680 
came to a ball right here then I cut
that<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.099> off<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.610> then<00:02:54.000> put<00:02:54.269> this<00:02:54.510> one

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
that one off and then put this one

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.289 
that one off and then put this one
overage<00:02:55.049> and<00:02:57.799> then<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.890> panel<00:02:59.220> didn't<00:03:00.060> quite

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
overage and then the panel didn't quite

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.380 
overage and then the panel didn't quite
come<00:03:00.680> all<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.920> way<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.430> door<00:03:02.700> here<00:03:02.970> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
come all the way out to the door here so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.569 
come all the way out to the door here so
I<00:03:03.860> put<00:03:04.860> a<00:03:04.890> strip<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:05.760> steel<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.209> here<00:03:06.569> and<00:03:07.579> put

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
I put a strip of steel in here and put

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.390 
I put a strip of steel in here and put
Kitty<00:03:08.819> hair<00:03:09.030> over<00:03:09.269> it<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.750> meet<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.250> meets

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
Kitty hair over it to meet so it meets

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.020 
Kitty hair over it to meet so it meets
up<00:03:11.640> there<00:03:11.849> now<00:03:12.019> not<00:03:13.019> much<00:03:13.170> different<00:03:13.590> inside

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
up there now not much different inside

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:25.250 
up there now not much different inside
still<00:03:15.030> all<00:03:15.239> taken<00:03:15.600> apart

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.229 

wasn't<00:03:26.010> too<00:03:26.099> much<00:03:26.220> wrong<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.760> door<00:03:26.970> here

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
wasn't too much wrong with the door here

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.759 
wasn't too much wrong with the door here
other<00:03:27.510> than<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:29.670> do<00:03:29.939> another<00:03:30.500> hatch<00:03:31.500> down

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
other than I just do another hatch down

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.589 
other than I just do another hatch down
in<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.010> corner<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.459> like<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:33.030> passenger

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
in that corner just like the passenger

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.550 
in that corner just like the passenger
side<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:35.629> only<00:03:36.629> rest<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:36.989> really<00:03:37.170> found<00:03:37.349> in

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
side the only rest have really found in

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.009 
side the only rest have really found in
this<00:03:37.620> car<00:03:37.920> is<00:03:38.250> inside<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.939> doors<00:03:39.180> because<00:03:39.750> it

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
this car is inside the doors because it

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.930 
this car is inside the doors because it
actually<00:03:40.260> came<00:03:40.680> from<00:03:40.709> Arizona<00:03:41.400> some<00:03:41.760> time

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
actually came from Arizona some time

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.970 
actually came from Arizona some time
back<00:03:42.150> again<00:03:42.569> so<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:44.370> not<00:03:44.549> too<00:03:44.730> bad<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.769> got

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
back again so it's not too bad so I got

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.479 
back again so it's not too bad so I got
a<00:03:47.010> new<00:03:47.190> hood<00:03:47.519> because<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.540> old<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:49.280> was<00:03:50.280> all

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
a new hood because the old one was all

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.130 
a new hood because the old one was all
full<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:50.970> filler<00:03:51.209> and<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.810> actually<00:03:52.019> tried<00:03:52.560> to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
full of filler and I actually tried to

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.210 
full of filler and I actually tried to
try<00:03:55.140> to<00:03:55.200> replace<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.680> filler<00:03:55.859> with<00:03:56.040> some

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
try to replace the filler with some

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.369 
try to replace the filler with some
Kitty<00:03:56.489> hair<00:03:58.010> but<00:03:59.840> didn't<00:04:00.840> quite<00:04:00.989> work<00:04:01.140> out

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
Kitty hair but didn't quite work out

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.190 
Kitty hair but didn't quite work out
because<00:04:01.760> that<00:04:02.760> was<00:04:02.909> a<00:04:02.940> high<00:04:03.180> spot<00:04:03.480> kept<00:04:03.870> coming

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
because that was a high spot kept coming

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.509 
because that was a high spot kept coming
up<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.609> I<00:04:05.609> decided<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.269> didn't<00:04:06.510> want<00:04:06.659> me<00:04:06.900> to

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
up and I decided I didn't want me to

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.000 
up and I decided I didn't want me to
kind<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.609> fill<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.879> or<00:04:08.940> anything<00:04:09.120> in<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.480> hood

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
kind of fill it or anything in the hood

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.050 
kind of fill it or anything in the hood
and<00:04:11.010> risk<00:04:11.280> having<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.700> come<00:04:11.879> off<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.810> just

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
and risk having it come off so I just

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.500 
and risk having it come off so I just
got<00:04:15.060> another<00:04:15.239> one<00:04:16.760> I'm<00:04:17.760> also<00:04:17.880> waiting<00:04:18.180> on<00:04:18.479> a

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
got another one I'm also waiting on a

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.779 
got another one I'm also waiting on a
new<00:04:18.660> fender<00:04:19.199> and<00:04:22.280> that's<00:04:23.280> what<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.520> front

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
new fender and that's what the front

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.600 
new fender and that's what the front
looks<00:04:23.940> like<00:04:24.120> right<00:04:24.300> now

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
looks like right now

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.640 
looks like right now
just<00:04:26.610> what<00:04:26.880> every<00:04:26.910> just<00:04:27.870> what<00:04:28.050> every<00:04:28.289> corner

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
just what every just what every corner

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.180 
just what every just what every corner
in<00:04:28.740> this<00:04:28.830> car<00:04:29.070> has<00:04:29.190> been<00:04:29.310> hit<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.760> think

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.670 

you<00:04:33.730> can<00:04:33.880> tell<00:04:34.090> on<00:04:34.210> this<00:04:34.300> side<00:04:34.680> that's

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
you can tell on this side that's

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.580 
you can tell on this side that's
straight

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
straight

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.550 
straight
that's<00:04:38.590> all<00:04:38.800> twisted<00:04:39.640> I<00:04:39.780> started<00:04:40.780> started

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
that's all twisted I started started

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.240 
that's all twisted I started started
stripping<00:04:41.920> these<00:04:42.250> pieces<00:04:42.550> with<00:04:44.250> chemical

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
stripping these pieces with chemical

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.790 
stripping these pieces with chemical
stripper<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:45.790> I<00:04:45.880> found<00:04:46.150> that<00:04:46.620> it's<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.680> lot

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
stripper and I found that it's a lot

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.790 
stripper and I found that it's a lot
easier<00:04:48.160> than<00:04:48.280> standing<00:04:50.220> balance<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.590> my

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
easier than standing balance and my

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.310 
easier than standing balance and my
relatively<00:04:54.730> new<00:04:55.000> bumpers<00:04:57.480> there's<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.750> trunk

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
relatively new bumpers there's the trunk

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.480 
relatively new bumpers there's the trunk
floor<00:04:59.470> piece<00:04:59.830> there<00:05:00.130> which<00:05:00.310> I've

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
floor piece there which I've

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.700 
floor piece there which I've
cannibalized<00:05:01.150> cut<00:05:01.690> quite<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:01.990> few<00:05:02.170> patches<00:05:02.410> out

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
cannibalized cut quite a few patches out

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:09.870 
cannibalized cut quite a few patches out
of<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:02.920> and<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:05.050> old<00:05:05.200> valence<00:05:08.640> cut<00:05:09.640> hid

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
of it and the old valence cut hid

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.150 
of it and the old valence cut hid
somewhere<00:05:10.300> like<00:05:10.450> right<00:05:10.660> there<00:05:11.070> there's<00:05:12.070> the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
somewhere like right there there's the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.270 
somewhere like right there there's the
old<00:05:12.340> fender<00:05:13.500> maybe<00:05:14.500> could<00:05:14.710> have<00:05:14.770> fixed<00:05:15.010> that

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
old fender maybe could have fixed that

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.310 
old fender maybe could have fixed that
but<00:05:16.140> kind<00:05:17.140> of<00:05:17.230> running<00:05:17.440> out<00:05:17.530> of<00:05:17.560> time<00:05:17.890> so<00:05:19.320> it's
