height<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.650> is<00:00:01.680> Kibo<00:00:02.389> so<00:00:03.389> here<00:00:03.570> is<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:03.899> super

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
height this is Kibo so here is the super

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.730 
height this is Kibo so here is the super
conversion<00:00:05.100> mochi<00:00:05.549> buckaroo<00:00:06.230> so<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.259> opened

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
conversion mochi buckaroo so I opened

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.110 
conversion mochi buckaroo so I opened
two<00:00:08.429> up<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.660> looks<00:00:09.840> like<00:00:10.099> yeah<00:00:11.120> whatever's

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
two up and it looks like yeah whatever's

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.549 
two up and it looks like yeah whatever's
on<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.420> outside<00:00:12.809> doesn't<00:00:13.080> really<00:00:13.349> reflect

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
on the outside doesn't really reflect

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.760 
on the outside doesn't really reflect
what's<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.309> inside<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:15.529> this<00:00:16.529> one

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
what's in the inside so this one

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.120 
what's in the inside so this one
actually<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.670> yellow<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.619> it's<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.920> bird

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
actually is the yellow one it's the bird

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.519 
actually is the yellow one it's the bird
or<00:00:20.400> torti<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:22.220> yeah<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:24.050> here<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
or torti I think yeah and here is the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.189 
or torti I think yeah and here is the
dragon<00:00:25.859> one<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.720> matched

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
dragon one but this one actually matched

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.459 
dragon one but this one actually matched
it<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> this<00:00:29.760> was<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> roof<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:32.489> blue<00:00:32.669> one<00:00:33.469> and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it so this was the roof the blue one and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.740 
it so this was the roof the blue one and
it<00:00:34.710> looks<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.160> one's<00:00:35.390> this<00:00:36.390> washed<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it looks like this one's this washed it

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.010 
it looks like this one's this washed it
fell<00:00:36.960> apart<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.300> these<00:00:39.300> things<00:00:39.570> come<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
fell apart and these things come with a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.000 
fell apart and these things come with a
piece<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> bubble<00:00:40.860> gum<00:00:41.750> so<00:00:42.750> let<00:00:42.870> me<00:00:42.989> try<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
piece of bubble gum so let me try and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.010 
piece of bubble gum so let me try and
see<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.250> tastes<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:48.500> tastes<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:51.020> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
see what tastes like tastes like the the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.160 
see what tastes like tastes like the the
soda<00:00:52.289> pop<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.949> know<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.719> blue

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
soda pop you know the one in the blue

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.290 
soda pop you know the one in the blue
bottle<00:00:55.460> and<00:00:56.809> it<00:00:57.809> tastes<00:00:58.020> pretty<00:00:58.140> good<00:00:59.239> okay<00:01:00.239> so

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
bottle and it tastes pretty good okay so

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:12.710 
bottle and it tastes pretty good okay so
let's<00:01:00.600> open<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.699> horse

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:30.200 

I'm<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.530> opening<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:14.040> from<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> bottom<00:01:29.210> and

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
I'm just opening up from the bottom and

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.030 
I'm just opening up from the bottom and
this<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:30.900> matches<00:01:31.440> into<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.800> black

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
this one actually matches into the black

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.270 
this one actually matches into the black
one<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.150> I'll<00:01:36.740> show<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.800> what<00:01:37.980> it<00:01:38.040> looks<00:01:38.190> like

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
one so I'll show you what it looks like

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.720 
one so I'll show you what it looks like
once<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.580> build<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:40.070> okay<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.520> thing<00:01:41.550> I<00:01:41.700> ever

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
once I build it okay so one thing I ever

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.410 
once I build it okay so one thing I ever
have<00:01:41.940> to<00:01:41.970> show<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.450> there<00:01:43.290> are<00:01:43.440> actually

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
have to show is that there are actually

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.080 
have to show is that there are actually
transformation<00:01:45.420> instructions<00:01:46.080> inside<00:01:47.090> so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
transformation instructions inside so

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:00.170 
transformation instructions inside so
let's<00:01:48.990> see

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.280 

so<00:02:01.180> each<00:02:01.420> box<00:02:01.690> would<00:02:01.990> have<00:02:02.110> these

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
so each box would have these

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.740 
so each box would have these
instructions<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.580> it's<00:02:04.390> not<00:02:04.600> like

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
instructions and it's not like

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.000 
instructions and it's not like
transformers<00:02:05.290> where<00:02:05.500> you<00:02:05.590> can<00:02:05.740> just

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
transformers where you can just

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.320 
transformers where you can just
transform<00:02:06.400> it<00:02:06.580> you<00:02:06.670> actually<00:02:06.940> have<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.150> take

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
transform it you actually have to take

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.570 
transform it you actually have to take
certain<00:02:07.480> parts<00:02:07.840> apart<00:02:08.080> in<00:02:08.950> order<00:02:09.460> to

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
certain parts apart in order to

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.010 
certain parts apart in order to
transform<00:02:10.090> it<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:13.230> I've<00:02:14.230> opened<00:02:14.410> them<00:02:14.680> all<00:02:14.830> and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
transform it so I've opened them all and

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.830 
transform it so I've opened them all and
okay<00:02:17.040> these<00:02:18.040> are<00:02:18.280> actually<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> 100<00:02:19.420> yen<00:02:19.570> each

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
okay these are actually a 100 yen each

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.940 
okay these are actually a 100 yen each
so<00:02:20.800> full<00:02:21.070> box<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.700> 2,000<00:02:22.570> yen<00:02:22.860> for<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
so full box is like 2,000 yen for the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.070 
so full box is like 2,000 yen for the
fishy<00:02:24.160> I<00:02:24.430> am<00:02:24.880> missing<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.570> white<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:25.900> which

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
white one the horse I'm missing the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.370 
white one the horse I'm missing the
white<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.300> tiger<00:02:46.570> I'm<00:02:46.930> missing<00:02:47.260> the

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.590 
white one the tiger I'm missing the
white<00:02:47.530> one<00:02:47.850> so<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:49.000> looks<00:02:49.150> like<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.450> white

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
white one so it looks like the white

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.110 
white one so it looks like the white
ones<00:02:49.870> are<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.430> more<00:02:51.790> rare<00:02:52.150> ones<00:02:52.480> maybe<00:02:54.840> so

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120

00:02:59.470 --> 00:04:12.540 
okay so the next part it's going to be
I'll<00:02:59.950> build<00:03:00.700> these<00:03:01.000> up<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.510> try<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.930> transform

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.150
