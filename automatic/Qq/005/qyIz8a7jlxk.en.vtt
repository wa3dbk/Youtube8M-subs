00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.969 
it may look familiar you were simply
going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.750> touch<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.110> start<00:01:25.380> touching<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
going to touch to start touching the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.789 
going to touch to start touching the
down<00:01:26.189> slopes<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.780> try<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.080> keep<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> from

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
down slopes and then try to keep it from

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.039 
down slopes and then try to keep it from
hitting<00:01:29.240> serio<00:01:30.240> down<00:01:30.479> slope<00:01:31.159> down<00:01:32.159> slope

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
hitting serio down slope down slope

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.440 
hitting serio down slope down slope
you're<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.229> whole<00:01:34.710> idea<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.820> hit<00:01:36.240> those

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
you're a whole idea here is to hit those

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.960 
you're a whole idea here is to hit those
down<00:01:36.750> slopes<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.710> get<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> most<00:01:38.250> air<00:01:38.640> as

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
down slopes and get the most air as

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.569 
down slopes and get the most air as
possible<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> go<00:01:40.829> flying

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
possible so that you can go flying

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.690 
possible so that you can go flying
through<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> air<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:43.259> avoid<00:01:43.560> these<00:01:43.799> hits

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
through the air and avoid these hits

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.149 
through the air and avoid these hits
that<00:01:44.939> slow<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.299> down<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.049> sometimes<00:01:46.710> easier

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that slow you down so sometimes easier

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.679 
that slow you down so sometimes easier

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
than others you're going to have more

hills<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.729> tend<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.880> be<00:01:51.149> good<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.220> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
hills that tend to be good for this you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.889 
hills that tend to be good for this you
can<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.610> frenzy<00:01:54.299> where<00:01:54.540> you're<00:01:54.659> doing

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
can get into a frenzy where you're doing

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.530 
can get into a frenzy where you're doing
somebody<00:01:55.200> put<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.439> slides<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.920> row<00:01:56.130> and

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
somebody put your slides in a row and

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
somebody put your slides in a row and
again<00:01:57.540> watch<00:01:57.750> watching<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.229> time<00:01:58.469> there<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
again watch watching that time there and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.359 
again watch watching that time there and
watching<00:01:59.310> your<00:01:59.490> level<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.240> watching<00:02:00.780> that

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
watching your level and watching that

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.090 
watching your level and watching that
score<00:02:02.369> go<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.060> better<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.960> do<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> can

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
score go up the better you do so I can

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.190 
score go up the better you do so I can
hear<00:02:05.159> better<00:02:05.310> your<00:02:05.520> score<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.810> more

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
hear better your score is the more

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.930 
hear better your score is the more
likely<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.560> you're<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.789> can

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
likely that you're going to and you can

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.910 
likely that you're going to and you can
still<00:02:09.149> move<00:02:09.239> along<00:02:09.479> without<00:02:09.720> helping<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.709> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
still move along without helping but you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.600 
still move along without helping but you
definitely<00:02:11.129> want<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.459> touch<00:02:11.670> down

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
definitely want to touch down

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.140 
definitely want to touch down
and<00:02:12.700> then<00:02:13.860> lift<00:02:14.860> it<00:02:15.010> up<00:02:15.070> for<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.730> there

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and then lift it up for that and there

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.820 
and then lift it up for that and there
we<00:02:16.240> go<00:02:16.360> that's<00:02:16.600> pretty<00:02:16.870> cool<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:17.680> you

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
we go that's pretty cool and then you

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.230 
we go that's pretty cool and then you
don't<00:02:17.980> want<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.190> hit<00:02:18.310> which<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.730> unfortunately

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
don't want to hit which I unfortunately

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.700 
don't want to hit which I unfortunately
just<00:02:19.360> did<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:19.720> it's<00:02:20.140> really<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.380> matter<00:02:20.530> of

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
just did so it's really a matter of

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.710 
just did so it's really a matter of
getting<00:02:20.860> your<00:02:20.980> strategy<00:02:21.430> down<00:02:21.610> getting<00:02:22.540> your

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
getting your strategy down getting your

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.960 
getting your strategy down getting your
groove<00:02:23.320> on<00:02:23.680> seeing<00:02:24.280> how<00:02:24.400> fast<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.940> can

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
groove on seeing how fast you can

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.180 
groove on seeing how fast you can
complete<00:02:25.570> these<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.710> can<00:02:26.830> tell<00:02:26.950> the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
complete these as you can tell the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.250 
complete these as you can tell the
graphics<00:02:27.550> are<00:02:27.670> really<00:02:27.700> pretty<00:02:27.970> simple<00:02:28.260> and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
graphics are really pretty simple and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.360 
graphics are really pretty simple and
you're<00:02:29.500> not<00:02:29.620> going<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:29.860> see<00:02:30.010> them<00:02:30.070> anything

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
you're not going to see them anything

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.800 
you're not going to see them anything
more<00:02:30.640> exciting<00:02:30.880> than<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.480> these<00:02:31.570> other

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
more exciting than that and these other

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.940 
more exciting than that and these other
ones<00:02:32.020> you're<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.380> see<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.650> first<00:02:32.800> three

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
ones you're going to see the first three

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.340 
ones you're going to see the first three
levels<00:02:33.750> they<00:02:34.750> do<00:02:34.900> good<00:02:35.080> little<00:02:35.230> more

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
levels they do good little more

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.230 
levels they do good little more
complicated<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:36.070> challenging<00:02:36.340> as<00:02:36.820> far<00:02:37.060> as

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
complicated and challenging as far as

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.440 
complicated and challenging as far as
the<00:02:37.540> design<00:02:38.530> goes<00:02:38.980> you're<00:02:39.370> not<00:02:39.550> being<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.090> easy

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the design goes you're not being so easy

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
the design goes you're not being so easy
to<00:02:40.720> get<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.670> good<00:02:43.270> jump<00:02:43.630> off<00:02:43.840> them<00:02:44.110> at<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.350> end

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470
