 is with us from doctors and as 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.429
 elevated 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.809
 walking very well, I'm very happy 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:13.620
 doctor has brought a subject that is very 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.450
 common in sunbathers that are those 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.600
 spots that appear with the sun that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.640
 they have the name of pityriasis 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.890
 pityriasis versicolor but if we 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.900
 we say powers of 5 years know that it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 treat nobody knows what it is about the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.199
 people are not interested in knowing something that is not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.300
 it does not even sound familiar to you so if 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.950
 one identifies it as mushrooms that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.110
 appear under the sun or fungi 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.850
 sun out there you can now the familiar 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.660
 you are going to like it a lot 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.340
 Carlos for the enríquez fantasy and all 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.309
 the work of the whole station is a lot 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.739
 you girls have also gone because the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.289
 just time when they start to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.379
 consult for these little spots that such 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.960
 once during the winter they had them but 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.879
 in the very white skins they passed 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.470
 unnoticed and now when they expose 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.250
 the sun on the one hand bothers them 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.860
 aesthetically 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.650
 and they begin to show themselves how 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.750
 are those stains why it is called 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 versicolor because they have different 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.440
 colors there is a variety that has 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.840
 get white are round well 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.410
 bounded some have some this 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.650
 half do not bother do not sting do not hurt 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.890
 but many times they are not white or 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.130
 they have scales but they are rather 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.290
 reddish brown or a color more salmon what 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.229
 is what happens with these and this mushroom 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.290
 that the mag malassezia für that is the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.920
 responsible for the appearance of this in 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.770
 the skin what it produces is an invasion 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.130
 growing skin that its habitat 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.800
 natural is to say where the fungus lives in 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.680
 our skin in certain people who 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.960
 have a predisposition to have this 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.290
 mushroom will develop who they are 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.140
 these people the young adults 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.149
 and teenagers because not both 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.100
 ends of life because it feeds 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.600
 this mushroom of the greasiness of the skin 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.510
 then to the extent that one goes 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.310
 aging the grease loses 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.320
 skin becomes drier so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.020
 so much has less gratitude and this mushroom 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.820
 it tends to disappear otherwise in 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.590
 the youth begins just the 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.680
 effervescence of adolescence with the 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.350
 acne the highest sebum production in the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.360
 skin and they are the ones that can have on 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.020
 all those people who perspire 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.260
 a lot that this one stays with the clothes 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.200
 perspired after having performed 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.130
 sports that go up a lot 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.370
 regardless of whether they do sports 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.850
 or not and they have oily skin that's why 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.160
 when one is going to give the treatment is 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.230
 important to have some things because if 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.970
 well there are in some things in mind if 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.860
 well there are predisposing factors that are 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.650
 we are talking about there are also 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 things to be able to prevent it and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.080
 eradicate it 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.180
 I'm going to repeat a little more than 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.100
 shine consult with the doctor for more 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.890
 that you think you can have these 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.780
 fungi of the sun because in dermatology 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.090
 many diseases that look like 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.550
 to another and only the trained eye of 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.440
 dermatologist is the one who allows the 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.530
 differential diagnosis if it's about 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.780
 this or not then if we can put the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.420
 the list of recommendations and 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.420
 general measures to take into account 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.070
 do not share towels or clothes if it is 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.570
 of low infectivity of the fungus because 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.640
 the one who has the 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.460
 predisposition that is what we talked about 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.190
 a little while before but the same is convenient 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.860
 Never share, do not stay with 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.200
 sweaty garments and there is no 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.330
 possibility to bathe immediately from 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.310
 practice a sport at least have 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.800
 a shirt or something that is spare 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.600
 dry so that there is moisture on the 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:06.740
 body after this you have to try to 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.980
 use the doctor vindicate shampoo is that 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.960
 they are special that are going to replace the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.910
 daily hygiene soap they're going to 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.549
 be destined not only to wash the 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.070
 affected area which is the trunk ie 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.980
 the whole part of the chest the back the 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.170
 Root of arms very rarely face 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.540
 out there in the smallest but they are the 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.020
 places where there is more gratitude then 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.660
 the body should be sanitized with this 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.550
 shampoo that contains a medicine is 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.560
 must include the head wash that is 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.340
 a fat area of ​​the ears from behind 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.919
 outside 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.100
 inside that is also a place from where 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:46.040
 the fungus is lodged and then the doctor 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.500
 will consider any one the option one 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.770
 cream or a spray to complement and 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.350
 If it is widespread, it usually happens 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.290
 is supplemented with a medication by 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.540
 mouth that has to be strictly 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:03.800
 controlled by the der killed and there are offer 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.930
 some topical magical things and for lan 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.720
 also some because they have drugs that 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.330
 dermatologists also use the theme 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.610
 is that they are usually effective out there 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.100
 when it is not so affected of the skin 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.040
 it is very common to see that they let themselves be 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.800
 because during the winter it does not look like 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.290
 that goes unnoticed then people 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.360
 or let it be because total does not bother 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:32.449
 no physics is not a fungus 111 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.419
 so like everything deep you have to try 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.370
 to keep the skin dry and free of 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:39.050
 city ​​oral medication can also be 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.810
 give oral medication you have to take in 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.300
 account that sometimes for more than 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.580
 have eliminated the fungus when the skin 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.280
 has been clarified that is when there is a 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.310
 pityriasis that is whiter than 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.789
 normal does the chronic computer stain that 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:58.340
 we say we no color takes the skin 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.509
 in recovering that color then sometimes 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.550
 you have to have a little patience 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:05.150
 because the skin is not going to return to the 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.870
 normality quickly thanks doctor 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.870
 very friendly
