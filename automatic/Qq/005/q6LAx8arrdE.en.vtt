00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.280
 asking for tips to be able to use a little 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.410
 better makeup with what you can 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.960
 combine sometimes you do not know do not know if 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.120

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.780
 tips for the perfect red lips and 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.780
 sensual 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.380
 so we'll start reading some tips 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.599
 how to choose the perfect color of 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 terms of color your skin and then already in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.600
 the perfect way and how to apply it in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.940
 only five steps 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.940
 that's 555 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.070
 first of all to find the color 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.050
 of ideal lips must be determined 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.200
 our skin tone but how 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.770
 we exactly do that one way is 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.659
 comparing the color on your forearms 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.149
 extend your wrists up 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.250
 directly under the light check 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.649
 your blood vessels and the tone that you have 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.329
 if it is a greenish tone you are of a tone of 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.119
 warm skin and if it's more or less your 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.250
 side is cold another way is that someone 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.079
 more see behind your ears with the light 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.969
 natural the skin behind the ear 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.679
 It has a much purer color then 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.479
 the other person can recognize more 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.850
 easily if it is a medium skin tone 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.900
 pinkish that is cold or yellowish that is 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.150
 warm 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.400
 another option is the leaf method 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.950
 paper 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.440
 hold a white sheet of paper to the side 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.630
 of your face contrast skin tone against 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.330
 this way you will easily see if your 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.790
 color is yellowish or pink if the last 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.680
 tip would be that for Christ's sake I do not know 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.050
 oppose a strong makeup on the eyes 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.490
 if they are going to get strong lips from 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.680
 they want to look like a clown they create 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.360
 remember that as I said the tone of 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.819
 lipstick has to go with the tone of 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.220
 skin this also applies to a tone of 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.200
 Ellipsis red when you have skin tone 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.420
 quality it is best to look for a red with 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.610
 its coral or orange tones 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.340
 for a cold skin tone one that has 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 rather sub blue or purple hues as 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.860
 my skin tone is warm I will choose 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.140
 this red more super sensual passion now 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.870
 if we apply the facelift in five steps 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.880
 easy and fast number one apply 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.080
 powder so that the color holds a lot 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.840
 better and last longer 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.460
 number 2 I take an eyeliner and start 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.490
 doing an X on the top 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.440
 of your lips step 3 continues delineating 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.960
 the outline of your lips and paint towards 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.670

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.160
 lips look thicker than line a 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.170
 little bit out is all the illusion that 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.930
 your lips are much bigger 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.150
 step 4 to apply the lifting uses a 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.040
 brush is much easier to apply and 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.200
 the concealer or pencil and a swab too 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.480
 to better remove any excess in the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.989
 way for that it bites with the lips a 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.989
 piece of paper 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.420
