 for direct brawer going out to work is 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.700
 a pleasure because so much of his 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.940
 effort is now assumed by his bicycle 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.589
 just put your feet on the pedal a 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.200
 electric motor amplifies 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.420
 automatically human strength well 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.970
 manages to take the orders of his clients 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.609
 in less time and save physical strength 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.550
 your vehicle is an electric bicycle 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.560
 load 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.630
 you can walk all day relaxed this 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.150
 electric bicycle takes away the weight of 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.290
 the cargo you do not feel at all that 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.969
 has 50 kilos of weight since this 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.980
 mail service acquired the 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.710
 cargo bicycles trips to 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.840
 Berlin's interior are shorter 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.300
 for a fleet of cars would be 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.329
 impossible is not a problem for these 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.670
 fast cyclists on bikeways and 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.039
 through parks manage to win 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.260
 any traffic jam is why this 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.480
 company wants to expand its fleet on 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.040
 inventor of the electric bicycle 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.820
 load is frank miller 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.850
 It is produced in series since 2012 together with 8 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.090
 employees each one costs about five thousand 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.579
 euros 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.310
 apart from the messaging services and 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.469
 fragmentary distribution thinks about the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.060
 manual workers of large 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.060
 cities as potential customers 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.250
 They are the ones who need to take few things 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.619
 and they have a limited amount of 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.090
 tools want to get to fast 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.900
 somewhere and continue on his way 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.120
 quickly 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.000
 a day you can travel 100 kilometers 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.340
 then the battery is charged for a few hours 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.010
 installed under the cargo compartment 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.430
 the electricity cost per 100 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.090
 kilometers 12 cents maximum speed 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.460
 25 kilometers per hour too slow 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.080
 for some customers the inventors are 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.390
 they managed to get even more 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.050
 speed to these two wheels the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.780
 result was this so-called spd lec in 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.240
 germany circulation is not allowed 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.600
 on ciclovÃ­as but in exchange if it reaches 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.730
 the 45 kilometers per hour in the hour 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.830
 peak load electric bikes 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.230
 They are much faster than any car 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.300
 the decisive thing is that you always find 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.110
 parking you no longer have problems 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.180
 of parking the company sells about 100 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.360
 bicycles a year will soon be thousands 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.010
 frank miller thinks about megalopolis 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.870
 Asian as possible market the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.760
 first electric donkeys 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.209
 made in Berlin were already sold to 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.209
 Singapore
