uh I guess perform correctly then that's

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.830 
uh I guess perform correctly then that's
just<00:02:10.319> your<00:02:10.649> fault<00:02:10.890> n

awkward but it's not oh I have to show

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.110 
awkward but it's not oh I have to show
you<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.920> chef<00:02:29.099> because<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.519> makes<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:30.030> little

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
you the chef because it makes a little

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.839 
you the chef because it makes a little
bit<00:02:30.299> more<00:02:30.390> convincing<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:33.500> got<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.590> eat<00:02:34.650> this

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
bit more convincing so I got to eat this

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.660 
bit more convincing so I got to eat this
angled<00:02:35.849> correctly<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.799> falls<00:02:38.129> out<00:02:38.310> almost

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
angled correctly so it falls out almost

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.390 
angled correctly so it falls out almost
basically<00:02:39.150> right<00:02:39.420> before<00:02:40.010> it's<00:02:41.010> almost

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
basically right before it's almost

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.960 
basically right before it's almost
vertical<00:02:41.879> hold<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.659> is<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:43.019> too<00:02:43.500> deep<00:02:43.970> so

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
vertical hold and it is not too deep so

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.880 
vertical hold and it is not too deep so
I<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.269> love<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:45.840> thing<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.319> goes<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.799> it

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
school spec which I'm actually very

surprised about I probably would have

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.009 
surprised about I probably would have
rather<00:03:11.819> because<00:03:12.359> i<00:03:12.420> don't<00:03:12.599> like<00:03:12.660> pinching

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
rather because i don't like pinching

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.360 
rather because i don't like pinching
heads<00:03:13.260> because<00:03:13.349> i<00:03:13.530> feel<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.799> screws<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.220> head

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
heads because i feel it screws the head

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.729 
heads because i feel it screws the head
up<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.940> makes<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.239> much<00:03:15.359> more<00:03:15.569> week<00:03:15.810> because

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
up it makes it much more week because

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.349 
up it makes it much more week because
i'm<00:03:16.889> not<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.430> best<00:03:17.549> at<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.819> because<00:03:17.940> i<00:03:18.120> don't

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
i'm not the best at it because i don't

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
more Flair that would have helped me

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.580 
more Flair that would have helped me
because<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:36.090> like<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.569> long<00:03:36.930> narrow<00:03:37.260> heads

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
because I like the long narrow heads

I've<00:03:37.950> been<00:03:38.069> using<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.400> CEO<00:03:38.700> for<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.940> while<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.269> I

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
I've been using a CEO for a while so I

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.860 
I've been using a CEO for a while so I
got<00:03:39.510> used<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:41.790> head<00:03:42.000> itself<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.660> only

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
got used to that the head itself is only

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.900 
got used to that the head itself is only
4.5<00:03:43.769> ounces<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.280> think<00:03:44.519> that's<00:03:44.669> for<00:03:44.849> the

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
4.5 ounces I think that's for the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.659 
4.5 ounces I think that's for the
Maverick<00:03:45.590> optic<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.829> though<00:03:47.010> because<00:03:47.280> they

Maverick optic you though because they

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.110 
Maverick optic you though because they
use<00:03:47.910> always<00:03:48.329> letter<00:03:48.599> some<00:03:48.989> odd<00:03:49.139> reason<00:03:50.120> same

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.599 
thing with ass telling you 500 um I
think<00:03:55.560> was<00:03:55.799> like<00:03:55.889> five<00:03:56.040> percent<00:03:56.310> later<00:03:56.459> or

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
think was like five percent later or

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.059 
think was like five percent later or
something<00:03:56.760> else<00:03:56.970> tell<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.419> I<00:03:57.510> wondered

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
something else tell you if I wondered

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:01.670 
something else tell you if I wondered
compared<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.099> stallion<00:03:59.400> but<00:04:00.410> this<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.530> think

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
compared to stallion but this I think

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.250 
compared to stallion but this I think
this<00:04:01.739> is<00:04:01.799> four<00:04:02.069> point<00:04:02.220> seven<00:04:02.549> ounces<00:04:03.260> or

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
this is four point seven ounces or

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.360 
this is four point seven ounces or
something<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.650> are<00:04:04.859> four<00:04:05.040> point<00:04:05.280> nine

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
something like that are four point nine

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.689 
something like that are four point nine
so<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.849> is<00:04:06.090> not<00:04:07.019> as<00:04:07.370> light<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.489> with<00:04:08.609> the

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
so it is not as light and with the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.119 
so it is not as light and with the
string<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.530> 5.3<00:04:10.530> because<00:04:10.829> either<00:04:10.919> the

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
string it is 5.3 because either the

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.909 
string it is 5.3 because either the
scale<00:04:11.400> or<00:04:11.760> right<00:04:12.120> behind<00:04:12.329> me<00:04:13.940> so<00:04:14.940> it's<00:04:15.919> 44.9

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
scale or right behind me so it's 44.9

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.539 
scale or right behind me so it's 44.9
else's<00:04:17.430> unstrung<00:04:18.419> it<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:19.440> very<00:04:19.890> very<00:04:20.280> very

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
else's unstrung it is very very very

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.510 
else's unstrung it is very very very
stiff<00:04:20.969> and<00:04:21.260> some<00:04:22.260> people<00:04:22.500> do<00:04:22.590> not<00:04:22.680> prefer<00:04:23.340> that

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
stiff and some people do not prefer that

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.240 
stiff and some people do not prefer that
some

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
some

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.820 
some
x<00:04:24.400> if<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.570> does<00:04:25.750> hit<00:04:26.140> a<00:04:26.350> little<00:04:26.560> bit<00:04:26.680> of<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
x if it does hit a little bit of the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.250 
x if it does hit a little bit of the
side<00:04:26.980> of<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.100> plastic<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:28.270> might<00:04:28.840> not<00:04:28.960> go<00:04:29.140> in

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
side of the plastic it might not go in

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.380 
side of the plastic it might not go in
the<00:04:29.350> stick<00:04:29.590> probably<00:04:30.100> will<00:04:30.250> but<00:04:30.880> it's<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.240> white

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
the stick probably will but it's a white

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.080 
the stick probably will but it's a white
head<00:04:31.570> enough<00:04:31.810> so<00:04:32.200> if<00:04:32.500> not<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.250> catch<00:04:33.490> you<00:04:33.850> should

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
head enough so if not a catch you should

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.720 
head enough so if not a catch you should
be<00:04:34.210> able<00:04:34.270> to<00:04:34.420> catch<00:04:34.540> the<00:04:34.690> ball<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:36.250> some

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
be able to catch the ball but some

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.210 
be able to catch the ball but some
people<00:04:36.970> don't<00:04:37.030> know<00:04:37.180> like<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.350> stiff<00:04:38.950> heads

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
people don't know like the stiff heads

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.420 
people don't know like the stiff heads
they<00:04:39.430> like<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:39.760> when<00:04:39.940> it's<00:04:40.030> really<00:04:40.450> nice<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:42.840> I

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
they like it when it's really nice and I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.260 
they like it when it's really nice and I
guess<00:04:45.430> week<00:04:46.420> in<00:04:46.930> my<00:04:47.080> opinion<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:48.190> was<00:04:49.120> shooting

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
guess week in my opinion I was shooting

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.670 
guess week in my opinion I was shooting
with<00:04:49.420> this<00:04:49.600> thing<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.930> doesn't<00:04:50.110> pull<00:04:50.440> back

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
with this thing it doesn't pull back

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.980 
with this thing it doesn't pull back
that<00:04:50.890> much<00:04:51.070> as<00:04:51.310> some<00:04:52.000> people<00:04:52.270> did<00:04:52.510> say<00:04:52.720> it

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
that much as some people did say it

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.430 
that much as some people did say it
would<00:04:53.460> I<00:04:54.460> do<00:04:54.970> like<00:04:55.300> how<00:04:55.480> the<00:04:55.540> side<00:04:56.230> wall

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
would I do like how the side wall

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.680 
would I do like how the side wall
pattern<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:57.010> does<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.460> looks<00:04:57.760> awkward<00:04:57.910> because

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
pattern it does it looks awkward because

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.200 
pattern it does it looks awkward because
it<00:04:58.900> pulls<00:04:59.200> down<00:04:59.500> at<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.220> very<00:05:00.250> last<00:05:00.669> second<00:05:01.090> so

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
it pulls down at the very last second so

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.540 
it pulls down at the very last second so
it<00:05:01.300> gives<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.570> just<00:05:01.750> that<00:05:01.960> mid<00:05:02.260> pocket<00:05:02.710> so<00:05:03.280> if

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
it gives you just that mid pocket so if

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.080 
it gives you just that mid pocket so if
you<00:05:03.760> like<00:05:03.910> high<00:05:04.120> pockets<00:05:04.570> or<00:05:04.750> low<00:05:05.320> pockets<00:05:06.090> you

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
you like high pockets or low pockets you

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.240 
you like high pockets or low pockets you
or<00:05:07.390> no<00:05:07.780> pocket<00:05:08.110> you'll<00:05:08.200> be<00:05:08.320> fine<00:05:08.530> hi<00:05:08.830> pocket

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
or no pocket you'll be fine hi pocket

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.820 
or no pocket you'll be fine hi pocket
don't<00:05:09.580> go<00:05:09.730> any<00:05:09.970> higher<00:05:10.240> in<00:05:10.600> my<00:05:10.750> opinion<00:05:10.930> then

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
don't go any higher in my opinion then

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.980 
don't go any higher in my opinion then
this<00:05:12.100> right<00:05:12.430> here<00:05:12.820> some<00:05:13.180> people<00:05:13.450> like<00:05:13.570> it<00:05:13.600> all

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
this right here some people like it all

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.409 
this right here some people like it all
the<00:05:14.440> way<00:05:14.500> up<00:05:14.650> here<00:05:15.070> and<00:05:15.280> I<00:05:15.700> think<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.120> that<00:05:16.150> is

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
the way up here and I think that that is

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.480 
the way up here and I think that that is
just<00:05:16.450> dumb<00:05:17.080> can<00:05:17.890> one<00:05:18.070> handle<00:05:18.310> regular

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
just dumb can one handle regular

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.560 
just dumb can one handle regular
anything<00:05:20.040> and<00:05:21.040> it<00:05:21.280> just<00:05:21.460> makes<00:05:21.910> your<00:05:22.030> game<00:05:22.240> I

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
anything and it just makes your game I

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.780 
anything and it just makes your game I
guess<00:05:23.020> not<00:05:23.320> as<00:05:23.590> good<00:05:23.860> even<00:05:24.220> though<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.430> say<00:05:24.610> oh

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
guess not as good even though you say oh

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.420 
guess not as good even though you say oh
I<00:05:25.090> can<00:05:25.480> shoot<00:05:25.750> better<00:05:25.990> if<00:05:26.800> you<00:05:26.980> notice<00:05:27.220> string

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
I can shoot better if you notice string

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.909 
I can shoot better if you notice string
a<00:05:27.550> mid<00:05:27.880> pocket<00:05:28.270> correctly<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:29.650> should<00:05:29.680> be

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
a mid pocket correctly you should be

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.250 
a mid pocket correctly you should be
fine<00:05:30.280> and<00:05:30.640> you<00:05:30.940> can<00:05:31.090> still<00:05:31.360> get<00:05:31.630> enough<00:05:31.990> whip

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
fine and you can still get enough whip

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.370 
fine and you can still get enough whip
and<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.500> put<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:34.030> snap<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.690> push<00:05:34.990> on<00:05:35.320> a

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
and the put the snap and the push on a

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.100 
and the put the snap and the push on a
mid<00:05:36.130> pocket<00:05:36.520> as<00:05:36.640> a<00:05:36.970> high<00:05:37.240> pocket<00:05:37.479> so<00:05:37.870> high

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
mid pocket as a high pocket so high

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.130 
mid pocket as a high pocket so high
pocket<00:05:38.470> my<00:05:38.590> opinion<00:05:39.460> is<00:05:39.930> completely<00:05:40.930> useless

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
pocket my opinion is completely useless

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.280 
pocket my opinion is completely useless
amid<00:05:41.830> high<00:05:41.979> is<00:05:42.040> good<00:05:42.840> because<00:05:43.840> it<00:05:43.930> gives<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.260> a

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.290 
amid high is good because it gives you a

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.440 
amid high is good because it gives you a
lot<00:05:44.380> of<00:05:44.440> vertical<00:05:44.650> old<00:05:45.180> automatically<00:05:46.180> if<00:05:46.360> you

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
lot of vertical old automatically if you

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.860 
lot of vertical old automatically if you
string<00:05:46.720> it<00:05:46.840> correctly<00:05:47.470> um<00:05:48.419> so<00:05:49.419> under<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:49.750> head

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
string it correctly um so under the head

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.260 
string it correctly um so under the head
itself<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:50.380> has<00:05:50.410> a<00:05:50.560> cool<00:05:50.979> little<00:05:51.160> us<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:54.270> little

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
itself it has a cool little us a little
