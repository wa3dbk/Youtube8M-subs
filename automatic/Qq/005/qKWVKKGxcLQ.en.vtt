00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.180
 I am convinced that we must play 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.940
 our basketball too 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 because the visit has the talent 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.660
 the athletics to be able to impose one's own 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.680
 game 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.680
 we are not we are not forced to have to 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.809
 come up with certain things for 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.150
 masking our obvious limitations myself 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.610
 I assume that it is a bit 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.470
 philosophy can not blatantly the 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.340
 philosophy of berlusconi 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.140
 we must look into our home 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.559
 we must be able to do ours well 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.390
 then things to me in every game 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.320
 staff we need to be good at 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.800
 identify a maximum two three things that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.680
 are the ones that maybe block a 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.940
 the mechanisms of the opposing team 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.000
 but the thing we have to do 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.520
 succeed as Gigi Brin used to say yes 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.410
 what that that players are 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.580
 aware of what they have to do in 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.140
 field 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.810
 then you play against pistoia games 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.409
 against head of edging games against 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 milano and logical that a minimum 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.680
 especially defensively you have to do 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.770
 of the choices but they are choices that however 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.020
 we had already tried previously 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.290
 for example, maybe we play on Sunday 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.240
 with amorous against the player who is 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.430
 that clearly that if he plays from five 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.740
 points from three points so it's normal that 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.060
 don't mark it as if you 're playing against 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.740
 thin 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.299
 these are things that basically 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.530
 you have to do davy though 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.590
 but I repeat the games we have 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.600
 won is because we played we have 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.600
 played as we wanted here in essence
