00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.499
 in this lesson we will see how to size the various elements that make up a 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.099
 technical drawing 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.000
 now that we have these dimensions configured according to the norm 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.909
 abnt technique 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.909
 we will learn techniques to scale correctly 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.939
 the project 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.929
 I'll start by talking here then. 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.940
 insertion of linear dimensions into the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.489
 for this then I will use similar tools over the internet 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.659
 insistent silence button here as you all already know 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.570
 so I'll activate the tool line 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.730
 manually enter 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.760
 the first dimension what will be referring to this body of this Tuesday 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.659
 see what I have already my first time 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:55.760
 dimension 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.970
 I will now insert the other dimensions based on this 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.450
 team dimension 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.860
 this will also be interesting because I'll already use it 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.530
 all settings that were previously created 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.430
 in my fifth tool 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.590
 according to abl and tv where it has spacing 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.340
 said they were old without having a 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.100
 element in another 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.540
 spacing of one millimeter in terracotta in operation 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.560
 so I'll use it here 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.940
 this tool kiss nine 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.460
 where I can already 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.200
 in series 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260
 other dimensions 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.550
 see only 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.380
 I'm just going to adjust file deletes that are minutes 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.800
 I'm going to adjust the size 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.000
 text 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 that you see here that it is very big 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.530
 in relation to the quotas I am going to insert here 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.940
 later then come here with the brt selected in monte do 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.650
 inform that 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.770
 ten units 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.029
 I confirm with that 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.139
 klose 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.789
 see I already have 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:14.349
 my fourth updated 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.139
 re-use 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 fourth reform that I want as basic 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.359
 and I plead 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.050
 the dimensions here 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.659
 that I'm inserting 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.449
 and so here is what you entered 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:33.809
 which will happen all its quotas qts are inserted based on 4 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:34.709
 initial 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.989
 will have the dimensions of separation 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.079
 according to the norm abnt 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.819
 now show you how to scale the refusal on circles 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.589
 For this I will use the tools 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.069
 frei that the adriano site inter 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.529
 the tool loses 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.139
 use here to size this rounding here 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.879
 see that it is very simple to active the tool 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.040
 selects element that returns to mention and fixed position of the fourth 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.569
 the same thing will be done for per day on the subway where I will activate the 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.339
 tool never 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.719
 select the circumference I want to size 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:19.759
 and will position fourth 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.569
 in my project 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.149
 see I have it here 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.429
 my size of this foundation 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:30.779
 Finally, I'll show you the tools of the 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:31.939
 angles 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.329
 which is known by the tool angola 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.379
 when activating this tool 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.569
 I am going to insert a dimension here and it is reported that 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.629
 then with the active tool you injured a line 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.929
 second line 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.929
 that you now have the position 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.219
 here see that I 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.349
 I selected rows 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.709
 who are not 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.599
 color attraction when selecting sakineh 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.989
 who uses here 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.929
 now yes i selected the correct line before i had selected 

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:08.889
 a line here 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.189
 from ashura 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.139
 and quickly see in cyrus 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.049
 let's simply activate the tool 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.999
 selecting the two elements I want 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.559
 and know the dimension 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.249
 position ap 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.249
 4 with a click on the graphic area and ready 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 and thus we conclude this class 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.500
 where we saw the tools that auto cad and offer for insertion of 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.050
 dimensions only in design
