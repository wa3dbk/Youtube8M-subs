00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.899
 hello today i will make you 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.640
 the hock of pork in carry so that's 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.200
 a recipe too that we can apply it 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:17.140
 at the foot of the harbor but we call it a 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:19.509
 nothing the pig carepa for the recipe 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.900
 you need turmeric salt weight 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:26.019
 live thyme from the tomato and 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.130
 onions and a nice hock of pork even 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.409
 heard if you do with packs 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.409
 foot coach carries us need the 14 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.800
 the first step is going to be to grab his 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.720
 hock in a pressure cooker with a 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.950
 oil fillet 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.570
 so of course this step is not 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.130
 feasible for the feet port it is necessary 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.520
 immediately go to the second step 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.570
 I start with my jar in 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.570
 gripping flesh side 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.769
 because of the victories 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.920
 after one minute you can see that my 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:26.330
 big seizure on the expensive side so I 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.490
 get rid of it and I go to the second 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.580
 step ie to bring back the 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.580
 onions 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.850
 once your bunions soon may 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.299
 welcome 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.299
 I add 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.810
 life 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.180
 I added 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.180
 och 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.560
 coffee 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.560
 what I see 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.250
 I will not go 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.920
 a coup 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.010
 there I'm going beauvais 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.010
 paleo 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.740
 we are still a little bit 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.400
 I cover 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 my meat 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:43.830
 I then put the lid on my 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:47.810
 casserole and that's going to cook pretty much a 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.810
 hour already is going to cook an hour 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.340
 that's after an hour and a half my 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.200
 pork knuckle is cooked 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.400
 if like me the juice is still a little 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.060
 too much liquid will leave you one more 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.250
 small can reduce 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.600
 and then here but more than to go to 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.600
 good appetite table
