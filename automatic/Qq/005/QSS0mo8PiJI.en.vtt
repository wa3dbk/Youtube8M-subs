Sea-monkeys part 2

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.720
Scine the last episode a lot has happend:

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:17.280
Faster than thought most of the seamonkey-larvas emerged. 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:26.520
What I will do taday is first the the cleaning of the tank-

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.040
On the second place the first feeding.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.200
For the cleaning I use this pipet.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.600
I have to draw the egg-shells from the ground.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.160
I have to be careful, to not draw sea-monkey-larvasÉ

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:14.040
As I said: they«ve grown suprisingly fast.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:38.760
By the way: the sea-monkey are living in salt seas

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.800
and these salt-seas drying out from time to time.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.560
When they notice that, they will lay permanent-eggs

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.240
which are able to resist in the dry sand, until there is water again.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.560
Now I refill the water.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.040
Certainly, there has to be salt in the new water.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.840
Now I will give them a little food.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.040
It is important to give them not too much food. 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.720
Because of the pollution.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:33.040
And especially the larvas are not able to absorb that much.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.280
Now they are coming, hungry little things. 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.200
The food consists of alga. 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.640
they smell like the sam-monkey-eggs.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.160
Jepp, that must be enough.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.480
Fine! So we have to wait until something interesting happens. 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.080
Bye!

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.400
To be continuedÉ
