 five variables or more calories to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.660
 that I feel nationally is not 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.660
 because I'm saying that subject to the movie 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.790

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.830
 vegetarian version in some places 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.710
 they vegetarian sausage is made with 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.050

 62 beans with tomato sauce come 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.500
 avocado a passion an avocado make 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.230
 even a little grilled melon and one wÃªnio 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.930
 sweet potato dumpling is 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.870
 very tasty to see a fried egg and 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.480
 vegetables in the case came broccoli is only 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.790
 open the dinho so a super 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.220
 feed the English they eat of 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.170
 morning and this usually they want 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.720
 sandwich at lunchtime they will 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.220
 to comment again at night that most 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.690
 the way they work during the day and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.310
 I can not show you how we have a 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.140
 very strong lunch thing in brazil 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.030
 mainly in the interior 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.100
 not so much but it is 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.200
 eat lunch here a lot because 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.750
 they stay all day but with this 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.790
 Super breakfast, you can handle it. 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.530
 all day bug was beans or have 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.660
 proteins without vegetable carbohydrates 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.040
 super rock so the half orange juice 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.520
 crazy but anyway 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.930
 using the pavilion is a tip to 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.920
 When are you going to London to 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.709
 to experiment 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.620
 I heard that this was super traditional and 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.720
 very close to the organic so this helps 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.110
 but now on the pope's agenda that in the case 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.970
 the cap serving people sang selection 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 have coffee with me and I know they 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.100
 They make bank saucers because I've never done it in 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.840
 home here and I end up eating out this 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.580
 but I'll find out any recent you 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.640
 more sweet in proving Brazilians 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.459

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.800
