you're screwing the screws back into

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.030 
you're screwing the screws back into
place<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.359> turn<00:03:28.659> it<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.900> just<00:03:29.170> until<00:03:29.829> you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.309 
place you turn it and just until you
feel<00:03:30.310> some<00:03:30.819> resistance<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.870> don't<00:03:32.109> want<00:03:32.260> to

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
feel some resistance you don't want to

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.349 
feel some resistance you don't want to
over<00:03:32.590> tighten<00:03:32.620> because<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.639> have<00:03:34.000> done<00:03:34.299> this

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
over tighten because I have done this

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.879 
over tighten because I have done this
before<00:03:35.019> if<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.620> over<00:03:36.040> tighten<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:36.639> expands

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
before if you over tighten it expands

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.759 
before if you over tighten it expands
inside<00:03:38.889> the<00:03:39.310> iphone<00:03:39.910> 4<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.870> expands<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.530> two

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
inside the iphone 4 it expands the two

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.979 
inside the iphone 4 it expands the two
metal<00:03:42.129> brackets<00:03:42.669> that<00:03:43.269> are<00:03:43.299> holding<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:43.900> in

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
metal brackets that are holding it in

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.050 
metal brackets that are holding it in
place<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:44.500> what<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.310> will<00:03:45.489> do<00:03:45.669> is<00:03:45.699> that<00:03:45.909> will

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
place and what that will do is that will

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.330 
place and what that will do is that will
either<00:03:46.269> crack<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:46.989> back<00:03:47.199> down<00:03:47.739> here<00:03:48.159> or

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
either crack the back down here or

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.309 
either crack the back down here or
possibly<00:03:48.790> even<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.449> front<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.840> your<00:03:49.989> screen

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
possibly even the front of your screen

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.599 
possibly even the front of your screen
so<00:03:50.530> be<00:03:50.680> very<00:03:50.829> careful<00:03:51.159> when<00:03:51.489> you're

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
so be very careful when you're

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.580 
so be very careful when you're
tightening<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.180> screws<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.720> just<00:03:53.349> tighten

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
tightening the screws to just tighten

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.909 
tightening the screws to just tighten
until<00:03:53.829> you<00:03:54.159> feel<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.400> resistance<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.150> stop

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
until you feel the resistance and stop

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.509 
until you feel the resistance and stop
so<00:03:56.919> here's<00:03:57.190> what<00:03:57.370> it<00:03:57.459> looks<00:03:57.639> like<00:03:59.310> it's<00:04:00.310> not

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
so here's what it looks like it's not

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.479 
so here's what it looks like it's not
very<00:04:00.699> thick<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.840> should<00:04:02.530> be<00:04:02.709> about<00:04:02.799> the<00:04:03.280> same

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
very thick it should be about the same

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.719 
very thick it should be about the same
thickness<00:04:03.970> as<00:04:04.239> the<00:04:04.569> other<00:04:05.079> one<00:04:05.349> maybe<00:04:06.250> just<00:04:06.639> a

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
thickness as the other one maybe just a

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.920 
thickness as the other one maybe just a
little<00:04:07.000> bit<00:04:07.269> slightly<00:04:08.760> thicker<00:04:09.760> I<00:04:10.120> don't<00:04:10.750> see

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
little bit slightly thicker I don't see

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.339 
little bit slightly thicker I don't see
much<00:04:11.109> difference<00:04:11.169> there<00:04:12.540> I've<00:04:13.540> taken<00:04:14.109> some

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
much difference there I've taken some

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.830 
much difference there I've taken some
pictures<00:04:14.590> there's<00:04:15.250> no<00:04:15.579> wash<00:04:15.879> out<00:04:16.209> whatsoever

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
pictures there's no wash out whatsoever

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.649 
pictures there's no wash out whatsoever
for<00:04:17.139> me<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:20.519> looks<00:04:21.519> basically<00:04:21.729> just<00:04:22.300> like<00:04:22.510> the

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
for me and looks basically just like the

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.080 
for me and looks basically just like the
original<00:04:22.750> iphone<00:04:23.349> 4<00:04:23.650> but<00:04:23.830> with<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.159> brushed

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
original iphone 4 but with that brushed

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.560 
original iphone 4 but with that brushed
metal<00:04:25.570> look<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.560> I'm<00:04:27.220> not<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:27.610> worried<00:04:28.090> about

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
metal look and I'm not so worried about

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.450 
metal look and I'm not so worried about
putting<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:29.080> protector<00:04:29.650> on<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.949> back<00:04:30.130> of<00:04:30.310> this

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
putting a protector on the back of this

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.219 
putting a protector on the back of this
yes<00:04:30.760> it's<00:04:31.000> already<00:04:31.300> got<00:04:31.419> some<00:04:31.659> scratches<00:04:32.110> from

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
yes it's already got some scratches from

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.750 
yes it's already got some scratches from
normal<00:04:32.320> wear<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:32.770> tear<00:04:32.949> but<00:04:33.070> these<00:04:33.370> were<00:04:33.520> so

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
normal wear and tear but these were so

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.850 
normal wear and tear but these were so
cheap<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.060> purchase<00:04:34.690> if<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.380> ever<00:04:35.500> want<00:04:35.770> to

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
cheap to purchase if I ever want to
