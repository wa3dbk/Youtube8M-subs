00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.029
 welcome everyone to the channel then i am china 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.179
 Today I have a review and on the review is smart 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.269
 bracelet watch 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:17.910
 watch at 9 means the hour comes from what 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.400
 box Apple did not believe was in such 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.400
 there are several types of them in the box 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.880
 resting there rumors talk about what 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.029
 fake not fake 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.510
 the fact is that it seems to me that this 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.710
 just different modifications i 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:46.640
 your watch turned out to the box and set 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:49.469
 delivery instruction we have here 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.059
 barcode by clicking on which you 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.410
 download the app for your smartphone 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.260
 instruction in english and in chinese 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:03.690
 language 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:09.090
 mean we still have more boxes 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.240
 nothing goes the clock itself arises 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.090
 the question is where is the charging and the cable really 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.560
 doing here 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.039
 it doesn't need anything because the clock 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.670
 charged by using and media connector 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:34.520
 which is hidden from the battle of the parts 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:36.850
 strap as you can see here there is an inscription 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:45.679
 yuzbi 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:49.759
 removing this part of the 3 bag we will see and the hut 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:56.590
 plug by connecting which computer or 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:59.689
 laptop we charge our watch means 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.789
 mount here is very reliable and its 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:08.599
 it's hard to take off so the clock 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.660
 this way you wo n't lose the strap 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.560
 we have a rubber in this case black 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:21.049
 Medium hard rubber strap very 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.609
 handy lock with a safe lock 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:28.069
 one side and aluminum plate and with 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:32.959
 other side two pin designs 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:37.190
 the castle itself is very reliable and convenient then 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:41.650
 there is closing it loose practically 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:51.049
 impossible he himself will not open and so 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:51.870
 hours themselves are clock size 74 by 178 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:57.580
 and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:03:00.550
 thickness 8 mm material of the watch itself 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.870
 whether plastic is either a metal but me 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.170
 it seems that it is still a metal display 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:14.400
 here flowed 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:19.710
