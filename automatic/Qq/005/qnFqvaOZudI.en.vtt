00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
just collapsed the fire brigade were

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.170 
just collapsed the fire brigade were
amazing<00:02:04.890> they<00:02:05.890> worked<00:02:06.190> really<00:02:06.760> really<00:02:06.940> hard

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
amazing they worked really really hard

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.560 
amazing they worked really really hard
the<00:02:07.960> two<00:02:08.170> children<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.310> two<00:02:09.700> adults<00:02:10.420> and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
the two children and the two adults and

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.190 
the two children and the two adults and
the<00:02:10.660> guy<00:02:11.910> was<00:02:12.910> all<00:02:13.090> putting<00:02:13.330> in<00:02:13.420> ambulance<00:02:13.810> and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.240 
I presume they took him to the hospital
to<00:02:16.330> make<00:02:16.840> sure<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.410> children<00:02:17.620> hadn't

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.600 
to make sure that the children hadn't
got<00:02:18.370> smoke<00:02:18.640> inhalation<00:02:20.130> but<00:02:21.130> as<00:02:21.250> far<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:21.460> I
