 I would not have kissed what I did with such 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.180
 Mara marvels at the sight of such big ones 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.750
 Although I did not know it, I did not know it 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.489

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.970

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.980
 Dilettante why I think so 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.050

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.169

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.000
 that is trusted viewers love as 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.730
 not too deeply affected 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.910
 ashamed and all questions open we see 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.390

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.390
