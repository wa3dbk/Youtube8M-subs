00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160 

okay<00:00:00.210> so<00:00:00.269> this<00:00:00.659> is<00:00:00.930> your<00:00:01.770> inferior<00:00:02.700> vena<00:00:02.909> cava

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
okay so this is your inferior vena cava

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay so this is your inferior vena cava
superior<00:00:04.170> vena<00:00:04.380> cava<00:00:04.500> then<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:05.700> blood

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
superior vena cava then the blood

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.350 
superior vena cava then the blood
travels<00:00:06.420> down<00:00:06.930> into<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.500> right<00:00:07.770> atrium<00:00:08.360> okay

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
travels down into the right atrium okay

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.589 
travels down into the right atrium okay
and<00:00:09.769> then<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.889> goes<00:00:11.040> into<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.429> tricuspid<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
and then it goes into the tricuspid the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.330 
and then it goes into the tricuspid the
tricuspid<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.410> always<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:13.950> your<00:00:14.099> right<00:00:14.309> side

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
tricuspid is always on your right side

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.810 
tricuspid is always on your right side
so<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.179> know<00:00:15.330> it's<00:00:15.480> try<00:00:15.780> try<00:00:16.289> right<00:00:16.650> then<00:00:17.640> it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so you know it's try try right then it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.679 
so you know it's try try right then it
travels<00:00:18.119> down<00:00:18.529> into<00:00:19.529> your<00:00:20.520> right<00:00:20.970> ventricle

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
travels down into your right ventricle

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.929 
travels down into your right ventricle
and<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.350> pretty<00:00:22.800> much<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> your

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and it's pretty much this is your

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
and it's pretty much this is your
ventricle<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> your<00:00:25.350> ventricle

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
ventricle and this is your ventricle

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.910 
ventricle and this is your ventricle
these<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:26.640> your<00:00:26.760> papillary<00:00:27.210> muscles<00:00:27.920> right

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
these are your papillary muscles right

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
these are your papillary muscles right
and<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.910> are<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.300> core<00:00:30.990> tight<00:00:31.140> end<00:00:31.380> tonight

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and these are the core tight end tonight

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.880 
and these are the core tight end tonight
the<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.579> strings<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.440> then<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.620> floor

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the little strings and then the floor

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.760 
the little strings and then the floor
the<00:00:35.190> blood<00:00:35.670> flows<00:00:36.090> out<00:00:36.480> from<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.290> right

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the blood flows out from the right

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.869 
the blood flows out from the right
ventricle<00:00:38.480> into<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.719> pulmonary<00:00:40.879> semilunar

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
ventricle into the pulmonary semilunar

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940 
ventricle into the pulmonary semilunar
valve<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:43.140> remember<00:00:43.469> pulmonary

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
valve and you remember pulmonary

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.369 
valve and you remember pulmonary
semilunar<00:00:44.399> valve<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.140> going

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
semilunar valve because when it's going

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.200 
semilunar valve because when it's going
out<00:00:46.680> it's<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.160> into<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> lungs<00:00:47.789> first

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
out it's going into the lungs first

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.029 
out it's going into the lungs first
right<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:50.690> pulmonary<00:00:51.690> semilunar<00:00:52.110> valve<00:00:52.710> and

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
right so pulmonary semilunar valve and

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.180 
right so pulmonary semilunar valve and
then<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.699> goes<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.590> should<00:00:55.860> have<00:00:55.890> your

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
then it goes then you should have your

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
then it goes then you should have your
pulmonary<00:00:56.640> trunk<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.510> even<00:00:57.600> know

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
pulmonary trunk but we don't even know

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.330 
pulmonary trunk but we don't even know
that<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> then<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.160> your<00:01:00.260> pulmonary

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
that and then this is your pulmonary

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.429 
that and then this is your pulmonary
arteries<00:01:02.340> wait<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.420> pulmonary<00:01:03.930> trunk<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
arteries wait the pulmonary trunk that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.679 
arteries wait the pulmonary trunk that
then<00:01:04.559> splits<00:01:04.949> into<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> arteries<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:06.510> on

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
then splits into the arteries because on

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.760 
then splits into the arteries because on
on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> book<00:01:07.500> F<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.670> die<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.810> okay

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
on the book F on the die on I know okay

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
on the book F on the die on I know okay
so<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.700> chunk<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.420> first<00:01:12.689> bit

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so this is really a chunk the first bit

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.600 
so this is really a chunk the first bit
is<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> trunk<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> then<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.920> splits<00:01:14.250> into<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is the trunk and then it splits into the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.100 
is the trunk and then it splits into the
artery<00:01:14.939> okay<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.689> would<00:01:15.869> be<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
artery okay so then this would be the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.999 
artery okay so then this would be the
trunk<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:17.600> then<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.750> goes<00:01:18.930> into<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
trunk but then it goes into your so

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.160 
trunk but then it goes into your so
these<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.220> pulmonary<00:01:21.000> arteries<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> then

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
these are pulmonary arteries and then

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.700 
these are pulmonary arteries and then
you<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.500> two<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.070> each<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:23.420> right<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.720> what

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you have two on each side right and what

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.270 
you have two on each side right and what
it<00:01:25.830> does<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.909> as<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.299> Bloods<00:01:27.570> leaving

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
it does so as it as the Bloods leaving

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
it does so as it as the Bloods leaving
the<00:01:29.280> arteries<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:30.659> your<00:01:30.869> lungs

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the arteries it's going into your lungs

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.929 
the arteries it's going into your lungs
right<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:32.070> your<00:01:32.189> lungs<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.880> on

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
right so your lungs your over here on

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.390 
right so your lungs your over here on
the<00:01:33.060> side<00:01:33.170> when<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> blood<00:01:34.590> goes<00:01:34.829> right<00:01:35.189> back

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the side when the blood goes right back

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.550 
the side when the blood goes right back
in<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.180> it's<00:01:36.360> got<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.540> flow<00:01:36.840> back<00:01:37.140> into<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
in because it's got a flow back into the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.210 
in because it's got a flow back into the
left<00:01:37.799> aigo<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.579> flows<00:01:38.939> into<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:40.220> pulmonary

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
left aigo it flows into the pulmonary

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.050 
left aigo it flows into the pulmonary
veins<00:01:41.850> right<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.280> pulmonary<00:01:44.729> veins

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
veins right so from the pulmonary veins

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
veins right so from the pulmonary veins
it<00:01:45.600> enters<00:01:46.079> into<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> left<00:01:47.070> atrium<00:01:47.810> okay<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it enters into the left atrium okay and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.499 
it enters into the left atrium okay and
from<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> let<00:01:50.310> go<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.549> trim<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.939> goes<00:01:51.090> into<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
from the let go to trim it goes into the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
from the let go to trim it goes into the
bicuspid<00:01:52.579> right<00:01:53.689> from<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> bicuspid<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.799> goes

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
bicuspid right from the bicuspid it goes

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.899 
bicuspid right from the bicuspid it goes
into<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.579> left<00:01:57.030> atrium<00:01:57.390> which<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.909> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
into the left atrium which is this the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.749 
into the left atrium which is this the
left<00:02:00.240> atrium<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> blood<00:02:01.530> travels<00:02:01.860> into

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
left atrium then the blood travels into

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
left atrium then the blood travels into
which<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:03.719> under<00:02:03.960> here

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
which is right under here

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.690 
which is right under here
it<00:02:05.159> travels<00:02:05.670> into<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.380> aorta<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.129> aortic

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it travels into the aorta the aortic

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.869 
it travels into the aorta the aortic
pulmonary<00:02:09.509> or<00:02:09.810> semilunar<00:02:10.379> valve<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.190> ortak

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
pulmonary or semilunar valve a ortak

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.660
