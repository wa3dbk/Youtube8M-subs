00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
this is the POV gear carbon fiber pole

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.350 
this is the POV gear carbon fiber pole
it's<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.840> standard<00:00:13.799> GoPro<00:00:14.130> pole<00:00:14.700> for<00:00:15.089> your

it's a standard GoPro pole for your
camera<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.650> made<00:00:16.980> out<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.310> carbon<00:00:17.699> fiber

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
camera but it's made out of carbon fiber

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.470 
camera but it's made out of carbon fiber
this<00:00:18.390> gives<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.900> just<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.939> it<00:00:20.939> just<00:00:21.270> gives<00:00:21.420> it

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
this gives it just this it just gives it

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.689 
this gives it just this it just gives it

a premium feel and you use this and you

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.300 
a premium feel and you use this and you
compare<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.359> an<00:00:24.480> aluminum<00:00:24.840> pole<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.560> even

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
compare it to an aluminum pole and even

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.400 
compare it to an aluminum pole and even
like<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.939> carbon<00:00:27.150> fiber<00:00:27.359> poles<00:00:27.599> lighter<00:00:27.900> it

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
like the carbon fiber poles lighter it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.370 
like the carbon fiber poles lighter it
just<00:00:28.650> feels<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.220> solid<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.810> feels

thing<00:00:36.829> let's<00:00:37.829> take<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.250> what<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.430> comes

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
thing let's take a look at what it comes

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:38.869 
thing let's take a look at what it comes
with

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
with

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.310 
with
so<00:00:38.969> basically<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> box<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.140> get<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
so basically out of the box you get the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.520 
so basically out of the box you get the
carbon<00:00:41.010> fiber<00:00:41.250> POV<00:00:41.910> gear<00:00:42.180> pole<00:00:42.480> there's<00:00:43.379> a

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
carbon fiber POV gear pole there's a

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.319 
carbon fiber POV gear pole there's a
strap<00:00:44.010> down<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> bottom<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.149> can

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
strap down here on the bottom so you can

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.819 
strap down here on the bottom so you can
use<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> wrist<00:00:45.870> strap<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
use it as a wrist strap it's got a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
use it as a wrist strap it's got a
rubberized<00:00:47.399> grip<00:00:47.850> here<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.600> then<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.809> got

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
rubberized grip here and then it's got

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.130 
rubberized grip here and then it's got
two<00:00:49.260> adjustment<00:00:49.890> points<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.690> untwist

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
two adjustment points so you can untwist

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.410 
two adjustment points so you can untwist
these<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.860> extend<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.489> each<00:00:53.670> segment<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
these to extend and each segment of the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
these to extend and each segment of the
pole<00:00:54.719> again<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> carbon<00:00:55.649> fiber<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.670> tighten

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
pole again is carbon fiber you tighten

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.590 
pole again is carbon fiber you tighten
these<00:00:57.120> down<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.660> twist<00:00:58.170> lock<00:00:59.300> untwist<00:01:00.300> here

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
these down so twist lock untwist here

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.429 
these down so twist lock untwist here
and<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.559> extend<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:03.439> so

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and you can extend just like that so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.289 
and you can extend just like that so
we've<00:01:05.040> seen<00:01:05.339> adjustment<00:01:05.790> systems<00:01:06.030> like<00:01:06.150> this

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
we've seen adjustment systems like this

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.890 
we've seen adjustment systems like this
before<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.680> twist<00:01:08.720> loosen<00:01:09.720> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
before it's all just twist loosen and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.140 
before it's all just twist loosen and
then<00:01:09.990> twist<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.650> locked<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> great

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
then twist it to locked in it's a great

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.370 
then twist it to locked in it's a great
adjustment<00:01:12.479> system<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.020> seems<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.350> work

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
adjustment system it seems to work

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.330 
adjustment system it seems to work
really<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:13.799> well

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
really really well

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
really really well
I<00:01:14.369> mean<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.150> haven't<00:01:15.630> had<00:01:15.840> anyone<00:01:16.049> complain

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I mean I haven't had anyone complain

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.640 
I mean I haven't had anyone complain
about<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.080> yeah<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.350> there's<00:01:19.530> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
about it and yeah so there's the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
about it and yeah so there's the
adjustment<00:01:20.040> system<00:01:20.159> down<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> end<00:01:21.140> it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
adjustment system down at the end it's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.890 
adjustment system down at the end it's
got<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.290> GoPro<00:01:22.619> tripod<00:01:23.250> mount<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
got a GoPro tripod mount this is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.539 
got a GoPro tripod mount this is
aluminum<00:01:25.170> tripod<00:01:25.770> mount<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.070> aluminum

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
aluminum tripod mount and aluminum

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
aluminum tripod mount and aluminum
tripod<00:01:26.909> mount<00:01:27.119> which<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.409> end<00:01:28.530> here

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
tripod mount which is on the end here

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.219 
tripod mount which is on the end here
and<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.310> removable<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> pole<00:01:30.869> itself

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
and it is removable so the pole itself

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.330 
and it is removable so the pole itself
actually<00:01:31.590> has<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.869> 1/4<00:01:33.869> by<00:01:34.079> 20<00:01:34.439> inch<00:01:34.619> thread<00:01:35.159> on

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
actually has a 1/4 by 20 inch thread on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.490 
actually has a 1/4 by 20 inch thread on
it<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.939> then<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> threads<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> tripod

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it and then it threads on to a tripod

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.130 
it and then it threads on to a tripod
mount<00:01:38.220> now<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:39.479> was<00:01:39.659> something<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.960> I've

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
mount now this was something that I've

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.420 
mount now this was something that I've
talked<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.829> different<00:01:40.950> reviews

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
talked about a lot of different reviews

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.940 
talked about a lot of different reviews
and<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> seems<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:43.020> pole<00:01:43.259> manufacturers

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and I seems like some pole manufacturers

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.840 
and I seems like some pole manufacturers
do<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.549> method<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.090> others<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
do this method and others do the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
do this method and others do the
built-in<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.500> GoPro

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
built-in like kind of have the GoPro

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
built-in like kind of have the GoPro
mount<00:01:50.220> built<00:01:50.850> into<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> end<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> pole<00:01:51.899> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
mount built into the end of the pole and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.920 
mount built into the end of the pole and
I<00:01:52.439> was<00:01:52.860> talking<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.000> owner<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.420> POV

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
I was talking to the the owner of POV

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.749 
I was talking to the the owner of POV
gear<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.439> he<00:01:55.890> told<00:01:56.070> me<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:56.189> at<00:01:56.369> she<00:01:56.460> what<00:01:56.610> he

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
blue loctite now blue loctite is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.920 
blue loctite now blue loctite is
removable<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.269> it's<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> hundred<00:02:29.810> percent

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
removable so it's not a hundred percent

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.809 
removable so it's not a hundred percent
permanent<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:30.500> what<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.709> does<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.790> just

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
permanent but what it does is it just

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.940 
permanent but what it does is it just
makes<00:02:32.000> sure<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:32.959> not<00:02:33.140> ever<00:02:33.470> going<00:02:33.830> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
makes sure that it's not ever going to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.680 
makes sure that it's not ever going to
loose<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.610> actually<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.030> remove<00:02:35.299> it<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
loose and you actually to remove it you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.479 
loose and you actually to remove it you
would<00:02:35.870> have<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.230> definitely<00:02:36.500> break<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.220> seal

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
would have to definitely break the seal

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.190 
would have to definitely break the seal
this<00:02:37.790> creates<00:02:38.120> not<00:02:38.360> impossible<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.930> do<00:02:39.049> but

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
this creates not impossible to do but

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.800 
this creates not impossible to do but
it's<00:02:39.830> something<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.250> stops<00:02:40.879> this<00:02:41.150> mount

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
it's something that stops this mount

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.059 
it's something that stops this mount
from<00:02:41.959> ever<00:02:42.200> coming<00:02:42.410> loose<00:02:42.739> oh<00:02:42.890> I'll<00:02:42.950> do<00:02:43.040> that

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
from ever coming loose oh I'll do that

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.680 
from ever coming loose oh I'll do that
right<00:02:43.370> now<00:02:43.580> we'll<00:02:43.940> get<00:02:44.030> out<00:02:44.150> our<00:02:44.269> little<00:02:44.480> cube

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
right now we'll get out our little cube

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.949 
right now we'll get out our little cube
of<00:02:44.810> Loctite<00:02:45.290> come<00:02:45.620> around<00:02:45.829> a<00:02:46.540> little<00:02:47.540> dab<00:02:47.750> on

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
of Loctite come around a little dab on

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.470 
of Loctite come around a little dab on
the<00:02:47.989> side<00:02:48.230> of<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.380> threads<00:02:48.650> just<00:02:48.829> like<00:02:49.160> that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
the side of the threads just like that

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.680 
the side of the threads just like that
then<00:02:50.480> we<00:02:50.630> get<00:02:50.750> our<00:02:50.930> tripod<00:02:51.530> mount<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.690> we

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
then we get our tripod mount and we

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.600 
then we get our tripod mount and we
screw<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:54.079> back<00:02:54.860> on<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:56.709> with<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.160> this

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
screw it back on and with that on this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.729 
screw it back on and with that on this
is<00:02:58.940> never<00:02:59.239> going<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.599> go<00:02:59.780> anywhere<00:03:00.140> until<00:03:00.349> we

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
is never going to go anywhere until we

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.990 
is never going to go anywhere until we
want<00:03:01.129> to<00:03:01.970> remove<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:03.340> other<00:03:04.340> than<00:03:04.549> that<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
want to remove it other than that the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.020 
want to remove it other than that the
pole<00:03:05.329> is<00:03:05.360> kind<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.250> nondescript<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.549> mean<00:03:07.760> it's

ounces and really this is one of my
favorite<00:03:30.680> lengths<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.280> poles<00:03:31.639> because<00:03:31.880> it's

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
favorite lengths of poles because it's

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.849 
favorite lengths of poles because it's
small<00:03:32.599> enough<00:03:32.630> or<00:03:33.049> in<00:03:33.139> short<00:03:33.380> enough<00:03:33.650> that<00:03:33.769> it

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the side or stopping them back so it's

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.610

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
shot so that's really all there is to

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.339 
shot so that's really all there is to
say<00:03:59.269> about<00:03:59.450> it<00:03:59.630> you<00:03:59.660> can<00:03:59.870> take<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.049> look<00:04:00.139> at<00:04:00.260> the

say about it you can take a look at the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.159 
say about it you can take a look at the
sample<00:04:00.560> shots<00:04:00.889> I<00:04:01.099> shot<00:04:01.400> again<00:04:02.239> as<00:04:02.450> always<00:04:02.810> when

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
sample shots I shot again as always when

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.020 
sample shots I shot again as always when
you<00:04:03.260> shoot<00:04:03.560> with<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.040> pole<00:04:04.310> mounted<00:04:04.639> camera

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.390 
you shoot with a pole mounted camera
it's<00:04:05.209> highly<00:04:06.019> highly<00:04:06.530> recommended<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.130> shoot

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
it's highly highly recommended to shoot

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.370 
it's highly highly recommended to shoot
a<00:04:07.750> 1440p<00:04:08.750> or<00:04:09.290> two<00:04:09.560> point<00:04:09.769> seven<00:04:10.099> four<00:04:11.060> by<00:04:11.180> three

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
a 1440p or two point seven four by three

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.990 
a 1440p or two point seven four by three
what<00:04:12.380> this<00:04:12.530> does<00:04:12.739> is<00:04:12.919> it<00:04:13.069> it<00:04:13.400> makes<00:04:13.639> it<00:04:13.849> gives

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
what this does is it it makes it gives

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.360 
what this does is it it makes it gives
you<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.120> wider<00:04:14.540> shot<00:04:15.319> basically<00:04:15.590> and<00:04:16.010> then<00:04:16.160> in

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
you a wider shot basically and then in

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.870

with<00:04:20.060> black<00:04:20.239> bars<00:04:20.479> inside<00:04:20.810> you<00:04:20.989> can<00:04:21.200> zoom<00:04:21.440> in

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
with black bars inside you can zoom in

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.580 
with black bars inside you can zoom in
on<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.130> shot<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.640> crop<00:04:23.419> out<00:04:23.659> the<00:04:23.719> portion<00:04:24.409> of

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
on that shot and crop out the portion of

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.620 
on that shot and crop out the portion of
a<00:04:24.680> shot<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.010> don't<00:04:25.250> want<00:04:25.490> in<00:04:25.700> my<00:04:26.210> case<00:04:26.270> what<00:04:26.599> I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
a shot you don't want in my case what I

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.220 
a shot you don't want in my case what I
tend<00:04:26.810> to<00:04:26.870> do<00:04:27.020> is

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
tend to do is

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.230 
tend to do is
shoot<00:04:27.410> 1440<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.280> then<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.460> normally<00:04:28.760> crop<00:04:29.030> out

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
shoot 1440 and then I normally crop out

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.420 
shoot 1440 and then I normally crop out
a<00:04:29.270> little<00:04:29.570> bit<00:04:29.690> I<00:04:29.930> cropped<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.980> shot<00:04:31.220> but<00:04:31.370> I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
a little bit I cropped the shot but I

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.950 
a little bit I cropped the shot but I
cropped<00:04:31.700> heavier<00:04:32.060> out<00:04:32.210> of<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.360> bottom<00:04:32.720> so<00:04:32.930> I

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
cropped heavier out of the bottom so I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.660 
cropped heavier out of the bottom so I
get<00:04:33.410> rid<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.740> pole<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.190> shot<00:04:34.430> and<00:04:34.550> this

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
get rid of the pole in the shot and this

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.120 
get rid of the pole in the shot and this
it<00:04:34.760> allows<00:04:34.880> me<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.150> create<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.480> an<00:04:36.020> image<00:04:36.890> very

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
it allows me to create a an image very

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.590 
it allows me to create a an image very
similar<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.640> which<00:04:37.880> people<00:04:38.060> capture

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
similar to that which people capture

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600 
similar to that which people capture
with<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.780> but<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.830> 3-way<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.460> that's

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
with the but the 3-way and that's

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.820 
with the but the 3-way and that's
supposed<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:40.910> be<00:04:41.060> kind<00:04:41.300> of<00:04:41.560> more<00:04:42.560> immersive

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
supposed to be kind of more immersive

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.260 
supposed to be kind of more immersive
because<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.370> don't<00:04:43.520> see<00:04:43.640> a<00:04:43.670> pole<00:04:43.940> in<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.120> but

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
because you don't see a pole in it but

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.940 
because you don't see a pole in it but
you<00:04:44.330> can<00:04:44.480> achieve<00:04:44.600> very<00:04:44.840> similar<00:04:45.530> results<00:04:45.860> by

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
you can achieve very similar results by

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.290 
you can achieve very similar results by
just<00:04:46.130> tilting<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.400> camera<00:04:46.460> up<00:04:46.730> a<00:04:46.760> little<00:04:46.910> bit

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
just tilting the camera up a little bit

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.390 
just tilting the camera up a little bit
shooting<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.900> wide<00:04:48.140> angle<00:04:48.500> and<00:04:48.860> then<00:04:48.950> cropping

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
shooting a wide angle and then cropping

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.280 
shooting a wide angle and then cropping
in<00:04:49.520> post<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.450> best<00:04:50.660> part<00:04:50.900> is<00:04:50.960> shooting<00:04:51.200> in

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
in post and the best part is shooting in

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.290 
in post and the best part is shooting in
1440<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.100> cropping<00:04:52.280> down<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.640> 1080<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.150> do

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
1440 and cropping down to 1080 you do

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.940 
1440 and cropping down to 1080 you do
not<00:04:53.450> even<00:04:53.780> lose<00:04:54.080> any<00:04:54.320> resolution<00:04:54.800> if<00:04:54.890> you

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
not even lose any resolution if you

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.840 
not even lose any resolution if you
shoot<00:04:55.480> 2.7<00:04:56.480> K<00:04:56.660> again<00:04:57.530> you<00:04:57.680> can<00:04:57.860> crop<00:04:58.070> that<00:04:58.310> and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.080 

not<00:05:01.850> lose<00:05:02.450> any<00:05:02.800> resolution<00:05:03.800> so<00:05:04.040> guys<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:04.910> was

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
not lose any resolution so guys this was
