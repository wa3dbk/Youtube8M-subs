the backend for assistance what I want
to<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.619> now<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.770> switch<00:00:17.100> gears<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.580> talk<00:00:17.820> a

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
to do now is switch gears and talk a

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.640 
to do now is switch gears and talk a
little<00:00:18.150> about<00:00:18.270> in<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.539> case<00:00:18.720> sort<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.289> PC

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
I've got a pretty interesting thing here

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.859 
I've got a pretty interesting thing here
this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.410> new<00:00:29.269> prototype<00:00:30.269> we're<00:00:30.449> working<00:00:30.750> on

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
this is a new prototype we're working on

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.720 
this is a new prototype we're working on
this<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.470> coming<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> labs<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
this is coming out of the labs this is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.340 
this is coming out of the labs this is
running<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> high-end<00:00:33.540> machine<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.960> notice

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
running on a high-end machine and notice

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 
running on a high-end machine and notice
like<00:00:34.559> what<00:00:34.890> I'm<00:00:35.010> about<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.550> start<00:00:35.910> doing<00:00:36.090> here

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
like what I'm about to start doing here

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
like what I'm about to start doing here
I<00:00:36.570> am<00:00:37.170> gonna<00:00:37.350> start<00:00:37.680> blowing<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.190> building

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
I am gonna start blowing this building

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.610 
I am gonna start blowing this building
apart<00:00:38.820> now<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.420> cool<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.410> is

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
apart now the cool thing about this is

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.970 
apart now the cool thing about this is
this<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.160> scripted<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.000> full-on

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
this is not scripted this is full-on

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.380 
this is not scripted this is full-on
deformation<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.160> building<00:00:44.460> now<00:00:45.030> things

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
deformation in this building now things

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.729 
deformation in this building now things
are<00:00:45.539> pretty<00:00:45.750> cool<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.410> I've<00:00:46.530> actually

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
are pretty cool here but I've actually

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.760 
are pretty cool here but I've actually
rigged<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.370> building<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.940> blow<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.739> what<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
rigged this building to blow and what I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.170 
rigged this building to blow and what I
mean<00:00:49.980> by<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.489> we're<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.850> just<00:00:51.090> start

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
mean by that is we're gonna just start

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.000 
mean by that is we're gonna just start
destroying<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.899> whole<00:00:52.050> building<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.710> so

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
destroying the whole building and so

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
destroying the whole building and so
whoops<00:00:53.430> don't<00:00:53.940> move<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.539> mouse<00:00:54.719> John<00:00:55.170> you'll

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
whoops don't move the mouse John you'll

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.619 
whoops don't move the mouse John you'll
notice<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> building<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> starting<00:00:57.570> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
notice that the building is starting to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:58.130 
notice that the building is starting to
come<00:00:57.840> down

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
come down

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.580 
come down
and<00:00:58.699> watch<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.730> frame<00:01:00.239> rate<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.629> frame<00:01:01.350> rate

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and watch that frame rate the frame rate

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
and watch that frame rate the frame rate
is<00:01:01.800> dropping<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.760> doing<00:01:03.090> an<00:01:03.239> incredible

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
is dropping we are doing an incredible

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
is dropping we are doing an incredible
number<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.260> calculations<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> physics

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
number of calculations on the physics

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.760 
number of calculations on the physics
the<00:01:06.210> geometry<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> rotation<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.619> all

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the geometry is the rotation of all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.440 
the geometry is the rotation of all
these<00:01:07.890> objects<00:01:08.369> as<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.060> down<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
these objects as is going down and

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
these objects as is going down and
you'll<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:10.830> overwhelms

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you'll see that this really overwhelms

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.359 
you'll see that this really overwhelms
this<00:01:11.909> machine<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:13.140> Steve's<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.010> same

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this machine now Steve's got the same

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.560 
this machine now Steve's got the same
app<00:01:14.610> running<00:01:14.909> over<00:01:15.210> here

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
app running over here

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
app running over here
yeah<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.590> we're<00:01:16.830> doing<00:01:17.070> something<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.460> little

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
yeah but we're doing something a little

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.969 
yeah but we're doing something a little
bit<00:01:17.880> different<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:18.689> using<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.350> cloud<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
bit different we're using the cloud and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.899 
bit different we're using the cloud and
a<00:01:20.280> collection<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.909> devices<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:22.340> do<00:01:23.340> cloud

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
a collection of devices to do cloud

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.730 
a collection of devices to do cloud
computation<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.930> why<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.470> start

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
computation and why don't you start

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.810 
computation and why don't you start
blowing<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> totally<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.520> gonna<00:01:26.640> start

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
blowing the totally I'm gonna start

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
blowing the totally I'm gonna start
shooting<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.180> building<00:01:27.570> up<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.500> like

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
shooting this building up and here like

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
shooting this building up and here like
these<00:01:29.220> are<00:01:29.430> high-end<00:01:29.640> main<00:01:30.119> gear<00:01:30.479> gaming<00:01:30.900> rigs

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
these are high-end main gear gaming rigs

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.569 
these are high-end main gear gaming rigs
these<00:01:31.200> aren't<00:01:31.439> small<00:01:31.590> machines<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.430> so

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
these aren't small machines and so

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.219 
these aren't small machines and so
they're<00:01:33.030> high-end<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.659> when<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
they're high-end but when you get to

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:34.819 
they're high-end but when you get to
this<00:01:34.409> level

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this level

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.440 
this level
let's<00:01:35.040> detonate<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> build<00:01:35.729> on<00:01:35.909> I'll<00:01:36.150> start

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
let's detonate the build on I'll start

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.120 
let's detonate the build on I'll start
the<00:01:36.540> detonation<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.560> thing<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> running

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
the detonation this thing is running

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.609 
the detonation this thing is running
much<00:01:38.490> much<00:01:38.820> faster<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.780> Steve<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.200> ready<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
much much faster for Steve are ready and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
much much faster for Steve are ready and
even<00:01:41.189> wet<00:01:41.610> after<00:01:42.060> he<00:01:42.150> detonates<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.689> building

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
even wet after he detonates the building

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.660 
even wet after he detonates the building
notice<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> building<00:01:44.130> starting<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> come

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
notice the building starting to come

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.109 
notice the building starting to come
apart

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
apart

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
apart
he<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.479> now<00:01:45.840> wander<00:01:46.320> around<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.799> let's<00:01:47.070> go

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
he can now wander around like let's go

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
he can now wander around like let's go
run<00:01:47.460> around<00:01:47.549> various<00:01:48.090> other<00:01:48.240> parts<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
run around various other parts like

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.840 
run around various other parts like
there's<00:01:49.470> some<00:01:49.680> great<00:01:49.979> stuff<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.640> shoes

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
there's some great stuff I like shoes

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.580 
there's some great stuff I like shoes
man<00:01:51.119> yeah<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.540> thing's<00:01:51.750> really<00:01:51.930> cool<00:01:52.049> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
man yeah this thing's really cool this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.120 
man yeah this thing's really cool this
thing<00:01:52.649> down<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.470> but<00:01:55.470> think<00:01:55.710> about<00:01:55.799> this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
thing down so but think about this

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.520 
thing down so but think about this
Camaro<00:01:56.790> I'm<00:01:57.030> treating<00:01:57.420> anything<00:01:57.869> moving<00:01:58.380> or

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
Camaro I'm treating anything moving or

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.469 
Camaro I'm treating anything moving or
not<00:01:58.680> but<00:01:58.890> that's<00:01:59.130> ever<00:01:59.310> ever<00:01:59.579> see<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.329> an

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
not but that's ever ever see and this an

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.600 
not but that's ever ever see and this an
entire<00:02:01.320> environment<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.280> blown<00:02:02.490> apart

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
entire environment can be blown apart

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.880 
entire environment can be blown apart
and<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.780> we're<00:02:03.930> really<00:02:03.960> saying<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
and what we're really saying is the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340 
and what we're really saying is the
power<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.579> cloud<00:02:05.820> did<00:02:06.119> enable<00:02:06.810> new<00:02:07.079> kinds

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
power of the cloud did enable new kinds

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
power of the cloud did enable new kinds
of<00:02:07.380> experiences<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.069> have<00:02:08.399> never<00:02:08.759> been

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
of experiences that have never been

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
of experiences that have never been
possible<00:02:09.330> even<00:02:09.959> if<00:02:10.349> we<00:02:10.470> had<00:02:10.649> multiple

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
possible even if we had multiple

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.530 
possible even if we had multiple
high-end<00:02:11.580> machines<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.090> these<00:02:12.180> things<00:02:12.390> we're

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
high-end machines and these things we're

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.230 
high-end machines and these things we're
talking<00:02:12.690> they<00:02:13.260> couldn't<00:02:13.680> do

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.270 

those<00:02:18.720> rotations<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.740> positional

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
those rotations the positional

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.160 
those rotations the positional
information<00:02:20.400> down<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.630> clients<00:02:22.020> where

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
information down to the clients where

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.750 
information down to the clients where
the<00:02:22.290> renderings<00:02:22.770> getting<00:02:23.070> done<00:02:23.220> I<00:02:23.400> think<00:02:23.640> it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the renderings getting done I think it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.580 
the renderings getting done I think it's
a<00:02:23.850> really<00:02:24.270> great<00:02:24.480> example<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> power<00:02:25.440> of

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
a really great example of the power of

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.440 
a really great example of the power of
the<00:02:25.680> cloud<00:02:25.890> no<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> real<00:02:26.520> nice<00:02:26.730> complement<00:02:27.210> this

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the cloud no a real nice complement this

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.970 
the cloud no a real nice complement this
is<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> good<00:02:27.870> connection<00:02:28.080> into<00:02:28.500> PC<00:02:28.770> gaming

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
is a good connection into PC gaming

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.730 
is a good connection into PC gaming
overall<00:02:29.460> we're<00:02:29.790> continuing<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:31.560> thing

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
overall we're continuing to that thing

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.520 
overall we're continuing to that thing
is<00:02:31.860> dead<00:02:32.070> yeah<00:02:32.610> two<00:02:33.600> frames<00:02:33.900> per<00:02:34.080> second<00:02:34.410> how

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
is dead yeah two frames per second how

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.290 
is dead yeah two frames per second how
to<00:02:34.590> kill<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.860> big<00:02:35.070> machine<00:02:35.190> we're<00:02:35.700> continuing

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
to kill a big machine we're continuing

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.930 
to kill a big machine we're continuing
to<00:02:36.330> work<00:02:36.480> on
