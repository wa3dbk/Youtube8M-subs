and then two snowmen eat here actually
he<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.710> writing<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.909> decided<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> try

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
he was writing this and I decided to try

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.569 
he was writing this and I decided to try
it<00:01:49.110> out<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.619> actually<00:01:49.770> works<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.189> good

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
it out and it actually works really good

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.399 
it out and it actually works really good
when<00:01:51.390> he's<00:01:51.509> facedown<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.590> he<00:01:53.189> liked<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:54.409> well

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
when he's facedown and he liked and well

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.590 
when he's facedown and he liked and well
basically<00:01:55.560> ways<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.219> face-down<00:01:56.520> defense

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
basically ways and face-down defense

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.280 
basically ways and face-down defense
positionings<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> face<00:01:57.990> up<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
positionings for the face up you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.510 
positionings for the face up you
destroyed<00:01:58.649> face-up<00:01:58.890> monster<00:01:59.310> on<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.430> field

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
destroyed face-up monster on the field

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.120 
destroyed face-up monster on the field
so<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.600> know<00:02:00.840> if<00:02:01.079> your<00:02:01.229> opponent<00:02:01.380> runs<00:02:01.680> into

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
so you know if your opponent runs into

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.800 
so you know if your opponent runs into
it<00:02:02.219> with<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> thunder<00:02:03.000> king<00:02:03.210> or<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> boggart

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it with like a thunder king or a boggart

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.170 
it with like a thunder king or a boggart
knight<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.590> kills<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.100> monster<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.790> he<00:02:05.909> sits

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
knight it kills in a monster and he sits

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.970 
knight it kills in a monster and he sits
there<00:02:06.299> because<00:02:06.630> he<00:02:06.689> has<00:02:06.780> 19<00:02:07.140> defense<00:02:07.439> which<00:02:07.649> is

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
there because he has 19 defense which is

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.800 
there because he has 19 defense which is
really<00:02:08.130> good<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.940> could<00:02:09.120> synchro<00:02:09.480> with<00:02:09.660> them

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
really good they could synchro with them

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.260 
really good they could synchro with them
