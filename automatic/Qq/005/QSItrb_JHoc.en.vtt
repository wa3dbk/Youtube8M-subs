the<00:00:30.250> way<00:00:30.340> it<00:00:30.460> mounts<00:00:30.730> up<00:00:30.850> is<00:00:31.090> just<00:00:31.390> once<00:00:32.230> the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
the way it mounts up is just once the

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
I kind of braced it up a little bit

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.049 
I kind of braced it up a little bit

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
there so just horse collar to frame and

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.880 
there so just horse collar to frame and

bracket from trail gear that I kind of

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.999 
bracket from trail gear that I kind of
modify<00:01:02.570> it<00:01:02.629> to<00:01:02.719> make<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.110> scoot<00:01:03.710> over<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.979> little

modify it to make it scoot over a little

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:05.469 
modify it to make it scoot over a little
bit<00:01:04.250> more

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
bit more

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.540 
bit more
in<00:01:05.810> case<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.140> don't<00:01:06.229> have<00:01:06.409> enough<00:01:06.650> room<00:01:06.830> which

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550

my<00:01:07.940> shop<00:01:08.210> was<00:01:08.390> in<00:01:08.810> the<00:01:09.560> way<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.300> works<00:01:11.300> good

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
my shop was in the way but works good

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.750 
my shop was in the way but works good
and<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.760> reason<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:14.060> put<00:01:14.270> that<00:01:14.360> in<00:01:14.570> was<00:01:14.840> because

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
and the reason I put that in was because

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.000 
and the reason I put that in was because
my<00:01:16.760> leaf<00:01:17.090> springs<00:01:17.450> were<00:01:17.630> getting<00:01:18.830> up

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
my leaf springs were getting up

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.499 
my leaf springs were getting up
took<00:01:20.000> tule<00:01:20.300> springs<00:01:20.360> off<00:01:20.720> of<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.960> half<00:01:21.680> of<00:01:21.920> the

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
took tule springs off of the half of the

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.700 
took tule springs off of the half of the
Pro<00:01:23.509> Pack<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:24.250> they<00:01:25.250> became<00:01:25.520> very<00:01:25.580> very<00:01:26.710> flexi

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
Pro Pack and they became very very flexi

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.300 
Pro Pack and they became very very flexi
just<00:01:28.550> how<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:28.640> wanted<00:01:29.060> them<00:01:29.210> but<00:01:29.479> I<00:01:30.070> got<00:01:31.070> this

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
just how I wanted them but I got this

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.830 
just how I wanted them but I got this
because<00:01:31.729> of<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.060> axle<00:01:32.450> wrap<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:35.450> I'm<00:01:35.600> still

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
because of the axle wrap so I'm still

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.650 
because of the axle wrap so I'm still
running<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:38.380> axle<00:01:39.380> wrap<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.740> gone<00:01:40.660> works
