00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:11.430
 hello today I want to show you how to make a 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:16.410
 Christmas tree with a good magazine 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.710
 we will start folding the leaves by 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.710
 half 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.940
 A) Yes 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.770
 and so with all 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.770
 let's go folding all the sheets 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.180
 well until we finish the magazine 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:50.850
 and we finished folding 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.720
 now we go to the last page the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.720
 we doubled also 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.850
 and we see at the beginning and we are going to double 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.850
 also the first 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.300
 this book that gives is very nice 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.970
 we also stayed as more than well design 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.250
 then we passed the first sheet and now 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.250
 we fold the sheet again 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.810
 if it was so 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.439
 and so we are going to do also with all 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.439
 the leaves 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.230
 against the biggest magazine 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 more closed more stupid is 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.900
 is our tree I think with this 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.250
 magazine we will fit the size 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.159
 good access good we keep recording and 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:02:01.210
 now I do fix the next step 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:03.450
 well let's end of doubles does not 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.539
 lack does not matter if it is not 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:12.659
 perfect perfect we double the last 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.970
 what are the caps we are going to donate 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:20.069
 as well 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.069
 and now we come to the first cup 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.450
 we have done this now let's see 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.859
 leaves 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.859
 let's go folding 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.329
 and now we enter the lapel 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.329
 And here 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.670
 we double 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.690
 and we enter the waves 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:06.299
 yes or yes after directly 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.299
 we enter 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.120
 and we look for the measure 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:20.060
 and so we will do with each sheet 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:24.360
 we are again and running 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:28.560
 and this is the last step 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.890
 well let's continue and now we will see 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.890
 how is it 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.069
 well let's finish with the leaves that 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.069
 they ask us 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:49.110
 the latter if you do double if 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.110
 you look at centrals that are made easier 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.970
 of this 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.240
 let's say a little 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.240
 Y 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.090
 now let's ride 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.930
 I 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.139
 this would be the tree 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.300
 let's take a roll of paper 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.280
 hygienic 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.350
 or a glass or whatever we want and we're going to 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:45.260
 form it or with red paper 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.210
 or with wrapping paper with what 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:53.650
 we want because this is going to be our 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.650
 foot to hold the tree 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.610
 good for it to be our our asks 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.610
 tree 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:12.100
 let's cover it is very simple let's 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.100
 Do it this way 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.069
 if we are going to give it a little touch like this 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.069
 of 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.940
 gift lancet 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.360
 d 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.360
 and here on the edge 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:43.070
 let's throw a little tail 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.980
 so that we can hold on 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.200
 to the flaps 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.980
 and 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.980
 and now 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:00.350
 we are opening we are organizing a 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.350
 little let's put some tail here 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.540
 Y 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.990
 let's center 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.800
 let's say to molars 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.889
 and the last thing we would have left would be to go 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.080
 decorating it 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:27.330
 for that we have sticks 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.659
 of these that sell in the stores of 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.659
 everything to one hundred 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.420
 The typical Chinese bazaars are easy 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.290
 of 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.290
 to hook 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.330
 we will go 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.919
 not like that 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.430
 you can choose these you can catch some 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:58.350
 that there is a pompom style 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:58.350
 as good then as we like 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:13.270
 this this tree I see it is a little 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:15.760
 more of how would you say design than the 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:20.520
 another that the other tells you to teach me 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.520
 the rather like for children 

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:28.760
 as a boy or a girl 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.520
 I believe that already 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:35.890
 so you can get an idea of ​​how 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.890
 is now this I will finish it 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:42.570
 I hope you liked it 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.800
 that you share them and thanks for 

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.800
 follow me to see you soon
