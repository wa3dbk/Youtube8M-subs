opposite side up here let's go ahead and
take<00:02:15.329> a<00:02:15.390> look<00:02:15.629> at<00:02:15.810> what<00:02:16.019> else<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.379> have<00:02:16.409> in<00:02:16.920> how

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
take a look at what else we have in how

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.830 
take a look at what else we have in how
to<00:02:17.819> get<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.629> out<00:02:19.819> I'm<00:02:20.819> of<00:02:21.150> course<00:02:21.329> read<00:02:21.629> the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to get this out I'm of course read the

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.530 
to get this out I'm of course read the
manual<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.970> when<00:02:23.970> i'm<00:02:24.090> going<00:02:24.209> to<00:02:24.299> leave<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
manual so when i'm going to leave the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.240 
manual so when i'm going to leave the
moment<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.049> usually<00:02:25.500> don't<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.829> what's<00:02:26.010> going

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
moment I usually don't know what's going

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.970 
moment I usually don't know what's going
on<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:27.540> there<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.170> see<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.590> got<00:02:28.709> rubber

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
on so there you can see it's got rubber

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.270 
on so there you can see it's got rubber
grommets<00:02:29.519> on<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.420> edges<00:02:31.049> here<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:31.859> you<00:02:32.040> put

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
grommets on the edges here so if you put

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.360 
grommets on the edges here so if you put
this<00:02:32.430> on<00:02:32.609> a<00:02:32.670> facedown<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:34.140> use<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.709> this

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
this on a facedown and use it like this

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.259 
this on a facedown and use it like this
it<00:02:35.879> will<00:02:36.090> take<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.659> protect<00:02:37.200> your<00:02:38.269> desktop

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
it will take and protect your desktop

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.319 
it will take and protect your desktop
what<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.140> cases<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.799> then<00:02:41.459> let's<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.909> for

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
what of the cases and then let's see for

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:52.009 
what of the cases and then let's see for
here<00:02:43.609> Toby<00:02:44.609> GAD<00:02:48.470> rare<00:02:49.700> ok<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.060> what<00:02:51.629> this<00:02:51.780> will

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
here Toby GAD rare ok so what this will

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.530 
here Toby GAD rare ok so what this will
do<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.200> act<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.799> conjunction<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.430> being<00:02:54.269> able

to<00:02:54.690> sit<00:02:54.840> with<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.200> device<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.799> being<00:02:56.099> able<00:02:56.220> to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
to sit with the device to being able to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.360 
to sit with the device to being able to
give<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.480> stand<00:02:57.840> back<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:59.189> looks

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
give you the stand back and it looks

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.050 
give you the stand back and it looks
like<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.670> also<00:03:00.060> acts<00:03:00.689> as<00:03:01.109> its<00:03:01.560> own<00:03:01.889> device<00:03:02.609> to

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
like it also acts as its own device to

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.699 
like it also acts as its own device to
give<00:03:03.720> you<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.930> stand<00:03:04.290> also<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.790> what<00:03:05.939> this<00:03:06.090> has

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
give you a stand also and what this has

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.360 
give you a stand also and what this has
on<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.980> back<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:09.569> little<00:03:10.379> stand<00:03:10.709> that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
on the back of it is a little stand that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.149 
on the back of it is a little stand that
you<00:03:11.579> can<00:03:11.760> see<00:03:12.030> there<00:03:12.439> and<00:03:13.439> what<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.799> will<00:03:13.889> do<00:03:14.129> is

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
you can see there and what it will do is

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.569 
you can see there and what it will do is
it<00:03:14.489> will<00:03:14.670> ratchet<00:03:15.680> between<00:03:16.680> several

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
it will ratchet between several

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.509 
it will ratchet between several
different<00:03:17.970> points<00:03:18.419> if<00:03:18.959> we<00:03:19.079> can<00:03:19.260> get<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.680> some

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
different points if we can get that some

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.569 
different points if we can get that some
different<00:03:20.849> points<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.239> will<00:03:21.359> ratchet<00:03:21.629> up

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
different points that will ratchet up

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.530 
different points that will ratchet up
and<00:03:23.579> down<00:03:23.849> and<00:03:24.590> by<00:03:25.590> doing<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.389> have

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
and down and by doing so you can have

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.659 
and down and by doing so you can have
several<00:03:27.780> different<00:03:27.959> angles<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:29.250> where<00:03:29.430> it

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
several different angles to where it

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.539 
several different angles to where it
will<00:03:29.819> hold<00:03:30.090> your<00:03:30.389> device<00:03:31.019> into<00:03:31.290> place<00:03:32.159> it's

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
will hold your device into place it's

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.909 
will hold your device into place it's
going<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.790> be<00:03:32.909> one<00:03:33.120> move<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.079> signs<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.709> you

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
going to be one move the signs that you

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.309 
going to be one move the signs that you
can<00:03:35.069> see<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.280> better<00:03:35.639> so<00:03:36.269> it<00:03:36.989> will<00:03:37.079> take<00:03:37.290> a

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
can see that better so it will take a

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.110 
can see that better so it will take a
mold<00:03:37.530> your<00:03:37.680> drive<00:03:37.919> so<00:03:37.949> you've<00:03:38.250> got<00:03:38.280> two

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
mold your drive so you've got two

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.789 
mold your drive so you've got two
separate<00:03:39.419> units<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.169> unit<00:03:40.620> and

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
separate units you have this unit and

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.780 
separate units you have this unit and
then<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:41.370> also<00:03:41.519> have<00:03:41.699> the<00:03:42.949> bigger<00:03:43.949> unit<00:03:44.340> that

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
then you also have the bigger unit that

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.369 
then you also have the bigger unit that
take<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.120> do<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.419> and<00:03:45.479> of<00:03:45.720> course<00:03:45.930> this<00:03:46.169> will

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
take and do this and of course this will

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.680 
take and do this and of course this will
do<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.680> up<00:03:47.099> and<00:03:47.340> down<00:03:47.489> vulture<00:03:48.150> device<00:03:48.419> you've

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
do it up and down vulture device you've

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.860 
do it up and down vulture device you've
got<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.900> ridge<00:03:49.290> right<00:03:50.069> here<00:03:50.400> speaking<00:03:51.000> Ely<00:03:51.329> post

the device now I believe Wiz is really
supposed<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.729> work<00:03:59.879> is<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:01.319> is<00:04:01.530> supposed<00:04:01.799> to

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
supposed to work is this is supposed to

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.059 
supposed to work is this is supposed to
go<00:04:02.129> into<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:03.000> lock<00:04:03.510> into<00:04:03.780> place<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.799> then
