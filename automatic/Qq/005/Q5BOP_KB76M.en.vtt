00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
feature is this one which it also does

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.479 
feature is this one which it also does
around<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.799> car<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:51.160> then<00:02:51.370> this

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
around the car like that and then this

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.180 
around the car like that and then this
