00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:56.400 

wherever<00:00:48.829> you're<00:00:49.070> supposed<00:00:49.309> to<00:00:49.399> look<00:00:49.579> old

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.200 

goodbye<00:00:57.040> noise<00:00:57.250> and<00:00:57.490> straight<00:00:57.670> out<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:58.030> or

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
goodbye noise and straight out this or

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.540 
goodbye noise and straight out this or
you<00:00:58.360> just<00:00:58.830> to<00:00:59.830> the<00:00:59.920> right<00:01:00.160> side<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.460> my<00:01:00.490> face

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
you just to the right side of my face

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.109 
you just to the right side of my face
great<00:01:01.450> for<00:01:01.750> a<00:01:01.780> check

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.850 

and<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> seemed<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.899> take<00:01:06.990> too<00:01:07.409> much<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.829> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and it seemed to take too much but I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.080 
and it seemed to take too much but I
think<00:01:07.890> once<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.399> starts<00:01:08.640> drying<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.060> can

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
think once it starts drying you can

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:21.359 
think once it starts drying you can
actually<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.170> feel<00:01:13.860> it

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.349 

so<00:01:21.850> let's<00:01:22.030> wait<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.299> few<00:01:22.479> seconds<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:25.240> what

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
so let's wait a few seconds and see what

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:36.160 
so let's wait a few seconds and see what
happens

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.110 

about<00:01:36.380> 20<00:01:36.740> seconds<00:01:37.220> in<00:01:37.370> we're<00:01:37.880> looking

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
about 20 seconds in we're looking

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:47.680 
about 20 seconds in we're looking
younger

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.020 

okay<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.050> technically<00:01:48.470> 40<00:01:48.950> seconds<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:49.790> come

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
okay so technically 40 seconds have come

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.000 
okay so technically 40 seconds have come
and<00:01:50.240> gone<00:01:50.420> I'm<00:01:50.870> just<00:01:51.170> gonna<00:01:51.290> go<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.530> little<00:01:51.860> bit

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
and gone I'm just gonna go a little bit

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.330 
and gone I'm just gonna go a little bit
closer<00:01:52.220> into<00:01:52.730> the<00:01:52.850> camera<00:01:53.240> and<00:01:53.300> see<00:01:53.510> if<00:01:53.600> we<00:01:53.720> can

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
closer into the camera and see if we can

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.830 
closer into the camera and see if we can
see<00:01:55.340> any<00:01:55.490> difference<00:01:56.000> is<00:01:56.180> now<00:01:56.480> we're<00:01:56.690> getting

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
see any difference is now we're getting

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.100 
see any difference is now we're getting
really<00:01:56.960> close<00:01:57.080> so<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.480> untreated

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
really close so this is the untreated

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.600 
really close so this is the untreated
side<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:03.190> versus<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.640> treated<00:02:05.090> side<00:02:06.400> I'm<00:02:07.400> just

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
side a versus the treated side I'm just

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.580 
side a versus the treated side I'm just
looking<00:02:07.820> in<00:02:07.910> my<00:02:08.000> camera<00:02:08.270> but<00:02:08.540> I<00:02:08.570> can<00:02:09.050> only<00:02:09.200> see

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
looking in my camera but I can only see

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.460 
looking in my camera but I can only see
a<00:02:09.619> soft<00:02:10.300> difference<00:02:11.300> in<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:11.990> side<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.320> might

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
a soft difference in this side it might

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.640 
a soft difference in this side it might
it<00:02:12.740> just<00:02:12.950> looks<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.220> little<00:02:13.310> more<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:14.440> bit<00:02:15.440> like<00:02:15.590> a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
it just looks a little more a bit like a

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.770 
it just looks a little more a bit like a
little<00:02:15.770> smoother<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.520> doesn't<00:02:16.730> look<00:02:16.850> as<00:02:17.030> my

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
little smoother it doesn't look as my

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.640 
little smoother it doesn't look as my
pores<00:02:18.080> are<00:02:18.260> as<00:02:18.440> deep<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:22.040> even<00:02:22.450> here

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
pores are as deep and even here

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.690 
pores are as deep and even here
especially<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.710> little<00:02:24.770> bit<00:02:24.950> under<00:02:25.130> my<00:02:25.160> eye<00:02:25.280> I

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
especially a little bit under my eye I

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.830 
especially a little bit under my eye I
didn't<00:02:25.850> go<00:02:25.940> too<00:02:26.090> far<00:02:26.120> right<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.600> this<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
didn't go too far right but this is the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.440 
didn't go too far right but this is the
untreated<00:02:27.350> side<00:02:27.670> versus<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.700> treated<00:02:29.210> side

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
untreated side versus the treated side

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.580 
untreated side versus the treated side
then<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:32.440> actually<00:02:33.440> think<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:33.770> Punk<00:02:34.010> works

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
then I actually think this Punk works

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.220 
then I actually think this Punk works
some<00:02:36.590> a<00:02:36.620> little<00:02:36.740> shiny<00:02:37.190> here<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.900> took<00:02:39.020> away

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
some a little shiny here so it took away

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.050 
some a little shiny here so it took away
some<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.650> dullness<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.310> this<00:02:40.550> side<00:02:40.790> and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
some of the dullness on this side and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.480 
some of the dullness on this side and
could<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.510> matted<00:02:41.870> me<00:02:42.020> out<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:45.400> well<00:02:46.400> you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
could have matted me out and well you

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.800 
could have matted me out and well you
know<00:02:46.610> maybe<00:02:46.760> we<00:02:46.970> have<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.120> winner

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
know maybe we have a winner

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.900 
know maybe we have a winner
so<00:02:48.590> everybody<00:02:48.920> it's<00:02:49.160> an<00:02:49.280> animal<00:02:49.580> or<00:02:49.700> so

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
so everybody it's an animal or so

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.640 
so everybody it's an animal or so
perhaps<00:02:50.420> everyone<00:02:50.780> can<00:02:51.020> actually<00:02:51.260> benefit

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
perhaps everyone can actually benefit

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.530 
perhaps everyone can actually benefit
from<00:02:51.890> them<00:02:52.100> guys<00:02:52.370> girls<00:02:52.970> you're<00:02:53.239> going<00:02:53.450> to
