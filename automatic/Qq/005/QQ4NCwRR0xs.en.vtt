00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.840
 frank how sour baby of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.320
 yes very sour i think we have a whole 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.139
 have left big mill but if 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.130
 qualify for the oil to win 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.230
 even the see tonight 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.600
 Yes to be to the yourself and our customers 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.340
 very moderate 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.810
 we wanted a better game than theirs 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.490
 but 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 low so many options to make them real 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.880
 to hurt and we don't have them with us 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.860
 grace is so so that was pretty fresh 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.030
 You have also reported ulcers and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.410
 I have to say in peace 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.930
 as much space as they got today 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.160
 suddenly get an eredivisie in you 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 then it seemed like a little bit 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 were surprised that there was so much space 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.100
 get in this actually not so good 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.950
 knew what you would do with that bonus 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.890
 you that space not what we actually it 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.750
 all seasons will see in December 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.350
 so again the case 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.280
 just not yes just not and yes it does 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.050
 pain must occur 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.460
 you had at the press conference last night 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.539
 talking about cleverness 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.470
 That is also what it is not giving you 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.210
 today not the smart year and year 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.210
 and I believe ultimately 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.480
 do you understand that it is that that 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.790
 believe not all agree 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.770
 no i don't understand because you are all 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.080
 circumstances are there at that moment 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.330
 before you 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.550
 that you can strike and you have to 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.220
 such as playing are like a team 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.990
 and that is what we are so 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.810
 I don't understand 100 very many guys 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.230
 who did not give the first one at home 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.460
 already taken a lot of tim with liqueur 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.960
 played 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 you started in the basics but in it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.890
 expect yes x 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.720
 yeah I hope of course a well 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.760
 she cared for and barked hospitality to scared 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.800
 its yes i just hoped it and 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.030
 finally Sunday I got it 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.010
 releasing you from a negative word 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.930
 right in your eyes 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.240
 yes i think i'll be right if i do 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.310
 if I laugh twice or that depends on me 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 in its place 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.970
 the trainer thought it was that too 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.730
 you are doing well this season that you 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.910
 good trains good plays with young ajax 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.430
 you also feel that you are developing now see 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.820
 this west was a confirmation and that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.040
 is nice went and yes that I still 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.680
 one thing always has to work but that i do 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.940
 have worked on things now in 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 this competition performers 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.000
 has emerged so please 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.610
 me there 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.769
 water heater it is the largest of bad luck 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.130
 the evening how is he doing 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.709
 yes that is the biggest stain of the evening 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.510
 pretty bad I think maybe fear 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.670
 of a cruciate ligament 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.130
 injury but you know how long that goes 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.930
 so I'm sick with that again 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.410
 honestly yes I just spoke and back 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.440
 yes this was not the not happy 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.239
 those who yes it is not that whole 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.430
 felt good and that 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.660
 scanning like having to wait does not look 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.190
 very good looking 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.170
 a draw or a defeat that had 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.420
 ultimately because apple loses 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.819
 It doesn't matter that much 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.680
 more bearable no, because I think we are 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.739
 must qualify today for the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.209
 We have Europa League together so you 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.099
 crazy you just have to learn from this 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.930
 type of competitions 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.300
 yes and in the end have too few 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.380
 of scholars we think this is another one 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.300
 whole other group as 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.880
 admit to manchester that i am so angry too 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.319
 we feel like comfort and we are there temporarily 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.090
 a reasonable rate still stands 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.950
 if they are really there from the first minute 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.190
 that in faith that it might still go on 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.530
 went against Mr United and this was one 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.420
 bit exactly the same as you 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.180
 played well that mission that stood well 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.450
 the butcher the room always with the good 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.670
 people and then we actually forget 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.830
 moving into pulling the first half 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.830
 and was the second half so I'm
