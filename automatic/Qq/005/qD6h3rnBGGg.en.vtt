trying to juggle tortilla and my phone

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.799 
trying to juggle tortilla and my phone
at<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.329> same<00:00:33.420> time

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
at the same time

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.750 
at the same time
Leslie<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> lopa<00:00:35.190> mechanism<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
Leslie thing is the lopa mechanism that

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
Leslie thing is the lopa mechanism that
locks<00:00:35.940> fall<00:00:36.390> into<00:00:36.630> place<00:00:36.800> now<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:37.950> listen

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
locks fall into place now if you listen

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.760 
locks fall into place now if you listen
carefully<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.730> hear<00:00:39.030> sand<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.290> stuff<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
carefully you hear sand and stuff and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.119 
carefully you hear sand and stuff and
that<00:00:41.430> stop<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.120> between<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.379> mechanism<00:00:43.890> if

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that stop and between the mechanism if

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.729 
that stop and between the mechanism if
you<00:00:44.219> listen<00:00:47.510> you<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.660> guys

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you listen you go guys

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.700 
you listen you go guys
hold<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.760> up<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.090> stuff<00:00:51.500> it's<00:00:52.500> getting

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
hold it get up and stuff it's getting

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.619 
hold it get up and stuff it's getting
stuck<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
stuck in there so that's what the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
stuck in there so that's what the
possession<00:00:55.020> looks<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.379> when<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.710> battery

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
possession looks like when the battery

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.700 
possession looks like when the battery
is<00:00:56.219> locked<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> police

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
is locked then the police

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.279 
is locked then the police

down guys if it went them and show you
from<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.909> state<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:07.670> as<00:01:08.670> your<00:01:08.909> sake<00:01:09.119> Lynn

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
from the state so as your sake Lynn

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
from the state so as your sake Lynn
among<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:10.170> they<00:01:10.350> thought<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
among all they thought and then what I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.710 
among all they thought and then what I
was<00:01:11.640> getting<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.450> who<00:01:12.750> raid<00:01:13.110> they<00:01:13.500> are

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
was getting in that we who raid they are

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.240 
was getting in that we who raid they are
basically<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.960> fact<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.619> whole<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
basically the fact that the whole is the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.780 
basically the fact that the whole is the
mechanism<00:01:17.549> that's<00:01:18.030> holding<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> guys

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
mechanism that's holding the so you guys

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.660 
mechanism that's holding the so you guys
can't<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.210> expertly<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> let's<00:01:23.549> be

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
can't get expertly for you so let's be

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.340 
can't get expertly for you so let's be
back<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.689> see<00:01:24.869> there's<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.140> wire

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
back here as you can see there's a wire

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.910 
back here as you can see there's a wire
earlier

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
earlier

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.060 
earlier
it<00:01:26.250> basically<00:01:26.430> tugs<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.420> battery<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.140> keep

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it basically tugs on the battery to keep

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.249 
it basically tugs on the battery to keep
it<00:01:29.250> locked<00:01:29.430> into<00:01:29.790> place<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> older<00:01:31.079> ball

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
it locked into place so the older ball

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.420 
it locked into place so the older ball
once<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.950> locked

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
once it's locked

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.670 
once it's locked
there's<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> hole<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.200> basically<00:01:34.200> all<00:01:36.680> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
there's a hole here basically all the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.450 
there's a hole here basically all the
moisture<00:01:39.500> nothing<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.619> getting<00:01:40.829> them<00:01:41.100> through

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
moisture nothing is getting them through

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.539 
moisture nothing is getting them through
that<00:01:41.759> whole<00:01:42.030> rate<00:01:42.540> there<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.310> we<00:01:44.340> come

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that whole rate there and if we come

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.160 
that whole rate there and if we come
round<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> look<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.450> actual<00:01:45.780> unit<00:01:46.049> with

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
round and look and the actual unit with

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
round and look and the actual unit with
the<00:01:46.290> battery<00:01:46.560> no<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> know<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.240> able

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the battery no I know you will be able

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.760 
the battery no I know you will be able
to<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.860> dot<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.880> water<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.899> stuff

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
to see dot and that's of water and stuff

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.010 
to see dot and that's of water and stuff
and<00:01:52.979> there<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.149> freaking<00:01:54.930> out

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
and there so I'm actually freaking out

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.240 
and there so I'm actually freaking out
though<00:01:55.170> because<00:01:55.200> whenever<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.799> had<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.100> take

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
though because whenever I had to take

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.550 
though because whenever I had to take
the<00:01:56.310> battery<00:01:56.610> off<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.909> charger<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:58.200> wall<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the battery off the charger the wall I

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.530 
the battery off the charger the wall I
could<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.950> them<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.520> prongs<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.270> cause

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
could get them to the prongs and cause

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.429 
could get them to the prongs and cause
it<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.750> short-circuit<00:02:01.500> when<00:02:02.070> mo<00:02:02.280> or<00:02:03.439> something

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
it to short-circuit when mo or something

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:04.789 
it to short-circuit when mo or something
like<00:02:04.560> that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
like that

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.770 
like that
as<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.610> see<00:02:05.759> those<00:02:05.939> that's<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.299> duck<00:02:06.540> in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
as you can see those that's a duck in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.770 
as you can see those that's a duck in
the<00:02:07.409> corner<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.280> all<00:02:08.670> around<00:02:08.849> then<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the corner and all around then there and
