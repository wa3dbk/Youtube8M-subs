the size of the bag and I covered it
with<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.180> with<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.900> bond<00:02:51.109> paper<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.890> wrapped

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
with the with a bond paper and wrapped

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.289 
with the with a bond paper and wrapped
it<00:02:52.879> in<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.720> scotch<00:02:54.290> tape<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.519> have<00:02:56.000> my<00:02:56.150> own

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
it in in scotch tape and I have my own

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.140 
it in in scotch tape and I have my own
you<00:02:57.109> know<00:02:59.140> improvised<00:03:00.140> bag<00:03:00.739> shape<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:01.849> put

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
you know improvised bag shape so I put

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.670 
you know improvised bag shape so I put
this<00:03:02.239> on<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.450> bottom<00:03:02.690> of<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.019> bag<00:03:03.230> just

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
this on the bottom of the bag just

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.339 
this on the bottom of the bag just
because<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.069> don't<00:03:04.489> like<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.790> saggy<00:03:05.030> look<00:03:05.420> I

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
because I don't like the saggy look I

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.400 
because I don't like the saggy look I
think<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:07.010> smarter<00:03:07.730> if<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.540> bad<00:03:08.750> maintains

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
think it's smarter if the bad maintains

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.550 
think it's smarter if the bad maintains
its<00:03:09.709> definite<00:03:10.190> shape<00:03:10.780> plus<00:03:11.780> if<00:03:12.049> you<00:03:12.170> have<00:03:12.290> so

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
its definite shape plus if you have so

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.319 
its definite shape plus if you have so
much<00:03:12.709> on<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.010> bag<00:03:13.160> already<00:03:13.489> I<00:03:13.669> don't<00:03:14.000> want<00:03:14.180> I

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
much on the bag already I don't want I

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.650 
much on the bag already I don't want I
don't<00:03:14.359> want<00:03:14.810> it<00:03:15.049> to<00:03:15.319> sag<00:03:16.069> on<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.340> bottom<00:03:16.669> one

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
don't want it to sag on the bottom one

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.720 
don't want it to sag on the bottom one

you have too much on the bag it has a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.800 
you have too much on the bag it has a

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
tendency to sag on the top part and what

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.569 
tendency to sag on the top part and what
I<00:03:29.840> mean<00:03:30.169> by<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.880> know<00:03:32.030> since<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
I mean by that is you know since the

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:39.339 
I mean by that is you know since the
this<00:03:34.579> the<00:03:34.849> straps<00:03:35.239> are<00:03:37.630> attached<00:03:38.630> on<00:03:38.959> this

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
this the straps are attached on this

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.699 
this the straps are attached on this
part<00:03:39.709> from<00:03:40.700> from<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.660> part<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.109> this<00:03:42.290> but<00:03:42.560> it

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
part from from this part of this but it

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.949 
part from from this part of this but it
has<00:03:42.739> a<00:03:42.919> tendency<00:03:43.310> to<00:03:43.910> be<00:03:44.030> pulled<00:03:44.389> down<00:03:44.510> like

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
has a tendency to be pulled down like

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.610 
has a tendency to be pulled down like
this<00:03:45.260> if<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:46.250> bag<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.669> too<00:03:46.700> heavy<00:03:46.910> I've<00:03:47.599> seen<00:03:48.380> a

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
this if the bag is too heavy I've seen a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.370 
this if the bag is too heavy I've seen a
few<00:03:49.040> bags<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.880> are<00:03:50.030> quite<00:03:50.299> old<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.109> maybe

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
few bags that are quite old and maybe

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.080 
few bags that are quite old and maybe
you<00:03:51.590> know<00:03:51.709> the<00:03:51.889> owners<00:03:52.190> are<00:03:52.400> putting<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:52.940> much

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
you know the owners are putting so much

you know the owners are putting so much
stuff<00:03:53.419> in<00:03:53.720> it<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.950> I'll<00:03:55.639> be<00:03:55.819> careful<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:56.359> that

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
stuff in it and I'll be careful on that

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.220 
stuff in it and I'll be careful on that
I<00:03:56.870> tried<00:03:57.379> to<00:03:57.650> be<00:03:57.889> very<00:03:58.849> minimalist<00:03:59.660> in<00:03:59.959> terms

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
I tried to be very minimalist in terms

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
I tried to be very minimalist in terms
of<00:04:00.530> bringing<00:04:00.829> stuff<00:04:01.310> in<00:04:01.519> my<00:04:01.669> bag<00:04:01.849> and<00:04:03.129> you<00:04:04.129> know

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
of bringing stuff in my bag and you know

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.800 
of bringing stuff in my bag and you know
maybe<00:04:04.430> that's<00:04:04.730> one<00:04:05.030> thing<00:04:05.389> that<00:04:05.660> you<00:04:05.780> guys

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
maybe that's one thing that you guys

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.369 
maybe that's one thing that you guys
might<00:04:06.410> want<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:07.389> be<00:04:08.389> careful<00:04:08.599> about<00:04:08.900> as<00:04:09.169> well

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
might want to be careful about as well

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.720 
might want to be careful about as well
I've<00:04:10.040> read<00:04:10.370> some<00:04:11.410> some<00:04:12.410> threads<00:04:12.889> in<00:04:13.340> some

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
I've read some some threads in some

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.159 
I've read some some threads in some
forums<00:04:14.239> as<00:04:14.389> well<00:04:14.569> as<00:04:14.690> if<00:04:14.810> these<00:04:15.370> tabs<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:17.750> side

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
forums as well as if these tabs the side

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.900 
forums as well as if these tabs the side
tabs<00:04:18.530> tend<00:04:19.099> to<00:04:19.370> curl<00:04:19.729> up<00:04:20.680> after<00:04:21.680> a<00:04:21.709> while<00:04:21.979> and

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
tabs tend to curl up after a while and

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.610 
tabs tend to curl up after a while and
the<00:04:22.970> reason<00:04:23.330> for<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.660> is<00:04:23.990> when<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:26.260> zip<00:04:27.260> and

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
the reason for that is when you zip and

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.330 
the reason for that is when you zip and
unzip<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.580> bag<00:04:28.730> sometimes<00:04:29.360> you<00:04:29.870> tend<00:04:30.170> to<00:04:30.350> to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
unzip the bag sometimes you tend to to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.170 
unzip the bag sometimes you tend to to
hold<00:04:31.670> on<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.300> side<00:04:32.510> tabs<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.730> might<00:04:34.910> want

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
hold on the side tabs and you might want

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.730 
hold on the side tabs and you might want
to<00:04:35.240> refrain<00:04:35.720> from<00:04:35.930> doing<00:04:36.140> that<00:04:36.440> because

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
to refrain from doing that because

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.340 
to refrain from doing that because
that's<00:04:37.130> gonna<00:04:37.550> cause<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.330> side<00:04:38.600> tabs<00:04:38.870> to<00:04:39.110> curl

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
that's gonna cause the side tabs to curl

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.280 
that's gonna cause the side tabs to curl
up<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:40.010> when<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.970> back<00:04:41.150> when<00:04:41.750> the<00:04:41.840> bag<00:04:41.990> looks

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
up and when the back when the bag looks

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.190 
up and when the back when the bag looks
older<00:04:43.450> definitely<00:04:44.450> you<00:04:44.570> don't<00:04:44.690> want<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.020> see

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
older definitely you don't want to see
