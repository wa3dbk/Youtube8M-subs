and<00:02:38.590> again<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.250> does<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.510> we<00:02:40.599> know<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.870> have

it to be it's moving how we expected to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.030 
it to be it's moving how we expected to
move<00:02:45.489> there's<00:02:46.060> nothing<00:02:46.450> unusual<00:02:46.599> here<00:02:47.139> so<00:02:47.859> why

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
move there's nothing unusual here so why

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.220 
move there's nothing unusual here so why

support<00:04:19.090> of<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.599> okay<00:04:20.019> interesting<00:04:20.380> but<00:04:20.829> what

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
are the counter arguments have you

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.480 
are the counter arguments have you
thought<00:04:22.630> about<00:04:22.690> that<00:04:23.080> if<00:04:23.229> you<00:04:23.289> thought<00:04:23.500> what
