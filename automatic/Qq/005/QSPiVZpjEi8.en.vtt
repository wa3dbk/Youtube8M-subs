other<00:00:53.230> wheels<00:00:53.470> so<00:00:54.100> these<00:00:54.970> don't<00:00:55.210> have<00:00:55.449> a<00:00:55.480> very

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
other wheels so these don't have a very

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.450 
other wheels so these don't have a very
long<00:00:55.900> life<00:00:56.199> so<00:00:56.860> if<00:00:56.980> you're<00:00:57.070> looking<00:00:57.160> for<00:00:57.309> a

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
offset these wheels do flat spot a lot

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.929 
offset these wheels do flat spot a lot
easier<00:01:26.590> than<00:01:26.770> any<00:01:27.070> other<00:01:27.280> wheel<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:27.790> I've

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
easier than any other wheel that I've

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.960 
easier than any other wheel that I've
written<00:01:28.689> before<00:01:28.960> because<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.740> their<00:01:29.979> super

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
so what I think about these wheels they

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.820 
so what I think about these wheels they
they<00:01:46.479> kick<00:01:46.720> into<00:01:46.899> your<00:01:47.110> slide<00:01:47.319> really<00:01:47.619> nicely

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830
