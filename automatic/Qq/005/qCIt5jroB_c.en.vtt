 difference popularity withdrawal 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 and it's true that popular there are many idols because the background codes 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.310
 what happens is that 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.640
 percent i 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.010

 in an idol or simply someone known 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.480
 i 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:13.819

 and this is or not next to another truck 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.859
 then this one comes from a person tells me 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.629

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.439
 the month goes well 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.929
 that will ask us to be lighter 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.199
 look, I say 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:44.529

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.549
 always so kind 1 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.369

 valero give a forbidden round 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.449
 he wanted to preserve the solidity of an amount owed 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:08.430
 this 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.430
 When I finish approving, come and change it 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.539
 and he took the van approved 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:16.989
 he returned with the whole family 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.309

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:22.309

 Alejandro María 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:32.449
 percent from 1 to 10 singh would you give to palm frames like 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.020
 host 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.020
 while you must add a severe 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.180
 percent got a bad time 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.909
 because he rules and you have to know how to manage 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.120
 and he has more courage 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.189
 what to know how to handle and courage or in does not define much 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.840
 if he had seen the old era touched the one that touched the old 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.479
 they would have done well 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.589
 now not because he mishandles 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.639
 bad does not know how to drive 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.639
 they should not cloth data records 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:25.809
 there is a deeper more 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:27.530
 this year in elche 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.990
 by the way the sky 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.389
 i my question is another strategy in the peña the mens technician healthy and well 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.620
 Argentines 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.620
 and above all increase women 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.180
 good question 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.559
 the Argentines 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:48.439
 They are very skilled with the steering wheel and others but they drive very badly we drive very badly 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.080
 extremely bad 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.189
 percent 

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:55.310
 we are the worst 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.699
 country 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:59.699
 driving down the street 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:02.219
 and the women 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.559
 they were driving 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.719
 fairly good 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.029
 were incorrect they complied with the traffic laws or ceao 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.400
 but men managed to make them worse like us 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.400
 so this unfortunately wrong we are very bad 

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:25.179
 This costs what you see every day Murray from behind the other 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.560
 I travel a lot of work how families are destroyed in a second 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.289
 this on television by television 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:36.110
 but 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.650
 We believe that we do not 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.740
 efe is not my case 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.740
 to me this saved my life to the extent of security 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:48.599
 and that must be a secret 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.479
 the one that really saved my life 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:54.710
 it was my family 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.710
 and my granddaughter I just to watch play 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.119
 I return slowly atadito 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:03.680
 I comply with all traffic regulations 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.009
 I killed her because colorado 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.779
 It is the secret 

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:10.980
 I can not imagine this 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.139
 to paul 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.659
 or manuela telling my grandson to my granddaughter 

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:16.930
 this 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.870
 the grandfather does not come base he went the trunk of a scanner has reassured to lose 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.449
 per animal 

00:07:23.449 --> 00:07:25.509
 it does not enter my head 

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:27.270
 so 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.270
 of course on that side he found it 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.510
 mohsén shaalan spoke of a face more emotion the emotional moment at 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:36.630
 margin of difference
