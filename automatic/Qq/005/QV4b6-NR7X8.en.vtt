00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:17.039
 tutorial on how to get the mother of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:22.140
 You endless looking, you have to 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:29.609
 make a hole looks for 3 1 o os 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.730
 materials are the big one is 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.130
 pine oak wood board 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:40.230
 and eucalyptus a war in the jungle 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:51.120
 things also will not need before 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:57.960
 Tony is a testoni repeater too. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:05.600
 they will need a launcher and also a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.600
 button a middle-of-the-network story 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.689
 To start, let's put rodriguinho 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.689
 on here 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:30.770
 who sees the business there also if you 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:34.070
 want to see this tutorial better than 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:39.440
 this flight on the canal of vinicius 13 explains 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:42.800
 The VinÃ­cius channel is right on the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.900
 description well 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.960
 First you're going to do it here. 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.210
 puts a redstone rate on the button 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.850
 down here 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:02:00.490
 from there behind what is the daiichi 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:03.860
 put it like oak so it's you 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.560
 Legs do not put repeaters here 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.560
 so everyone level 4 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:23.290
 Just to warn you, it's a little dot. 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:26.319
 point 1 of level 4 jo 10 will put 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.250
 Our story here put four more 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:33.150
 Estonian network competitors quito 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 all on level 4 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.180
 hence the quiche will put a torch 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:53.790
 here is already putting a repeater day 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:58.530
 available 3 the smell giving us the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:02.040
 right did not do a wrong thing in the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.040
 disk ok 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.670
 on here 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.220
 I do not know if I know 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:20.450
 So you are also a dynamite. 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:24.620
 have intel that you just have only have to 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.160
 to be explosive was what I have here and a 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.840
 a drop launcher fits the diamond 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:41.960
 a diamond but first leaving the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:43.040
 inventory as well as making this bug is 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.860
 simple 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:51.160
 you stay here so the side that most 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.160
 or less 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.440
 push the button puts the diamond in. 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.460
 of law 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:11.500
 Vixi and I'll see if it works for us . 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:16.070
 Dance there, guys, how did I do it? 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.160
 only I could only duplicate not much 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.020
 I could only duplicate 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.270
 Only the mother is gone now let's try 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.080
 again 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.080
 I think it went wrong 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:36.740
 now I know if I'll see if I've done any 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:43.270
 or something wrong or something has 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.270
 I'm wrong, scheyla, I see it. 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.370
 where it places the diamond first 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.850
 button presses a button 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:57.780
 hence you have when the rate is from edson 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:00.150
 meet you will be doing is online 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.180
 I'll show a better way of how 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:10.170
 come from here festive diamond quickly 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:18.450
 he can fall to the ground or he can stay here 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:25.320
 most likely I do not even know if the 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:32.700
 button and there 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:35.820
 hence I just could not do this bug 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.890
 but who congratulates 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.320
 I think it's better if they do not see each other. 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:46.640
 video of vinicius 13 he explains well 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.640
 better he who saw this bug 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.919
 I hope you like it, but I'll tell you again 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.250

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.560
