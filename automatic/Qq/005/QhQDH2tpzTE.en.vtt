00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:06.430
 body 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.070

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.820
 girl so beautiful in every sense of 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.620
 the word I think she wants to 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.239
 keep growing in music is 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.220
 willing to do big things during 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.740
 more than 12 hours of work in the and wisin 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.430
 they merged their talent without a doubt 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.430

 Latinos to Latinos we like 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.440
 rumbear until dawn then I think 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.110
 which is a song that can all be 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.870
 like everyone we like the rumba 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.340
 and take a break so this video I think 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.440
 that they will really like it a lot 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.260

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.450
 ingredients of this video you are looking for 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.650
