 Hello , doom with you today

 look left again namely set 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.200
 from the series the avengers era of altron is a set 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.710
 called iron man against 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.900
 Altrona Poleur Warm 76 029 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.550
 Well, the box itself looks like this 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:38.590
 logo the avengers era of altron ligal 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.430
 edishn visited her from the marvel line 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.460
 super heroes 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.750
 the height of the image of the set itself is here 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.690
 side on different languages ​​again here 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.309
 such an icon for children over three years old 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.800
 more precisely from 3 years 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.870
 and here is the marvel logo 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.280
 I also liked the set 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.839
 from this line called hulkbuster 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.060
 I think so called there enters 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.080
 hulkbaster iron man black widow 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.370
 But in my opinion Altron is also Hulk in general 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.500
 such a cool set but his 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.049
 Unfortunately there was not on that site where 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.799
 ordered on may appear order 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.159
 maybe his 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.320
 but today we look at this set so 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.579
 what let's open up let's see what 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:34.439
 actually there inside we press on 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.439
 this bitch and how to open 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.520

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:56.590

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:04.690

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.510
 similar to this figure that i have 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.570
 from the company diku that is a copy of lego 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.480
 then we compare what's so different 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:34.060
 original so to speak copies and here 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.290
 still different so to say sets 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.819

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.560

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.220
 I don't know what to call it 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:09.579
 the device yes that's how it all looks 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:14.799
 It seems like in the picture so look gave 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:16.840
 legs are sticking out that's all done so 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.150
 way that you can see here and altron 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.400
 sits such a main type with my antenna 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.540
 here you can pull it out 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.470
 cut hell altron here it 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.470
 legs are attached now connect them 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:39.070
 here legs are disconnected 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.990
 here 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:52.130
 loaded as it were a little closer 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:55.010
 and puts on here 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.680
 such an altron some antennas that 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.700
 crooked knows he seems to be all right 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.700
 did everything according to the instructions 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:10.090
 Here is such a way Altron Masochka his 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:17.270
 similar to captain america's helmet 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:19.720
 future closer what concerns here 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.720
 altron 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.100
 ring 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:35.870
 here we have this altron now 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.259
 henchmen so say okay so what 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:47.349
 here 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:47.349
 oh on the side here these legs connect 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.499
 in fact this is robot tony stark when 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:05:02.719
 how did you in the movie have which altron 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:05:02.719
 look reprogrammed like that 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.680
 so this looks like to you 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.720
 the henchmen of altron are exactly the same 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.610
 actually like altron itself they are all 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:21.300
 the same for some reason did not do separately 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:28.040
 up to some movie bolt at the end already here 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:32.180
 that's about the robots themselves 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.180
 at-at aircraft 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.259
 Well, now actually go to Tony 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.180
 starku iron man here on such 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.830
 tricks here somehow there is a jumping mechanism 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.740
 some kind of well I don’t have to 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.960
 I'm going to play maxim there already for 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.909
 children who want to play these figures i 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.590
 just put them on the shelf and 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.590
 let them stand can be admired 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:07.599
 actually tony stark we are so 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:10.440
 Now we will take away the son is removed before 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:10.440
 removed 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:17.159
 so he has two angry facial expressions so 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.159
 this is tony 

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:24.449
 such a helmet to the window 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.600
 yes my god it is impossible not about 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.770
 such 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.770
 tony stark helmet 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.530
 feet 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:58.030
 tony stark actually this 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:03.480
 it turns out a set of these throne sheep 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:07.420
 well, stop, don't want to stand 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:12.510
 damn okay here comes this one 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:15.010
 the apparatus their flying toni stark and 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:18.670
 Altron with his two 

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.320
 robots actually everything that goes into 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.420
 this set is pretty good 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.140
 Considering that I bought this set of everything 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:29.410
 only for say 325 rubles I think 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:33.100
 it is very cheap the most minimal then 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:36.970
 star wars set worth 800 in my 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.130
 rubles 4 figures and finish the machine and so 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.870
 Further more expensive so that I am very 

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.600
 great as a set for such a price 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:47.380
 naturally thanks to coupons it all 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.430
 bought so it costs us 899 in my opinion before 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:54.760
 children's world in general thousands 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:59.610
 so I recommend this set to everyone 

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.610
 thank you all for watching
