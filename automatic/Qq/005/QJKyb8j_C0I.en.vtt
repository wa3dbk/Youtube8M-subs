you can hide that as well also a new
thing<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.100> short<00:03:53.610> embedded<00:03:54.299> battery

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
thing is short embedded battery

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.840 
thing is short embedded battery
percentage<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.620> if<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.250> turn<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:56.610> only

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
percentage so if you turn that only

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.150 
percentage so if you turn that only
guessing<00:03:57.209> severe<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.600> percentage<00:03:58.470> right

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
guessing severe that percentage right

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.940 
guessing severe that percentage right
embedded<00:03:59.730> right<00:03:59.880> within<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.420> battery<00:04:01.290> icon<00:04:01.500> I

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
embedded right within the battery icon I

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.820 
embedded right within the battery icon I
it's<00:04:02.459> kind<00:04:02.760> of<00:04:02.850> tiny<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:03.570> you<00:04:04.230> know<00:04:04.350> it's<00:04:04.560> good

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
it's kind of tiny but you know it's good

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.490 
it's kind of tiny but you know it's good
it's<00:04:05.070> nice<00:04:05.390> alright<00:04:06.390> so<00:04:06.720> in<00:04:06.900> develop<00:04:07.320> reeve

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
it's nice alright so in develop reeve

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.009 
it's nice alright so in develop reeve
you<00:04:07.680> too<00:04:07.920> we<00:04:08.250> actually<00:04:08.640> got<00:04:09.019> memory

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
you too we actually got memory

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.140 
you too we actually got memory
management<00:04:10.350> as<00:04:10.620> well<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.640> can<00:04:11.820> see<00:04:12.000> we

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
management as well so as you can see we

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.650 
management as well so as you can see we
have<00:04:12.180> very<00:04:13.079> nice<00:04:13.410> section<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.450> memory<00:04:15.450> usage

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
have very nice section of memory usage

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.409 
have very nice section of memory usage
so<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.560> tells<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:17.040> how<00:04:17.640> much<00:04:17.880> memory<00:04:18.180> is

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
so it just tells you how much memory is

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.050 
so it just tells you how much memory is
being<00:04:18.600> used<00:04:18.840> every<00:04:19.560> members<00:04:19.890> used<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.760> tool

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
being used every members used the tool

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.050 
being used every members used the tool
memory<00:04:21.510> memory<00:04:22.169> index<00:04:22.620> system<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.640> free

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
memory memory index system the free

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.060 
memory memory index system the free
memory<00:04:24.570> right<00:04:24.930> now<00:04:25.140> and<00:04:25.410> then<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.830> can<00:04:25.950> also

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
memory right now and then you can also

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.200 
memory right now and then you can also
go<00:04:26.370> through

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
go through

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.480 
go through
upright<00:04:27.840> as<00:04:28.050> well<00:04:28.259> so<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.620> tells<00:04:28.800> you<00:04:29.039> which

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
upright as well so it tells you which

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.540 
upright as well so it tells you which
app<00:04:29.729> is<00:04:29.759> taking<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.840> most<00:04:31.110> amount<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.710> RAM<00:04:32.280> and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
app is taking the most amount of RAM and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.510 
app is taking the most amount of RAM and
actually<00:04:33.419> the<00:04:33.569> chrome<00:04:33.810> isn't<00:04:33.990> one<00:04:34.800> chrome<00:04:35.370> ash

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
actually the chrome isn't one chrome ash

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.309 
actually the chrome isn't one chrome ash
doesn't<00:04:35.729> take<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.090> much<00:04:36.300> at<00:04:36.509> all<00:04:36.539> it's

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
doesn't take that much at all it's

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.409 
doesn't take that much at all it's
mainly<00:04:37.860> Android<00:04:38.520> operating<00:04:38.699> system<00:04:38.970> and

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
mainly Android operating system and

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.080 
mainly Android operating system and
Google<00:04:39.720> Apps<00:04:39.870> actually<00:04:40.319> also<00:04:41.160> we<00:04:41.669> also<00:04:41.819> have

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
Google Apps actually also we also have

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.930 
Google Apps actually also we also have
internal<00:04:42.810> storage<00:04:43.259> as<00:04:43.680> well<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:44.759> have<00:04:44.849> the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
internal storage as well so you have the

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.370 
internal storage as well so you have the
internal<00:04:45.240> storage<00:04:45.539> management<00:04:45.810> as<00:04:46.050> well<00:04:46.080> and

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
internal storage management as well and

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.110 
internal storage management as well and
you<00:04:46.440> can<00:04:46.470> go<00:04:46.680> through<00:04:46.710> how<00:04:47.160> much<00:04:47.340> storage<00:04:47.910> has

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
you can go through how much storage has

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.260 
you can go through how much storage has
been<00:04:48.300> taken<00:04:48.720> up<00:04:48.900> by<00:04:48.930> apps<00:04:49.680> as<00:04:50.099> well<00:04:50.160> and<00:04:50.669> you

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
been taken up by apps as well and you

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.409 
been taken up by apps as well and you
can<00:04:51.389> also<00:04:51.479> get<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.900> very<00:04:52.169> nice<00:04:52.520> in<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.610> bar<00:04:53.940> kind
