you're thinking when I first saw our

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.750 
you're thinking when I first saw our
chart<00:00:38.350> like<00:00:38.560> this<00:00:38.590> I<00:00:38.950> almost<00:00:39.070> fell<00:00:39.489> out<00:00:39.520> of<00:00:39.640> my

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
chart like this I almost fell out of my

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.790 
chart like this I almost fell out of my
chair<00:00:39.850> no<00:00:40.750> way<00:00:41.050> am<00:00:41.230> I<00:00:41.290> going<00:00:41.440> to<00:00:41.530> be<00:00:41.620> able<00:00:41.680> to

learn<00:00:41.950> all<00:00:42.010> this<00:00:42.570> however<00:00:43.570> once<00:00:44.140> we<00:00:44.320> break<00:00:44.560> the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
learn all this however once we break the

learn all this however once we break the
chart<00:00:45.100> up<00:00:45.340> into<00:00:45.670> little<00:00:45.910> parts<00:00:46.210> you<00:00:46.810> will<00:00:47.050> soon

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
chart up into little parts you will soon

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.850 
chart up into little parts you will soon
see<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:48.280> it's<00:00:48.430> as<00:00:48.610> easy<00:00:48.820> as<00:00:49.000> cake<00:00:49.860> first

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
see that it's as easy as cake first

see that it's as easy as cake first
let's<00:00:51.490> examine<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:52.090> chart<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.630> a<00:00:52.810> bit<00:00:52.960> more

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
let's examine the chart in a bit more

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.860 
let's examine the chart in a bit more
detail<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.760> from<00:00:54.940> looking<00:00:55.090> at<00:00:55.390> it<00:00:55.600> I<00:00:55.750> can

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
detail just from looking at it I can

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.010 
detail just from looking at it I can
tell<00:00:56.350> how<00:00:56.860> to<00:00:56.920> orient<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.610> chart<00:00:57.880> look<00:00:58.780> for

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
tell how to orient the chart look for

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.190 
tell how to orient the chart look for
the<00:00:59.110> arrows<00:00:59.530> or<00:01:00.130> better<00:01:00.370> yet<00:01:01.080> recall<00:01:02.080> the

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
of traffic in an orderly way let's first

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.480 
of traffic in an orderly way let's first
determine<00:01:27.760> where<00:01:28.630> we<00:01:28.780> are<00:01:29.050> or<00:01:29.590> at<00:01:29.740> least<00:01:29.770> where

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
determine where we are or at least where

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.540 
determine where we are or at least where
we<00:01:30.610> need<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:31.030> be<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.590> we<00:01:33.100> look<00:01:33.310> at<00:01:33.430> our

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
we need to be for this we look at our

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.300 
we need to be for this we look at our
flight<00:01:33.790> plan<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.960> last<00:01:35.229> Waypoint<00:01:35.920> on<00:01:36.159> our

however<00:07:05.930> if<00:07:06.289> you<00:07:06.410> just<00:07:06.440> using<00:07:07.220> vor<00:07:07.729> navigation

however if you just using vor navigation
then<00:07:08.930> the<00:07:09.139> following<00:07:09.560> description<00:07:10.009> is<00:07:10.310> needed

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
then the following description is needed

Mullin transition because that's the

approach using only vor navigation and
you<00:07:57.830> will<00:07:58.340> appreciate<00:07:58.699> how<00:07:59.270> easy<00:07:59.659> we<00:08:00.110> have<00:08:00.349> it
