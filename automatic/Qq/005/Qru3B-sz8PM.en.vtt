00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 increasingly popular and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.000
 spread today get 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.859
 autonomous heating systems which 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.230
 installed not only in private 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.240
 houses but also in ordinary apartments because 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.609
 convenient not to depend on heating 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 season and live in a comfortable temperature 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.910
 all year round basis any 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.010
 heating system 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.780
 This is the boiler when choosing it first 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.880
 should determine the type of fuel 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 which will be on and hurt available on 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.040
 long term in your area 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.350
 at home it's the same time 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.570
 think about installing heating systems and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
 and replacement of heating equipment and 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.649
 the first thing to start is the choice 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.120
 heating boiler as it is 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.730
 the heart of the whole system 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.750
 There are three types of heating boilers 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 by type of fuel 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.340
 these are gas and electric and 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 solid due to high 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 gasification percentage 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.640
 gas boilers remain top sellers 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.130
 among gas boilers there are many 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 various modifications first by type 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 Installations have floor boilers 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.520
 there are also wall boilers 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.920
 different combustion chambers there is a chamber 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
 open when oxygen is taken from 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 the premises such a boiler is installed 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.759
 especially in the boiler room and combustion products 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.100
 removed through the mine through traction 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.280
 you also have cameras closed at such 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.680
 boiler minimum installation restrictions and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.750
 he takes oxygen from the streets 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.420
 the difference between wall and floor 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.700
 boilers not only in the installation method and 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.440
 I will remind you that the wall boiler 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.360
 is a finished mini 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.250
 boiler room and floor requires equipment 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.259
 additional equipment that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.300
 implies additional expenses but 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.520
 here are the heat exchangers of floor boilers 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.290
 serves as a rule much longer but 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.869
 dimensions of boilers with installation on the floor 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.240
 too large and the installation is more difficult therefore 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.290
 on some walls at a lower price remain 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.840
 bestsellers 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.350
 boilers can meet various types 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.840
 Control is a simple mechanical on 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.640
 flame height also exists more 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.590
 sophisticated electronic control where we 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.780
 we can set the temperature exactly 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.700
 to degree and it is not inherent 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.280
 only gas boilers but also electric 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.480
 also gas boilers 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.400
 complemented by an additional second 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.769
 contour which is responsible for hot 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.989
 water supply where gas supply is yet 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.970
 unavailable to solve the issue of heating and 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.100
 hot water too easy 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.170
 and there are solid fuel boilers 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.600
 which will allow you greatly 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.700
 save on wood and coal considering that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.170
 gasification of our republic is still not 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.930
 one hundred percent well offer 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.340
 electric type solid fuel boilers 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.430
 besides the fact that they can be used 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.769
 as the main source is also possible 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.250
 install them as a backup boiler in 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.640
 pair with gas if you decide to purchase 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.519
 solid fuel boiler 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.930
 I want to draw your attention to this 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.870
 long burning boiler 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.310
 calculated on an area of 400 squares 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.920
 one bookmark firewood 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.939
 one hour of coal lasts up to 30 hours 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.189
 up to 5 days 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.409
 in conclusion it is worth noting that in our 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.150
 Republic where the level of gasification is higher 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.980
 average Russian and approaching 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.810
 ninety percent gas boiler 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.579
 seems the most practical 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.769
 option for heating system and 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.019
 hot water purchase 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.540

 warmth and comfort everything for heating 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.849
 systems from boilers and radiators to 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.709
 pumps and fittings you can purchase 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.969
