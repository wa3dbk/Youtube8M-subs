00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.910
 ah 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.399
 hello how well they're doing to me xd if 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.829
 they ask why I'm not so active is 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.440
 because there is a month to finish the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.719
 classes and every week there are exams and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.030
 I have to study a lot if it is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.309
 that I want to move to third good does 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.860
 like a month that did not bring a video of the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.010
 wwf today I will talk about some 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.199
 abandoned wwf championships today 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.970
 I will talk about the European Championship of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.820
 the wwf created in early 1997 and 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.039
 disappeared in mid-2002 the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.470
 first champion was the British bulldog 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:09.539
 and the last one was rock band and it was one of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.660
 my favorite championships of the era 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:15.539
 attitude its first champions were 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.570
 the best ones like shawn michaels the world 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.270
 British or in party triple h having 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.850
 good reigns and good struggles despite 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.950
 that it was a European championship just 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.979
 two champions were from that continent 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.630
 the British world and william regal with 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.850
 Over the years 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.150
 having short reigns that only 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.910
 they lasted 1 or 2 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.420
 what a pity for me the golden age for 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:44.500
 this championship was from 1997 until 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.370
 mid 1998 since after that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.710
 its decline began in 1999 it was abandoned 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.140
 this title but after a few months 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.290
 He came back but we had champions again 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.810
 mediocre as test william regal or in 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.240
 mccann the title disappeared in 2002 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.090
 because rob van dam the champ 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.760
 intercontinental then unified 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.649
 his championship with the European 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.659
 turning it into a single title 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.939
 now I will talk about the championship 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:17.680
 hardcore this championship was created to 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:19.720
 end of 1998 and disappeared in 2002 from 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.700
 the same way that the European being 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.670
 unified with the intercontinental title 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.489
 from rob van dam the first person in 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.769
 get this title was mankin because 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.470
 that mister mcmann handed it to him 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.870
 championship I loved was defended 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.379
 by extreme rules was added a 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.079
 norm rule 24 of 7 which meant 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.940
 that this title was at stake the 24 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.400
 hours of the seven day day of the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.799
 week whenever there was a referee 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.920
 present of course the one that more times 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.739
 got this title was king come with 27 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.829
 reigns that yes the reigns lasted very 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.650
 little sometimes even seconds 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:03.220
 for me the best champions went to 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.859
 snow steve black man rob van raven and dam 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.319
 big boss man but not only men what 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.840
 they got also highlights that some 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.060
 women got the title as sad 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.960
 stratus terry rummel somol and holly 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.460
 they also got it 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.740
 we had like 234 reigns wow even 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.070

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.500
