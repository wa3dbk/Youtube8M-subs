00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.950
 very good to everyone how are you today 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.840
 mmm and since we are again with another 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.250
 new video from the little egg corner 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.950
 Well, on this occasion, he has 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.170
 touched to saber since as you know I'm going 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.730
 going up in this section with the pokemon 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.880
 that you are asking me and good 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.160
 Well, here I am going to show you the saber and 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.199
 that I have achieved with four movements 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.210
 eggs that would be these that you are 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.660
 seeing here would be 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.520
 repression recovery metal trick and 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.220
 low blow that the truth is that your cone 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.470
 It would be great for if we have a 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.090
 saber and therefore with the hidden ability of 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.340
 with mista for why we would always attack 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.920
 before recovery would also not be 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.870
 great for saber and repression metal it 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.110
 I 've put it basically because it's been 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.550
 one of the attacks like that egg that more me 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.129
 have liked all those who can 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.140
 learn well saber jet and hit down 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.580
 because the truth is that we will always attack 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.860
 before thanks to this attack and since 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.800
 we are quite slow saber and it is very 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.170
 slow so it would not be great and good 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.050
 like to have a saber like this 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.720
 I suppose if not, well, here I am going to 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.210
 teach then the method to be able to 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.670
 get what is not so complicated is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.820
 quite easy and so I'm going to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.310
 explain step by step 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.590
 and so you can see it I'm going to leave it 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.950
 here to the saber since we have achieved and 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.440
 let's start first of all then 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.760
 that we have to get to see wait 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.510
 what 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.750
 ok this we have to get a saber 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.120
 and female has to be female 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.850
 attacks would be the same for example if 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.100
 has basic attacks and such, well, better 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.450
 the nature then what you 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.940
 you want and this time I have 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.070
 Prefer to be firm I've been lucky 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.340
 since of having also the ability 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.500
 joker that would be the hidden and good 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.720
 so we have to get a saber and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.729
 female if you do not have any you can 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.740
 ask the gts too as always 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.300
 I say after we're going to do it 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.070
 let's get a male billiard and or 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.630
 got in the gts as you see is 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.670
 Japanese 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.250
 and it has come to me with nature 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.040
 firm so perfect and good then 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.170
 we have to get a macho kiss and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.750
 have the attack learned repression 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.240
 metal how are you seeing this attack what 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.100
 learn visart at level 1 what do you want 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.860
 say this because it is done we have 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.140
 have to remember this attack and where 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.300
 It is what we can do to make 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.890
 remember so that if you do not know 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.440
 some of you then you have to go 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.040
 until fresh village and there's a 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.140
 tutor of movements and we have to 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.330
 teach then a heart flake if you 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.970
 we teach a heart flake to this 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.800
 tutor so we can remind you 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.930
 an attack on our pokemon in this 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.110
 occasion I have taught the attack 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.050
 metal repression right here we go 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.990
 to do so let's put this pokemon together 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.850
 to the billiards male with the saber and female if 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.130
 we put them together in the nursery 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.740
 what will happen then that the breeding that we 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.620
 come out will be a saber and with the attack 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.110
 inherited from his dad villar that would be 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.790
 metal repression as you are seeing 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.100
 What are we going to do here? 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.040
 take out this baby until it comes out 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.440
 spotted this time we're going to leave 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.360
 so we'll leave it time just after 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.970
 what are we going to do then we have to 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.850
 get a crowd cut or its evolution 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.730
 Like one of the two would have to 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.670
 attack learned hit under this 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.560
 Pokemon learns low blow at level 31 at 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.050
 level up so perfect what 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.590
 you can ask in the gts also I'm 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.069
 singles 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.220
 this is English so perfect is not 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:00.019
 we would do well anyway and well 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.060
 Well, what are we going to do? 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.390
 join with the saber already comes from before 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.920
 what is this here that is female and if 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.989
 them together to the others in the nursery 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.819
 what will happen so that a baby does not come out 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.140
 with the attack he has learned low blow and 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.630
 here what are we going to do then we are going to 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.609
 make this saber and try to get it out 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.859
 female with the low blow attack when 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.130
 we have it female that we are going to do 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.380

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.120
 female who has low blow with that 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.970

 the father villar and sable and female that 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.680
 would have the metal attack and repression that 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.780
 it's male if we put these two together in the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.000
 nursery what will happen then that breeding 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.430
 that comes out will leave us with repression 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.460

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.060
 that we get a female female because 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.080
 because then we have to look 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.940
 every hour that is macho the skull 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.790
 he has to have learned the attack 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:10.180
 trick and recovery recovery can 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.820
 learn it every open at level 36 when climbing 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.000

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.660
 to level 50 when leveling up as you see 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.940
 this corpse up to level 53 because what 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.100
 perillo the gts as you see is french what 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.200
 I asked and it was open and I had to upload 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.340

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.580
 as you see and well once we have this 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.580
 corpse like this 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.690
 with trick and recovery attacks and 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.610

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.400
