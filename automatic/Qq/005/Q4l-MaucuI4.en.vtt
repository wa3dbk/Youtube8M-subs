thing<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.719> this<00:00:37.230> guy<00:00:37.410> came<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.340> that's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
thing that this guy came with that's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.369 
thing that this guy came with that's
interesting<00:00:39.270> from<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.780> time

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
interesting from the time

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.720 
interesting from the time
got<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:42.559> 3.5<00:00:43.559> inch<00:00:43.770> disc<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:46.460> some<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
got your 3.5 inch disc here some of you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
got your 3.5 inch disc here some of you
may<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:47.940> never<00:00:48.210> even<00:00:48.420> seen<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.500> then

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
may have never even seen that and then

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
may have never even seen that and then
here's<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.829> specs<00:00:50.219> required<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.300> i

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
here's the specs required for it which i

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.610 
here's the specs required for it which i
think<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.750> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:51.989> interesting<00:00:52.050> I'll<00:00:52.469> just

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
think is kind of interesting I'll just

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.990 
think is kind of interesting I'll just
hold<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.829> up<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> second<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.910> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
hold that up there for a second so you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.750 
hold that up there for a second so you
can<00:00:54.120> read<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.420> details<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:56.430> amazing

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
can read all the details it's amazing

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
can read all the details it's amazing
how<00:00:56.850> far<00:00:57.090> we've<00:00:57.300> come<00:00:57.329> since<00:00:57.750> 96

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
how far we've come since 96

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
how far we've come since 96
so<00:00:59.309> anyway<00:00:59.579> onto<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.210> figure<00:01:01.489> it's<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.609> really

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
so anyway onto the figure it's a really

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.780 
so anyway onto the figure it's a really
good<00:01:03.439> it's<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:04.830> well<00:01:04.949> sculpted<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.580> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
good it's really well sculpted off of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.500 
good it's really well sculpted off of
the<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.510> movie<00:01:07.439> design<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.330> whether

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the the movie design you know whether

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.910 
the the movie design you know whether
you<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> design<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.500> don't<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you like this design or don't like the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010 
you like this design or don't like the
design<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.490> definitely<00:01:12.180> owes<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> lot<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.930> H

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
design it definitely owes a lot to the H

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.410 
design it definitely owes a lot to the H
R<00:01:13.260> Giger<00:01:14.000> alien<00:01:15.439> design<00:01:16.439> from<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> movies<00:01:17.420> but

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
R Giger alien design from the movies but

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.600 
R Giger alien design from the movies but
it<00:01:18.689> definitely<00:01:18.900> has<00:01:19.259> sort<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.680> its<00:01:19.860> own<00:01:20.009> twist

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
it definitely has sort of its own twist

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.850 
it definitely has sort of its own twist
to<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.180> think<00:01:21.380> for<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.890> figure<00:01:23.520> he's<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.450> a

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
to it I think for the figure he's got a

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.969 
to it I think for the figure he's got a
pretty<00:01:25.860> limited<00:01:26.280> articulation<00:01:26.430> arms<00:01:27.420> go

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
pretty limited articulation arms go

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.580 
pretty limited articulation arms go
around<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> wrap<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.790> has<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.259> Ninja<00:01:31.259> Turtle

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
around the wrap it has the Ninja Turtle

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.679 
around the wrap it has the Ninja Turtle
playmates<00:01:32.130> style<00:01:33.079> diagonal<00:01:34.079> cut<00:01:34.320> hips<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
got all these tentacles which you know

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.090 
got all these tentacles which you know
of<00:01:42.720> course<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.170> completely<00:01:43.649> bendable

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
which are hard plastic all of these you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.830 
which are hard plastic all of these you
can<00:01:48.810> pop<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.009> want<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.570> but<00:01:51.570> these<00:01:51.689> are
