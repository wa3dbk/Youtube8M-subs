00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
card in against stop that relies heavily

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.980 
card in against stop that relies heavily
on<00:05:48.919> their<00:05:49.130> effect<00:05:49.400> for<00:05:49.520> example<00:05:49.850> like<00:05:50.360> maybe

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
on their effect for example like maybe

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.630 
on their effect for example like maybe
plants<00:05:51.890> or<00:05:52.100> glad<00:05:52.610> rubies<00:05:52.940> for<00:05:53.120> sure<00:05:53.330> so<00:05:53.660> yeah
