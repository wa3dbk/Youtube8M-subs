and over and over and circles drill it
and<00:02:22.400> five<00:02:22.670> circles<00:02:23.150> have<00:02:23.780> your<00:02:23.930> friend<00:02:24.200> do

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
and five circles have your friend do

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.160 
and five circles have your friend do
five<00:02:24.530> circles<00:02:24.950> then<00:02:25.250> do<00:02:25.370> again<00:02:25.690> wide<00:02:26.690> circles

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
five circles then do again wide circles

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.900 
five circles then do again wide circles
have<00:02:27.680> your<00:02:27.799> friend<00:02:28.010> class<00:02:28.250> circles<00:02:28.549> do<00:02:28.700> like

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
have your friend class circles do like

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.900 
have your friend class circles do like
five<00:02:29.209> or<00:02:29.390> six<00:02:29.420> times<00:02:29.660> really<00:02:30.310> understand<00:02:31.310> how

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
five or six times really understand how

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.090 
five or six times really understand how
to<00:02:31.970> get<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:32.420> know<00:02:32.480> it's<00:02:32.690> easy<00:02:32.930> but<00:02:33.709> there's

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
to get this I know it's easy but there's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.530 
to get this I know it's easy but there's
a<00:02:34.160> difference<00:02:34.459> between<00:02:34.819> something<00:02:35.389> being

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
a difference between something being

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.229 
a difference between something being
easy<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.590> actually<00:02:36.799> be<00:02:37.069> good<00:02:37.400> at<00:02:37.579> after

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
easy and you actually be good at after

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.729 
easy and you actually be good at after
you<00:02:38.329> guys<00:02:38.450> get<00:02:38.630> this<00:02:38.780> down<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.260> you're

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
you guys get this down and you're

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.900 
you guys get this down and you're
confident<00:02:40.430> with<00:02:40.549> it<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.389> start<00:02:42.049> freestyling

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
confident with it then start freestyling

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.309 
confident with it then start freestyling
going<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.030> other<00:02:44.180> combinations<00:02:44.840> go<00:02:45.049> into

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
going to other combinations go into

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.860 
going to other combinations go into
other<00:02:45.410> four<00:02:45.769> steps<00:02:46.130> go<00:02:46.340> into<00:02:46.639> flow<00:02:47.510> moves

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
other four steps go into flow moves

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.780 
other four steps go into flow moves
power<00:02:48.410> means<00:02:48.709> all<00:02:48.980> these<00:02:49.280> different<00:02:49.639> things

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
power means all these different things

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.309 
power means all these different things
and<00:02:50.000> that's<00:02:50.540> when<00:02:50.720> it's<00:02:50.900> really<00:02:51.139> going<00:02:51.260> to

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
and that's when it's really going to

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.150 
and that's when it's really going to
start<00:02:51.380> looking<00:02:51.769> good

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
start looking good

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.280 
start looking good
all<00:02:52.579> right<00:02:52.670> last<00:02:53.209> but<00:02:53.359> not<00:02:53.569> least<00:02:53.900> here's<00:02:54.200> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
all right last but not least here's the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:06.890 
all right last but not least here's the
demonstration<00:02:54.889> six<00:02:55.549> step

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.450 

those<00:03:07.900> are<00:03:08.050> new<00:03:08.200> jobs<00:03:08.410> hope<00:03:08.800> you<00:03:08.920> guys<00:03:09.100> enjoy
