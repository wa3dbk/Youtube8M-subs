00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
and a box it is at most risk when they

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.680

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
hopefully if one of your shots do land

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.749 
hopefully if one of your shots do land
it<00:06:39.229> will<00:06:39.410> put<00:06:39.590> the<00:06:39.710> opponent's<00:06:40.190> on<00:06:40.250> his<00:06:40.370> back

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
it will put the opponent's on his back

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:41.260 
it will put the opponent's on his back

hopefully<00:06:42.940> reality<00:06:43.940> is<00:06:44.060> that<00:06:44.270> that's<00:06:44.479> not

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
hopefully reality is that that's not

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.700 
hopefully reality is that that's not
going<00:06:44.810> to<00:06:44.870> happen<00:06:45.430> so<00:06:46.430> plan<00:06:46.699> for<00:06:46.910> that

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
going to happen so plan for that

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.890 
going to happen so plan for that
expect<00:06:48.710> a<00:06:48.889> punch<00:06:49.130> to<00:06:49.310> come<00:06:49.460> back<00:06:49.639> your<00:06:49.880> way<00:06:50.030> it

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
expect a punch to come back your way it

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.700 
expect a punch to come back your way it
makes<00:06:51.199> sense<00:06:51.530> it's<00:06:51.740> the<00:06:51.800> right<00:06:52.100> thing<00:06:52.370> to<00:06:52.550> do

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
makes sense it's the right thing to do

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.850 
makes sense it's the right thing to do
and<00:06:54.759> that's<00:06:55.759> about<00:06:55.849> it<00:06:56.500> if<00:06:57.500> you've<00:06:57.620> got<00:06:57.650> any

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:57.860 
and that's about it if you've got any

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.640 
and that's about it if you've got any
