00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.130
 two 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.119
 the case happened in mid-2015 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.310
 with a baby of Chinese origin and how 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.770
 he was only three months old 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.830
 when a friend of the parents went to 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.230
 meet the couple's son in the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.480
 excitement of the moment picked up his phone 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.000
 mobile and proceeded to take a photo to 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.129
 the memory with such bad luck that the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.400
 man forgot to deactivate the flash of 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:45.100
 device after taking the picture the baby 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.260
 he began to cry however the parents 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.680
 they did not take much care at the beginning 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.110
 except because I kept crying so 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.720
 which decided to go to the hospital more 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.269
 close once there two canines 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.610
 confirmed that the baby had received 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.409
 serious damage to your eyes and you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.740
 They told the couple that the child 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.630
 would be blind from his left eye and that 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.170
 I would have vision problems in his eye 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.420
 right the cause the camera flash 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.759
 and is that the man had not only taken 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.860
 the photo with the flash but there was 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:22.310
 done at a distance as short as 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.860
 25 centimeters fact that it deteriorated the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.130
 macula the part of the eye sensitive to 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.780
 light and that gives sharpness to the images a 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.720
 damage in this area makes the images 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.380
 are perceived as blurry as the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.420
 severity of the harm in the case of the child the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.640
 Flash flash was lethal 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.869
 and is that the care with a new 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.909
 born covers several areas and aspects 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.700
 between them as they warn 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.430
 Pediatricians is the fact that there are 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.530
 you should take pictures with the flash since 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.140
 the eye cells have not finished 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.180
 if the risk is formed , 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.479
 presents with toys and pointers 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.610
 laser aimed at the eyes even with 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.240
 barcode readers and equipment 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.240
 scanner
