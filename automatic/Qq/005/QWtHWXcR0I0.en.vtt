00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that I think he believes that he's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.690 
that I think he believes that he's
something<00:02:45.709> quite<00:02:46.709> majestic<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.489> then<00:02:47.580> when

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
something quite majestic and then when

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.490 
something quite majestic and then when
the<00:02:47.790> sheriff<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.269> sort<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:48.930> stripping<00:02:49.410> him

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
the sheriff is sort of stripping him

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.860 
the sheriff is sort of stripping him
down<00:02:49.680> him<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.370> gets<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.060> real<00:02:51.300> vulnerable

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
down him it gets to that real vulnerable

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.110 
down him it gets to that real vulnerable
place<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.410> term<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:53.430> he<00:02:53.610> hates<00:02:53.849> to<00:02:54.000> be

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.130 
I think that probably has some effect on
the<00:05:00.630> scenes<00:05:00.840> with<00:05:01.100> with<00:05:02.100> guy<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.640> sheriff

think his chosen profession would be
that's<00:05:15.060> really<00:05:15.450> hard

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
that's really hard

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.790 
that's really hard
