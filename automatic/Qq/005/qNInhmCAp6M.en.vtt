 October a little ball arrived with the mini

 smiling eyes and little feel which 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.020
 They decided to call him Pauline. 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.900
 for a novel after another baby was born 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.280
 spies in Spanish and if indeed a whole 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.140

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.150
 looking for the kid and nothing else at 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.110
 sixth attempt came the boy who right now 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.520
 is 17 years old and measures 185 counts my dad 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.829
 that I was admitted seriously in the hospital 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.300
 in fact he tells me that they were 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.640
 going the eyes that are putting on 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.590
 blank to attend for exorcist but 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.960
 In the end God decided to kick his ass 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.950
 and threw me back to earth the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.570
 small girls 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.640
 the law paid with more guys who had 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.770
 a tying machine and giant in your house 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.899
 they steal hours with just one coin 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.610
 100 because the back was 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.979
 open and that coin was put and the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.390
 they put here also when it was very 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.640
 my little sister and I got on 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.710
 that body cream like that or 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.799
 idea on the soles of the feet and also 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.170
 We fill the entire floor of the kitchen with 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.729
 cream and I go and I got 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 happily r1 which is that skates already 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.810
 imagine when mom came as we 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.159
 it was one of so many times playing with my 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.929
 sister in a vacant place I got 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.939
 thorn on the foot plant the fourth one is 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.409
 He was taken by a guy with a nail clipper 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.479
 my dad always told us that 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.000
 the bread of the dead was made in 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.470
 reality with dead meat and that the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.659
 Zamorano shampoos were made with 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.090
 Rat meat and obvious how we were 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.380
 little we all thought we were my mom 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.899
 we woke up to go to school and 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.670
 she what she did with the uniforms was 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.349
 Warm them up a bit with their hands and with 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.299
 his mouth so that to the mind that we what 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.159
 they would not be so cold in fact 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.679
 Much of what I am today, I owe 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.060
 I love Mons, I also believe that 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.009
 very well that they sent me once to the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.720
 store I was going with my super container of 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.590
 glass and a pretty one that I had 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.420
 given 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.180
 suddenly I do not know how, but I left 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.160
 flying I fell and I fell and suddenly 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.069
 I woke up from my dream with a super 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.050
 giant glass embedded in my wrist and 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.819
 obvious the blood jet the doctor 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.099
 he told me that by five millimeters more I 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:30.709
 came to the vein and it 's a bit and it does not 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.239
 He counted again the 15 years they gave me 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.739
 a puppy and we gave him the name of 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.060
 woody and in fact was born the same from 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.950
 that and to date he lives with 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.379
 we in fact have about seven thousand 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.540
 dog years when after high school 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.480
 I always wanted a child who had a tic 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.950
 in the eye but he never paid attention to me 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.349
 in the high school stage I got a 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.970
 case with the image of the piolin which 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.470
 I do not know why it occurred to me to do it 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.540
 big in my obvious notebook it came out 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.730
 disgusting but I kept drawing and then 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.200
 same with time improve a little bit already 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.420
 then I drew pictures and they 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.310
 gave to my friends at the beginning of 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.230
 my dad dressed me with sweatshirts and 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.299
 baggy pants but no it was not chola 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.129
 also in the preparatory stage to me 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.290
 best friend liked a friend according to 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.910
 I was going to be cupid but it ended 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.430
 falling in love with me because we already made 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.140
 boyfriends 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.909
 some friends if you can 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.950
 call like that they gave me a glass that according to 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.810
 I was a refresher but in the end I did not 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.700
 It was refreshing and I ended up falling 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.530
 funky are thorns and I did not feel 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.299
 nothing that was my first and last 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.370
 experience with a drink unintentionally 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.379
 because it's worth mentioning that I do not smoke or 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.480
 I take it alone I could be like that I asked like the 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.489
 galaxy nothing is not true that either 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.780
 less at the end of high school 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.489
 computing while everyone is 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.139
 worried about why the 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.329
 program did not matter to me 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.519
 entertaining combining colors by aligning 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.500
 text boxes choosing typeface 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.840
 there I discovered that design was mine 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.530
 graphic and luckily I did not reprobate base of 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.450
 data 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.609
 in this stage prepares together with 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.709
 my relationship and the economic support of my 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.329
 dad to continue with my studies to 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.060
 soon between working a chain of 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.799
 cinemas that I will not promote or saw the 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.859
 same time I went to study design 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.970
 graphic to an open nail a career of 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.620
 five years 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.240
 in the morning it was studied and in the 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.770
 Afternoons I worked in company stazzi 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.660
 that together with my effort they paid 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.550
 my university studies years later 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.080
 since this race is a bit expensive 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.670
 got another additional job 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.519
 I studied from seven to ten in the morning 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.070
 from ten thirty to three in my job of 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.960
 graphic design and from three and a half to ten 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.220
 and half worked in the cinema many 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.780
 sometimes I would see myself at the box office or 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.180
 receiving the tickets with my sheet 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.980
 paper and pencil drawing attempts 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.480
 face or poster of the films of 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.650
 made some clips pop out and I 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.870
 they saw when I was drawing and I 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.300
 oral told you you're doing 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.860
 nothing more so as it overflowed still 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.140
 nothing more than social responds then that 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.540
 yes I always felt sorry for a certain day 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.230
 manager caught me drawing at the cinema in 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.660
 work hours 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.030
 I said now yes I already charge the clown 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.190
 but he just smiled and said he was very 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.500
 nice and it was obvious I all pumpkin 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.900
 since I saved myself for those dates 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.510
 I met him who was the love of my life and 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.790
 If I met him online, I did not believe in 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.950
 that but also soon a talker if 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.330
 I choose Polish to mention that I love 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.650
 of the cinema 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.480
 and once I had the opportunity to play 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.940
 one pretend that it feels like 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.210
 if it was a tire sometimes black type 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.639
 as 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.370
 lifeguard but wet feels good 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.750
 slippery the morning you have that 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.940
 I always go thundering the likes of 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.440
 the back and the neck intended 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.090
 I stay studying I am crooked 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.550
 also participates in several competitions of 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.380
 I sing and guess what hobyo always 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.540
 he totally lost the attempt he was made 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.550
 four months before finishing the uni and 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.710
 trying to keep my average of 9.5 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.540
 without any extraordinary to get 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.540
 my title on average if I got out of 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.120
 control the faults a matter itself by 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.280
 two fouls put an extraordinary and 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.660
 so my four year effort went to 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.150
 the garbage along with my degree 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.760
 automatic a few moments I wanted to jump 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.440
 through the window I finished college and 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.030
 I continued with my two jobs and was added 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.370
 a third was only my times 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.200
 free and as a hobby pencil portraits 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.390
 after a long time my cycle in the 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.190
 cinema ended and later on my 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.410
 relationship also certain day I bought a 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.610
 small acrylic nail kit and with 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.380
 YouTube tutorials 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.050
 I learned how to put them and with my guinea pigs 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.690
 from india who said how every time 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.250
 it was improving little by little there were thousands and thousands 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.960
 of friends of my sisters who ask 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.030
 appointments to which they attended my times 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.890
 free good the net were not thousands but 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.990
 your two that three a very good way 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.820
 What I have is that when it's time to 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.380
 sleep as I go to bed but from 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.790
 I suddenly begin to come ideas 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.530
 which are rolling in my head 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.420
 simply the hours pass and I continue 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.940
 think and think about things I'm going to do 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.860
 in ideas for x today the total project 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.719
 the hours pass and I keep playing 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.340
 in bed I'm not comfortable until I 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.689
 stop either at three thirty of the 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.919
 tomorrow to write what I got 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:42.840
 it happened on a paper and after that 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:44.430
 I write all agent ar has said this 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.139
 dÃ­az I came up with a portrait 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.909
 pencil and a youtube character but 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.800
 this time I not only drew it but also 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.080
 I also recorded the drawing process and what 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.849
 I went up to show him he shared it and 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.650
 flies that started asking me to 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:59.490
 draw another character and battle 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.990
 was and I saw again all his anger at 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.270
 see that more and more people shared my 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.189
 I liked drawing and that I supported 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.750
