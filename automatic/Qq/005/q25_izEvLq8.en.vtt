00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
about the top of the nose you put a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.039 
about the top of the nose you put a
little<00:01:29.070> mark<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.759> either<00:01:30.360> side<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> head

shape if you find by this time that with
the<00:01:47.070> features<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.460> you've<00:01:47.700> drawn<00:01:48.060> by<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> um<00:01:49.320> a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
the features that you've drawn by a um a

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.219 
the features that you've drawn by a um a
little<00:01:50.369> bit<00:01:50.490> wide<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.509> your<00:01:51.630> face<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.840> can

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
little bit wide for your face you can

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.109 
little bit wide for your face you can
bring<00:01:52.440> the<00:01:52.560> face<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.700> find<00:01:53.940> that<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
bring the face out if you find that a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.969 
bring the face out if you find that a
little<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.600> narrow<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.619> bring<00:01:55.740> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
little bit narrow you can just bring the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.090 
little bit narrow you can just bring the
oval<00:01:56.580> shape<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.940> so<00:01:57.330> one<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.380> too<00:01:58.560> bad<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.070> I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
oval shape in so one not too bad so I

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.480 
oval shape in so one not too bad so I
will<00:01:59.340> just<00:01:59.520> follow<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.850> oval<00:02:00.180> round<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.490> on

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
will just follow the oval round and on

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.749 
will just follow the oval round and on
the<00:02:02.610> bottom<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.090> do<00:02:03.830> next<00:02:04.830> shape<00:02:05.040> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the bottom you just do next shape this

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.130 
the bottom you just do next shape this
one<00:02:05.940> can<00:02:06.119> come<00:02:06.300> in<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.690> bit

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
one can come in a little bit

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.080 
one can come in a little bit
whereas<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.890> face<00:02:08.100> would<00:02:08.250> look<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> bit<00:02:08.519> odd

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
whereas the face would look a bit odd

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.930 
whereas the face would look a bit odd
because<00:02:09.570> it<00:02:09.810> would<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.050> lopsided<00:02:10.820> so<00:02:11.820> we

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
because it would be a lopsided so we

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.090 
because it would be a lopsided so we
come<00:02:12.150> around<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.290> you've<00:02:13.890> got<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100
