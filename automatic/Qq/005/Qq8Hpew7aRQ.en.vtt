I'm<00:00:08.589> going<00:00:08.919> to<00:00:09.040> go<00:00:09.129> over<00:00:09.400> the<00:00:09.519> basics<00:00:09.940> of

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:10.089 
I'm going to go over the basics of

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.869 
I'm going to go over the basics of
blending<00:00:10.660> with<00:00:11.110> interactive<00:00:11.879> generally

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
blending with interactive generally

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.789 
blending with interactive generally
there<00:00:13.090> are<00:00:13.119> three<00:00:13.240> times<00:00:13.779> while<00:00:14.349> you<00:00:14.469> create<00:00:14.679> a

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:14.799 
there are three times while you create a

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.440 
there are three times while you create a
painting<00:00:15.070> that<00:00:15.369> you're<00:00:15.940> going<00:00:16.059> to<00:00:16.119> want<00:00:16.330> to

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
painting that you're going to want to

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.870 
painting that you're going to want to
think<00:00:16.720> about<00:00:16.900> blending<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:18.189> first<00:00:18.490> is<00:00:18.700> when

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
think about blending the first is when

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.970 
think about blending the first is when
you<00:00:19.029> are<00:00:19.180> actually<00:00:19.439> painting<00:00:20.439> and<00:00:20.650> you're

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
you are actually painting and you're

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.249 
you are actually painting and you're
working<00:00:21.400> with<00:00:21.579> wet<00:00:21.849> paint<00:00:22.090> and<00:00:22.419> wet<00:00:22.660> paint<00:00:22.960> and

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
working with wet paint and wet paint and

working with wet paint and wet paint and
you<00:00:23.680> start<00:00:24.039> to<00:00:24.189> feel<00:00:24.340> your<00:00:24.579> interactive<00:00:25.000> paint

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:25.899 
you start to feel your interactive paint

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.319 
you start to feel your interactive paint
start<00:00:26.259> to<00:00:26.380> tack<00:00:26.680> up<00:00:26.710> that's<00:00:27.520> when<00:00:27.820> you<00:00:27.910> want<00:00:28.119> to

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
start to tack up that's when you want to

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.869 
start to tack up that's when you want to
give<00:00:28.930> it<00:00:29.050> some<00:00:29.079> more<00:00:29.349> moisture<00:00:29.500> using<00:00:30.309> your

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:30.879 
give it some more moisture using your

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:51.939

water<00:00:31.059> spray

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.970 

the<00:00:52.670> second<00:00:53.089> time<00:00:53.239> is<00:00:53.539> when<00:00:54.109> your<00:00:54.410> painting<00:00:54.859> is

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
the second time is when your painting is

some adjusting do some blending of some
edges<00:01:22.130> at<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:23.119> point<00:01:23.420> waters<00:01:24.080> not<00:01:24.259> gonna

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
edges at that point waters not gonna

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.440 
edges at that point waters not gonna
work<00:01:24.710> anymore<00:01:24.860> but<00:01:25.580> that's<00:01:25.819> when<00:01:26.090> you<00:01:26.179> want<00:01:26.390> to
