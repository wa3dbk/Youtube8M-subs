00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello you are going to witness the setting 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.170
 water from cardia to bernard 45 kg plus 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.980
 two meters long it takes at least 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.530
 that to be able to 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.130
 oulala it's good I can not lend you 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 but seemed to be really too small to 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.970
 my opinion concept like that and after 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.449
 kneel and someone removes the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.630
 cart is nice ask the laddh to 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.630
 wrong 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.599
 oh yes it's heavy here it's really 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.599
 heavy 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.610
 short because you give certain 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:45.180
 while the baby ball and at the port 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.239
 what boat what boat my friend is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.469
 Feel good little 1 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.730
 look at his colors with as at 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.920
 the old sails take the canvas 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.909
 that we had and we get bored and harbors and 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.799
 the fishing rods look at them 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.399
 fishing rods that squarely shows to 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:02.430
 the horizon ah yeah you mean you 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.880
 the helped sense with a brain good bah you 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
 want to do a demonstration because 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.110
 I can say that I rarely saw a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.080
 boat of this size with the canes 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.909
 functional like here it's true 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.560
 it's the same that we have a bigger one 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.409
 that but I had about ten lines of 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.300
 each side tutoya stuff for the saas and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.319
 the mizzen mast behind her breasts but 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.460
 it seems that a this jorick query this 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:34.050
 that there is the arrow actually with 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.649
 so do you also have a 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.960
 engine to help you nothing it's just the 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.740
 joy of the wild 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.740
 look down 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.490
 no it's me do not leave you here 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.130
 so there you are going back up 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 actually I see them go back up that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.530
 do not laugh it's the first listen I 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.120
 I'm not sure that many people have 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.550
 saw this on the web I am delighted to 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.250
 to be able to immortalize this hour and this 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.510
 exercise is getting off their and me 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.400
 I still have a few minutes dodon that 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.640
 I'm still going to play a little bit there is at 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 wearing now because they move and 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.420
 45 kg and how long about 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.770
 30 1 2 30th in total quad agreement before and 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.770
 more agreement 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.720
 eiffarie is the reproduction of a 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.460
 tuna boat of 1909 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.560
 she went back months canes because 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.950
 that really failing to ski me 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.660
 nautical 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.390
 I would be happy to show that to my 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.819
 friends on the web you'll find him on 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.290
 the canvas in your name 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.939
 I hope it will come back well but it's 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.310
 I can see them whisper that oath 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.930
 although they put you up to six lines 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.900
 said this line 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.230
 ok right behind 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.230
 m 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.370
 come on like this goes down like a real 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.450
 it goes down nicely all the hens 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.010
 being functional only knows that she 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.540
 seems she had the advantage it's 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.880
 it crashed less fish 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.160
 because when he's fishing at the net he's 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.290
 dirty and thanks to the tithe with the stitches 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.670
 the net then his 12th while there 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.190
 did not shock and then immediately 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.030
 it was much less linear 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.030
 it makes me a sacred glass 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.050
 cosco wei do I think it's ja lemay 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.080
 of murder and already privately warned of a 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.080
 friend 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.480
 what is beautiful listen to them 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.920
 enemies and friends to say that this is 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.750
 perfect I see it perfectly all the 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.120
 world will see it go back up like a real 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.840
 slowly that benefits from the waist 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.580
 after the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.090
 garbage bins fish on the ice there 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.019
 must deliver lines with plans 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.280
 being a real fish clinging 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.900
 and there crying because the boat that 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.370
 sinks 45 kg would be jacques on a big 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.530
 fish that by scoring that fretille 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.970
 well be careful and well here are the friends I 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.920
 am happy to have shown you this 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.970
 new feature on a tuna boat 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.650
 from 1909 realized by Bernard years a lot 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.459
 of time as usual a camp five 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.940
 in five years it does not say goodbye 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.940
 the friends
