00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
was enough to do this whole back area up

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
was enough to do this whole back area up
on<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.520> up<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.570> window<00:01:56.160> plus<00:01:57.160> some

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.219 

areas<00:02:01.479> going<00:02:01.750> down<00:02:02.400> toward<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.430> battery<00:02:03.880> area

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
areas going down toward the battery area

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.729 
areas going down toward the battery area
that<00:02:05.229> was<00:02:05.350> one<00:02:05.619> rule<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:07.000> and<00:02:07.479> that<00:02:07.600> was<00:02:07.780> $17

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
that was one rule so and that was $17

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.270 
that was one rule so and that was $17
for<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.840> then<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.110> also<00:02:11.320> bought<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.770> piece

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
for that and then I also bought a piece

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.270 
for that and then I also bought a piece
of<00:02:13.080> carpet<00:02:14.080> backing<00:02:16.530> way<00:02:17.530> more<00:02:17.800> than<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.040> needed

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
of carpet backing way more than I needed

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.010 
of carpet backing way more than I needed
because<00:02:18.459> I<00:02:18.640> only<00:02:18.790> use<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.480> one<00:02:19.630> little<00:02:19.810> piece

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
because I only use this one little piece

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.360 
because I only use this one little piece
in<00:02:20.170> here<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.410> didn't<00:02:20.620> really<00:02:20.709> work<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.160> put<00:02:21.340> it

spread it on here but you kind of have
to<00:02:55.660> be<00:02:55.810> careful<00:02:56.200> because<00:02:56.260> once<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.769> sticks

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
watch out for it's pretty obvious but

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.170 
watch out for it's pretty obvious but
good<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.019> point<00:03:29.200> out<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:30.310> then<00:03:30.579> I've<00:03:30.670> got<00:03:30.910> a
