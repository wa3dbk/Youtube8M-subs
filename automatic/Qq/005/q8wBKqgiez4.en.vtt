00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.050 

yeah<00:00:01.700> scale<00:00:02.700> not<00:00:03.570> for<00:00:04.020> no<00:00:04.529> single<00:00:05.100> vertex<00:00:05.640> only

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
yeah scale not for no single vertex only

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.350 
yeah scale not for no single vertex only
now<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.950> rotate<00:00:07.950> same<00:00:08.550> not<00:00:08.820> for<00:00:09.090> one<00:00:09.540> vertex

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
now and rotate same not for one vertex

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.970 
now and rotate same not for one vertex
so<00:00:12.360> that's<00:00:12.540> about<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.139> now<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.769> you

I always render with five when on low

masterpiece<00:05:26.210> okay<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.270> without<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.230> with<00:05:28.500> our

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
masterpiece okay so without and with our

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.350 
masterpiece okay so without and with our
sampling<00:05:29.720> with<00:05:30.720> our<00:05:31.110> sampling<00:05:31.980> no<00:05:32.760> more<00:05:32.940> edges

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
sampling with our sampling no more edges

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.900 
sampling with our sampling no more edges
and<00:05:33.510> stuff<00:05:34.310> without<00:05:36.620> edges<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.830> stuff<00:05:38.070> okay

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
and stuff without edges and stuff okay

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.650 
and stuff without edges and stuff okay
so<00:05:39.510> you<00:05:39.600> know<00:05:39.630> this<00:05:39.870> it<00:05:40.590> takes<00:05:40.950> a<00:05:41.220> bit<00:05:41.910> longer

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
so you know this it takes a bit longer

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.830 
so you know this it takes a bit longer
with<00:05:43.560> over<00:05:44.190> sampling<00:05:44.520> that's<00:05:45.030> because<00:05:45.390> you

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
with over sampling that's because you

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.220 
with over sampling that's because you
know<00:05:45.960> the<00:05:46.770> RGB<00:05:47.370> things<00:05:47.940> just<00:05:48.810> need<00:05:49.050> to

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
know the RGB things just need to

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.000 
know the RGB things just need to
rearrange<00:05:49.530> weather<00:05:50.340> okay<00:05:51.200> shadows<00:05:52.200> if<00:05:52.830> you

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
rearrange weather okay shadows if you

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.720 
rearrange weather okay shadows if you
want<00:05:53.220> your<00:05:53.370> shadows<00:05:53.790> to<00:05:53.970> be<00:05:54.120> generated<00:05:54.690> or<00:05:55.200> not

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
want your shadows to be generated or not

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.890 
want your shadows to be generated or not
again<00:05:57.110> takes<00:05:58.110> more<00:05:58.380> time<00:05:58.590> with<00:05:58.830> shadows<00:05:59.310> on

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
again takes more time with shadows on

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.070 
again takes more time with shadows on
less<00:06:00.900> without<00:06:01.850> that's<00:06:02.850> just<00:06:03.300> about<00:06:03.480> it<00:06:03.540> motion

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169 
in gaming if you have what it takes then

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:26.390

you'll<00:07:22.380> just<00:07:22.590> leave<00:07:23.159> it<00:07:23.310> to<00:07:23.460> 25<00:07:23.970> for<00:07:24.150> now<00:07:25.400> so

render<00:07:35.220> Animation<00:07:35.460> I<00:07:35.970> suggest<00:07:36.659> you<00:07:36.720> don't<00:07:36.960> do

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:37.229 
render Animation I suggest you don't do

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.159 
render Animation I suggest you don't do
that<00:07:37.259> with<00:07:37.680> static<00:07:38.250> objects<00:07:38.810> because<00:07:39.810> just

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.169 
that with static objects because just

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.249 
that with static objects because just
waste<00:07:40.740> time<00:07:40.889> okay<00:07:41.849> so<00:07:41.909> that's<00:07:42.150> about<00:07:42.300> it<00:07:42.449> happy
