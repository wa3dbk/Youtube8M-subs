00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:47.000 
good thing I'll go around here and show
the<00:00:36.630> inside<00:00:44.690> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:46.050> there's<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.500> dash

the inside you can see there's the dash
camera<00:00:47.430> right<00:00:47.789> there<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.760> when<00:00:50.940> you're

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
camera right there and so when you're

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.170 
camera right there and so when you're
driving<00:00:51.329> down<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> road<00:00:52.850> they<00:00:53.850> actually

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
driving down the road they actually

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.430 
driving down the road they actually
really<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.750> much<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.320> that's

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
really don't see that much so that's

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
really don't see that much so that's
really<00:00:55.649> block<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.129> view<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.370> anything<00:00:59.149> go

really block your view or anything go

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.580 
really block your view or anything go
around<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> other<00:01:00.570> side<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:01.020> easier<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.469> see

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
around the other side it's easier to see

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:19.200 
around the other side it's easier to see
how<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.920> mounted<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.579> over<00:01:02.820> there

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.190 
you can see it's got a suction cup mount
which<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.229> have<00:01:25.390> stuck<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:26.570> windshield<00:01:27.079> right

this<00:02:55.170> little<00:02:56.120> flip<00:02:57.120> down<00:02:57.269> screen<00:02:57.660> open<00:02:57.959> that's

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
this little flip down screen open that's

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.870 
this little flip down screen open that's
basically<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.829> so<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.040> can<00:02:59.370> see<00:02:59.640> if<00:02:59.730> it's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
basically just so you can see if it's

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.120 
basically just so you can see if it's
recording<00:03:00.420> or<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.720> you<00:03:00.840> want<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.170> maybe<00:03:01.950> go

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
recording or if you want to maybe go

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.680 
recording or if you want to maybe go
back<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.489> play<00:03:02.640> back<00:03:02.849> some<00:03:03.060> footage<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> does

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
back and play back some footage it does

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.569 
back and play back some footage it does
have<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.900> playback<00:03:04.349> feature<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.920> here<00:03:05.190> but<00:03:05.400> I

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
have a playback feature on here but I

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.220 
have a playback feature on here but I
won't<00:03:06.150> get<00:03:06.299> into<00:03:06.569> all<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.720> for<00:03:07.019> this<00:03:07.140> video

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
won't get into all that for this video

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.690 
won't get into all that for this video
I'll<00:03:10.230> leave<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.560> open<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.310> next<00:03:11.549> feature

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
I'll leave that open to the next feature

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.319 
I'll leave that open to the next feature
here<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.299> have<00:03:12.930> it<00:03:13.049> wired<00:03:13.260> up<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:14.239> when<00:03:15.239> you

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
here I have it wired up so that when you

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.470 
here I have it wired up so that when you
turn<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.660> car<00:03:15.840> back<00:03:15.900> off<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.560> shuts<00:03:16.829> down

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
turn the car back off it shuts down

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.160 
turn the car back off it shuts down
automatically<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:21.090> it'll<00:03:21.299> take<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> second

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
automatically so it'll take it a second

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:42.380 
automatically so it'll take it a second
but

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.470 

you<00:03:43.390> can<00:03:43.540> see<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.840> shuts<00:03:44.080> down<00:03:44.170> automatically

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
you can see it shuts down automatically

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.450 
you can see it shuts down automatically
so<00:03:46.480> that's<00:03:46.660> great<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.980> know<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.130> don't<00:03:48.340> have

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
so that's great you know you don't have

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.830 
so that's great you know you don't have
to<00:03:48.550> do<00:03:48.640> anything<00:03:48.850> just<00:03:49.030> get<00:03:49.330> in<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:49.480> car<00:03:49.630> turn

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
to do anything just get in the car turn

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.450 
to do anything just get in the car turn
it<00:03:49.960> on<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.260> go<00:03:50.350> like<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.650> normally<00:03:50.830> would<00:03:51.010> to

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
it on and go like you normally would to

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.370 
it on and go like you normally would to
wherever<00:03:51.760> you're<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:52.210> and<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.960> will<00:03:53.080> record

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
wherever you're going and it will record

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.770 
wherever you're going and it will record
automatically<00:03:54.840> so<00:03:55.840> now<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.650> will<00:03:57.280> show<00:03:57.780> go

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
automatically so now I will show go

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.120 
automatically so now I will show go
ahead<00:03:58.960> and<00:03:59.050> turn<00:03:59.140> this<00:03:59.290> back<00:03:59.530> on<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.100> it

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
ahead and turn this back on so it

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.670 
ahead and turn this back on so it
doesn't<00:04:00.250> get<00:04:00.580> too<00:04:00.730> hot<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:01.120> here<00:04:01.330> about<00:04:02.320> 90

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
doesn't get too hot in here about 90

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.390 
doesn't get too hot in here about 90
degrees<00:04:03.010> today<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:04.560> how<00:04:05.560> have<00:04:05.710> it<00:04:05.830> wired<00:04:06.040> up<00:04:06.250> to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
degrees today so how have it wired up to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.150 
degrees today so how have it wired up to
the<00:04:06.670> wire<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:07.900> power<00:04:08.200> runs<00:04:08.650> up<00:04:08.830> there<00:04:09.040> and

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
the wire to the power runs up there and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.420 
the wire to the power runs up there and
what<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.310> did<00:04:09.550> is<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:10.290> power<00:04:11.290> wire<00:04:11.650> runs<00:04:12.070> just

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
what I did is the power wire runs just

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.420 
what I did is the power wire runs just
up<00:04:12.640> here<00:04:12.880> back<00:04:13.330> behind<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.780> headliner<00:04:14.430> runs

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
up here back behind the headliner runs

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.390 
up here back behind the headliner runs
back<00:04:15.670> there<00:04:15.880> behind<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.390> headliner<00:04:16.780> and<00:04:17.709> then

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
back there behind the headliner and then

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.070 
back there behind the headliner and then
you<00:04:18.910> get<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.120> the<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.270> pillar<00:04:19.660> right<00:04:19.870> here<00:04:20.049> I

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
you get to the a pillar right here I

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.410 
you get to the a pillar right here I
pulled<00:04:20.290> this<00:04:20.410> piece<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.739> trim<00:04:20.950> off<00:04:21.300> ran<00:04:22.300> it

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
pulled this piece of trim off ran it

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.730 
pulled this piece of trim off ran it
down<00:04:22.570> behind<00:04:22.750> here<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:25.200> take<00:04:26.200> it<00:04:26.260> out<00:04:26.440> shows

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
down behind here and take it out shows

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.300 
down behind here and take it out shows
next<00:04:27.010> one<00:04:28.410> pull<00:04:29.410> this<00:04:29.560> little<00:04:29.830> piece<00:04:29.950> of<00:04:30.130> trim

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
next one pull this little piece of trim

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.270 
next one pull this little piece of trim
off<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:30.700> ran<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:30.910> back<00:04:31.060> behind<00:04:31.360> their<00:04:32.280> event

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
off and ran it back behind their event

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.180 
off and ran it back behind their event
coming<00:04:33.610> down<00:04:33.790> here<00:04:34.650> might<00:04:35.650> be<00:04:35.680> kind<00:04:35.980> of<00:04:36.040> hard

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
coming down here might be kind of hard

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.640 
coming down here might be kind of hard
to<00:04:36.220> see<00:04:36.520> but<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:37.720> can<00:04:38.020> see<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.560> used<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:40.650> fuse

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
to see but you can see I used a fuse

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.950 
to see but you can see I used a fuse
panel<00:04:42.040> tap<00:04:42.340> so<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.090> could<00:04:43.300> add<00:04:43.480> an<00:04:43.630> extra

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
panel tap so I could add an extra

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.090 
panel tap so I could add an extra
cigarette<00:04:44.610> 12-volt<00:04:45.610> outlet<00:04:46.650> right<00:04:47.650> there<00:04:47.860> up

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
cigarette 12-volt outlet right there up

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.480 
cigarette 12-volt outlet right there up
under<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.630> dashboard

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.520 

because<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.060> camera<00:04:53.420> operates<00:04:53.870> off<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.140> five

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
because the camera operates off of five

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.010 
because the camera operates off of five
volts<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.700> car<00:04:55.910> of<00:04:56.030> course<00:04:56.210> puts<00:04:56.540> out<00:04:56.690> 12

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
volts and the car of course puts out 12

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.820 
volts and the car of course puts out 12
volts<00:04:57.380> I<00:04:57.560> need<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:57.860> have<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.190> plug<00:04:58.430> on<00:04:58.640> there

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
volts I need to have that plug on there

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.550 
volts I need to have that plug on there
so<00:05:00.830> just<00:05:01.250> basically<00:05:01.930> tap<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.110> fuse<00:05:03.320> panel

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
so just basically tap the fuse panel

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.740 
so just basically tap the fuse panel
added<00:05:04.490> a<00:05:06.040> and<00:05:07.040> out<00:05:07.370> are<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.610> circuit<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.570> the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
added a and out are a circuit to the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.430 
added a and out are a circuit to the
fuse<00:05:09.350> panel<00:05:09.530> and<00:05:10.240> did<00:05:11.240> it<00:05:11.330> so<00:05:11.360> that<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.840> only<00:05:11.870> is

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
fuse panel and did it so that it only is

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.230 
fuse panel and did it so that it only is
on<00:05:12.800> when<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.310> car<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.580> on<00:05:13.850> so<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.150> way

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
on when the car is on so that way

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.560 
on when the car is on so that way
doesn't<00:05:14.510> run<00:05:14.660> down<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.960> battery<00:05:15.110> or<00:05:15.410> anything

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
doesn't run down the battery or anything

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.760 
doesn't run down the battery or anything
so<00:05:17.570> anyway<00:05:17.930> you<00:05:18.710> can<00:05:18.740> see<00:05:20.230> wire<00:05:21.230> just<00:05:21.500> runs

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
so anyway you can see wire just runs

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.470
