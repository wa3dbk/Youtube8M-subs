 women 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.480
 but after all what causes sagging 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.240
 abdominal 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.210
 loss of natural skin elasticity 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.180
 in the abdominal region can be caused 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.949
 excessive gain and loss of weight or 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.980

 the reduction of stretch marks below the navel 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.320
 it happens naturally when it is 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.380
 along with excess skin to be removed 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.299
 ordered laboratory tests some 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.649

 tell your doctor the medicines you 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.119
 you use normally because some should 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.920
 be suspended as in the case of 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.649
 anticoagulants 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.810

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.640
 days 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.629
 other specific recommendations 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.030
 concerning curative care 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:40.579
 solar exposure healing and practice 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.879

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.680
 by your doctor according to your case the 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.019
 patience and caring are key 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.540
 in the postoperative period 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.360
 over a few months you can see 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.819
 a more natural and definitive result 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.760
 complications are rare due to 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.370
 preparation performed in the preoperative period 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.750
 care offered during and after the 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.790
 surgery 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.670
 plastic surgery is one of the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.950
 to gain more self-confidence and 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.769
 improve your quality of life 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.349
 talk about your expectations with your 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.900
 and I see that it really can be 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.620
 done in your case since perfection does not 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.019
 exist 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.419
 together they can discuss the techniques 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.000
 surgical procedures and the 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.190
 indicated for your case because you have to 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.690
 always respect the anatomy of each 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.579
 person 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.780
 there is no plastic surgery without 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.400
 scars 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.130
 each person has a process of 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.590
 different healing that does not 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.709
 of the doctor but of the organism 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.950
 you should seek the best result 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.650
 within their reality without expectation 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.220
 to look like someone famous or 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:54.709
 that you admire surgical technique 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.209
 abdominal wall is formed of skin 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.489
 fatty tissue and musculature each 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.680
 abdominoplasty is thoroughly 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.730
 planned by analyzing whether the overall format 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.639
 of the body 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.669
 Let's see now how the 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.370
 abdominal surgery is performed 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:14.840
 horizontal incision above the hair 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.600
 pubic 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.470
 through it the surgeon has access to 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.620
 musicians knows 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.020
 nominal values that can be approximated if 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.830
 are far apart leaving the wall 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.530
 the flabby and 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.590
 covers an abdominal muscle is pulled to 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.550
 low and removed leaving firm abdomen 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.860
 and beautiful belly button is repositioned on your 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.920
 the original location through a new 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.050
 hole whose incision is hidden in the 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.500
 umbilical scar 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:51.350
 the size of the scar will be determined 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.570
 by the degree of sagging of the abdomen when 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.360
 the patient shows little excess of 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.120
 skin the size of the incision is smaller 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.160
 very similar to the size of the cesarean section 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.310
 technique known as mini 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.050
 abdominoplasty in cases where there is 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.960
 great flaccidity of skin 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.000
 the scar is bigger but it is hidden 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.850
 in the brand of swimsuits 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.640
 the use of a drain may be necessary to 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.490
 the removal of liquids and are formed below 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.669
 the skin to facilitate healing and 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.860
 promoting a faster recovery 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.650
 it is withdrawn in the days following 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.380
 surgery according to each case 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.010
 liposuction is often associated with 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:36.560
 abdominoplasty to remove the 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.900
 thereby providing localized fat 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.510
 best body contour 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.580
 the scars ripen 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.340
 less visible over time 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.370
 It may take a few months for the 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:52.280
 final result 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.830
 post-surgical recommendations the use of 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.770
 modeling strap is a must in 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.410
 the postoperative period helping to reshape 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.320
 new abdomen shape will decrease the 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:06.320
 accumulation of liquids and also accelerate 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.240
 recovery by compressing the 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.580
 operated region 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.010
 in the first days the patient should 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.540
 keep your posture curved so you do not 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.630
 commit the points 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.390
 sleep should also maintain the 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.300
 curved with the aid of pillows 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.190
 underneath the knees and back 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.760
 lymphatic drainage sessions and 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.680
 ultrasound accelerate recovery 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.840
 promoting the absorption of bumps and 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.040
 improving the 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.040
 the internal update
