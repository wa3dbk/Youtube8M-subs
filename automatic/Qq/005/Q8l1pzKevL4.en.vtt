it's beyond her laser range for today
but<00:04:15.600> after<00:04:15.870> we<00:04:15.959> hiked<00:04:16.200> out<00:04:16.380> there<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.739> was<00:04:16.859> uh

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
but after we hiked out there it was uh

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.590 
but after we hiked out there it was uh
we<00:04:17.280> realized<00:04:17.700> as<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.030> little<00:04:18.209> farther<00:04:18.390> than<00:04:18.480> we

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
we realized as a little farther than we

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.420 
we realized as a little farther than we
thought<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:18.930> was<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.320> that<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.590> slimy<00:04:20.040> those

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
thought it was and that is slimy those

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.710 
thought it was and that is slimy those
hills<00:04:20.730> are<00:04:20.940> slimy<00:04:21.740> right<00:04:22.740> oh<00:04:22.920> yeah<00:04:23.280> yeah<00:04:23.720> okay

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.900 
hills are slimy right oh yeah yeah okay
I<00:04:24.750> pretty<00:04:24.990> much<00:04:25.080> was<00:04:25.770> carrying<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.400> target<00:04:26.790> up

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
I pretty much was carrying the target up

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.360 
I pretty much was carrying the target up
one<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.210> these<00:04:27.300> slopes<00:04:27.980> stepped<00:04:28.980> on<00:04:29.130> some

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
one of these slopes stepped on some

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.000 
one of these slopes stepped on some
slime<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.300> I<00:04:30.450> ended<00:04:30.690> up<00:04:30.810> upside<00:04:31.020> down<00:04:31.410> sliding

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
slime and I ended up upside down sliding

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.640 
slime and I ended up upside down sliding
downhill<00:04:32.250> into<00:04:32.790> one<00:04:33.030> of<00:04:33.150> those<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:33.510> caves<00:04:33.810> so

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
downhill into one of those the caves so

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.760 
downhill into one of those the caves so
they<00:04:34.770> got<00:04:34.890> these<00:04:35.070> vertical<00:04:35.610> tubes<00:04:36.240> out<00:04:36.510> there

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
they got these vertical tubes out there

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.080 
they got these vertical tubes out there
that<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.890> water<00:04:38.100> runs<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> thought<00:04:38.910> I<00:04:38.940> was

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
that the water runs to I thought I was

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.840 
that the water runs to I thought I was
gonna<00:04:39.180> die<00:04:39.480> pretty<00:04:39.780> much<00:04:40.070> yeah<00:04:41.070> but<00:04:41.310> uh<00:04:41.340> yeah

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
gonna die pretty much yeah but uh yeah

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.760 
gonna die pretty much yeah but uh yeah
the<00:04:42.000> target<00:04:42.360> kind<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.630> caught<00:04:42.780> me<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.140> oh<00:04:43.290> my

ended<00:05:24.330> up<00:05:24.419> next<00:05:24.719> time<00:05:25.699> so<00:05:26.699> should<00:05:26.909> we<00:05:26.939> go

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
ended up next time so should we go

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.969 
ended up next time so should we go
through<00:05:27.389> yeah<00:05:28.080> let's<00:05:28.259> just<00:05:28.409> cut<00:05:28.590> cross<00:05:28.770> you

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
through yeah let's just cut cross you

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:29.719 
through yeah let's just cut cross you
can<00:05:29.129> go<00:05:29.219> down<00:05:29.400> this<00:05:29.490> way

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
can go down this way

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:46.420 
can go down this way
yep<00:05:30.180> so<00:05:30.509> we<00:05:30.569> don't<00:05:30.689> die<00:05:30.960> fall<00:05:31.500> into<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.770> hole

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.180 

we're<00:05:47.430> almost<00:05:47.610> there<00:05:48.710> it's<00:05:49.710> right<00:05:49.949> over<00:05:50.159> that

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
we're almost there it's right over that

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.749 
we're almost there it's right over that
hill

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 
hill

00:05:50.759 --> 00:06:01.369 
hill
I'll<00:05:51.569> see<00:05:51.930> it<00:05:52.110> Ernest<00:05:56.539> you<00:05:57.539> can<00:05:57.750> do<00:05:57.900> it<00:06:00.379> yeah

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
I'll see it Ernest you can do it yeah

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:07.719 
I'll see it Ernest you can do it yeah
one<00:06:01.830> times<00:06:02.900> okay<00:06:04.520> so<00:06:05.520> the<00:06:06.210> first<00:06:06.449> one<00:06:06.599> I<00:06:06.750> think

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
one times okay so the first one I think

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:11.330 
one times okay so the first one I think
is<00:06:08.729> there<00:06:08.879> is<00:06:08.969> an<00:06:09.060> impact<00:06:09.389> right<00:06:09.689> there<00:06:10.250> but<00:06:11.250> it

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
is there is an impact right there but it

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.980 
is there is an impact right there but it
looks<00:06:11.370> like<00:06:11.699> it<00:06:11.849> bounced<00:06:12.240> up<00:06:12.330> and<00:06:12.449> whacked<00:06:12.779> it

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
looks like it bounced up and whacked it

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.189 
looks like it bounced up and whacked it
and<00:06:13.740> then<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.729> second<00:06:15.150> one<00:06:15.270> was<00:06:15.479> go<00:06:15.990> ahead<00:06:16.050> and

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
and then the second one was go ahead and

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:18.339 
and then the second one was go ahead and
point<00:06:16.349> that

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
point that

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.409 
point that
yep<00:06:19.349> and<00:06:19.620> bounced<00:06:20.310> off<00:06:20.430> that<00:06:20.490> rock<00:06:20.969> that

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
yep and bounced off that rock that

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:23.809 
yep and bounced off that rock that
little<00:06:22.289> temple<00:06:22.650> to<00:06:22.710> see<00:06:22.860> that<00:06:22.979> let<00:06:23.370> mark<00:06:23.639> come

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
little temple to see that let mark come

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.980 
little temple to see that let mark come
in<00:06:23.940> or<00:06:24.029> not<00:06:24.440> and<00:06:25.440> then<00:06:25.589> a<00:06:25.650> bomb<00:06:25.860> stuff

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
in or not and then a bomb stuff

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.050 
in or not and then a bomb stuff
hit<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.680> target<00:06:27.919> again<00:06:28.310> we<00:06:28.550> should<00:06:28.729> repeat

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
hit the target again we should repeat

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.140 
hit the target again we should repeat
that<00:06:29.210> target<00:06:29.600> again<00:06:32.740> so<00:06:33.759> that's<00:06:34.759> our<00:06:34.970> little

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
that target again so that's our little

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.350 
that target again so that's our little
plate<00:06:35.539> though<00:06:36.039> it's<00:06:37.039> like<00:06:37.190> a<00:06:37.220> 500<00:06:37.940> meter<00:06:38.030> plate

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
plate though it's like a 500 meter plate

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.270 
plate though it's like a 500 meter plate
is<00:06:38.539> what<00:06:38.690> a<00:06:38.720> lot<00:06:38.900> of<00:06:38.990> guys<00:06:39.139> use<00:06:39.380> it<00:06:39.530> 500<00:06:40.070> even

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
is what a lot of guys use it 500 even

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.219 
is what a lot of guys use it 500 even
though<00:06:40.400> it's<00:06:40.580> plus<00:06:41.060> 12<00:06:41.449> by<00:06:41.830> 14<00:06:42.830> or<00:06:42.979> something

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
though it's plus 12 by 14 or something

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:50.560 
though it's plus 12 by 14 or something
but<00:06:45.229> uh<00:06:46.810> your<00:06:47.810> shots<00:06:48.380> are<00:06:48.620> about<00:06:49.449> 11<00:06:50.449> inches

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
but uh your shots are about 11 inches

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.409 
but uh your shots are about 11 inches
apart<00:06:51.020> and<00:06:53.770> probably<00:06:54.770> three<00:06:55.070> inches<00:06:55.460> an<00:06:56.300> hour

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
apart and probably three inches an hour
