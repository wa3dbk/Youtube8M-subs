00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
I know just that if you sit and work on

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.880 
I know just that if you sit and work on
that<00:02:56.090> like<00:02:56.359> for<00:02:56.540> long<00:02:56.659> enough<00:02:56.870> when<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.739> get

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
that like for long enough when you get

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.020 
that like for long enough when you get
that<00:02:58.040> right<00:02:58.310> then<00:02:58.489> you<00:02:58.579> can<00:02:58.640> move<00:02:58.849> on<00:02:58.970> to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
that right then you can move on to

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.979 
that right then you can move on to
something<00:02:59.209> else<00:02:59.299> that's<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.599> way<00:02:59.689> I<00:02:59.720> kind<00:02:59.959> of

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
something else that's the way I kind of

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.259 
something else that's the way I kind of
look<00:03:00.049> at<00:03:00.230> it<00:03:00.409> if<00:03:00.859> you<00:03:01.129> you<00:03:01.670> know<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:01.939> many<00:03:02.060> ways

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
look at it if you you know so many ways

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:12.429 
look at it if you you know so many ways
I've<00:03:02.390> done<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.689> go<00:03:02.840> I<00:03:10.450> think<00:03:11.450> people<00:03:11.959> will

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
I've done that go I think people will

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.170 
I've done that go I think people will
get<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.829> tab<00:03:13.099> for<00:03:13.670> that<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:13.939> they'll<00:03:14.030> say

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
get the tab for that and they'll say

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.030 
get the tab for that and they'll say
that's<00:03:14.720> that<00:03:14.900> lick<00:03:15.170> there<00:03:15.379> that<00:03:15.530> I've<00:03:15.859> got

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
that's that lick there that I've got

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.250 
that's that lick there that I've got
that<00:03:16.189> one<00:03:16.220> now<00:03:16.970> later<00:03:17.180> on<00:03:17.299> again<00:03:17.720> I'll<00:03:18.139> just

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
that one now later on again I'll just

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.750 
that one now later on again I'll just
play<00:03:18.439> our<00:03:18.620> three<00:03:18.829> different<00:03:18.950> words<00:03:19.280> it's<00:03:19.639> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
play our three different words it's the

play our three different words it's the
new<00:03:19.909> ones<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.419> kind<00:03:20.629> of<00:03:20.659> you<00:03:21.500> know<00:03:21.650> even

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
new ones it's the kind of you know even

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.530 
new ones it's the kind of you know even
to<00:03:22.579> either<00:03:22.879> two<00:03:23.060> notes<00:03:24.310> yeah<00:03:28.450> that's<00:03:29.450> just

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
to either two notes yeah that's just

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.629 
to either two notes yeah that's just
that<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:29.959> kind<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.319> it's<00:03:31.010> just<00:03:31.099> how<00:03:31.609> you

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
that all kind of it's just how you

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.030 
that all kind of it's just how you
interpret<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:33.709> really<00:03:33.859> what

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
interpret it and that's really what

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.289 
interpret it and that's really what
makes<00:03:34.189> the<00:03:34.310> difference<00:03:34.340> I<00:03:34.730> mean<00:03:34.849> if<00:03:34.939> you<00:03:35.030> play

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299
