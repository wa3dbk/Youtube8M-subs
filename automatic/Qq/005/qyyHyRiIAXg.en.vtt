00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
well if it's goes in my Timbo I can I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.570 
well if it's goes in my Timbo I can I
don't<00:02:50.010> like<00:02:50.420> things<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.660> brush<00:02:52.530> away<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:52.920> like

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
don't like things to brush away I like

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.850 
don't like things to brush away I like
to<00:02:53.730> take<00:02:53.940> things<00:02:54.420> one<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> day<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.260> time<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
to take things one a day at the time and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.850 
to take things one a day at the time and
and<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.820> think<00:02:57.120> with<00:02:57.390> this<00:02:57.570> step<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.020> made<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and I think with this step I made the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.430 
and I think with this step I made the
hopefully<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.820> right<00:02:59.970> decision<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.750> took<00:03:01.380> it

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
hopefully the right decision and took it

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.290 
hopefully the right decision and took it
step<00:03:01.709> by<00:03:01.739> step<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.400> hopefully<00:03:03.000> i<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.060> do<00:03:03.270> that

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
step by step and hopefully i can do that

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.470 
step by step and hopefully i can do that
when<00:03:03.570> i<00:03:03.840> come<00:03:04.170> down<00:03:04.200> here<00:03:04.470> as<00:03:04.560> well<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.480> it's
