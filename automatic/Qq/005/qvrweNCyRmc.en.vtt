00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
going leak in there and I should have

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it better this fall but I thought it

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.450 
it better this fall but I thought it
could<00:00:25.680> hold<00:00:25.890> until<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:27.180> spring<00:00:28.220> but<00:00:29.220> anyways

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
could hold until this spring but anyways

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.160 
could hold until this spring but anyways
what<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.699> think<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.090> happening<00:00:30.330> I'll<00:00:30.779> take<00:00:30.990> you

but I have it parked on a slant next to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.360 
but I have it parked on a slant next to
my<00:00:39.840> driveway<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.620> moment<00:00:40.800> till<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.219> get
