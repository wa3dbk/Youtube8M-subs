00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 here is garden video point is my 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.680
 name is markus boosted our theme 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.510
 old office office is an old one 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.700
 English rose we have been in for a long time 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.030
 have our garden and those with us 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.500
 a very high garden value shows that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 first thing you can see is one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.910
 flowering also a quality as fast 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 softies big when she is dead 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.710
 all flowers leaves lose one says 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.630
 it's anointing the rose looks very beautiful 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.330
 you quickly see that here comes 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.610
 you shake her and she is gone like that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 means that one very quickly one again 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.899
 clean plant has where it is not 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.059
 faded brown roses after 300 anyway 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 There are also plenty of fresh flowers 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.649
 sees that here are the softies in her 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.899
 show full splendor 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.300
 It was very hot here last week 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.340
 to 40 degrees accordingly are some 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.010
 flowers also lightened a bit but also 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.590
 so office looks very attractive 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.449
 office is a similar shrub rose we 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.500
 but cut like a beetrose we 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.690
 they also have with us under the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.280
 English beetroots submitted because 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.580
 we noticed they were down completely 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 cut every year 15 to 20 cm 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.220
 fall below 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.600
 then we have a very compact rose 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.030
 Look at this beautiful 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.210
 roundish wish the rose now 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.670
 made it back out of the base 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.080
 would cut wrong very shrub rose 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.210
 so would let stand about 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 fall apart and that's how the rose stays 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.439
 nice tight upright something you can 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.640
 unfortunately not all english roses 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.979
 can say 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.990
 Sophies is sometimes called Rosenfreunde 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.420
 said that relatively vulnerable to 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
 real mildew also that's right 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.689
 We also experienced as we did 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.430
 The softies have planted out here 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.619
 next one two years since the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.840
 rosebush but established and rich 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.579
 deadline we see almost no real 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.320
 mildew it is also very sturdy 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.659
 Faulty message that fell 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.850
 bigger problem in the gardens than that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 powdery mildew and opposite sternustau 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.380
 So we are also health-moderately 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.820
 extremely extensive plant protection with us 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.509
 in the garden very satisfied with the rose 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.969
 sofia through like most English 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.160
 roses also a beautiful beautiful 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:11.479
 fruity scents need more air 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.479
 has edelrose
