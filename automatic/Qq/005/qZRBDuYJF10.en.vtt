00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
two of them they fit this thing

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.590 
two of them they fit this thing
perfectly<00:00:44.559> right<00:00:45.040> it's<00:00:45.549> a<00:00:45.760> little<00:00:46.059> bit<00:00:46.360> too

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
big for my little wood stove but I did

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.600 
big for my little wood stove but I did
have<00:00:49.600> to<00:00:49.659> cut<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:49.989> hole<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:51.220> be<00:00:51.369> able<00:00:51.549> to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
have to cut a hole in it to be able to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.759 
have to cut a hole in it to be able to
open<00:00:51.909> this<00:00:52.030> circle<00:00:52.420> that's<00:00:52.809> okay<00:00:53.320> too<00:00:53.559> because

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
open this circle that's okay too because

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.590 
open this circle that's okay too because
that<00:00:54.220> right<00:00:54.400> there<00:00:54.580> the<00:00:54.790> heat<00:00:54.970> rises<00:00:55.449> up

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
that right there the heat rises up

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.149 
that right there the heat rises up
through<00:00:55.659> this<00:00:56.110> thing<00:00:56.379> and<00:00:56.409> comes<00:00:56.739> out<00:00:56.920> these

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
through this thing and comes out these

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.350 
through this thing and comes out these
holds<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:59.350> needs<00:00:59.650> some<00:00:59.860> air<00:01:00.100> sucking<00:01:00.970> in<00:01:01.210> to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
holds it needs some air sucking in to

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.869 
holds it needs some air sucking in to
make<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.629> heat<00:01:01.809> move<00:01:02.019> up<00:01:02.199> anyway<00:01:02.710> but<00:01:03.640> what<00:01:03.850> I

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
make the heat move up anyway but what I

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.020 
make the heat move up anyway but what I
found<00:01:04.180> was<00:01:04.479> its<00:01:05.019> with<00:01:05.290> this<00:01:05.530> lid<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.490> it<00:01:06.640> this

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
found was its with this lid on it this

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.780 
found was its with this lid on it this
thing<00:01:07.270> got<00:01:07.479> up<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.810> 250<00:01:08.770> degrees<00:01:08.800> which<00:01:09.430> is<00:01:09.460> way

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
thing got up to 250 degrees which is way

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.740 
thing got up to 250 degrees which is way
too<00:01:09.850> hot<00:01:10.330> for<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.660> hydrating<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.970> now<00:01:13.210> I<00:01:13.570> have

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
too hot for the hydrating so now I have

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.500 
too hot for the hydrating so now I have
to<00:01:13.990> take<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.350> lid<00:01:14.530> off<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:15.310> leave<00:01:15.910> it<00:01:15.940> off<00:01:16.210> if

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
to take the lid off and leave it off if

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.540 
to take the lid off and leave it off if
I<00:01:16.720> want<00:01:16.960> to<00:01:17.020> use<00:01:17.230> it<00:01:17.260> as<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.530> dehydrator<00:01:18.310> and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
I want to use it as a dehydrator and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.720 
I want to use it as a dehydrator and
I'll<00:01:19.030> have<00:01:19.300> to<00:01:19.420> work<00:01:19.960> with<00:01:20.230> the<00:01:20.350> fire<00:01:20.620> not<00:01:21.550> to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
I'll have to work with the fire not to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.060 
I'll have to work with the fire not to
let<00:01:21.910> that<00:01:22.090> get<00:01:22.270> over<00:01:22.540> one<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.170> then<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.040> thought

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
let that get over one so then I thought

like<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.220> originally<00:01:45.400> had<00:01:45.670> it<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.120> highest

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
like I originally had it the highest

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.530 
like I originally had it the highest
temperature<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.840> could<00:01:47.020> get<00:01:47.200> was<00:01:47.409> 250<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.970> now<00:01:49.240> I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.590 
temperature I could get was 250 so now I
took<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.409> heart<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:50.950> cut<00:01:51.190> off<00:01:51.600> enhanced

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
took this heart that I cut off enhanced

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.800 
took this heart that I cut off enhanced
it<00:01:52.720> back<00:01:52.930> on<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:54.070> hopefully<00:01:54.610> with<00:01:55.330> with<00:01:55.659> it

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
it back on and hopefully with with it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.930 
it back on and hopefully with with it
closed<00:01:56.080> up<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:57.040> I<00:01:57.070> have<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.460> open<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.700> every

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
closed up but I have to open it every

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.410 
closed up but I have to open it every
time<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.300> feed<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.540> fire<00:01:59.850> when<00:02:00.850> I<00:02:00.880> close<00:02:01.120> it<00:02:01.150> up

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
time to feed the fire when I close it up

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.789 
time to feed the fire when I close it up
i'm<00:02:01.570> hoping<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:01.930> get<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.229> temperature<00:02:02.440> in

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
i'm hoping to get the temperature in

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.580 
i'm hoping to get the temperature in
there<00:02:03.010> up<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.370> at<00:02:03.670> least<00:02:04.000> 350<00:02:04.690> 400<00:02:05.290> let's<00:02:05.470> see

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
there up to at least 350 400 let's see

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.430 
there up to at least 350 400 let's see
if<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:05.770> can<00:02:05.890> get<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.130> up<00:02:06.220> that<00:02:06.430> high<00:02:07.110> all<00:02:08.110> right

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
if we can get it up that high all right

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.820 
if we can get it up that high all right
it<00:02:08.679> took<00:02:08.830> about<00:02:08.979> five<00:02:09.879> minutes<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.830> we

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
it took about five minutes and we

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.670 
it took about five minutes and we
already<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.760> hit<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.240> 150<00:02:14.140> more<00:02:14.319> on<00:02:14.560> this

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
already have hit the 150 more on this

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.650 
already have hit the 150 more on this
level<00:02:14.980> I'll<00:02:15.250> take<00:02:15.550> this<00:02:15.760> out

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
level I'll take this out

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.070 
level I'll take this out
put<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.230> up<00:02:17.320> here<00:02:17.500> on<00:02:17.650> top<00:02:18.780> cuz<00:02:19.780> you're<00:02:19.900> going

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
put it up here on top cuz you're going

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.720 
put it up here on top cuz you're going
to<00:02:20.200> do<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.470> with<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.710> lid<00:02:20.890> off<00:02:21.160> with<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.520> lid

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
to do it with the lid off with the lid

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.940 
to do it with the lid off with the lid
on<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.120> go<00:02:22.330> up<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.510> 250<00:02:23.140> even<00:02:23.470> without<00:02:23.650> this

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
on it go up to 250 even without this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.500 
on it go up to 250 even without this
door<00:02:24.190> closed<00:02:24.750> without<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.780> close<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.350> 50<00:02:27.510> so

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
door closed without it close to 50 so

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.290 
door closed without it close to 50 so
130<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.170> 150<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.710> really<00:02:30.040> really<00:02:30.190> good<00:02:30.490> and<00:02:31.210> you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
130 to 150 is really really good and you

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.300 
130 to 150 is really really good and you
can<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.720> can<00:02:32.050> feel<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.530> heat<00:02:32.560> just<00:02:32.890> coming

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
can you can feel the heat just coming

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.720 
can you can feel the heat just coming
through<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:33.730> means<00:02:34.000> it's<00:02:34.180> moving<00:02:34.540> air<00:02:35.730> so

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
through so that means it's moving air so

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.550 
through so that means it's moving air so
right<00:02:36.940> there<00:02:37.120> isn't<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.480> dehydrator<00:02:38.050> see<00:02:38.470> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
right there isn't a dehydrator see I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.810 
right there isn't a dehydrator see I
thought<00:02:38.800> about<00:02:38.950> making<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.370> Solar<00:02:39.640> dehydrator

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
thought about making a Solar dehydrator

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.600 
thought about making a Solar dehydrator
but<00:02:40.750> man<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.470> wintertime<00:02:41.770> our<00:02:42.130> days<00:02:42.370> are

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
but man in the wintertime our days are

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.660 
but man in the wintertime our days are
so<00:02:42.820> short<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:44.380> if<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.710> are<00:02:45.300> kill<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.330> deer<00:02:46.840> or

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
so short and if you are kill a deer or

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.860 
so short and if you are kill a deer or
Paulson<00:02:48.670> or<00:02:48.790> something<00:02:49.090> wanted<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.360> hydrate

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
Paulson or something wanted to hydrate

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.950 
Paulson or something wanted to hydrate
it<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:51.490> may<00:02:51.640> not<00:02:51.790> have<00:02:52.000> enough<00:02:52.210> hours<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
it you may not have enough hours in the

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.980 
it you may not have enough hours in the
day<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.680> be<00:02:54.400> able<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:54.730> dehydrate<00:02:55.210> it<00:02:55.240> if<00:02:55.480> there

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
day to be able to dehydrate it if there

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.920 
day to be able to dehydrate it if there
is<00:02:56.080> a<00:02:56.110> no<00:02:56.350> electrical<00:02:56.770> situation<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:58.630> i<00:02:58.660> think

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
is a no electrical situation but i think

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.060 
is a no electrical situation but i think
this<00:02:59.050> right<00:02:59.260> here<00:02:59.440> is<00:02:59.470> going<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.740> work<00:02:59.800> really

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
for a dehydrator but i'm not going to

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.990 
for a dehydrator but i'm not going to
need<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.050> lid<00:03:47.320> at<00:03:47.500> all<00:03:47.680> for<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> dehydrator<00:03:48.730> so

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
need the lid at all for a dehydrator so

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.090 
need the lid at all for a dehydrator so
now<00:03:49.209> i<00:03:49.239> may<00:03:49.570> have<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.840> put<00:03:50.170> bolts<00:03:50.500> back<00:03:50.860> in
