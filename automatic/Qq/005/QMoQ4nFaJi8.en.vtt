00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 about ten years ago I was in school 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.770
 like everyone is a very good friend 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.319
 to me who was in my class to 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.570
 the time made me discover a manga to 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.580
 manga that I really appreciated and who 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.980
 in addition to that is so much that 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.900
 the story continues today 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.260
 my dear friends I had the pleasure and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.220
 the honor to present you 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.519
 hajime 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.519
 2 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.660
 how's that the ridiculous match 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.150
 damien yes but no but I put myself 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.410
 in context a little yes but I believe 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.660
 that I like the Commissioner and the 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.760
 face with something like that no but 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.479
 the guys also to me who are doing 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.550
 efforts to draw voice near hajime no 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.470
 ippo is in my eyes maybe better 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.390
 manga in terms of sports references 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.720
 and we are not talking about any 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.950
 sport 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.900
 we are talking about boxing yes I know 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.950
 talented girl is going you know one everyone is 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.140
 gifted in his element 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.020
 there are people who are a bit more 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.910
 gifted in more elements than others 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.740
 so before jean louis for reference 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.390
 in terms of mangasport in my eyes 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.729
 it was olive and tom 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.040
 olive and tom i hope you know the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.410
 manga who talks about soccer there good i 'm going 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.410
 show a little excerpt that I like 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.270
 we 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.330
 a real I really like the lyrics I 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.740
 know them by heart but if I you 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.000
 say that midnight Monday for represents 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.890
 better boxing than olive and tom 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.090
 represents football does not mean that 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.920
 I prefer to attract us we must not 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.680
 olive and tom is still a manga 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.830
 who pushed even football plan to 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.150
 to become a footballer I know you it's 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.290
 things in life 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.330
 inexplicable 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.810
 but in my eyes to jimmy we had 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.360
 more to feel the pressure of boxing 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.850
 what at the locker room the fight of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.290
 the training of the mind of the pressure 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.030
 of all these things 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.800
 so before talking about the bigger ones 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.930
 of state it would still be necessary to speak of 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.450
 the base our main character 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.370
 is called makoun chipeau orphan of his 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.230
 father he finds himself alone with his 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.709
 mother worked in a fishing boat 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.380
 apart from that he could a schoolboy 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.850
 quite anxious and weak of mind that's 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.500
 a child who like many children 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.519
 unfortunately is not expected at the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.540
 going out of school to do this thing 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.760
 which happens today unfortunately 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.410
 and do not be ashamed to say it if you 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.700
 get mugged because it can not 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.230
 say you are weak it means 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.799
 that you have the fear of waking up 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.660
 your power 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.579
 but the question that comes back to the top of 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.400
 hypo as of every child I imagine 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.079
 what does it mean to be strong of 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.420
 not be attacked to be feared by 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:12.500
 the majority of people be respected 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.930
 for his strength roughly like me that bret 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.070
 while hypo was coming out of low school 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.320
 as usual it is true that we 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.790
 know he knows how to worry is good there 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.450
 he fell to the ground the guy 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:27.530
 except that at that moment a guy is not 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.880
 like that this person did not see him 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.420
 being attacked by his 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.739
 attackers 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.450
 what did this person come 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.250
 do you go tell me eh ben he is 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.560
 helped our friend skin but 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.370
 even better than that he has them all 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.489
 not his skis the person who came to 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.310
 relief of hypo is called nipples ta 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.079
 balaclava ah yes it's japanese it's for 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.670
 the army were waiting even better than that 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.000
 it's people 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.830
 and professional boxer at nothing 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.230
 hypo who was in a dirty state so 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.270
 been transported to the gym there 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.680
 where the driven takamura thing he got 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.989
 realized when he woke up 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.630
 you imagine a little since if he sleeps he 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.480
 will he can not know where he is unless 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.860
 you are sleepwalk ammann ambÃ¼hl also at 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.380
 wake up so he took notice of 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.630
 some members of the coach and he was 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.030
 asked why not try 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.070
 maybe that's a sign of the fate of 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.660
 ending up in a boxing gym with 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.060
 boxers since I am 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.260
 weak and I want to become strong no 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.320
 but when I'm weak I do not speak 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.060
 I beat you I save you 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.580
 details but know that you have to 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.590
 boxing his passion and his goal is 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.630
 to become the strongest and why not 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.550
 one day try to become the strongest 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.990
 from Japan but do not forget that we are 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.550
 never alone to want to be the best 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.930
 that the world is filled with young people 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.820
 talents who wish to become the 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.979
 best boxers in the world with everything 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.460
 full of different styles of strength and 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.900
 in life 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.580
 what I really like in this manga 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.380
 it's to see the evolution that there can 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.850
 having a child who was victimizing to 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.950
 the time but with a lot of endurance 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.270
 and extreme will we can come to 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.680
 do things we did not think 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.610
 can do and as usual 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.039
 now you are regulars 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.270
 do not hesitate to drop a little like a 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:02.780
 little comment it's always 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.880
 pleasure 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.880
 and by the way if you're still not 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.550
 subscribers so if you wish you me 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.300
 measure to hypo before him will have to pass 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.300
 in the ring
