00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
oh hello and welcome to episode six so

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.799 
oh hello and welcome to episode six so
let's<00:00:07.080> get<00:00:07.350> right<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.890> it

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
let's get right to it

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.209 
let's get right to it
now<00:00:10.259> I<00:00:10.290> wanted<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.130> add<00:00:11.309> something

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.390 

with<00:00:15.580> some<00:00:15.879> inside<00:00:16.510> discussion<00:00:17.410> I<00:00:17.680> figured

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
with some inside discussion I figured

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.939 
with some inside discussion I figured
out<00:00:18.520> that<00:00:18.849> there's<00:00:19.210> a<00:00:19.300> glitch<00:00:19.750> apparently<00:00:20.680> in

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
out that there's a glitch apparently in

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.100 
out that there's a glitch apparently in
this<00:00:21.220> version<00:00:21.520> of<00:00:21.910> space<00:00:22.869> engine<00:00:23.849> where<00:00:24.849> um

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
this version of space engine where um

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.260 
this version of space engine where um
only<00:00:26.849> systems<00:00:27.849> or<00:00:28.239> binary<00:00:28.599> systems<00:00:29.410> of<00:00:29.680> stars

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
only systems or binary systems of stars

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.100 
only systems or binary systems of stars
have<00:00:31.290> planets<00:00:32.290> with<00:00:32.469> life<00:00:33.300> which<00:00:34.300> is<00:00:34.719> why

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
have planets with life which is why

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.209 
have planets with life which is why
every<00:00:35.829> single<00:00:37.079> planet<00:00:38.079> would<00:00:38.379> life<00:00:38.559> we<00:00:38.860> found

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
every single planet would life we found

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.900 
every single planet would life we found
is<00:00:39.489> in<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.730> binary<00:00:39.940> system<00:00:40.390> so<00:00:40.840> far<00:00:41.110> so<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.730> um

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
is in a binary system so far so but um

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.729 
is in a binary system so far so but um
the<00:00:43.390> lead<00:00:43.840> developer<00:00:45.059> has<00:00:46.059> said<00:00:46.539> that<00:00:46.899> he's

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
the lead developer has said that he's

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.810 
the lead developer has said that he's
going<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:49.170> release<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.350> patch<00:00:50.769> here<00:00:51.190> soon<00:00:51.460> but

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
going to release a patch here soon but

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.669 
going to release a patch here soon but
it's<00:00:51.969> gonna<00:00:52.120> change<00:00:52.300> it's<00:00:52.960> gonna<00:00:53.079> fix<00:00:53.440> that

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
it's gonna change it's gonna fix that

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.689 
it's gonna change it's gonna fix that
but<00:00:54.390> we're<00:00:55.390> gonna<00:00:55.449> lose<00:00:55.870> all<00:00:56.319> the<00:00:56.699> planets

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
but we're gonna lose all the planets

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.229 
but we're gonna lose all the planets
with<00:00:57.879> life<00:00:58.059> that<00:00:58.420> we<00:00:58.510> found<00:00:58.809> so<00:00:59.170> far<00:00:59.469> so<00:01:00.239> it's

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
with life that we found so far so it's

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.450 
with life that we found so far so it's
gonna<00:01:01.420> suck<00:01:01.749> a<00:01:01.809> little<00:01:02.170> bit<00:01:02.319> but<00:01:02.859> um<00:01:03.069> I<00:01:05.460> think

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
gonna suck a little bit but um I think

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.890 
gonna suck a little bit but um I think
I'm<00:01:06.670> just<00:01:06.790> gonna<00:01:06.970> go<00:01:07.180> ahead<00:01:07.300> and<00:01:07.479> keep<00:01:07.840> going

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
I'm just gonna go ahead and keep going

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.190 
I'm just gonna go ahead and keep going
and<00:01:08.880> hopefully<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.330> patch<00:01:10.600> will<00:01:10.840> come<00:01:11.050> out

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
and hopefully that patch will come out

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.780 
and hopefully that patch will come out
soon<00:01:11.500> at<00:01:12.130> least<00:01:12.190> before<00:01:12.550> the<00:01:12.940> season<00:01:13.330> ends

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
soon at least before the season ends

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.940 
soon at least before the season ends
but<00:01:15.360> yeah<00:01:15.540> I'll<00:01:15.900> let<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.200> guys<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
but yeah I'll let you guys know when it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.000 
but yeah I'll let you guys know when it
comes<00:01:17.160> out<00:01:17.370> so<00:01:17.610> um<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:19.290> seems<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.800> good

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
comes out so um this seems like a good

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.810 
comes out so um this seems like a good
spot<00:01:20.160> let's<00:01:20.730> start<00:01:21.140> start<00:01:22.140> clicking<00:01:22.560> around

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.930 

oh<00:01:25.880> here<00:01:26.540> we<00:01:26.630> go<00:01:26.810> three<00:01:27.500> planets<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.460> life

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.020 

three<00:01:31.940> planets

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
three planets

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.820 
three planets
now<00:01:34.270> I'm<00:01:34.540> gonna<00:01:34.750> probably<00:01:35.050> just<00:01:35.440> choose

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
now I'm gonna probably just choose

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.980 
now I'm gonna probably just choose
whichever<00:01:36.430> one<00:01:36.610> looks<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.270> coolest<00:01:37.450> because

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
whichever one looks the coolest because

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.350 
whichever one looks the coolest because
I'm<00:01:38.500> not<00:01:38.680> going<00:01:38.890> to<00:01:38.950> be<00:01:39.250> able<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.580> have<00:01:39.730> time<00:01:39.970> to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
I'm not going to be able to have time to

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.030 
I'm not going to be able to have time to
do<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:41.650> three<00:01:42.930> okay<00:01:43.930> so<00:01:43.990> here<00:01:44.320> we<00:01:44.350> have<00:01:44.560> two<00:01:44.860> of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
do all three okay so here we have two of

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.620 
do all three okay so here we have two of
them<00:01:45.250> two<00:01:46.240> moons<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.190> warm<00:01:48.640> gas<00:01:48.970> giant

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
them two moons for this warm gas giant

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.520 
them two moons for this warm gas giant
and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.610> last<00:01:51.850> one's<00:01:52.210> over<00:01:52.630> here<00:01:52.990> by<00:01:53.470> the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and the last one's over here by the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.460 
and the last one's over here by the
orange<00:01:53.950> dwarf<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.780> let's<00:01:55.960> take<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.200> quick

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
orange dwarf so let's take a quick

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.899 
orange dwarf so let's take a quick
glance<00:01:56.920> at<00:01:57.340> them

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.980 

this<00:02:02.479> one<00:02:02.659> looks<00:02:02.899> nice<00:02:03.170> but

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
this one looks nice but

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:18.559 
this one looks nice but
take<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.590> look<00:02:05.770> at<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.950> others

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.800 

we<00:02:19.080> might<00:02:19.319> do<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.769> one<00:02:20.069> unless<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.420> next

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
we might do that one unless this next

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.140 
we might do that one unless this next
one<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.140> pretty<00:02:22.680> awesome

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.220 

actually<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.180> think<00:02:30.330> we'll<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.930> one

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.940 

pretty<00:02:34.230> cool

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
pretty cool

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:46.059 
pretty cool
come<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.220> in

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.220 

here<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:47.220> have<00:02:47.340> some<00:02:47.870> photo<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.260> structures

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
here we have some photo like structures

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.750 
here we have some photo like structures
reminds<00:02:52.230> me<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.680> last<00:02:52.890> planet

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.699 

we<00:02:56.239> have<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.540> icy<00:02:56.989> tops<00:02:57.319> of<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> mountains

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
we have the icy tops of the mountains

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.720 
we have the icy tops of the mountains
here

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
here

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.300 
here
although<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.060> don't<00:03:00.330> know<00:03:00.480> how<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:01.170> see<00:03:01.920> they<00:03:02.069> are

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
although I don't know how I see they are

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.449 
although I don't know how I see they are
this<00:03:03.090> planet<00:03:03.690> has<00:03:03.959> a<00:03:03.989> scorching<00:03:04.860> temperature

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
this planet has a scorching temperature

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.180 
this planet has a scorching temperature
about<00:03:06.890> 328<00:03:07.890> Kelvin<00:03:09.470> which

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
about 328 Kelvin which

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.050 
about 328 Kelvin which
that's<00:03:13.740> 130<00:03:14.740> Fahrenheit<00:03:15.610> just<00:03:15.910> about

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.080 

now<00:03:19.569> as<00:03:19.900> we<00:03:20.110> saw<00:03:20.410> earlier<00:03:20.440> this<00:03:21.430> planet<00:03:21.910> is

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
now as we saw earlier this planet is

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.230 
now as we saw earlier this planet is
orbiting<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.840> giant<00:03:23.500> gas<00:03:24.160> giant<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:26.880> warm<00:03:27.880> gas

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
orbiting a giant gas giant a warm gas

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.870 
orbiting a giant gas giant a warm gas

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
giant that is

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.620 
giant that is
and<00:03:31.920> it's<00:03:32.920> quite<00:03:33.250> large<00:03:33.520> in<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:33.940> sky<00:03:34.210> this

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
and it's quite large in the sky this

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.670 
and it's quite large in the sky this
planet<00:03:35.170> or<00:03:35.590> this<00:03:36.010> moon<00:03:36.400> rather<00:03:36.790> would<00:03:37.210> life

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
planet or this moon rather would life

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.930 
planet or this moon rather would life
it's<00:03:38.680> large<00:03:38.950> enough<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.280> be<00:03:39.460> planet<00:03:39.970> but<00:03:40.650> it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
it's large enough to be planet but it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.990 
it's large enough to be planet but it
it's<00:03:42.940> fairly<00:03:43.210> close<00:03:43.690> in<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.110> close<00:03:44.350> orbit

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
it's fairly close in a close orbit

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.660 
it's fairly close in a close orbit
finishes<00:03:46.000> in<00:03:46.090> orbit<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:47.430> 1.3<00:03:48.430> days<00:03:50.550> we<00:03:51.550> have

finishes in orbit in 1.3 days we have

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.430 
finishes in orbit in 1.3 days we have
some<00:03:51.970> even<00:03:52.900> stranger<00:03:53.650> features<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:56.380> does

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
some even stranger features it does

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.290 
some even stranger features it does
still<00:03:57.370> have<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.850> plateau<00:03:58.300> look

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.970 

a lot<00:04:01.480> lower<00:04:02.470> not<00:04:03.340> as<00:04:03.580> tall<00:04:04.050> and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
a lot lower not as tall and

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.600 
a lot lower not as tall and
it's<00:04:07.550> just<00:04:07.790> a<00:04:07.879> great<00:04:08.120> view<00:04:08.420> there<00:04:09.459> with<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
it's just a great view there with the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.690 
it's just a great view there with the
gas<00:04:10.790> giant<00:04:11.330> peeking<00:04:11.900> up<00:04:12.080> above<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.250> horizon

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.040 

now<00:04:19.700> on<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.959> side<00:04:21.230> of<00:04:21.290> the<00:04:21.530> planet<00:04:23.050> but

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
now on this side of the planet but

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.450 
now on this side of the planet but
there's<00:04:24.290> not<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:24.650> much<00:04:25.220> water<00:04:25.750> but<00:04:26.750> only

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
there's not as much water but only

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.129 
there's not as much water but only
scattered<00:04:28.460> lakes<00:04:29.740> across<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:31.220> surface<00:04:32.139> where

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
scattered lakes across the surface where

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.869 
scattered lakes across the surface where
you<00:04:33.260> can<00:04:33.440> see<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:34.720> rivers

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:44.610 

very<00:04:39.479> nice<00:04:39.749> view

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.690 

now<00:04:45.310> we're<00:04:45.790> flying<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.390> about<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.660> hive<00:04:46.990> of<00:04:47.700> 15

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
now we're flying it about a hive of 15

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.750 
now we're flying it about a hive of 15
kilometers<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:52.500> because<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.760> the

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
kilometers and because of the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.210 
kilometers and because of the
atmospheric<00:04:55.540> pressure<00:04:55.630> of<00:04:56.260> this<00:04:56.410> planet<00:04:56.980> you

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
atmospheric pressure of this planet you

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.850 
atmospheric pressure of this planet you
could<00:04:58.060> likely<00:04:58.300> be<00:04:58.570> in<00:04:58.780> an<00:04:58.900> orbit<00:04:59.350> at<00:04:59.710> this

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
could likely be in an orbit at this

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.570 
could likely be in an orbit at this
height

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.670 

this<00:05:04.120> could<00:05:04.389> be<00:05:04.569> about<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:04.870> right<00:05:05.259> speed<00:05:05.650> for

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
this could be about the right speed for

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.129 
this could be about the right speed for
the<00:05:06.129> orbit<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:07.000> this<00:05:07.150> is<00:05:07.300> what<00:05:07.479> a<00:05:07.509> satellite

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
the orbit so this is what a satellite

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.960 
the orbit so this is what a satellite
might<00:05:08.409> be<00:05:08.620> seeing

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:19.610 

now<00:05:12.720> rum<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.830> ninth<00:05:14.130> side

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.000 

to<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.400> left<00:05:21.830> with<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:34.210 
joven
in<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.280> middle<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.730> screen

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.860 

let's<00:05:34.640> go<00:05:34.970> ahead

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
let's go ahead

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.679 
let's go ahead
speed<00:05:36.590> of<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.919> cycle<00:05:37.460> here

00:05:43.679 --> 00:05:43.689 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:50.340 

ECS

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:58.250 

there's<00:05:50.470> another<00:05:50.710> star

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:11.300 

there's<00:05:58.470> an<00:05:58.710> drama

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.790 

hopefully<00:06:12.310> we'll<00:06:12.550> get<00:06:12.670> that<00:06:12.880> new<00:06:13.060> patch<00:06:13.330> out

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
hopefully we'll get that new patch out

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.450 
hopefully we'll get that new patch out
so<00:06:14.800> we<00:06:14.920> can<00:06:15.070> have<00:06:15.250> some<00:06:15.490> single<00:06:16.030> systems<00:06:16.540> and

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
so we can have some single systems and

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.650 
so we can have some single systems and
hopefully<00:06:18.460> get<00:06:18.670> some<00:06:18.700> more<00:06:19.030> interesting

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
hopefully get some more interesting

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.370 
hopefully get some more interesting
planets<00:06:20.170> with<00:06:20.320> life<00:06:20.500> and<00:06:21.810> that's<00:06:22.810> all<00:06:23.050> I<00:06:23.080> hope

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
planets with life and that's all I hope

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.680 
planets with life and that's all I hope
you<00:06:23.530> guys<00:06:23.680> enjoy<00:06:24.100> this<00:06:24.310> planet<00:06:25.410> take<00:06:26.410> care
