now<00:00:51.020> this<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> power<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
now this is the power for the the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.650 
now this is the power for the the
charger<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:55.980> course<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:57.750> manuals<00:00:58.170> and

also<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.960> ordered<00:01:01.649> an<00:01:02.160> extra<00:01:02.550> pair<00:01:02.820> of

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
also I ordered an extra pair of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.230 
also I ordered an extra pair of
propellers<00:01:04.400> now<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
propellers now here you can see the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.830 
propellers now here you can see the
gimbal<00:01:06.570> Center<00:01:07.550> this<00:01:08.550> is<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.880> reacts<00:01:09.540> if

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
gimbal Center this is how it reacts if

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.219 
gimbal Center this is how it reacts if
the<00:01:10.290> correct<00:01:10.920> weight<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.210> camera<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.810> not

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the correct weight of the camera is not

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.630 
the correct weight of the camera is not
installed<00:01:13.970> it<00:01:14.970> behaves<00:01:15.390> elastically<00:01:16.460> this<00:01:17.460> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
installed it behaves elastically this is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.969 
installed it behaves elastically this is
normal<00:01:18.090> but<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.140> often<00:01:20.149> creates

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
normal but it often creates

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.650 
normal but it often creates
misunderstanding<00:01:23.000> here<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.270> see<00:01:24.420> the

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
misunderstanding here you can see the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.660 
misunderstanding here you can see the
get<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.289> G<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.190> controller<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:28.670> it's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
get the G to the controller and it's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.609 
get the G to the controller and it's
it's<00:01:30.119> very<00:01:30.509> important<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:33.630> set<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.470> off

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
it's very important to set it off

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.080 
it's very important to set it off
correctly<00:01:35.240> now<00:01:36.500> if<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:38.159> look<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.700> picture

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
correctly now if we look at the picture

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.230 
correctly now if we look at the picture
you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.590> two<00:01:40.770> knobs<00:01:41.190> in<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you can see that the two knobs in the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
you can see that the two knobs in the
beginning<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.840> best<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.170> adjust<00:01:43.619> them<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
beginning it's best to adjust them to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.440 
beginning it's best to adjust them to
roughly<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.819> middle<00:01:44.940> and<00:01:46.159> also<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:48.149> plug-in

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
roughly the middle and also you plug-in

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.590 
roughly the middle and also you plug-in
the<00:01:48.840> connectors

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the connectors

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.679 
the connectors
to<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.500> left<00:01:51.740> the<00:01:52.460> pins<00:01:52.700> go<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.150> left<00:01:53.360> and

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
to the left the pins go to the left and

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.050 
to the left the pins go to the left and
the<00:01:53.810> s<00:01:54.009> W<00:01:55.009> goes<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.610> one<00:01:56.650> so<00:01:57.650> let's<00:01:58.280> set<00:01:58.610> up<00:01:58.640> the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
the s W goes to one so let's set up the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
the s W goes to one so let's set up the
the<00:01:59.420> devil<00:01:59.810> time<00:02:00.280> now<00:02:01.360> you<00:02:02.360> have<00:02:02.509> two<00:02:02.690> buttons

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
the devil time now you have two buttons

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.770 
the devil time now you have two buttons
there<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:03.530> have<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.950> ext<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.180> you<00:02:05.360> have<00:02:05.570> the
