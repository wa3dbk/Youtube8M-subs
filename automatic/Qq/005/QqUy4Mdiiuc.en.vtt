00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
sound that it makes because of that so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
sound that it makes because of that so
it's<00:01:02.399> almost<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.090> semi<00:01:03.539> hollow<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
it's almost like a semi hollow in that
regard<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> chambering<00:01:05.460> style<00:01:05.850> gives<00:01:06.150> it

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
regard but the chambering style gives it

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
regard but the chambering style gives it
a<00:01:06.360> lot<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.630> sustain<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> biggest<00:01:08.310> thing<00:01:08.460> that
