quick cooking our ladies right that's
right<00:02:28.340> without<00:02:28.549> you<00:02:28.670> when<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.030> look<00:02:29.180> at<00:02:29.299> this

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
right without you when you look at this

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.270 
right without you when you look at this
you<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:30.049> can't<00:02:30.260> help<00:02:30.470> thinking<00:02:30.739> of<00:02:30.830> lunch<00:02:31.040> you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
you you can't help thinking of lunch you

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.170 
you you can't help thinking of lunch you
know<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:32.239> it<00:02:32.450> healthy<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:34.519> only<00:02:34.670> value<00:02:34.880> media

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
know is it healthy the only value media

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.220 
know is it healthy the only value media
what<00:02:35.600> the<00:02:35.720> animal<00:02:36.019> is<00:02:36.170> as<00:02:36.380> healthy<00:02:36.769> as<00:02:37.190> another

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
what the animal is as healthy as another

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.900 
what the animal is as healthy as another
intensive<00:02:39.230> producing<00:02:39.860> animal<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.580> this<00:02:40.760> is

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
intensive producing animal so this is

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.449 
intensive producing animal so this is
about<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.390> most<00:02:41.540> technological<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:43.040> we<00:02:43.220> can

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
about the most technological that we can

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.490 
about the most technological that we can
get<00:02:43.640> not<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.180> most<00:02:44.330> technological<00:02:44.989> in<00:02:45.290> terms

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
get not the most technological in terms

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.050 
get not the most technological in terms
of<00:02:45.620> technology<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.220> talk<00:02:46.489> about<00:02:46.640> selection

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
of technology we talk about selection

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.039 
of technology we talk about selection
natural<00:02:47.600> selection<00:02:48.080> having<00:02:48.530> achieved<00:02:48.650> that

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.990 

so<00:02:56.049> what<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.469> the<00:02:56.709> science<00:02:57.159> behind<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
so what is the science behind the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.170 
so what is the science behind the
Belgian<00:02:58.420> blues

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.479 

there<00:03:03.049> is<00:03:03.170> a<00:03:03.200> gene<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.739> regulates<00:03:04.189> the

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
there is a gene that regulates the

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.110 
there is a gene that regulates the

growth of muscles in cattle these cows

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.970 
growth of muscles in cattle these cows
have<00:03:08.359> been<00:03:08.540> selectively<00:03:09.049> bred<00:03:09.140> from<00:03:09.500> animals

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
have been selectively bred from animals

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.130 
have been selectively bred from animals
that<00:03:10.159> contain<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:10.849> copy<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.329> this<00:03:11.540> gene<00:03:11.599> which

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
that contain a copy of this gene which

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.030 
that contain a copy of this gene which
doesn't<00:03:12.560> work<00:03:12.799> as<00:03:13.239> a<00:03:14.239> result<00:03:14.590> their<00:03:15.590> muscles

in the artificial vagina and from there

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.729 
in the artificial vagina and from there
we<00:03:52.580> process<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.180> semen<00:03:53.510> in<00:03:53.930> order<00:03:54.379> to<00:03:54.500> be<00:03:54.620> able

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
we process the semen in order to be able

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.979 
we process the semen in order to be able
to<00:03:54.980> process<00:03:55.239> artificial<00:03:56.239> insemination<00:03:56.840> on

the<00:03:57.170> code<00:04:00.250> so<00:04:01.250> precise<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:02.030> the<00:04:02.180> technology

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
the code so precise is the technology

the code so precise is the technology
involved<00:04:02.989> they<00:04:03.440> can<00:04:03.470> analyze<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.280> semen

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
involved they can analyze the semen

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.850
