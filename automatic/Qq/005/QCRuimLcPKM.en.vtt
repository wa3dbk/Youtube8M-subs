be<00:01:49.500> perfect<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.460> still<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.869> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
be perfect and we still have to see it

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
be perfect and we still have to see it
for<00:01:52.350> ourselves<00:01:52.579> we<00:01:53.579> still<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:55.219> watch<00:01:56.219> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.650 
Lin and they did their homework with
people<00:02:57.340> who<00:02:57.519> would<00:02:57.670> probably<00:02:58.090> give<00:02:58.269> a<00:02:58.300> fair

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
people who would probably give a fair

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.809 
people who would probably give a fair
evaluation<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:59.620> Jeremy<00:03:00.010> Lin<00:03:00.160> rather<00:03:00.489> than

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
evaluation of Jeremy Lin rather than

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.540 
evaluation of Jeremy Lin rather than
perhaps<00:03:01.600> some<00:03:02.110> other<00:03:02.230> sources<00:03:02.800> who<00:03:03.130> might<00:03:03.370> be

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
perhaps some other sources who might be

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.610 
perhaps some other sources who might be
a<00:03:03.580> little<00:03:03.819> less<00:03:04.150> flattering<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:05.019> Jeremy's

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
a little less flattering of Jeremy's

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.780 
a little less flattering of Jeremy's
ability<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.459> that's<00:03:06.670> good<00:03:06.970> to<00:03:07.150> see<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.260> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
ability so that's good to see this is a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.559 
ability so that's good to see this is a
promising<00:03:09.959> start<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.250> relationship<00:03:13.000> okay

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569

now there's two other quick things I
wanted<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.819> hit<00:03:15.970> on<00:03:16.560> number<00:03:17.560> one<00:03:17.769> is<00:03:18.010> Jeremy's

should say for Jeremy's fans I mean

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.069 
should say for Jeremy's fans I mean
Jeremy<00:03:35.230> obviously<00:03:35.739> already<00:03:35.890> knew<00:03:36.280> this

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
Jeremy obviously already knew this

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.100 
Jeremy obviously already knew this
Jeremy's<00:03:38.079> contract<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.489> two-year<00:03:40.180> deal<00:03:40.420> but

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
Jeremy's contract is a two-year deal but

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.680 
Jeremy's contract is a two-year deal but
it's<00:03:41.260> really<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.859> one-year<00:03:42.489> deal<00:03:42.519> because<00:03:43.209> it's

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
it's really a one-year deal because it's

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.400 
it's really a one-year deal because it's
it's<00:03:43.959> one<00:03:44.769> year<00:03:45.359> that<00:03:46.359> he's<00:03:46.600> there<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.109> then

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
it's one year that he's there and then

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's one year that he's there and then
the<00:03:47.590> second<00:03:48.010> year<00:03:48.190> as<00:03:48.310> a<00:03:48.340> player<00:03:48.670> option

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
the second year as a player option

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.810 
the second year as a player option
meaning<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.780> it's<00:03:50.079> up<00:03:50.350> to<00:03:50.650> Jeremy<00:03:51.340> whether

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
meaning that it's up to Jeremy whether

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.470 
meaning that it's up to Jeremy whether
or<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.480> he<00:03:53.200> wants<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.650> stay<00:03:54.160> there<00:03:54.579> so

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
or not he wants to stay there so

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.910 
or not he wants to stay there so
basically<00:03:55.959> he<00:03:56.079> can<00:03:56.260> become<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> free<00:03:56.890> agent

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
basically he can become a free agent

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.550 
basically he can become a free agent
again<00:03:57.280> next<00:03:57.670> year<00:03:57.850> the<00:03:58.750> reason<00:03:59.200> why<00:03:59.320> that's

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
again next year the reason why that's

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.099 
again next year the reason why that's
key<00:03:59.859> is<00:04:00.040> if<00:04:00.670> he<00:04:00.850> wants<00:04:01.150> to<00:04:01.180> go<00:04:01.390> try<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.690> start

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
key is if he wants to go try to start

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.160 
key is if he wants to go try to start
somewhere<00:04:02.440> he<00:04:03.100> can<00:04:03.310> do<00:04:03.489> that<00:04:03.700> and<00:04:03.970> he<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.959> make

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
somewhere he can do that and he can make

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.590 
somewhere he can do that and he can make
a<00:04:05.200> whole<00:04:05.799> bunch<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.459> money<00:04:06.730> next<00:04:07.030> year<00:04:07.209> because

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
a whole bunch of money next year because

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.039 
a whole bunch of money next year because
the<00:04:07.959> salary<00:04:08.440> cap<00:04:08.560> is<00:04:09.250> going<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.700> jump<00:04:10.000> up<00:04:10.239> 20

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
the salary cap is going to jump up 20

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.180 
the salary cap is going to jump up 20
million<00:04:11.410> dollars<00:04:11.769> basically<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.359> this<00:04:14.190> team

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
million dollars basically so this team

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.650 
million dollars basically so this team
Lin<00:04:15.670> really<00:04:16.570> got<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.019> job<00:04:17.320> done<00:04:17.380> here<00:04:18.070> and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
Lin really got the job done here and

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.960 
Lin really got the job done here and
credit<00:04:19.660> to<00:04:19.810> Charlotte<00:04:20.260> they<00:04:20.739> made<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.580> deal

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
credit to Charlotte they made that deal

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.839 
credit to Charlotte they made that deal
they<00:04:22.810> allow<00:04:23.169> Jeremy<00:04:23.560> Lyn<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:24.370> do<00:04:24.610> that

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
they allow Jeremy Lyn to do that

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.560 
they allow Jeremy Lyn to do that
contract<00:04:25.570> so<00:04:25.840> that's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
contract so that's

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.330 
contract so that's
very<00:04:26.720> good<00:04:27.140> news<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.710> lot<00:04:27.890> of<00:04:27.920> people<00:04:28.040> were

could shoot from the outside and what

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.040 
could shoot from the outside and what
that<00:05:56.390> means<00:05:56.840> is<00:05:57.170> that<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.740> spacing<00:05:58.700> is<00:05:59.120> going

that means is that the spacing is going

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.100 
that means is that the spacing is going
to<00:06:00.140> be<00:06:00.320> very<00:06:00.650> good<00:06:01.070> for<00:06:01.340> Jeremy<00:06:01.760> Lin<00:06:02.110> because

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.110 
to be very good for Jeremy Lin because

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.260 
to be very good for Jeremy Lin because
that<00:06:03.770> the<00:06:04.160> defenders<00:06:04.730> have<00:06:04.910> to<00:06:05.030> come<00:06:05.240> out

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
that the defenders have to come out

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.990 
that the defenders have to come out
further<00:06:05.750> on<00:06:06.140> those<00:06:06.380> two<00:06:06.620> big<00:06:06.950> men<00:06:07.160> and<00:06:07.430> that

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
further on those two big men and that

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.580 
further on those two big men and that
means<00:06:08.210> Jeremy<00:06:08.720> Lin's<00:06:08.930> going<00:06:09.110> to<00:06:09.170> have<00:06:09.320> a<00:06:09.350> lot
