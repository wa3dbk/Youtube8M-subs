we've had that stick been there for a
long<00:00:55.500> long<00:00:55.649> time<00:00:55.710> consumers<00:00:56.309> are<00:00:56.460> very<00:00:56.670> very

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
long long time consumers are very very

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.110 
long long time consumers are very very
comfortable<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.660> familiar<00:00:58.020> with<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
comfortable and familiar with it

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.430 
comfortable and familiar with it
probably<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.510> newest<00:01:00.870> addition<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
probably the newest addition to the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.229 
probably the newest addition to the
family<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.980> everybody's<00:01:02.370> starting<00:01:03.120> to

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
family that everybody's starting to

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.460 
family that everybody's starting to
really<00:01:03.449> find<00:01:03.960> themselves<00:01:04.260> getting

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
really find themselves getting

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.080 
really find themselves getting
comfortable<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.189> gonna<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.519> Nexus<00:01:05.909> so

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
comfortable with is gonna be Nexus so

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.840 
comfortable with is gonna be Nexus so
next<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.110> takes<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:08.250> low<00:01:08.580> kick

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
next this kind of takes that low kick

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.700 
next this kind of takes that low kick
technology<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.900> vapor<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:10.409> antenna

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
technology that's in vapor then antenna

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
technology that's in vapor then antenna
and<00:01:11.010> shot<00:01:11.159> technology<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.790> elevates<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and shot technology and elevates it a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
and shot technology and elevates it a
bit<00:01:12.540> more<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.470> does<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
bit more and what it really does is it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
bit more and what it really does is it
improves<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> power<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.119> slap<00:01:15.390> shots

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
improves on the power of your slap shots

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
improves on the power of your slap shots
so<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.200> still<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> nice<00:01:16.890> quick<00:01:17.189> release

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
so you still get a nice quick release

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.740 
so you still get a nice quick release
because<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.000> softer<00:01:18.420> than<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> lower

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
because it is softer than the lower

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.660 
because it is softer than the lower
portion<00:01:19.229> but<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:20.040> softer<00:01:20.460> through

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
portion but it's gonna be softer through

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.520 
portion but it's gonna be softer through
the<00:01:20.759> upper<00:01:20.970> handle<00:01:21.299> than<00:01:21.450> vapor<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.049> what

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the upper handle than vapor is so what

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.870 
the upper handle than vapor is so what
its<00:01:22.650> gonna<00:01:22.770> really<00:01:22.950> allow<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> pull

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
its gonna really allow you to do is pull

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
its gonna really allow you to do is pull
that<00:01:24.000> top<00:01:24.270> hand<00:01:24.540> back<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> lot<00:01:25.290> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that top hand back and get a lot of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
that top hand back and get a lot of
energy<00:01:25.530> generated<00:01:26.280> through<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.670> square

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
energy generated through that square

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
energy generated through that square
shaft<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.920> get<00:01:29.009> maximum<00:01:29.369> output

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
shaft so that you can get maximum output

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.370 
shaft so that you can get maximum output
on<00:01:30.000> those<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.420> those<00:01:30.659> slap<00:01:30.900> shots<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> one

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
on those on those slap shots and one

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
you're gonna load all that energy

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.859 
you're gonna load all that energy
through<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.729> shaft<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.210> gonna<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.479> stored
