00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.239
 hi platanito that I am more if it comes 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.400
 they know that we are here a life 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.619
 escape from the beast and as always 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.089
 we found here in the servers of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.160
 almost good olympus you will ask more 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.930
 yes because you have the beast skin if you 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.420
 has touched being a runner because in 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.949
 this video I'm going to make a beast 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.659
 infiltrated to sabotage my 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.519
 mates so let's see how much 

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.989
 this game was an island draw and 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.930
 as always I love this beast 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 mix pvp plus parkour the two things that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.050
 more I like main classic has a 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
 little bit of echo is that I've been changing 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 the room things from my room and now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 I do not know why I get there but I do not know 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.760
 if it will be heard or not but well I will 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.859
 I leave as well as information because when 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.960
 I'm talking I feel super weird or 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.879
 it's as if I were in an auditorium myself 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.610
 you only know speaking in plan because we are 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.979
 here in the talk of the plane trees 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.080
 world and I only have cri crí crí crí then 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.149
 that's how I feel, I'm going to leave this 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.880
 around here just in case we read who 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.070
 ga jumps like and is perfect 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.140
 perfect there we are going to go in this 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.520
 heading we are in the lead we will arrive 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.049
 the first ones to the treatment area 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.729
 let's hope the beast does not get caught 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.649
 because I know that if the beast 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.630
 falls to take by sac the map returns to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.090
 principle unlike all of us 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.490
 that if we fall and die we come 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.750
 here to the part of the town and we're going to 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.520
 remove the rage in the house of the 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.679
 left and then go back to the beginning 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.259
 from this church although there are times that 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.939
 it does not work do not ask me why but 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.009
 well let's pray so that's not 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.409
 happen now we have this for here it's worth 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.899
 let it be and no no no no we are worth 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.250
 perfect perfect perfect and there that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.360
 let's go where you can find the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.159
 time we would go to the beginning 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.159
 we should go at the end come to me the game 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.310
 At first come to the beginning look at them 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.990
 does not work does not work there this arch is 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.700
 Exactly the same as nothing you see 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.039
 the go to the top button does not work 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.840
 I do not know why but the other day also 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.399
 with the average playing here does not work 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.970
 neither the button go to the beginning like this 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.860
 what to see 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.530
 let's try to visualize the beast 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.750
 beast lady where can you be 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.310
 okay come a Mr. runner Mr. friend 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.900
 come here in the eastern part of the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.660
 fences because if we have we are going to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.220
 throw us and look would even get 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.230
 to the part is from here below yours with 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.240
 the waterfall and ask the beast 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.890
 very safe so come to the waterfall 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.840
 above we are going to receive we realize 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.370
 the time is pretty good but 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.630
 It seems that he is not very good at 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.550
 air parkour we are seeing the time already 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.170
 is there is worth the view the seen vale 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.970
 let's put the guns for her 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.240
 when I pass through the parkour this of the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.180
 to see the jump is worth the feasible 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.410
 beast 20 after the beast jump beast 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.850
 coin I am a see you soon sharp beast 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.980
 Okay, now we have a small 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.000
 problem wait wait if I go back 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.160
 behind 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.380
 hey worth it's worth more devastating we've 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.820
 turned back to look carefully here 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.950
 there's a way out, come on let's go 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.330
 look for her beastly lady beast with 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.430
 be careful, let's not go to 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.620
 fall has to give some form some 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.560
 from gleacher us or from cross look look 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.510
 look there is there we are at 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.650
 principle where is the shit beast 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.760
 rather behind beast one side the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.560
 mania this amount is that I get something 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.850
 so in a video the beast escapes 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.100
 always kiss things more the time 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.890
 He commits suicide I fall for making the man 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.020
 that so come also the lila beast 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.350
 lilac lila beast 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.210
 and nanin nothing is worth not the beast has done 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.480
 the leap of faith to the voucher with care to see 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.160
 let's go with this here come to this bargain 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.390
 that we respect him is that we are 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.450
 is the beast that the beast is going 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.550
 dale dale dale dale julian dale julian and 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.500
 I have already killed the corner thanks to 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.210
 sir is both of you and me so good 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.340
 the first time he has sabotaged the pain 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.340
 now ending there is first beast 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.110
 sabotaged today because nothing platanitos is what 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.240
 who works here in the second game and 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.920
 this time we have come to the map of 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.350
 level you already know that the preferred map 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.600
 to bring the beast but I do not want 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.550
 touch left corrected 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.720
 sabotage the game the beast so 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.460
 let's try to kill our 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.590
 partner you already know that I activate the mode 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.510
 beast here you are capable of the version 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.950
 only for all platanitos one only for 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.900
 teach fight and greet to teach 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.190
 spectrum and all the platanitos that 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.570
 will appreciate throughout the video we 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.100
 are watching the chat I have to 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.780
 concentrate on playing and doing this 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.580
 parkour the best possible so 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.140
 we like the map of levels theme 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.270
 pretty well I like parkour so the 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.840
 guy this is pretty cool we were going in 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.970
 head 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.280
 what cole is caring for the beast 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.510
 just come out come it's perfect me the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.550
 I play the game I play 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.160
 his voice his voice his voice his voice by 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.890
 ladler throw and throw and throw and 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.870
 throw and dad come here throw and throw 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.940
 and there we were in the lead we are going very well 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.800
 let's hope the beast does not commit suicide 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.660
 immolate yourself in the lava because you know what 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.250
 good if once it falls into the void 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.530
 powell imprisoned but if you fall the 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.990
 lava there is no turning back and accept and 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.730
 prevents pp and you died so come by 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.500
 favor live beast to you I'll 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.420
 distribute love when I get here to 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.770
 final voucher worth we remove the cobwebs 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.540
 with the hand is there is there is 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.580
 perfect vale 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.930
 we arrived in the head let's read here that 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.970
 we have around here we have the armor 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.860
 It's worth this here but it would fit in case 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.140
 perhaps although I do not believe that the beast arrives 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.850
 in time we have to see this one 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.980
 regeneration strength and speed not 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.830
 I want more now we just put the 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:23.800
 swords regeneration strength and speed 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.470
 and at the end of the map throw and throw and 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.750
 pull and use of the cavalry in 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.000
 look for the beast come jump around here 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.190
 our beast to see we're going to look for her 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.480
 this arrives below it leads down to 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.490
 the beast is down here 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.080
 we are seeing come I think it has not 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.870
 come nobody wins parkour zone of the 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.400
 beginning there that comes 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.950
 what good in the beast that comes in the 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.140
 beast that fall that this beast comes 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.940
 It seems a little bad in parkour as well 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.730
 that to see I'm sorry but the beast has 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:55.020
 that be good and you will die you and tiki 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.480
 tiki tiki tiki tiki tiki tiki and second 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.800
 beast settled here on the map of 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.990
 event we see you now in the third 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.180
 good start platanitos we are here in 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.670
 the last game and we are in 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.930
 the gamer map and look where it has 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.580
 touched being the beasts and I have not 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.770
 bought no beast step or anything 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.360
 but the game itself has wanted 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.860
 I was the energy is split so 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.360
 let's see how we get map of 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.890
 mérimée I really like parkour vale 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.260
 we have night vision that we have 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.180
 equip here strength and speed to 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.970
 we have this slowness I do not want it 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.620
 force the speed and apart vision 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.540
 night is worth I keep another one here 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.800
 just in case it costs me and we're going to see 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.030
 that you take this game I love the 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.770

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.030
 I am the beast, we are going to try to distribute 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.310

 perfect that jump to the beginning there 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.650
 I'm seeing the first ones that are going to 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.110
 die tries to attack 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.430
