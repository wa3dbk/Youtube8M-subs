00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
for the washing machine it was a place

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.960

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
was about two by two it was about 2 feet

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.219 
was about two by two it was about 2 feet
by<00:02:03.820> 2<00:02:04.090> feet<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:07.030> was<00:02:07.180> a<00:02:07.210> drain<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:08.020> had

by 2 feet and there was a drain and had
a<00:02:08.259> plastic<00:02:08.700> flooring<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.000> so<00:02:10.869> this<00:02:10.990> area<00:02:11.470> was

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
a plastic flooring and so this area was

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.130 
a plastic flooring and so this area was
meant<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.870> put<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.080> washing<00:02:14.530> machine<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:16.180> since

meant to put a washing machine and since
there<00:02:17.260> was<00:02:17.380> no<00:02:17.410> shower<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.780> decided<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:19.959> I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
there was no shower I decided that I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.740 
there was no shower I decided that I
would<00:02:20.470> take<00:02:20.590> my<00:02:20.830> showers<00:02:21.489> in<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.880> little<00:02:22.360> two
