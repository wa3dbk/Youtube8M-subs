00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.820 

this<00:01:11.340> hair<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.880> actually<00:01:12.290> synthetic<00:01:13.290> hair<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this hair is actually synthetic hair it

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.860 
this hair is actually synthetic hair it
is<00:01:13.890> by<00:01:14.190> fashion<00:01:14.730> source<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> seven

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
is by fashion source and it is a seven

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.390 
is by fashion source and it is a seven
piece<00:01:16.050> clip<00:01:16.440> inset<00:01:17.010> so<00:01:18.380> it<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> heat<00:01:19.890> resistant

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
piece clip inset so it is heat resistant

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.130 
piece clip inset so it is heat resistant
so<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.550> can<00:01:20.910> straighten<00:01:21.300> it<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.780> think<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
so you can straighten it I think up to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.760 
so you can straighten it I think up to
400<00:01:22.710> degrees<00:01:23.010> you<00:01:23.220> could<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:23.520> heat<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.850> it

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
400 degrees you could put heat in it

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.200 
400 degrees you could put heat in it
this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.100> go-to<00:01:26.280> hair<00:01:26.670> when<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.000> hair<00:01:27.180> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this is my go-to hair when my hair is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
this is my go-to hair when my hair is
dirty<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:28.350> feel<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.860> washing<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
dirty and I don't feel like washing it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
dirty and I don't feel like washing it
because<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.760> hides<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> greasiness<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.930> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
because it hides the greasiness and it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.110 
because it hides the greasiness and it
blends<00:01:31.590> really<00:01:31.860> well<00:01:32.010> but<00:01:32.550> like<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.790> said<00:01:32.970> it's

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
blends really well but like I said it's

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.090 
blends really well but like I said it's
seven<00:01:33.450> pieces<00:01:33.660> it<00:01:34.230> comes<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.560> five<00:01:34.800> pieces

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
least you can get at least two washes

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.120 
least you can get at least two washes
out<00:02:20.940> of<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.209> would<00:02:21.390> say<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.840> it'll<00:02:22.590> hold<00:02:22.920> up

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
out of it I would say and it'll hold up

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.970 
out of it I would say and it'll hold up
this<00:02:23.310> pattern<00:02:23.760> pretty<00:02:24.540> well<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.350> what<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.680> do

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
this pattern pretty well so what you do

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.430 
this pattern pretty well so what you do
is<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.000> fill<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.450> sink<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.840> with<00:02:28.020> warm<00:02:28.260> water

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
is you fill the sink up with warm water

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.590 
is you fill the sink up with warm water
and<00:02:28.620> soap<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.430> don't<00:02:29.760> scrub<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.420> hair

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
and soap and you don't scrub the hair

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.690 
and soap and you don't scrub the hair
you<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:30.989> put<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> hair<00:02:31.560> into<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.220> sink<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
you just put the hair into the sink and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.910 
you just put the hair into the sink and
you<00:02:32.820> let<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.120> soak<00:02:33.390> for<00:02:33.989> about<00:02:34.080> 10<00:02:34.410> minutes<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
you let it soak for about 10 minutes and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.650 
you let it soak for about 10 minutes and
you<00:02:35.010> take<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.400> out<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.820> rinse<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.300> off<00:02:36.420> and

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you take it out and you rinse it off and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.270 
you take it out and you rinse it off and
then<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.900> either<00:02:37.050> hang<00:02:37.440> dry<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.770> or<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.130> can

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
then you either hang dry it or you can

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.250 
then you either hang dry it or you can
lay<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.670> flat<00:02:38.790> surface<00:02:39.360> like<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.959> towel

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
lay it on a flat surface like on a towel

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.620 
lay it on a flat surface like on a towel
and<00:02:40.470> let<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:40.620> dry<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.190> like<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> said<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.360> should

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
and let it dry and like I said it should

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.810 
and let it dry and like I said it should
hold<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.140> pattern<00:02:43.590> pretty<00:02:43.890> well<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.550> can

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
hold this pattern pretty well and I can

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.449 
hold this pattern pretty well and I can
get<00:02:45.060> about<00:02:45.480> two<00:02:45.750> washes<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.530> that<00:02:46.800> but

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
get about two washes out of that but

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.850 
get about two washes out of that but
then<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.239> end<00:02:48.450> starts<00:02:48.959> amad<00:02:49.350> up<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.739> get

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
then the end starts amad up and get

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.030 
then the end starts amad up and get
really<00:02:50.100> nappy<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> can<00:02:51.239> either<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.920> can
