00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.780

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.000

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.070

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.500

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:24.250
 Here was a shotgun ventilation 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:42.420
 display of time in munich and easy to 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 use this place to be 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.960
 So the most important thing was now 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.030
 to get top performance and then 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.539
 maybe our big dream come true too 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.940
 do 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.590
 the championship is not just football 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.510
 but also in basketball to Munich 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.100

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.269

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.250
 so far profi that he has this situation 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.019
 Of course, every game knows 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.760
 different and he was already one today 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.930
 a bit nervous but a bit 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.540
 but if you are then excited 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.489

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.150
