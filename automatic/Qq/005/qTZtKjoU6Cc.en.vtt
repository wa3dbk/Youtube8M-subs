00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that we're gonna talk about here in a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
that we're gonna talk about here in a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
second but that's one kind of wondering

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.210 
second but that's one kind of wondering
cuz<00:01:18.900> you're<00:01:19.080> adjusting<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.799> levels<00:01:20.070> near

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
cuz you're adjusting the levels near

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
cuz you're adjusting the levels near
thing<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> would<00:01:21.240> assume<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.780> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
thing to go for what I would assume is a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.929 
thing to go for what I would assume is a
bigger<00:01:22.049> level<00:01:22.290> synchro<00:01:22.740> monster<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.640> I'm

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
bigger level synchro monster so I'm

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.399 
bigger level synchro monster so I'm
hoping<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.450> maybe<00:01:24.570> he<00:01:24.840> has<00:01:24.930> some<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
hoping that maybe he has some kind of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
hoping that maybe he has some kind of
black<00:01:25.650> winged<00:01:25.830> dragon<00:01:26.280> that's<00:01:26.729> gonna<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.150> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
black winged dragon that's gonna be a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.730 
black winged dragon that's gonna be a
lot<00:01:27.360> better<00:01:27.479> than<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.750> original<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.350> maybe

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
lot better than the original and maybe

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.020 
lot better than the original and maybe
something<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.310> even<00:01:29.520> sort<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:29.939> like

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
something that's even sort of like

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.520 
something that's even sort of like
quasar<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.900> too<00:01:31.079> because<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.320> really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
quasar on that too because I really

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.539 
quasar on that too because I really
think<00:01:31.680> we're<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.860> see<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.070> black<00:01:32.310> wings

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
think we're gonna see more black wings

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.830 
think we're gonna see more black wings
in<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.759> future<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.270> like<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> said<00:01:33.600> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
in the future because like I said the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.499 
in the future because like I said the
duel<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.430> unfortunately<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.790> know<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.360> was

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
duel was unfortunately you know it was

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
duel was unfortunately you know it was
kind<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.840> stopped<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> middle<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.009> I

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
kind of stopped in the middle of it so I

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.740 
kind of stopped in the middle of it so I
think<00:01:38.520> we're<00:01:38.700> gonna<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:38.970> crow<00:01:39.180> duel<00:01:39.360> later<00:01:39.630> on

think we're gonna see crow duel later on

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.090 
think we're gonna see crow duel later on
an<00:01:39.869> arc<00:01:39.990> 5<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> we're<00:01:40.530> gonna<00:01:40.650> see<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> lot<00:01:41.070> more

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
it becomes a Tuner monster so here I

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.960 
it becomes a Tuner monster so here I
have<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> synchro<00:02:08.069> tuner<00:02:08.250> that's<00:02:08.429> why<00:02:08.550> again

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
have a synchro tuner that's why again

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.089 
have a synchro tuner that's why again
I'm<00:02:09.209> wondering<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.810> there<00:02:09.959> could<00:02:10.170> be<00:02:10.229> possible

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
I'm wondering if there could be possible

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.410 
I'm wondering if there could be possible
like<00:02:11.310> quasar<00:02:11.879> sort<00:02:12.239> of

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
like quasar sort of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.540 
like quasar sort of
that'd<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.690> amazing<00:02:13.349> if<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.680> but<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.370> only

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
that'd be amazing if so but not only

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.830 
that'd be amazing if so but not only
that<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.849> does<00:02:15.000> have<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> destruction<00:02:15.540> effect

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that it does have a destruction effect

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.540 
that it does have a destruction effect
too<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.290> however<00:02:16.470> many<00:02:16.709> blackman<00:02:17.130> monsters

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
too so however many blackman monsters

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.520 
too so however many blackman monsters
you<00:02:17.730> control<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.599> could<00:02:18.720> destroy<00:02:19.050> cards<00:02:19.410> in

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
you control you could destroy cards in

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.140 
you control you could destroy cards in
the<00:02:19.590> field<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.819> really<00:02:20.849> come<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the field so that can really come in

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.850 
the field so that can really come in
handy<00:02:21.420> black<00:02:21.599> wings<00:02:21.810> swarm<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.230> field<00:02:22.440> anyway

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
handy black wings swarm the field anyway

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.650 
handy black wings swarm the field anyway
and<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.520> set<00:02:24.090> up<00:02:24.209> everything<00:02:24.450> you

and you can just set up everything you
need<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:25.020> because<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.790> card<00:02:27.060> your

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
need to because it's just card your

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.360 
need to because it's just card your
opponent<00:02:27.420> controls<00:02:27.540> too<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.140> if<00:02:28.230> there's<00:02:28.560> some

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370

for that a bigger synchro monster so

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.009 
for that a bigger synchro monster so
yeah<00:02:41.640> all<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.030> all<00:02:42.120> these<00:02:42.330> two<00:02:42.450> cards<00:02:42.690> seem

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
yeah all in all these two cards seem

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.690 
yeah all in all these two cards seem
like<00:02:43.200> they're<00:02:43.380> pretty<00:02:43.769> good<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.069> really<00:02:44.459> like

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
like they're pretty good I really like

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.309 
like they're pretty good I really like
them<00:02:44.910> again<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.720> kind<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.930> hard<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.140> judge

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
them again it's kind of hard to judge

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.140 
them again it's kind of hard to judge
them<00:02:46.500> too<00:02:46.650> much<00:02:46.860> yet<00:02:47.220> though<00:02:47.400> because<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.819> think

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
them too much yet though because I think

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.250 
them too much yet though because I think
that<00:02:48.269> you're<00:02:48.390> hinting<00:02:48.600> at<00:02:48.780> something<00:02:48.840> much

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that you're hinting at something much

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.809 
that you're hinting at something much
bigger<00:02:49.410> in<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.100> future<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.459> don't<00:02:50.610> know<00:02:50.760> if

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
bigger in the future I don't know if

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.610 
bigger in the future I don't know if
they'll<00:02:50.940> be<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.390> pack<00:02:51.660> or<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.170> next<00:02:52.410> pack

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
they'll be this pack or in the next pack

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.770 
they'll be this pack or in the next pack
but<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.400> might<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.910> next<00:02:54.239> pack<00:02:54.420> -<00:02:54.569> because

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
but it might be the next pack - because

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.940 
but it might be the next pack - because
it<00:02:54.900> hadn't<00:02:55.080> even<00:02:55.140> happened<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.590> anime<00:02:55.890> for

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
it hadn't even happened in the anime for

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.280 
it hadn't even happened in the anime for
the<00:02:56.250> for<00:02:56.730> what<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:56.910> would<00:02:57.209> assume<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:58.049> lot

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the for what I would assume is a lot

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.259 
the for what I would assume is a lot
more<00:02:58.440> black<00:02:58.590> wing<00:02:58.799> stuff<00:02:59.040> so<00:02:59.430> yeah<00:02:59.940> tell<00:03:00.239> me
