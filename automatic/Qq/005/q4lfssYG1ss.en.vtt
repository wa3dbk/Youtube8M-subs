00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.710

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.450
 loved him 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.570
 so it's a flood of classics to 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.950
 smoky eyes with lips 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.780
 at the church 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:55.210

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.300
 I'm going right away with the mac mars 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.820
 mac coach with a sharp brush and 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.130
 soup to apply it as a whole 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.680
 from my hollow and my outer corner 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.680
 I go wide enough and fade 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.670
 then to give a little more 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.670
 definition a good record i'm going with 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.800
 a pointed and denser brush with a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.480
 black color that I'm going to apply in 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.480
 the hollest part of my eye 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.360
 in order not to lose the intensity of the 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.910
 color sketches I come back with this 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.430
 color is my brush surprised and this 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.220
 m also to create a beautiful background of the 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.650
 well I'm going directly with my 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.270
 point of light under the eyebrow and in 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.320
 all the clear part that remain them 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.320
 on the eyelid 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.040
 I have so much under the eye 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.300
 then I go directly 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.280
 by tracing the inside of my eye and 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.280
 then between them each c 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.400
 I come to create the smoky effect with 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.010
 the black-eyed number and a small 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.730
 brush dances and I'm going to melt the line 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.730
 that I just did 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:06.239
 without forgetting of course the underside of 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:08.510
 the eye apply several layers of 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.510
 mascara 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:23.680
 and I go with a lip color 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:25.420
 pretty erased but pink and I use the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.010
 lip pencil on all of my 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.459
 lips to make the color of red to 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.790
 lips more pink and the gloss to finish 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.790
