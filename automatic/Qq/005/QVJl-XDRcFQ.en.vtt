00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.069
 like you're bored 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.540
 it's really the wrath of the dragons 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.429
 that's what it looks like dragons 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 in game of thrones in the seine cia 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.440
 in the bio in warcraft in the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.960
 emerald knights in dragon except 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.960
 that in pokemon the dragons 500 the aca 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.710
 after we are surprised that the players of 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.449
 pokemon are not taken seriously in 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.980
 this video 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.800
 explanations we start with noon 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.660
 dragon the first pokemon of the pokedex 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.640
 mini draco per occurrence c he min 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.870
 dragon except for me before the mini 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.219
 dragon that was it's a bit of a shadow 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.920
 obviously we all know that his stadium 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.960
 final and so we can assume that one 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.180
 said draco and draco are tears of 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.530
 dragon however some people 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.550
 did not see things like that and 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.940
 we find on the net 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.829
 the next magic theory and the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.870
 legs of the dragon door in 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.440
 which a map that goes back a 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.329
 waterfall can turn into dragon 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.280
 before the jo we are not of the dragon type 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.360
 and went with the little larvae that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.310
 live in the water and who is 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.650
 would transform a day in Libya to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.080
 time they all live in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.180
 the water they are all three blue and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.500
 their time on 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.150
 their the stuff on their head 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.950
 will evolve over time magical erp 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.860
 to return to him he responds more with 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.660
 bricolo what is he a dragon you 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.280
 notice that the magic mustache has 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.290
 could jump the doors on his head 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.570
 I do not agree with this 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.550
 theory the leviathan is kind of 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.110
 dragon a little more chaotic a little bit more 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.810
 aquatic but it remains a kind of 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.130
 dragon and more viator when 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.250
 even some similarities with our 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.250
 criteria 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.360
 only pro jockey dragons of joe early on 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.310
 only one point that has two cars 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.290
 not the appearance of a dragon that makes 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.390
 gauler a lot of people but there are 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.479
 an explanation they can to 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.570
 evolution of hypo that is by posting there is 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.979
 a sea dragon a sea dragon it's 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.790
 a real species 1 it looks like that 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:09.520
 these products can camp hypo king and 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.760
 so the king of the sea dragons is him 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.380
 has a real dragon scales 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.150
 in the kind why does that normally 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.790
 later it's not my dragon 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.620
 braekhus is not bad but frankly 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.299
 it's true a guy who does not know 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.959
 pokemon it will really be able to land 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.209
 that question 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.010
 obviously we all know that draco 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.630
 it's a kind of cocoon in which the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.570
 draghi cells is changing to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.549
 become a breteca it's kind of 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.880
 pretty fit between chauny pan and aero 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.220
 myth 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.160
 the most critical dragon pokemons 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.910
 and must be surely vibratory and 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.850
 his evolution 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.440
 released to understand why the type 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.019
 dragon is assigned to them must 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.180
 go back to basic pokemon crack noah 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.640
 crack law it's a larva of ants 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.420
 lyon makes it the art of many millions to 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.519
 adulthood 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.310
 it gives that it's very close to the 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:02.739
 dragonfly and dragonflies in English that's 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.560
 dragonfly says a dragon flying their 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.640
 dragon type has therefore attributed them through 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.989
 this word game 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.820
 by the way, a little parenthesis 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.290
 now understand the link between spiro 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.930
 and sparks 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.780
 the last pokemon I'm going to 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.670
 to speak is surely the dragon who has 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:25.000
 need the most research from my 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:28.329
 share i have named halte arias i'm sure 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.599
 that none of you knows why 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.090
 this pokemon is a dragon on the net on 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.920
 find things inconsistent as he has 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.010
 bird body and a dragon's head 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.700
 hence its double type not seriously 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.209
 a dragon's head then a head of 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.040
 dragon 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.629
 no but it's really canaries 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.120
 a shit dragon head but that's it 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:55.359
 so why halte arias is a dragon 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.409
 you have to find that answer in sap 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:03.099
 revolution that is not even dragon 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:07.200
 said his name is composed of thil and 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.879
 detoh letoh one of cotton she useful 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.720
 be careful here it goes but really far 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.849
 thil is the name of a star star who 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.260
 is part of the constellation of 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:18.699
 dragon 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.109
 so maybe a key could see 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.820
 from altergaz come from this 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.310
 constellation years I do not know and I 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.320
 I do not care I criticize criticism but 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.940
 there are still pokemon dragons who 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.889
 look like dragons do not have friends 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.270
 it's really fire drago is not a 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.010
 dragon why why prague or fire 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.270
 is not he a dragon 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.340
 that's the question everyone is getting 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.080
 pose since the dawn of time and whose 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.750
 no one has no answer 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.139
 you will finally have a real 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.810
 answer it was never questioned that 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.990
 fire drago be a dragon if we take his 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:05:01.120
 original name we see that it is composed 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.249
 of lizards and the water suffix and this 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.149
 suffix is used for a lot of 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:09.349
 i know your fire dragon is a dinosaur 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:12.229
 and fr throws flames 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.239
 it's via uci and yes prefers draco 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.999
 claw the ligature too yet they 

00:05:14.239 --> 00:05:19.329
 are low of bragon even the English name 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:22.849
 does not refer to a dragon at all 

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:24.679
 it would have been called dino fire yes it does 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.439
 very badly but years would have called it dino 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:29.329
 fire we will not ask any questions it's 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.749
 like yoshi that 's a dinosaur that's 

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.749
 a dragon
