my<00:02:36.510> question<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.110> think<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.410> would<00:02:37.500> make<00:02:37.620> it

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
my question I think it would make it

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.980 
my question I think it would make it
sound<00:02:37.950> smooth<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.790> would<00:02:38.910> grab<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
sound smooth I think it would grab the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.750 
sound smooth I think it would grab the
groove<00:02:40.260> before<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.830> groom<00:02:41.100> actually<00:02:41.550> gets

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
groove before the groom actually gets

you<00:02:41.910> what<00:02:42.270> everything<00:02:42.920> because<00:02:43.920> that's<00:02:44.010> right

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
you what everything because that's right

you what everything because that's right
that's<00:02:44.520> what<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.790> do<00:02:44.850> naturally<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:06.300> would<00:03:06.540> be

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
that's what I do naturally that would be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720 
that's what I do naturally that would be
cooler<00:03:07.020> because<00:03:07.620> then<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.950> hit<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.370> hit<00:03:08.400> the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
cooler because then you hit you hit the
