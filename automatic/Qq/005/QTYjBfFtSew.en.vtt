00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
made a chaser for the product do that

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.500 
made a chaser for the product do that
you'll<00:02:11.579> use<00:02:12.079> than<00:02:13.079> it<00:02:13.349> is<00:02:13.560> reduced<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.670> maybe

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
you'll use than it is reduced and maybe

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.949 
you'll use than it is reduced and maybe
eight<00:02:15.959> she's<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> product<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.700> two<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.750> you

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
eight she's a product of the two and you

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.790 
eight she's a product of the two and you
can<00:02:19.290> surely<00:02:19.560> use<00:02:19.980> when<00:02:20.790> it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
can surely use when it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.890 
can surely use when it
do
