00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello today we cook the potato 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.590
 sweet no matter how the potato 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.590
 sweet jump 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.640
 a simple recipe today 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.990
 still just call it then is 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.610
 what you know that already the potato 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.910
 sweet and very very very rich in 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.500
 vitamin c and vitamins and more 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.270
 she is orange and like that there and 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.199
 the more she does not count checks then for 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.470
 the recipe it's called game the cut in 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.150
 not too much songs we'll blow them up 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.980
 a bit like fried potatoes 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.489
 Besides, we need small 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.680
 parts 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.750
 if you want you can also keep 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.519
 skin since almost every 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.519
 vitamins are in the bush precisely 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.940
 here are the manceaux 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.260
 we will make them white, that is to say 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.390
 precooked back we can get rid 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.829
 of the surplus friends so not very 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.809
 long huh it just takes two 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.820
 minutes I let it boil constantly 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.160
 without anything two three minutes 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.250
 I took them out by depositing them 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.740
 simply on absorbent paper 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.259
 we will actually make them listen before 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.020
 blow them up happily in the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.460
 stove for cooking oil from 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.080
 sunflower but you can also 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.149
 use grape seed oil 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.780
 which supports very well the cooking 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.420
 strong 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.740
 I like to hear that that sings it sings 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.899
 we will soon eat good there we keep the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.910
 rhythm one does not stop stir it must 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.099
 especially not the pasta with crolles one 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.670
 will leave them quietly golden be 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:38.229
 crispy you're just cooked to heart 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.590
 at the end of the cooking I blow again 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.819
 a little when they are golden 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.819
 are ready do not know actually 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 that's right in my dish and for 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.869
 finish nutmeg 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.189
 a pinch it will raise the dish and it 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.070
 marries really well with potatoes 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.970
 sweet another pinch of coarse salt 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.560
 this time brought back from the crunch and for 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.560
 the color a little chopped parsley 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.450
 to enjoy without moderation with a 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.470
 simmered olive fish for example 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.070
 that's all for today 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.070
 See you tomorrow
