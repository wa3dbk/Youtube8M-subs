upcoming Tegra 4 now if you guys
remember<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.139> sort<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.739> tegra

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
remember the sort of the tegra

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.610 
remember the sort of the tegra
progression<00:03:46.790> Tegra<00:03:47.150> one<00:03:47.389> didn't<00:03:48.169> really<00:03:48.410> take

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
progression Tegra one didn't really take

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.069 
progression Tegra one didn't really take
off<00:03:48.799> Tegra<00:03:49.459> 2<00:03:49.489> did<00:03:49.940> really<00:03:50.150> well<00:03:50.269> but<00:03:50.840> was

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
off Tegra 2 did really well but was

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.439 
off Tegra 2 did really well but was
replaced<00:03:51.230> quite<00:03:51.739> quickly<00:03:52.040> by<00:03:52.280> Tegra<00:03:52.639> 3<00:03:52.669> which

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
replaced quite quickly by Tegra 3 which

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.330 
replaced quite quickly by Tegra 3 which
jumped<00:03:53.870> from<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.109> dual-core<00:03:54.530> processor<00:03:55.129> to<00:03:55.280> a

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
jumped from a dual-core processor to a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.879 
jumped from a dual-core processor to a
quad-core<00:03:55.669> processor<00:03:56.510> beefed<00:03:57.019> up<00:03:57.199> the<00:03:57.379> GPU

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
quad-core processor beefed up the GPU

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:59.409 
quad-core processor beefed up the GPU
and<00:03:58.099> was<00:03:58.220> just<00:03:58.400> generally<00:03:58.849> better<00:03:59.000> in<00:03:59.209> every

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
and was just generally better in every

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.559 
and was just generally better in every
possible<00:03:59.599> way<00:03:59.900> Tegra<00:04:00.889> 4<00:04:01.329> ramps<00:04:02.329> it<00:04:02.449> up

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
possible way Tegra 4 ramps it up

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.949 
possible way Tegra 4 ramps it up
enormously<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:03.889> now<00:04:04.040> we've<00:04:04.250> got<00:04:04.430> 72<00:04:05.180> GPU<00:04:05.720> cores

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
enormously so now we've got 72 GPU cores

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.860 
enormously so now we've got 72 GPU cores
we've<00:04:06.680> got<00:04:06.949> the<00:04:07.129> same<00:04:07.370> four<00:04:07.909> plus<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.389> core

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
we've got the same four plus one core

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.250 
we've got the same four plus one core
layout<00:04:09.229> but<00:04:09.650> we're<00:04:10.280> talking<00:04:10.760> about<00:04:10.959> much<00:04:11.959> more

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
layout but we're talking about much more

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.939 
layout but we're talking about much more
like<00:04:13.220> just<00:04:13.959> way<00:04:14.959> more<00:04:14.989> power<00:04:15.470> they're<00:04:15.739> saying

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
like just way more power they're saying

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.759 
like just way more power they're saying
about<00:04:16.010> six<00:04:16.609> times<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.120> power<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.570> Tegra<00:04:18.260> 3<00:04:18.289> is

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
about six times the power of Tegra 3 is

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.399 
about six times the power of Tegra 3 is
going<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.190> be<00:04:19.310> in<00:04:19.549> Tegra<00:04:20.180> 2<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:20.659> it's<00:04:20.810> got<00:04:21.019> full

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
going to be in Tegra 2 so it's got full

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:24.339 
going to be in Tegra 2 so it's got full
support<00:04:21.889> for<00:04:22.130> your<00:04:22.219> ddr3<00:04:23.060> it's<00:04:23.630> got<00:04:23.930> support

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
support for your ddr3 it's got support

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.800 
support for your ddr3 it's got support
for<00:04:24.500> up<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.710> 2560<00:04:25.550> x<00:04:25.700> 1440

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
for up to 2560 x 1440

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.300 
for up to 2560 x 1440
output<00:04:27.260> which<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.470> really<00:04:27.889> really<00:04:28.040> cool

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
output which is really really cool

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.770 
output which is really really cool
remember<00:04:28.669> that's<00:04:28.820> sort<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.710> anecdotally<00:04:30.710> or

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
remember that's sort of anecdotally or

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.840 
remember that's sort of anecdotally or
so<00:04:32.780> what<00:04:32.930> I'm<00:04:33.050> looking<00:04:33.350> for<00:04:33.850> casually

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
so what I'm looking for casually

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.350 
so what I'm looking for casually
colloquially<00:04:35.480> referred<00:04:35.660> to<00:04:36.260> as<00:04:36.380> 2.5<00:04:36.560> k<00:04:37.360> lower

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
colloquially referred to as 2.5 k lower

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.490 
colloquially referred to as 2.5 k lower
power<00:04:38.660> okay<00:04:39.290> that's<00:04:39.590> good<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:42.200> pretty

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
power okay that's good and that pretty

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.409 
power okay that's good and that pretty
much<00:04:42.710> oh<00:04:43.010> that's<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:43.610> video<00:04:43.820> acceleration<00:04:44.060> it

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
much oh that's for video acceleration it

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.659 
much oh that's for video acceleration it
can<00:04:44.540> output<00:04:44.810> 2560<00:04:45.530> by<00:04:45.650> 1600<00:04:46.070> which<00:04:46.430> is<00:04:46.550> of

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
can output 2560 by 1600 which is of

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.640 
can output 2560 by 1600 which is of
course<00:04:46.790> very<00:04:47.030> different<00:04:47.360> or<00:04:47.540> even<00:04:47.870> 1080p<00:04:48.470> at

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
course very different or even 1080p at

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.440 
course very different or even 1080p at
120<00:04:49.370> Hertz<00:04:49.550> which<00:04:49.639> would<00:04:49.910> mean<00:04:50.030> it's<00:04:50.240> fully

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
120 Hertz which would mean it's fully

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.379 
120 Hertz which would mean it's fully
capable<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:50.960> outputting<00:04:51.020> in<00:04:51.440> 3d<00:04:51.970> thank<00:04:52.970> you<00:04:53.180> oh

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
capable of outputting in 3d thank you oh

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.530 
capable of outputting in 3d thank you oh
yeah<00:04:53.900> USB<00:04:54.320> 3<00:04:54.500> look<00:04:54.680> at<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.889> is<00:04:55.040> built-in
