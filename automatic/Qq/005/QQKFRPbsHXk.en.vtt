00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.389 

here's<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.229> question<00:00:01.499> I<00:00:01.829> was<00:00:01.979> asked<00:00:02.340> recently

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
here's a question I was asked recently

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.210 
here's a question I was asked recently
and<00:00:02.969> I<00:00:03.030> think<00:00:03.090> it<00:00:03.449> can<00:00:03.780> provide<00:00:04.649> a<00:00:04.710> little

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
and I think it can provide a little

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.490 
and I think it can provide a little
insight<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.359> stair<00:00:06.779> builders<00:00:07.200> and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
insight to stair builders and

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.070 
insight to stair builders and
do-it-yourselfers<00:00:08.030> and<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.570> whether<00:00:09.960> or

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
do-it-yourselfers and that is whether or

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.070 
do-it-yourselfers and that is whether or
not<00:00:10.470> you<00:00:10.800> should<00:00:10.830> extend<00:00:11.430> the<00:00:12.360> treads<00:00:12.840> and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
not you should extend the treads and

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.620 
not you should extend the treads and
risers<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:14.010> allow<00:00:14.340> or<00:00:14.670> compensate<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.510> the

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
risers to allow or compensate for the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.409 
risers to allow or compensate for the
drywall<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.320> other<00:00:16.500> words<00:00:16.769> in<00:00:17.419> some

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:18.419 
drywall in other words in some

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:23.540 
drywall in other words in some
situations<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.499> extend<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.699> tread<00:00:22.550> 5/8

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
situations you can extend the tread 5/8

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.759 
situations you can extend the tread 5/8
of<00:00:23.730> an<00:00:23.910> inch<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:24.359> you're<00:00:24.509> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.900> use<00:00:25.140> 5/8

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
of an inch if you're going to use 5/8

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.540 
of an inch if you're going to use 5/8
drywall<00:00:26.009> and<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.699> would<00:00:26.789> actually<00:00:26.929> overhang

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
drywall and it would actually overhang

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.030 
drywall and it would actually overhang
past<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.849> edge<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.810> stringer<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.499> you<00:00:31.800> see

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
past the edge of the stringer as you see

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.710 
past the edge of the stringer as you see
in<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.400> picture<00:00:32.790> here<00:00:33.060> so<00:00:33.090> here<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.570> have<00:00:33.690> a

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
in the picture here so here we have a

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.640 
in the picture here so here we have a
riser<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.430> extended<00:00:36.180> past<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:37.140> edge<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
riser that is extended past the edge of

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.840 
riser that is extended past the edge of
the<00:00:37.890> stair<00:00:38.610> stringer<00:00:39.980> 5/8<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.160> an<00:00:41.340> inch<00:00:41.460> or

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
the stair stringer 5/8 of an inch or

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.910 
the stair stringer 5/8 of an inch or
half-inch<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.540> don't<00:00:42.930> remember<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.380> exactly

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
half-inch I don't remember what exactly

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.370 
half-inch I don't remember what exactly
what<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.220> one<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:44.490> but<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.970> would<00:00:45.120> allow<00:00:45.380> for

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:46.380 
what this one is but you would allow for

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.740 
what this one is but you would allow for
the<00:00:46.800> width<00:00:47.130> of<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.610> drywall<00:00:47.880> half-inch

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the width of the drywall half-inch

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.050 
the width of the drywall half-inch
drywall<00:00:49.200> will<00:00:49.680> require<00:00:50.070> 1/2<00:00:50.340> inch<00:00:50.610> extension

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
drywall will require 1/2 inch extension

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.160 
drywall will require 1/2 inch extension
5/8<00:00:51.780> drywall<00:00:52.050> will<00:00:52.740> require<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.510> 5/8<00:00:54.510> extension

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
5/8 drywall will require a 5/8 extension

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830 
5/8 drywall will require a 5/8 extension
and<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> treads<00:00:56.130> will<00:00:56.610> also<00:00:57.120> need<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.630> cut

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and the treads will also need to be cut

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
and the treads will also need to be cut
a<00:00:57.870> little<00:00:58.200> longer<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.280> match<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.260> have

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
a little longer to match so if you have

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.289 
a little longer to match so if you have
an<00:01:02.610> overall<00:01:03.120> length<00:01:03.450> of<00:01:03.690> 36<00:01:04.619> inches<00:01:05.249> from<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
an overall length of 36 inches from the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.060 
an overall length of 36 inches from the
edge<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.990> stair<00:01:07.200> stringer<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.950> edge

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
edge of your stair stringer to the edge

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.480 
edge of your stair stringer to the edge
of<00:01:08.249> the<00:01:08.369> stair<00:01:08.579> stringer<00:01:08.969> overall<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:10.560> width

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
of the stair stringer overall in width

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
of the stair stringer overall in width
and<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:12.509> gonna<00:01:12.630> use<00:01:12.810> half-inch<00:01:13.320> drywall

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and you're gonna use half-inch drywall

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.219 
and you're gonna use half-inch drywall
then<00:01:14.429> you<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.700> cut<00:01:15.179> the<00:01:15.210> treads<00:01:16.049> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
then you would just cut the treads and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.940 
then you would just cut the treads and
risers<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.740> half<00:01:17.009> inch<00:01:17.249> longer<00:01:18.319> 36<00:01:19.319> and<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.890> half

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
risers a half inch longer 36 and a half

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.480 
risers a half inch longer 36 and a half
inches<00:01:20.640> would<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.359> correct<00:01:21.689> length<00:01:22.490> so

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
inches would be the correct length so

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.190 
inches would be the correct length so
realistically<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.359> I<00:01:24.390> did<00:01:24.600> was<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.780> took<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
realistically what I did was I took a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.760 
realistically what I did was I took a
section<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:26.009> kind<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.399> split<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:28.020> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
section I kind of split it and this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.340 
section I kind of split it and this
would<00:01:29.039> be<00:01:29.189> looking<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.179> front<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
would be looking at the front of the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.899 
would be looking at the front of the
stairway<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.039> again<00:01:32.490> if<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.639> having<00:01:32.819> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
stairway and again if you having a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
stairway and again if you having a
difficult<00:01:33.329> time<00:01:33.389> figuring<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.310> what<00:01:35.310> you're

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
difficult time figuring out what you're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.889 
difficult time figuring out what you're
actually<00:01:35.639> looking<00:01:36.030> at<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.479> might<00:01:36.630> need<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
actually looking at you might need to

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.260 
actually looking at you might need to
watch<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.319> video<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.649> few<00:01:37.979> times<00:01:38.090> these<00:01:39.090> are

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
watch the video a few times these are

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.529 
watch the video a few times these are
difficult<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.899> explain<00:01:40.520> if<00:01:41.520> you're<00:01:42.389> not

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
difficult to explain if you're not

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.109 
difficult to explain if you're not
familiar<00:01:42.749> with<00:01:43.049> construction<00:01:43.679> sections<00:01:44.459> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
familiar with construction sections and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.440 
familiar with construction sections and
drawings<00:01:45.929> so<00:01:46.709> what<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.310> here<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
drawings so what we have here is the

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.370 
drawings so what we have here is the
site<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.109> stair<00:01:49.380> stringer<00:01:49.889> and<00:01:50.719> we<00:01:51.719> have<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
site of a stair stringer and we have the

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.859 
site of a stair stringer and we have the
top<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.579> stair<00:01:53.880> tread<00:01:54.179> now<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.689> just

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
top of the stair tread now this is just

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.599 
top of the stair tread now this is just
the<00:01:55.020> framing<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.679> we're<00:01:55.829> looking<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.249> for

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
the framing so we're looking at for

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:01.330 
the framing so we're looking at for
example<00:01:56.639> a<00:01:57.299> 2<00:01:57.810> by<00:01:58.319> 12<00:01:58.380> stair<00:01:59.130> stringer<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.929> a

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
example a 2 by 12 stair stringer and a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.840 
example a 2 by 12 stair stringer and a
3/4<00:02:02.340> inch

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
3/4 inch

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.980 
3/4 inch
stair<00:02:03.689> tread<00:02:04.159> cut<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.279> of<00:02:05.399> plywood<00:02:05.549> or<00:02:05.999> OSB

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
stair tread cut out of plywood or OSB

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.639 
stair tread cut out of plywood or OSB
this<00:02:07.319> would<00:02:07.499> be<00:02:07.649> standard<00:02:08.280> framing<00:02:09.019> and<00:02:10.019> of

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
this would be standard framing and of

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.070 
this would be standard framing and of
course<00:02:10.950> here's<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:12.019> extent

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
course here's the extent

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.490 
course here's the extent
did<00:02:13.260> tread<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.310> previous<00:02:14.760> picture<00:02:15.480> was<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
did tread the previous picture was the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.710 
did tread the previous picture was the
tread<00:02:16.830> flush<00:02:17.250> with<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.760> stringer<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.480> one

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
tread flush with the stringer this one

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.470 
tread flush with the stringer this one
actually<00:02:19.020> has<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.770> extension<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:21.120> let's<00:02:21.300> just

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
actually has the extension so let's just

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.390 
actually has the extension so let's just
say<00:02:21.630> it's<00:02:21.750> extended<00:02:22.500> five<00:02:22.800> eighths<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.220> an

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
say it's extended five eighths of an

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.060 
say it's extended five eighths of an
inch<00:02:23.570> for<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.810> drywall<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.590> provides

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
inch for the drywall and this provides

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.860 
inch for the drywall and this provides
you<00:02:26.250> with<00:02:26.400> an<00:02:26.550> excellent<00:02:27.000> example<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.810> what

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
you with an excellent example of what

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.180 
you with an excellent example of what
I'm<00:02:28.170> talking<00:02:28.620> about

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
I'm talking about

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.600 
I'm talking about
we<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> piece<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.240> drywall<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:32.250> will

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
we have a piece of drywall that will

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.920 
we have a piece of drywall that will
butt<00:02:33.000> up<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.440> bottom<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.970> stair<00:02:36.570> tread

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
butt up to the bottom of the stair tread

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.660 
butt up to the bottom of the stair tread
and<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.290> course<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.680> edge<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.430> stair

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and of course the edge of the stair

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
and of course the edge of the stair
risers<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.690> works<00:02:40.110> great<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:41.010> certain

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
risers and this works great for certain

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.930 
risers and this works great for certain
situations<00:02:42.690> but<00:02:42.870> night<00:02:43.140> might<00:02:43.590> not<00:02:43.800> work<00:02:44.100> well

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
situations but night might not work well

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.060 
situations but night might not work well
for<00:02:45.750> everything<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> main

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
for everything and this is the main

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.910 
for everything and this is the main
reason<00:02:47.250> why<00:02:47.550> I'm<00:02:47.670> making<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.060> video<00:02:48.650> next<00:02:49.650> up

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
reason why I'm making the video next up

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.250 
reason why I'm making the video next up
I<00:02:50.010> went<00:02:50.220> ahead<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.610> installed<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.510> bottom

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
I went ahead and installed the bottom

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.199 
I went ahead and installed the bottom
trim<00:02:52.590> board<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.280> carpeting<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.970> give<00:02:54.120> you

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
trim board and the carpeting to give you

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.540 
trim board and the carpeting to give you
a<00:02:54.270> better<00:02:54.420> idea<00:02:54.540> where<00:02:55.260> we're<00:02:55.530> at<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.400> of

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
a better idea where we're at and of

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.820 
a better idea where we're at and of
course<00:02:56.760> here's<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.120> picture<00:02:57.560> sometimes<00:02:58.560> a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
course here's a picture sometimes a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.470 
course here's a picture sometimes a
picture<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.220> worth<00:02:59.370> more<00:02:59.670> than<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.970> thousand

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
picture is worth more than a thousand

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.180 
picture is worth more than a thousand
words<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.500> found<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.950> be<00:03:02.070> true

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
words and I found that to be true

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.640 
words and I found that to be true
explaining<00:03:03.060> things<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.510> people<00:03:03.690> now<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
explaining things to people now the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.210 
explaining things to people now the
black<00:03:05.160> arrow<00:03:05.550> is<00:03:05.910> actually<00:03:06.390> pointing<00:03:06.990> to<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
black arrow is actually pointing to the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.480 
black arrow is actually pointing to the
The<00:03:09.060> Cove<00:03:09.450> moulding<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.410> again<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.280> this

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
The Cove moulding and again this this

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.340 
The Cove moulding and again this this
trim<00:03:11.940> can<00:03:12.209> come<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.630> variety<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:13.110> different

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
trim can come in a variety of different

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.790 
trim can come in a variety of different
sizes<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.340> wanted<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.900> make<00:03:15.900> sure<00:03:16.560> that

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
sizes but I wanted to make sure that

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.000 
sizes but I wanted to make sure that
this<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.370> actually<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.959> one<00:03:19.470> of<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.620> reasons

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
this is actually the one of the reasons

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.240 
this is actually the one of the reasons
why<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.250> made<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.730> video<00:03:20.959> to<00:03:22.040> give<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.160> an

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
why I made the video to give you an

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.710 
why I made the video to give you an
example<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.850> some<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.180> problems<00:03:24.570> you

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
example of some of the problems you

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.380 
example of some of the problems you
could<00:03:24.840> run<00:03:25.110> into<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.459> use<00:03:27.000> if<00:03:27.239> you're

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
could run into if you use if you're

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
could run into if you use if you're
going<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:27.570> use<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.750> smaller<00:03:28.760> moulding<00:03:29.760> here

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
going to use a smaller moulding here

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.670 
going to use a smaller moulding here
versus<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.440> larger<00:03:32.070> one<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.519> then<00:03:33.620> why<00:03:34.620> you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
versus a larger one and then why you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.020 
versus a larger one and then why you
should<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:35.700> should<00:03:36.000> not<00:03:36.030> extend<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:38.310> tread

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
should or should not extend the tread

overhang at the stair stringers and of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.759 
overhang at the stair stringers and of
course<00:03:42.570> you'll<00:03:42.720> see<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.019> here<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.560> next

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
course you'll see it here in the next

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.160 
course you'll see it here in the next
few<00:03:44.250> pictures<00:03:44.700> you'll<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.390> all<00:03:45.600> figured

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
few pictures you'll have it all figured

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.320 
few pictures you'll have it all figured
out<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.739> should<00:03:46.920> be<00:03:46.950> crystal<00:03:47.430> clear<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:48.120> you

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
out it should be crystal clear to you

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.699 
out it should be crystal clear to you
now<00:03:48.650> here's<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:50.660> cove<00:03:51.660> molding<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.530> was

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
now here's the cove molding I was

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.830 
now here's the cove molding I was
referring<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.150> actually<00:03:54.810> a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
referring to and this is actually a

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.900 
referring to and this is actually a
picture<00:03:55.260> where<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.590> can<00:03:55.769> see<00:03:55.980> where<00:03:56.190> where

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
picture where you can see where where

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.120 
picture where you can see where where
the<00:03:57.350> thread<00:03:58.400> was<00:03:59.400> extended<00:04:00.150> past<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.769> stair

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
the thread was extended past the stair

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.640 
the thread was extended past the stair
stringer<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.730> allow<00:04:03.000> for<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.390> drywall<00:04:04.019> and

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
stringer to allow for the drywall and

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.890 
stringer to allow for the drywall and
one<00:04:05.519> of<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.670> problems<00:04:06.180> you're<00:04:06.330> going<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.690> run

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
one of the problems you're going to run

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.100 
one of the problems you're going to run
into<00:04:07.170> if<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.800> do<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.880> with<00:04:09.510> this<00:04:09.690> particular

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
into if you do this with this particular

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.570 
into if you do this with this particular
finish<00:04:10.790> will<00:04:11.790> be<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.540> fact<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.950> trim

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
finish will be the fact that the trim

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.449 
finish will be the fact that the trim
sometimes<00:04:15.570> won't<00:04:15.780> cover<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.500> drywall<00:04:17.430> and

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
sometimes won't cover the drywall and

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.099 
sometimes won't cover the drywall and
I've<00:04:17.790> seen<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.180> especially<00:04:18.570> when<00:04:18.930> you're

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
I've seen this especially when you're

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.370 
I've seen this especially when you're
using<00:04:19.410> larger<00:04:20.310> stair<00:04:21.209> treads<00:04:21.570> for<00:04:21.930> example

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
using larger stair treads for example

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.890 
using larger stair treads for example
inch<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.860> an<00:04:22.950> eighth<00:04:23.100> or<00:04:23.400> two<00:04:23.760> by<00:04:24.000> stair

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
inch and an eighth or two by stair

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.150 
inch and an eighth or two by stair
treads<00:04:25.320> and

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
treads and

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.480 
treads and
you<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.670> drywall<00:04:27.150> budding<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:28.490> bottom

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
you have the drywall budding the bottom

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.430 
you have the drywall budding the bottom
of<00:04:29.730> the<00:04:29.970> tread<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.750> can<00:04:30.930> see<00:04:31.110> where<00:04:31.290> this

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
of the tread you can see where this

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.220 
of the tread you can see where this
would<00:04:31.500> be<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.770> problem<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.610> again<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.960> arrow

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
would be a problem and again the arrow

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.730 
would be a problem and again the arrow
in<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.800> picture<00:04:35.190> is<00:04:35.310> pointing<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:37.020> small

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
in this picture is pointing to the small

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.070 
in this picture is pointing to the small
area<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.670> would<00:04:38.820> be<00:04:38.970> covered<00:04:39.360> by<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.600> trim

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
area that would be covered by the trim

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.920 
area that would be covered by the trim
so<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.860> if<00:04:41.010> you<00:04:41.190> were<00:04:41.370> going<00:04:41.670> to<00:04:41.760> use<00:04:42.300> larger

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
so so if you were going to use larger

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.260 
so so if you were going to use larger
treads<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.620> smaller<00:04:44.520> trim<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.150> could

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
treads and smaller trim you could

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.090 
treads and smaller trim you could
actually<00:04:45.420> see<00:04:45.870> where<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.230> could<00:04:46.440> be<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.650> big

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
actually see where this could be a big

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.930 
actually see where this could be a big
problem<00:04:47.930> however<00:04:48.930> if<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.980> run<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.400> drywall

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
problem however if you run the drywall

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.600 
problem however if you run the drywall
to<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.450> top<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.350> stair<00:04:52.650> treads<00:04:53.010> and<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
to the top of the stair treads and the

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.380 
to the top of the stair treads and the
edge<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.870> risers<00:04:55.590> then<00:04:55.980> you<00:04:56.550> aren't<00:04:57.120> going

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
edge of the risers then you aren't going

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.510 
edge of the risers then you aren't going
to<00:04:57.450> have<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.720> problem<00:04:58.350> so<00:04:58.950> you<00:04:59.010> can<00:04:59.220> see<00:04:59.370> where

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
to have the problem so you can see where

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.890 
to have the problem so you can see where
this<00:04:59.640> could<00:04:59.790> be<00:04:59.940> an<00:05:00.030> advantage<00:05:00.210> or<00:05:00.810> a

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
this could be an advantage or a

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.750 
this could be an advantage or a
disadvantage<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:03.260> there<00:05:04.260> are<00:05:04.640> reasons<00:05:05.640> why

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
disadvantage and there are reasons why

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.930 
disadvantage and there are reasons why
you<00:05:05.940> do<00:05:06.390> want<00:05:06.600> to<00:05:06.690> extend<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.730> treads<00:05:08.730> and

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
you do want to extend the treads and

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.250 
you do want to extend the treads and
risers<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.660> course<00:05:09.870> there<00:05:10.020> are<00:05:10.110> going<00:05:10.200> to

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
risers and of course there are going to

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.990 
risers and of course there are going to
be<00:05:10.380> situations<00:05:10.590> like<00:05:11.160> this<00:05:11.370> where<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.730> will

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
be situations like this where you will

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.100 
be situations like this where you will
not<00:05:12.330> want<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.170> so<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.070> hope<00:05:14.520> this<00:05:14.700> helps<00:05:15.120> and

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
not want to so I hope this helps and

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.080 
not want to so I hope this helps and
again<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.470> received<00:05:16.920> an<00:05:17.070> email<00:05:17.220> from<00:05:17.730> someone

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
again I received an email from someone

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.410 
again I received an email from someone
who<00:05:18.510> is<00:05:19.220> pulling<00:05:20.220> their<00:05:20.490> hair<00:05:20.520> out<00:05:20.730> right<00:05:20.940> now

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
who is pulling their hair out right now

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.680 
who is pulling their hair out right now
thinking<00:05:21.900> do<00:05:22.110> they<00:05:22.260> have<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:23.360> dismantle<00:05:24.360> the

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
thinking do they have to dismantle the

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.140 
thinking do they have to dismantle the
stairway<00:05:25.170> that<00:05:25.440> they<00:05:25.830> took<00:05:26.670> their<00:05:26.910> time

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
stairway that they took their time

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.900 
stairway that they took their time
building<00:05:27.600> and<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.410> answer<00:05:28.770> is<00:05:29.490> absolutely

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:29.910 
building and the answer is absolutely

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.930 
building and the answer is absolutely
not<00:05:30.690> this<00:05:31.230> is<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.800> way<00:05:31.950> you're<00:05:32.220> going<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.550> need

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
not this is the way you're going to need

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.410 
not this is the way you're going to need
to<00:05:33.210> go<00:05:33.360> this<00:05:33.690> will<00:05:33.870> be<00:05:33.990> what<00:05:34.170> you<00:05:34.350> want<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.860> do

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
to go this will be what you want to do

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.240 
to go this will be what you want to do
if<00:05:36.420> this<00:05:36.990> is<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:38.150> method<00:05:39.150> that<00:05:39.950> you're<00:05:40.950> going

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
if this is the method that you're going

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.090 
if this is the method that you're going
to<00:05:41.310> use<00:05:41.700> to<00:05:42.210> finish<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.960> stairway<00:05:43.410> sometimes

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
to use to finish the stairway sometimes

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.640 
to use to finish the stairway sometimes
like<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.430> said<00:05:44.460> there<00:05:45.390> are<00:05:45.419> bright<00:05:45.930> a<00:05:45.990> variety

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
like I said there are bright a variety

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.530 
like I said there are bright a variety
of<00:05:46.680> different<00:05:46.919> ways<00:05:47.220> to<00:05:47.490> finish<00:05:47.700> the<00:05:48.000> edge<00:05:48.180> of

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
of different ways to finish the edge of

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.409 
of different ways to finish the edge of
a<00:05:48.660> stair<00:05:48.960> stringer<00:05:49.700> if<00:05:50.700> you're<00:05:50.940> going<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.270> use

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
a stair stringer if you're going to use

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.210 
a stair stringer if you're going to use
this<00:05:51.630> one<00:05:51.840> then<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:52.140> can<00:05:52.290> definitely<00:05:52.590> see

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
this one then you can definitely see

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.780 
this one then you can definitely see
where<00:05:54.000> extending<00:05:54.870> the<00:05:55.020> drywall<00:05:55.590> or<00:05:56.370> running

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
where extending the drywall or running

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.980 
where extending the drywall or running
the<00:05:56.910> drywall<00:05:57.450> past<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.380> stair<00:05:59.280> tread<00:05:59.669> and<00:05:59.990> the

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
the drywall past the stair tread and the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.540 
the drywall past the stair tread and the
edge<00:06:01.110> of<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.530> riser<00:06:01.740> is<00:06:01.919> going<00:06:02.160> to<00:06:02.220> be<00:06:02.370> more

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
edge of the riser is going to be more

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.750 
edge of the riser is going to be more
beneficial<00:06:02.730> than<00:06:03.510> extending<00:06:04.380> the<00:06:04.890> treads<00:06:05.490> and

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
beneficial than extending the treads and

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.000 
beneficial than extending the treads and
risers
