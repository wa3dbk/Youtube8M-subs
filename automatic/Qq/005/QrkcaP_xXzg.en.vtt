tossing things at them this becomes

progressively more difficult of course

progressively more difficult of course
as<00:01:09.630> each<00:01:10.050> hangar<00:01:10.500> adds<00:01:10.710> new<00:01:10.950> obstacles<00:01:11.610> that

than<00:01:14.460> you'd<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.060> would<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.440> a

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
than you'd think it would be you have a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.469 
than you'd think it would be you have a
few<00:01:16.800> weapons<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.670> disposal<00:01:18.060> their

few weapons at your disposal their
crates<00:01:19.160> choose<00:01:20.420> cannonballs<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.720> only<00:01:21.869> catch

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
crates choose cannonballs the only catch

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
crates choose cannonballs the only catch
is<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.830> crate<00:01:23.160> is<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.759> only<00:01:23.910> one

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
is that the crate is the only one

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
is that the crate is the only one
available<00:01:24.210> at<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.899> start<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.800> want<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
available at the start if you want to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.800 
available at the start if you want to
use<00:01:26.220> those<00:01:26.400> other<00:01:26.640> weapons<00:01:27.120> you<00:01:27.510> have<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
use those other weapons you have to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.210 
use those other weapons you have to
unlock<00:01:28.110> them<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> want<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.920> unlock

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
unlock them and if you want to unlock

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
unlock them and if you want to unlock
them<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.150> knock<00:01:30.330> off<00:01:30.600> about<00:01:30.870> a<00:01:30.930> few

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
them you have to knock off about a few

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.460 
them you have to knock off about a few
thousand<00:01:32.010> barrels<00:01:32.250> first<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.090> fact<00:01:33.470> nothin

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
thousand barrels first in fact nothin

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.730 
thousand barrels first in fact nothin
500<00:01:35.190> for<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.610> weapon<00:01:36.290> 4,000<00:01:37.290> for<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.560> other

500 for one weapon 4,000 for the other

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.670 
500 for one weapon 4,000 for the other
this<00:01:38.190> is<00:01:38.280> ridiculous<00:01:39.020> so<00:01:40.020> obviously<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
this is ridiculous so obviously that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.580 
this is ridiculous so obviously that
takes<00:01:41.310> quite<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.940> time<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.350> has

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
takes quite some time to do and this has

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.590 
takes quite some time to do and this has
become<00:01:43.740> pervasive<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.760> lot<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> games<00:01:45.330> for

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
become pervasive in a lot of games for

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.140 
become pervasive in a lot of games for
mobile<00:01:45.780> devices<00:01:46.580> technically<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.790> game<00:01:47.970> is

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
mobile devices technically the game is

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.899 
mobile devices technically the game is
free<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.110> takes<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.680> long<00:01:50.100> time<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.580> gain

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
free but it takes a long time to gain

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.270 
free but it takes a long time to gain
access<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.570> better<00:01:51.930> weapons<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.650> more<00:01:52.799> levels

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
access to better weapons and more levels

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
access to better weapons and more levels
so<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:54.090> keep<00:01:54.600> playing<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
so you have to just keep playing the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.050 
so you have to just keep playing the
same<00:01:55.200> ones<00:01:55.680> over<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.100> over<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
same ones over and over with the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.270 
same ones over and over with the
dangling<00:01:57.570> carrot<00:01:58.049> being<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.560> oh<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.920> can

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
dangling carrot being that oh you can

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.219 
dangling carrot being that oh you can
just<00:01:59.460> buy<00:01:59.729> those<00:02:00.030> extra<00:02:00.450> features<00:02:00.840> with<00:02:01.110> an

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
just buy those extra features with an

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:13.479 
just buy those extra features with an
in-app<00:02:01.650> purchase

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.369 

that's<00:02:14.489> not<00:02:14.819> really<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.269> problem<00:02:15.379> certainly

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
that's not really a problem certainly

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.619 
that's not really a problem certainly
not<00:02:16.769> one<00:02:16.950> that's<00:02:17.190> exclusive<00:02:17.849> to<00:02:17.879> barrel<00:02:18.420> toss

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
not one that's exclusive to barrel toss

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.100 
not one that's exclusive to barrel toss
but<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> game<00:02:19.409> does<00:02:19.799> have<00:02:19.909> problems<00:02:20.909> and

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
but the game does have problems and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.140 
but the game does have problems and
specifically<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.769> lack<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.040> content<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
specifically it's a lack of content the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.059 
specifically it's a lack of content the
game<00:02:24.330> has<00:02:24.540> three<00:02:24.930> weapons<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.709> three

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
game has three weapons and three

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.830 
game has three weapons and three
different<00:02:26.430> hangers<00:02:26.819> each<00:02:27.060> with<00:02:27.540> its<00:02:27.690> own

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
different hangers each with its own

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.470 
different hangers each with its own
levels<00:02:28.379> but<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.310> all<00:02:29.549> there<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.879> barrel

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
levels but that's all there is to barrel

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.509 
levels but that's all there is to barrel
toss<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.110> it<00:02:31.200> gets<00:02:31.349> old<00:02:31.560> well<00:02:31.950> before<00:02:32.370> you've

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
toss and it gets old well before you've

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.820 
toss and it gets old well before you've
done<00:02:32.730> enough<00:02:32.879> to<00:02:33.180> unlock<00:02:33.569> everything<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.680> of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
done enough to unlock everything now of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.350 
done enough to unlock everything now of
course<00:02:35.010> there's<00:02:35.370> not<00:02:35.580> much<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.090> do<00:02:36.239> about

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
course there's not much you can do about

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.330 
course there's not much you can do about
repetition<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.410> game<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.040> you're

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
repetition in a game like this you're
