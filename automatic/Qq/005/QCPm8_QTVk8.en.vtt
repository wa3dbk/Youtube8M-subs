in my other video as you know has 10

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.120 
in my other video as you know has 10
your<00:00:09.929> house<00:00:10.080> won't<00:00:10.290> get<00:00:10.500> one<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:10.860> where<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> was

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
your house won't get one and where I was

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.970 
your house won't get one and where I was
going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.370> mount<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.759> or<00:00:12.440> suggestions<00:00:13.440> and

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
going to mount it or suggestions and

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.589 
going to mount it or suggestions and
where<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.580> know<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.759> need<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.089> mount<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.480> and

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
where you know I need to mount it and

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.019 
where you know I need to mount it and
all<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.049> stuff<00:00:16.400> anyways<00:00:17.400> first<00:00:17.699> thing<00:00:17.910> you

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
all that stuff anyways first thing you

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:28.849 
all that stuff anyways first thing you
need<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:21.500> take<00:00:22.500> your<00:00:22.650> views<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:27.859> pull

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
need to do is take your views and pull

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:41.650 
need to do is take your views and pull
it<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:33.469> yes<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.770> dark<00:00:35.040> time<00:00:39.410> okay

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
it out yes it is dark time okay

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.130 
it out yes it is dark time okay
such<00:00:42.660> views<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> side<00:00:44.660> thing<00:00:45.660> when<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> do

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
such views the side thing when you do

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920 
such views the side thing when you do
just<00:00:46.879> discharge<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
just discharge it so we need to go to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.189 
just discharge it so we need to go to
the<00:00:49.110> capacitor<00:00:49.910> now<00:00:50.910> as<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.300> see<00:00:51.829> it's<00:00:52.829> on

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
the capacitor now as you can see it's on

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:07.700 
the capacitor now as you can see it's on
so<00:00:57.170> I<00:00:58.219> do<00:00:59.510> is<00:01:02.809> take<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.189> lot<00:01:05.189> tester<00:01:06.260> this<00:01:07.260> anyone

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
so I do is take a lot tester this anyone

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.660 
so I do is take a lot tester this anyone
this<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:08.520> brother-in-law<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:10.520> take<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
this is my brother-in-law so I take the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
this is my brother-in-law so I take the
light<00:01:11.820> tester<00:01:12.680> stick<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:14.850> side<00:01:15.350> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
light tester stick it on one side the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.429 
light tester stick it on one side the
other<00:01:16.500> side<00:01:17.750> like<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.960> you'll<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
other side like that and you'll see the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.010 
other side like that and you'll see the
lock<00:01:19.590> come<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:22.310> well<00:01:23.310> I'm<00:01:24.299> like<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.990> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
lock come on well I'm like see that I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.780 
lock come on well I'm like see that I
got<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> light<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> camera<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.430> anyways

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
got the light on the camera on anyways

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
got the light on the camera on anyways
sit<00:01:29.790> lock<00:01:30.000> come<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.570> what<00:01:31.350> you'll<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.680> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
sit lock come on what you'll do is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
sit lock come on what you'll do is
you'll<00:01:32.070> wait<00:01:32.310> until<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> light<00:01:33.060> completely

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you'll wait until the light completely

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.679 
you'll wait until the light completely
Den's<00:01:34.729> what<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:35.909> doing<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.420> it's

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
Den's what that's doing is it's

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.240 
Den's what that's doing is it's
discharging<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.770> way<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.130> you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
discharging that that way when you

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.330 
discharging that that way when you
unhook<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:40.170> replace<00:01:40.619> there's<00:01:40.890> something

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
unhook it to replace there's something

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.910 
unhook it to replace there's something
it<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> crap<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:44.299> anyways

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
it was that the crap out of you anyways

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.550 
it was that the crap out of you anyways
once<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.070> light<00:01:47.250> goes<00:01:47.490> completely<00:01:47.759> dim<00:01:48.560> which

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
once the light goes completely dim which

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.810 
once the light goes completely dim which
y'all<00:01:49.829> can't<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.369> I've<00:01:50.579> got<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
y'all can't see it because I've got the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.249 
y'all can't see it because I've got the
light<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:53.270> once<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.390> goes<00:01:54.479> completely<00:01:54.750> dim

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
light on once it goes completely dim

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.630 
light on once it goes completely dim
that<00:01:55.500> means<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.950> there's<00:01:56.159> no<00:01:56.399> power

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that means that there's no power

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.330 
that means that there's no power
whatsoever<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.780> cap<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:01.340> lights

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
whatsoever in the cap so the lights

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.850 
whatsoever in the cap so the lights
completely<00:02:02.549> out<00:02:03.060> so<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.469> safe<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
completely out so now it is safe to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.910 
completely out so now it is safe to
remove<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:06.479> capacitor<00:02:07.429> alright<00:02:08.690> now<00:02:09.739> we<00:02:10.739> need

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
remove the capacitor alright now we need

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.100 
remove the capacitor alright now we need
to<00:02:11.099> charge<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:12.180> reason<00:02:12.360> why<00:02:12.629> I'm

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
to charge it the reason why I'm

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.270 
to charge it the reason why I'm
discharging<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.890> reach

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
discharging it in reach

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.910 
discharging it in reach
because<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.940> just<00:02:14.970> hooked<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:16.050> didn't

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
because I just hooked it up I didn't

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.300 
because I just hooked it up I didn't
charge<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.460> or<00:02:17.610> anything<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.650> wanted<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.710> just

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
charge it or anything I wanted to just

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.800 
charge it or anything I wanted to just
charge<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.060> then<00:02:21.390> we're<00:02:21.600> going<00:02:21.720> to

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
charge it and then we're going to

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.310 
charge it and then we're going to
recharge<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.130> way<00:02:24.110> how<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.140> do

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
recharge it the right way how you do

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.770 
recharge it the right way how you do
that<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:27.630> come<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.340> battery<00:02:29.780> all

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that is you come to the battery all

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.210 
that is you come to the battery all
right<00:02:32.750> now<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:34.500> here<00:02:34.680> where<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.920> shoot<00:02:35.100> as

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
right now right here where you shoot as

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:45.010 
right now right here where you shoot as
holder<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:39.680> like<00:02:40.680> clip<00:02:43.430> okay

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
holder is you like clip okay

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.449 
holder is you like clip okay
clip<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.170> onto<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.530> positive<00:02:46.709> side<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.340> your

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
clip it onto the positive side of your

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:56.090 
clip it onto the positive side of your
battery<00:02:49.010> that's<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.989> looked<00:02:51.989> up<00:02:54.920> maybe<00:02:55.920> that

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
battery that's so looked up maybe that

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.020 
battery that's so looked up maybe that
would<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.310> worked<00:02:56.400> if<00:02:56.580> I'd<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.820> done<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
would have worked if I'd have done that

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
would have worked if I'd have done that
while<00:02:57.209> we<00:02:57.300> go<00:02:57.390> all<00:02:57.959> right<00:02:59.000> now<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.300> your<00:03:00.600> fuse

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
while we go all right now on your fuse

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.330 
while we go all right now on your fuse
as<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.760> see<00:03:02.910> it's<00:03:03.200> connected<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
as you can see it's connected to the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.880 
as you can see it's connected to the
positive<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.030> battery

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
positive on the battery

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.600 
positive on the battery
here's<00:03:07.890> your<00:03:08.070> amp<00:03:08.220> wire<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.140> side<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.739> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
here's your amp wire on this side is the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.000 
here's your amp wire on this side is the
wire<00:03:11.760> that's<00:03:11.970> going<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> battery<00:03:13.010> this

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
wire that's going to the battery this

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.560 
wire that's going to the battery this
side<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.550> wire<00:03:14.820> that's<00:03:14.970> going<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> amp

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
side is the wire that's going to the amp

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.190 
side is the wire that's going to the amp
what<00:03:16.050> you'll<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:17.250> you'll<00:03:17.430> touch<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.870> in

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
what you'll do is you'll touch that in

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.460 
what you'll do is you'll touch that in
the<00:03:19.860> lateral<00:03:20.130> come<00:03:20.340> on<00:03:21.019> you'll<00:03:22.019> hold<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.320> on

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
the lateral come on you'll hold it on

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.710 
the lateral come on you'll hold it on
here<00:03:22.739> until<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.190> light<00:03:23.370> goes<00:03:23.400> off<00:03:23.820> when<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
here until the light goes off when the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.449 
here until the light goes off when the
light<00:03:24.900> goes<00:03:25.080> off<00:03:25.290> or<00:03:25.709> completely<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> end

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
light goes off or completely the end

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.850 
light goes off or completely the end
that<00:03:26.670> means<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.420> capacitor<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.140> charged

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
that means that the capacitor is charged

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.210 
that means that the capacitor is charged
so<00:03:29.239> let's<00:03:30.239> do<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:32.030> as<00:03:33.030> you<00:03:33.269> can<00:03:33.330> see<00:03:34.220> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
so let's do that as you can see the

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:44.730 
so let's do that as you can see the
light<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.580> on<00:03:36.980> it's<00:03:37.980> starting<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.370> go<00:03:38.459> down

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.220 

we<00:03:45.430> don't<00:03:45.670> have<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.940> go<00:03:46.030> complete<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.900> want<00:03:47.080> to

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
we don't have to go complete you want to

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.410 
we don't have to go complete you want to
go<00:03:47.350> completely<00:03:47.500> diem<00:03:48.100> do<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.820> see<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
go completely diem do you see it

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.390 
go completely diem do you see it
flashing<00:03:52.420> back<00:03:52.720> there<00:03:52.930> well<00:03:53.290> let<00:03:53.890> you<00:03:54.010> see<00:03:54.250> it

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
flashing back there well let you see it

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.460 
flashing back there well let you see it
or<00:03:54.670> not<00:03:54.760> but<00:03:54.820> let<00:03:55.780> me<00:03:55.840> see<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.140> blue<00:03:56.260> light

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
or not but let me see the blue light

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:05.260 
or not but let me see the blue light
flashing<00:03:57.870> means<00:03:58.870> it's<00:03:59.080> charging

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:15.080 

the<00:04:06.270> lot<00:04:06.450> hasn't<00:04:06.750> won<00:04:07.050> game<00:04:07.230> yet

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.979 

still<00:04:16.130> going<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.760> want<00:04:17.970> it<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.630> don't<00:04:18.720> have

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
still going you want it you don't have

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.569 
still going you want it you don't have
to<00:04:19.169> hold<00:04:19.320> it<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.829> air<00:04:19.919> until<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.400> goes

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
to hold it on the air until it goes

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.129 
to hold it on the air until it goes
completely<00:04:21.570> dim<00:04:22.560> but<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:23.790> do<00:04:23.880> that<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.600> way<00:04:24.780> I

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
completely dim but I do that that way I

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.960 
completely dim but I do that that way I
can<00:04:25.380> get<00:04:25.500> all<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.639> juice<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.180> can<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.840> it<00:04:27.960> thing

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
can get all the juice I can in it thing

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.620 
can get all the juice I can in it thing
you<00:04:29.970> know<00:04:30.090> it's<00:04:30.330> just<00:04:31.910> do<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:32.940> believe<00:04:33.240> it<00:04:33.450> has

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
you know it's just do you believe it has

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.280 
you know it's just do you believe it has
won<00:04:33.870> out<00:04:34.020> now<00:04:35.180> now<00:04:36.180> another<00:04:36.630> reason<00:04:36.900> for<00:04:37.050> doing

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
won out now now another reason for doing

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.750 
won out now now another reason for doing
this<00:04:37.470> is<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.800> way<00:04:37.950> when<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.190> put<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.490> fuse

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
this is that way when you put the fuse

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.990 
this is that way when you put the fuse
in<00:04:39.169> if<00:04:40.169> you<00:04:40.380> don't<00:04:40.770> see<00:04:41.010> no<00:04:41.070> sparks<00:04:41.520> because

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
in if you don't see no sparks because

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.240 
in if you don't see no sparks because
the<00:04:42.300> capacitor<00:04:42.780> has<00:04:42.870> got<00:04:43.169> it's<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.220> a

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
the capacitor has got it's like a

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.800 
the capacitor has got it's like a
battery<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.700> mean<00:04:44.850> it<00:04:44.940> holds<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.210> charge<00:04:46.220> but

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
battery I mean it holds the charge but

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.510 
battery I mean it holds the charge but
I'll<00:04:48.810> do<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.050> video<00:04:49.350> on<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.889> capacitor<00:04:50.370> itself

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
I'll do a video on the capacitor itself

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.430 
I'll do a video on the capacitor itself
and<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.030> reason<00:04:51.360> why<00:04:51.510> people<00:04:52.110> use<00:04:52.260> them

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
and the reason why people use them

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.710 
and the reason why people use them
anyway<00:04:53.280> is<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.550> Lots<00:04:53.729> completely<00:04:54.270> out

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
anyway is the Lots completely out

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:02.150 
anyway is the Lots completely out
now<00:04:55.020> let's<00:04:55.200> unhook<00:04:55.470> this<00:04:59.780> now<00:05:00.889> I'll<00:05:01.889> put<00:05:02.130> the

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
now let's unhook this now I'll put the

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.340 
now let's unhook this now I'll put the
fuse<00:05:02.760> in<00:05:02.790> as<00:05:03.389> you<00:05:03.540> notice<00:05:03.780> when<00:05:03.900> I<00:05:03.960> go<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.169> touch

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
fuse in as you notice when I go to touch

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.120 
fuse in as you notice when I go to touch
us<00:05:06.470> no<00:05:07.470> sparks<00:05:08.330> that's<00:05:09.330> a<00:05:09.450> good<00:05:09.630> thing<00:05:10.130> all

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
us no sparks that's a good thing all

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.710 
us no sparks that's a good thing all
right<00:05:11.780> hook<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.930> up<00:05:14.000> like<00:05:15.000> this<00:05:15.180> now<00:05:15.479> let's<00:05:15.630> go

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
right hook it up like this now let's go

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.350 
right hook it up like this now let's go
back<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.080> look<00:05:16.200> at<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.440> Pasteur<00:05:20.090> all<00:05:21.090> right

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
back and look at the Pasteur all right

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.700 
back and look at the Pasteur all right
now<00:05:22.110> with<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:23.280> vehicle<00:05:23.760> off<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:24.710> capacitor

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
now with the vehicle off the capacitor

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.890 
now with the vehicle off the capacitor
is<00:05:25.800> sitting<00:05:26.070> at<00:05:26.130> 12.1<00:05:29.479> there<00:05:30.479> you<00:05:30.570> have<00:05:30.750> it

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
is sitting at 12.1 there you have it

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.840 
is sitting at 12.1 there you have it
that's<00:05:31.140> how<00:05:31.289> you<00:05:31.380> charge<00:05:31.770> and<00:05:32.010> discharge<00:05:32.160> a

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
that's how you charge and discharge a

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.760 
that's how you charge and discharge a
capacitor<00:05:33.390> if<00:05:33.539> you<00:05:33.660> need<00:05:33.840> you<00:05:34.410> got<00:05:34.620> any
