into preseason drills battling to become
the<00:00:29.070> start<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:30.480> think<00:00:31.260> Jared<00:00:31.650> Barnett<00:00:32.270> really

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
the start I think Jared Barnett really

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.069 
the start I think Jared Barnett really
controls<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.730> other<00:00:35.880> 10<00:00:36.239> guys<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:36.809> he's<00:00:36.930> on

controls the other 10 guys when he's on
the<00:00:37.230> field<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.860> still<00:00:38.190> Jam<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the field I think still Jam has the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.000 
the field I think still Jam has the
ability<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.260> make<00:00:40.620> more<00:00:41.420> plays<00:00:42.800> because<00:00:43.800> of

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
ability to make more plays because of

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.880 
ability to make more plays because of
his<00:00:44.840> capability<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> then<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> ability<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
his capability and then the ability to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
his capability and then the ability to
improvise<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.120> run<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.050> think<00:00:49.110> all

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
improvise on the run and I think all

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.229 
improvise on the run and I think all
those<00:00:49.680> things<00:00:50.039> shows<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.789> both<00:00:51.030> those

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
those things shows with both those

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.799 
those things shows with both those
guides<00:00:51.620> our<00:00:52.620> football<00:00:53.430> team<00:00:53.690> recognizes<00:00:54.690> the

guides our football team recognizes the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.139 
guides our football team recognizes the
competition<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.680> think<00:00:55.890> everybody<00:00:56.370> sees<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.969> as

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
competition I think everybody sees it as

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.779 
competition I think everybody sees it as
something<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.199> healthy<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.980> then<00:00:59.579> we'll

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
something that's healthy and then we'll

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.029 
something that's healthy and then we'll
look<00:00:59.940> forward<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> August<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.230> what<00:01:01.829> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
look forward to August and what that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.219 
look forward to August and what that
