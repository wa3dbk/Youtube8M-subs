00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
was in my morning bushwalk when this

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.819 
was in my morning bushwalk when this
wild<00:03:19.720> animal<00:03:20.170> dropped<00:03:20.440> on<00:03:20.560> me<00:03:20.680> from

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
wild animal dropped on me from

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.830 
wild animal dropped on me from
absolutely<00:03:21.430> nowhere<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.209> started<00:03:22.690> to

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
absolutely nowhere and started to

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.199 
absolutely nowhere and started to
scratch<00:03:23.109> my<00:03:23.350> face<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:24.220> Murray<00:03:24.579> what<00:03:24.970> sort<00:03:25.180> of

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
scratch my face so Murray what sort of

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.690 
scratch my face so Murray what sort of
that<00:03:25.329> of<00:03:25.450> all<00:03:25.510> are<00:03:25.600> we<00:03:25.690> talking<00:03:26.019> about<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:27.190> can't

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
that of all are we talking about I can't

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.360 
that of all are we talking about I can't
say<00:03:27.910> exactly<00:03:28.030> there<00:03:28.720> but<00:03:29.290> I<00:03:29.319> think<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:30.040> was<00:03:30.190> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
say exactly there but I think it was a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.970 
say exactly there but I think it was a
kilometer<00:03:31.120> high<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:32.019> you<00:03:32.049> saw<00:03:32.290> your<00:03:32.500> Co<00:03:32.650> all<00:03:32.829> or

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
kilometer high so you saw your Co all or

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.970 
kilometer high so you saw your Co all or
attacked<00:03:33.310> you<00:03:33.489> yes<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.389> so<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:35.139> fact<00:03:35.380> that

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
attacked you yes I think so in fact that

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.069 
attacked you yes I think so in fact that
that<00:03:36.430> beasts<00:03:36.730> maybe<00:03:37.060> go<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.510> hospital

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
that beasts maybe go to the hospital

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.770 
that beasts maybe go to the hospital
where<00:03:38.230> I<00:03:38.260> have<00:03:38.530> has<00:03:38.739> 15<00:03:39.190> stitches<00:03:39.549> now<00:03:40.450> I<00:03:40.720> know

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
where I have has 15 stitches now I know

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.780 
where I have has 15 stitches now I know
this<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.350> how<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> believe<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.430> same

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
this is how to believe that the same

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.640 
this is how to believe that the same
thing<00:03:43.030> happened<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.450> a<00:03:43.569> relative<00:03:43.989> of<00:03:44.109> mine<00:03:44.260> far
