00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680 
hey I'm Colin and today I'm gonna show

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.070 
hey I'm Colin and today I'm gonna show
you<00:00:06.830> a<00:00:06.920> pretty<00:00:07.100> cool<00:00:07.279> reaction<00:00:07.840> right<00:00:08.840> here<00:00:08.900> in

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 
you a pretty cool reaction right here in

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.020 
you a pretty cool reaction right here in
my<00:00:09.200> hand<00:00:09.410> under<00:00:10.010> this<00:00:10.130> paper<00:00:10.340> towel<00:00:10.580> I<00:00:10.790> have<00:00:11.000> a

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
my hand under this paper towel I have a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.020 
my hand under this paper towel I have a
piece<00:00:11.629> of<00:00:11.839> elemental<00:00:12.469> sodium<00:00:12.679> a<00:00:13.129> metal<00:00:13.910> which

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
piece of elemental sodium a metal which

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.789 
piece of elemental sodium a metal which
is<00:00:14.059> extremely<00:00:14.509> reactive<00:00:14.749> and<00:00:15.139> in<00:00:15.200> weather<00:00:15.499> one

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
is extremely reactive and in weather one

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.890 
is extremely reactive and in weather one
of<00:00:15.889> my<00:00:16.010> other<00:00:16.100> videos<00:00:16.490> and<00:00:16.789> it's<00:00:17.510> pretty<00:00:17.690> cool

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
of my other videos and it's pretty cool

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.880 
of my other videos and it's pretty cool
because<00:00:18.020> if<00:00:18.170> you<00:00:18.230> throw<00:00:18.410> it<00:00:18.470> in<00:00:18.530> water<00:00:18.710> it'll

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
because if you throw it in water it'll

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.990 
because if you throw it in water it'll
explode<00:00:19.340> or<00:00:20.120> catch<00:00:20.300> on<00:00:20.450> fire<00:00:20.600> and<00:00:21.340> here<00:00:22.340> I<00:00:22.550> have

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
explode or catch on fire and here I have

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000 
explode or catch on fire and here I have
iodine<00:00:23.720> elemental<00:00:24.560> iodine<00:00:24.680> crystals<00:00:25.100> and<00:00:27.010> you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
iodine elemental iodine crystals and you

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.450 
iodine elemental iodine crystals and you
can<00:00:28.160> see<00:00:28.280> it's<00:00:28.400> a<00:00:28.460> purplish<00:00:28.880> gray

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:01:50.340 

nope

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.460 

the<00:01:50.830> blob<00:01:51.100> of<00:01:51.130> sodium<00:01:51.610> at<00:01:51.970> the<00:01:52.210> bottom<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:53.140> that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
the blob of sodium at the bottom is that

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:08.120 
the blob of sodium at the bottom is that
orange<00:01:53.800> hot

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:03:22.010 

it's<00:02:08.730> on<00:02:08.880> fire<00:02:09.120> from<00:02:09.390> iodine

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.960 

you

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.670 

okay<00:03:26.970> what<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.720> can<00:03:27.870> see<00:03:28.020> here<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
okay what you can see here is the

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.949 
okay what you can see here is the
remnants<00:03:29.069> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.250> reaction<00:03:29.730> in<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.420> center

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
remnants of the reaction in the center

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.940 
remnants of the reaction in the center
that<00:03:31.380> white<00:03:31.650> spot<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.130> there<00:03:32.420> that<00:03:33.420> is

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
that white spot we have there that is

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.059 
that white spot we have there that is
sodium<00:03:34.950> iodide<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:36.709> that's<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.920> chemical

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
sodium iodide and that's the chemical

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.820 
sodium iodide and that's the chemical
that<00:03:38.370> was<00:03:38.520> formed<00:03:39.150> from<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.330> reaction<00:03:39.830> around

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
that was formed from the reaction around

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.500 
that was formed from the reaction around
that<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.640> purple<00:03:42.860> most<00:03:43.860> we<00:03:44.069> have<00:03:44.100> is<00:03:44.640> wet

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
that the purple most we have is wet

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.590 
that the purple most we have is wet
iodine<00:03:46.080> so<00:03:46.860> when<00:03:47.730> I<00:03:47.760> drop<00:03:48.060> another<00:03:48.330> piece<00:03:48.569> of

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
iodine so when I drop another piece of

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.840 
iodine so when I drop another piece of
sodium<00:03:49.020> in<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:50.340> reaction<00:03:50.700> will<00:03:50.790> proceed

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
sodium in it the reaction will proceed

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.130 
sodium in it the reaction will proceed
very<00:03:51.300> very<00:03:51.600> quickly

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
very very quickly

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:19.129 
very very quickly
so<00:03:52.950> I'd<00:03:53.130> step<00:03:53.400> back<00:03:53.550> up

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.290 

turtle<00:04:21.949> by<00:04:22.949> increasing<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.520> contact<00:04:24.120> between

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
turtle by increasing the contact between

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.879 
turtle by increasing the contact between
the<00:04:24.479> two<00:04:24.659> chemicals<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:25.259> can<00:04:25.379> speed<00:04:25.650> up<00:04:25.770> the

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
the two chemicals I can speed up the

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.700 
the two chemicals I can speed up the
rate<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.280> reaction<00:04:27.199> although<00:04:28.199> this<00:04:28.319> is<00:04:28.530> a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
rate of the reaction although this is a

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.350 
rate of the reaction although this is a
little<00:04:28.949> bit<00:04:29.069> scary<00:04:29.400> because<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:29.819> could<00:04:29.969> get<00:04:30.120> a

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
little bit scary because we could get a

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:55.550 
little bit scary because we could get a
little<00:04:30.780> bit<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:30.990> splatter<00:04:31.229> here

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.390 

that<00:04:56.560> is<00:04:56.770> why<00:04:56.920> we<00:04:57.070> have<00:04:57.190> protective<00:04:57.640> equipment

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
that is why we have protective equipment

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.810 
that is why we have protective equipment
okay<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:02.080> white<00:05:02.260> top<00:05:02.530> you<00:05:02.710> saw<00:05:02.890> there<00:05:03.160> was

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
okay so the white top you saw there was

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.880 
okay so the white top you saw there was
the<00:05:04.120> vaporized<00:05:04.660> sodium<00:05:05.140> iodide<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.830> the

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
the vaporized sodium iodide and the

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.950 
the vaporized sodium iodide and the
salton<00:05:06.310> vaporized<00:05:08.190> and<00:05:09.840> probably<00:05:10.840> have<00:05:10.930> a

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
salton vaporized and probably have a

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.510 
salton vaporized and probably have a
little<00:05:11.200> bit<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.470> sodium<00:05:11.770> left<00:05:12.010> in<00:05:12.160> there<00:05:12.340> as

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
little bit of sodium left in there as

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.280 
little bit of sodium left in there as
well<00:05:12.760> as<00:05:12.850> a<00:05:12.880> little<00:05:13.120> bit<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.270> iodine<00:05:13.630> but

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
well as a little bit of iodine but

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
well as a little bit of iodine but
besides<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.680> it's<00:05:14.920> mostly<00:05:15.220> sodium<00:05:15.880> iodide

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
besides that it's mostly sodium iodide

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:25.380 
besides that it's mostly sodium iodide
and<00:05:18.310> water<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:24.610> heat<00:05:24.820> from<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.150> reaction

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
and water the heat from the reaction

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.950 
and water the heat from the reaction
it's<00:05:25.630> cracked<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:27.130> Pyrex<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:28.210> I<00:05:28.600> contained
