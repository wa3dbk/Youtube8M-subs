I've<00:02:00.899> never<00:02:01.439> visited<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.700> great<00:02:02.909> pyramid

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
I've never visited the great pyramid

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.510 
I've never visited the great pyramid
wouldn't<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.890> known<00:02:05.189> how<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.969> measure<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
wouldn't have known how to measure it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.470 
wouldn't have known how to measure it
if<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.850> had<00:02:08.649> so<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.679> hesitate<00:02:10.369> suggesting<00:02:11.270> that

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
if I had so I hesitate suggesting that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.510 
if I had so I hesitate suggesting that
there<00:02:12.200> may<00:02:12.410> be<00:02:12.440> another<00:02:13.010> ratio<00:02:13.870> involved

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
there may be another ratio involved

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.260 
there may be another ratio involved
however<00:02:16.959> experiments<00:02:17.959> with<00:02:18.620> scale<00:02:19.370> models<00:02:19.940> of
