00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
of start to track them at the very last

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.699 
of start to track them at the very last
minute<00:02:51.340> then<00:02:51.940> boom<00:02:52.709> essentially

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
minute then boom essentially

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.740 
minute then boom essentially
guaranteeing<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.549> you<00:02:54.850> hit<00:02:55.120> your<00:02:55.299> target

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
guaranteeing that you hit your target

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.020 
guaranteeing that you hit your target
and<00:02:55.840> pretty<00:02:56.380> much<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.739> right<00:02:56.980> here<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.310> going

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
and pretty much this right here is going

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.420 
and pretty much this right here is going
to<00:02:58.150> increase<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.049> duration<00:02:59.470> of<00:02:59.829> the<00:03:00.070> Nova

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
to increase the duration of the Nova

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.740 
to increase the duration of the Nova
bomb<00:03:00.609> so<00:03:00.880> that's<00:03:01.060> basically<00:03:01.239> going<00:03:01.690> to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
bomb so that's basically going to

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.059 
bomb so that's basically going to
increase<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.140> chances<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.620> possibly

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
increase the chances of you possibly

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.009 
increase the chances of you possibly
getting<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.430> post-mortem<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.390> also<00:03:04.750> increase

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
getting a post-mortem and also increase

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.870 
getting a post-mortem and also increase

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
the range of the axiom boat which is

axion<00:03:13.959> boat<00:03:14.109> as<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.440> would<00:03:14.530> see<00:03:14.709> here<00:03:14.950> because

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
axion boat as you would see here because

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.849 
axion boat as you would see here because
what<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:15.850> does<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.180> another<00:03:16.540> extra<00:03:17.019> axiom

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
what that does is another extra axiom

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.890 
what that does is another extra axiom
bullet<00:03:18.160> we<00:03:18.250> have<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.609> scan<00:03:18.850> three<00:03:19.030> players<00:03:19.269> but

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
bullet we have to scan three players but

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.860 
bullet we have to scan three players but
every<00:03:20.590> time<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:20.950> die<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.700> spawn<00:03:22.150> with

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
every time you die you spawn with

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.539 
every time you die you spawn with
grenade<00:03:23.350> energy<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:23.980> don't<00:03:24.130> have<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.400> wait

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
grenade energy so you don't have to wait

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.400 
grenade energy so you don't have to wait
for<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.730> cooldown<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:26.019> know<00:03:26.139> should<00:03:26.380> you

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
for the cooldown you know should you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.379 
for the cooldown you know should you
happen<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.889> die<00:03:27.069> so<00:03:27.579> this<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.880> perfect<00:03:28.090> because

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
happen to die so this is perfect because

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.090 
happen to die so this is perfect because
now<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.840> can<00:03:29.049> essentially<00:03:29.650> ignore

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
now you can essentially ignore

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.289 
now you can essentially ignore
discipline<00:03:30.579> because<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.819> won't<00:03:30.970> really<00:03:31.090> need

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
discipline because you won't really need

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.000 
discipline because you won't really need
it<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.690> know<00:03:31.810> now<00:03:32.230> I'm<00:03:32.319> not<00:03:32.380> saying<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:32.889> you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
it you know now I'm not saying that you

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.039 
it you know now I'm not saying that you
plan<00:03:33.400> on<00:03:33.579> dying<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.940> lot<00:03:34.120> but<00:03:34.510> if<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.690> happen<00:03:35.019> to

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
plan on dying a lot but if you happen to

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.720 
plan on dying a lot but if you happen to
die<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.709> don't<00:03:35.889> have<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.130> wait<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.340> cool

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
die you don't have to wait that cool

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:37.650 
die you don't have to wait that cool
down<00:03:36.880> I'm<00:03:36.970> pair<00:03:37.150> that<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.420> would<00:03:37.540> normally

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
down I'm pair that you would normally

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.809 
down I'm pair that you would normally
have<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.079> do<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.920> have<00:03:39.190> your<00:03:39.340> grenade<00:03:39.639> all

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
have to do and you have your grenade all

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.640 
have to do and you have your grenade all
the<00:03:40.209> jump<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:40.870> the<00:03:40.959> perfect<00:03:41.139> car<00:03:41.440> and

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
the jump so that's the perfect car and

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.410 
the jump so that's the perfect car and
it<00:03:41.739> goes

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
it goes

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.080 
it goes
Jacksonville<00:03:42.990> obviously<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.910> focus

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
Jacksonville obviously and you can focus

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.059 
Jacksonville obviously and you can focus
your<00:03:45.240> build<00:03:45.540> more<00:03:45.780> intellect<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.920> can

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
your build more intellect and you can

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.809 
your build more intellect and you can
focus<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.550> more<00:03:47.790> on<00:03:48.060> strength<00:03:48.980> now<00:03:49.980> i'm<00:03:50.370> going

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819
