00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 mathematics from Yekaterinburg it seems 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.519
 prepare a world sensation 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.990
 they learned how to deal with hurricanes 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.880
 Every year this natural disaster causes 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.340
 huge damage to people in different parts 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.460
 of light and now it is possible with 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.480
 the conclusion came the end unique 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 method studied Alexei Zakharov member 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.510
 Ural scientists decided to tame the wind 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.150
 if they succeed the element can 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.640
 will not only curb but any tornado 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.190
 can also become a cheap source 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.320
 electricity is a new way of dealing with 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:46.379
 tornado confirmed by experiments and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:48.390
 mathematical calculations multimeter 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.550
 a pillar of air and water is rapidly 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.219
 approaching the shore is gaining strength and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.980
 threatens to raise everything in the sky that seems 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.160
 his way inside ashore goes al-al 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 and these frames are shot right in the center 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.270
 death of the Annunciation rips the roof off 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.270
 houses and uprooting trees 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 every year tornadoes hurricanes and tornadoes 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.880
 arises from nowhere and in a few 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.759
 second korezhit destroy houses and cars 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.460
 sometimes kills people so early 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.070
 December a terrifying storm called 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.689
 Kasavir collapsed on Europe and claimed life 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.549
 10 people 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.759
 wind speed in the midst of a hurricane 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.920
 reached 130 kilometers per hour 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.689
 scientists have long learned to predict 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.420
 the occurrence of destructive eddies 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.100
 preoccupy with their power but with yourself 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 natural disasters so far 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.119
 cope failed death as in 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.810
 the distant past makes people 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.790
 flee and seek shelter 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.159
 it seems that we know about hurricanes all but 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.860
 any new elemental strike brings trouble and 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.479
 destruction is of course a problem with us 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 no weapons against the forces of nature 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.930
 so far meteorologists and climatologists everything 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.090
 peace of thought 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.940
 about how to overcome the element of the answer to this 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.470
 question and unexpectedly found 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.480
 Ekaterinburg mathematics using 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.759
 ordinary plastic pipe calculated 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.520
 force of turbulence at the surface of the earth and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.970
 determined exactly how hurricanes are gaining 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.330
 its terrifying power in such an upward 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.750
 the thread necessarily occurs twist 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.870
 which is here in this bottom part of the play 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.180
 if the pipe is 10 meters at the shooting 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.370
 will be great then we just get the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.860
 tornado which blows everything up 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.170
 paths according to mathematician sergey bautino 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.750
 dense air turbulence form 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.440
 something like walls if you work 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.940
 on a tornado from the outside, the tone will also lose its 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.580
 force if we 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.950
 twist here or here stop then we 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.900
 generally speaking let's make a move 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.800
 substantially less resistant and she 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.959
 will fall apart 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.880
 the most effective method of exposure 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.950
 On a tornado, Sergey Bautin calls 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.989
 the bombardment scientist suggests 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.130
 dump into the epicenter of a tornado charge and 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.739
 blast forces 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.900
 destroy air twist true 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.970
 what kind of ammunition is needed for 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.280
 such a operation the mathematician does not know yet 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.959
 he has already sent his calculations to Moscow and 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.690
 hope that after additional 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.950
 consultation with colleagues his idea 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.290
 will adopt 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.810
 so perhaps in the near future 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.630
 tornado hurricanes and tornadoes will 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.640
 destroyed as dangerous enemies on 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.640
 distant approaches to the houses of civilians
