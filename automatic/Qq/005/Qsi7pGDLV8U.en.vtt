the news that we're going to present
just<00:00:23.380> here<00:00:23.650> than<00:00:23.890> maybe<00:00:24.070> the<00:00:25.029> eye<00:00:25.060> scan<00:00:25.600> has

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
just here than maybe the eye scan has

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.580 
just here than maybe the eye scan has
been<00:00:26.470> used<00:00:26.770> for<00:00:26.980> quite<00:00:27.130> some<00:00:27.370> years<00:00:27.400> now<00:00:27.820> and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
been used for quite some years now and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.400 
been used for quite some years now and
nowadays<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.890> focus<00:00:30.250> goes<00:00:30.490> more<00:00:30.850> to<00:00:31.030> with

nowadays the focus goes more to with

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.799 
nowadays the focus goes more to with
archive<00:00:32.410> setups<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.239> therefore<00:00:34.239> we<00:00:34.600> have

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
archive setups and therefore we have

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.690 
archive setups and therefore we have
developed<00:00:35.559> in<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:35.830> past<00:00:36.070> already<00:00:36.370> quite<00:00:36.640> a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
developed in the past already quite a

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.900 
developed in the past already quite a
few<00:00:36.970> tools<00:00:37.180> that<00:00:37.500> allows<00:00:38.500> us<00:00:38.530> to<00:00:38.980> utilize<00:00:39.400> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
few tools that allows us to utilize the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.570 
few tools that allows us to utilize the
scanner<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.480> archive<00:00:40.900> material<00:00:41.470> so<00:00:42.129> besides

on<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.380> civilization<00:01:47.370> process<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.030> get<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
on the civilization process you get a

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.890 
on the civilization process you get a
histogram<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.770> tells<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.670> how<00:01:51.420> much<00:01:51.660> the

the image was too large we generate a

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.910 
the image was too large we generate a

well that we generate during the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.840 
well that we generate during the
scanning<00:03:20.880> is<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.630> can<00:03:21.780> actually<00:03:22.850> import

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
scanning is that you can actually import

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.570 
scanning is that you can actually import
the<00:03:24.180> information<00:03:24.410> into<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.860> Dustbuster

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
indication on where the images are that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.600 
indication on where the images are that
they'll<00:03:33.330> be<00:03:33.570> able<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.990> get<00:03:34.860> stabilized<00:03:35.340> during

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
they'll be able to get stabilized during

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.310 
they'll be able to get stabilized during
the<00:03:35.730> scan<00:03:36.030> so<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.690> just<00:03:36.960> skip

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
the scan so that you can just skip

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.220 
the scan so that you can just skip
through<00:03:37.560> those<00:03:38.490> positions<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.420> then<00:03:39.630> do<00:03:40.020> your
