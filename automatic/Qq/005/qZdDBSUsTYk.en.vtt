00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.980
 the pedro a púa looking at the girl until the theme 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.830
 today was chosen by our 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.470
 dear fans that brigh pound pound game 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.140
 fernando barbosa and many others then 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.330
 Let's talk today about the good old man. 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.279
 digimon digimon actually had more 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.109
 continuations that a panel is 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.250
 But let's talk only about the importance of 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.440
 the first digital version was released in 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.870
 1997 but you know where the idea came from 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.510
 of the drawing if you answered the ingestion 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.340
 Mushroom exaggeration of the sun is well 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.980
 plausible but not the idea came from 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.590
 damn tamagochi and if you stop for 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.690
 repairing the device looks very much like a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.539
 tamagochi that happened to be created by 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.370
 same girl who calls herself Maita I 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.020
 I bet that every tamagochi had a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.670
 hidden camera and every time you 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.829
 I would wake up at two in the morning to 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.710
 food for him this girl thought and 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.870
 stay another cup but like me 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 you should remember to see digimon in the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 globe you remember the music of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 The opening was sung by the angelic street. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540
 but then of course you remember the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.670
 super performance of her with a chat pose 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.100
 What is the song over the opening of the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.990
 Died poor angelica but had some 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.780
 things in the drawing that I never understood 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.450
 first what is that glasses for 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.090
 swimming on the team's forehead did not have a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.650
 only episode in which he used it 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.470
 is it that the person who runs the world was the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.810
 name of a water park I know 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.670
 contrary to all the drawings in the world 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.650
 do not dje mon the battles against bosses 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.899
 were much more practical for oposa said 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.780
 of chosen you asked me which 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.950
 But it's already an episode, my 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.320
 friend you are thinking of your break 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 global by chance but the tips of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.320
 evolutions also had a few things 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.020
 Weird 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.329
 a gale a giant dinosaur other 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.780
 I was a killer wolf but I wanted to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.420
 to draw attention to the more 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.759
 he was spanking he was spanking 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.380
 ugly to hell evolution of him was a 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.509
 cactus with inflatable doll face 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.000
 fucking massami miki ong mon and no 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.189
 consolation for the cold nights the tude 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.280
 the world but also delay the 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:21.430
 Demonstrate to take a long time 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.700
 About 30% of the episode is wrong for this. 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.700
 Do not take it there, I'll save you. 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.720
 There you go , now I'll go then he'll 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.879
 died and I do not think it took a 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.129
 A little bit not and you already 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.140
 They realized that the stronger was 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.069
 digimon plus his voice goes slow 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.150
 motion 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.370
 louboutin only vote if you change the badge 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.349
 video of them is the best but I think 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.599
 that Montevideo day a little mistake 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.879
 because you noticed that the 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.139
 2g mon voice is for woman 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.150
 knows that voice that the woman tried 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:00.879
 pre-natal or even go through 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.500
 regions is all wet and such reads more 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.659
 I think it might be that he's friends. 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.909
 of thammy gretchen and more seeing digimon 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.069
 it was also that I discovered that the robocop 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:11.889
 actually an angel because in fact 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.750
 this helmet does not deny we may have 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.329
 sure it's good to start tying today 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.129
 people until they blow everything up, and when 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.470
 you were little do you know any 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.930
 friend who could not green so that 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.910
 it was the capeta thing 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.799
 but why will not we read some 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.569

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:32.819

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.349
 digimon world playstation 1 era 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.359

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.359

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:49.629

 hand for a mere love that makes sense is 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.030
 a dinosaur to become a man 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.310
 giant on fire but this just was not 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.919
 more disappointing than not having a 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.810
 doll that transformed from the days of mons 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.629

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.970
