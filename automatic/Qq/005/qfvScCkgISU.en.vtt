00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
simplified but overall I really really

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.720 
simplified but overall I really really
like<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.090> overall<00:00:33.149> look<00:00:33.390> had<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.050> figure

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
like the overall look had this figure

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.889 
like the overall look had this figure
and<00:00:35.730> we've<00:00:35.910> got<00:00:36.030> some<00:00:36.149> really<00:00:36.270> nice<00:00:36.420> details

be kind of a quickie review in a way to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
be kind of a quickie review in a way to
transform<00:01:20.729> him<00:01:21.830> it's<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.340> the

camera I'm not ever gonna bother editing

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.630 
camera I'm not ever gonna bother editing
this<00:01:25.229> too<00:01:25.409> much<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
this too much because it's just a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.740 
this too much because it's just a
cyberverse<00:01:27.439> nobody<00:01:28.439> transforming<00:01:29.540> one<00:01:30.540> peg

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
cyberverse nobody transforming one peg

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.030 
cyberverse nobody transforming one peg
that<00:01:30.869> that's<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.290> be<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.470> weapon<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.770> robot

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
that that's gonna be as weapon in robot

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.090 
that that's gonna be as weapon in robot
obviously<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.470> then<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.680> do<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
obviously and then we're gonna do is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
obviously and then we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:35.220> gonna<00:01:35.280> try<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:35.970> gonna<00:01:36.119> angle

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
we're gonna try and just gonna angle

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.880 
we're gonna try and just gonna angle
this<00:01:36.869> down<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.409> peg<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.890> can

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
this down on peg that like that then can

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.780 
this down on peg that like that then can
I<00:01:40.950> grab<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:43.380> pull<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.070> I'll<00:01:44.729> show

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
I grab this that pull that out I'll show

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.060 
I grab this that pull that out I'll show
you<00:01:45.000> what<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.240> doesn't<00:01:45.450> open<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.409> like

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you what that doesn't open these up like

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.350 
you what that doesn't open these up like
that<00:01:47.270> can<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> lift<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.689> up<00:01:49.040> like<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.340> I'm<00:01:51.149> gonna

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that can I lift it up like so I'm gonna

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.350 
that can I lift it up like so I'm gonna
take<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.689> piece<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.229> fold<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.360> like

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
take this piece and fold it out like

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.289 
take this piece and fold it out like
that<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.869> these<00:01:55.380> pieces<00:01:55.619> rotate<00:01:56.130> up<00:01:56.399> like

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
that then these pieces rotate up like

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.209 
that then these pieces rotate up like
that<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:57.960> these<00:01:58.110> pieces<00:01:58.380> obviously

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
that and then these pieces obviously

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.620 
that and then these pieces obviously
these<00:01:59.670> gonna<00:01:59.790> be<00:01:59.880> his<00:02:00.000> forearms<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.479> they're

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
these gonna be his forearms so they're

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.510 
these gonna be his forearms so they're
gonna<00:02:00.719> rotate<00:02:00.899> down

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
gonna rotate down

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.760 
gonna rotate down
so<00:02:02.520> again<00:02:02.759> hurts<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> up<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:04.409> rotate<00:02:04.649> that

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
so again hurts that up and rotate that

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.719 
so again hurts that up and rotate that
down<00:02:05.030> like<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.530> then<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.590> gonna<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.099> we

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
down like that then I'm gonna do is we

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.430 
down like that then I'm gonna do is we
are<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.179> fold<00:02:09.720> these<00:02:09.869> piece<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> down

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
are going to fold these piece it down

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.730 
are going to fold these piece it down
double<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.489> head<00:02:11.670> grab<00:02:12.540> his<00:02:12.660> head<00:02:12.810> school

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
double the head grab his head school

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.130 
double the head grab his head school
now<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.090> there<00:02:15.330> are<00:02:15.360> two<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.660> pegs<00:02:15.930> now

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
now that there are two little pegs now

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.200 
now that there are two little pegs now
said<00:02:16.320> I'll<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.530> peg<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.820> I'm<00:02:17.910> gonna<00:02:18.000> do

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
said I'll just peg in that I'm gonna do

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.710 
said I'll just peg in that I'm gonna do
split<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.260> legs<00:02:19.850> fold<00:02:20.850> out<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.150> feet<00:02:21.360> here

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
split the legs fold out the feet here

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.810 
split the legs fold out the feet here
just<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.220> we're<00:02:23.400> gonna<00:02:23.490> rotate

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
just like that and we're gonna rotate

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.280 
just like that and we're gonna rotate
them<00:02:24.210> like<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:26.030> there<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.080> central<00:02:28.080> in

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
them like that and there is central in

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.820 
them like that and there is central in
his<00:02:28.980> robot<00:02:29.640> mode<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.810> really<00:02:31.230> do<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.650> this

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
his robot mode and I really do like this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.190 
his robot mode and I really do like this
robot<00:02:32.190> mode<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> little<00:02:33.420> figure<00:02:34.080> this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
robot mode for a little figure this

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.650 
robot mode for a little figure this
small<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.890> they<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.850> really<00:02:36.210> captured<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
small and they have really captured the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.390 
small and they have really captured the
look<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.080> sindelle<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:38.010> really<00:02:38.250> does<00:02:38.370> look

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
look of sindelle it really does look

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.020 
look of sindelle it really does look
cool<00:02:39.350> head<00:02:40.350> sculpt<00:02:40.770> obviously<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.760> fairly

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
cool head sculpt obviously is fairly

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.710 
cool head sculpt obviously is fairly
accurate<00:02:43.190> pretty<00:02:44.190> nice<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.670> do<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:46.280> a

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
accurate pretty nice I do like it a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.460 
accurate pretty nice I do like it a
little<00:02:48.720> bit<00:02:48.840> out<00:02:48.960> of<00:02:48.990> it<00:02:49.200> today

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
little bit out of it today

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.360 
little bit out of it today
and<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.520> stand<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.240> I'm<00:02:51.360> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.840> sick<00:02:52.370> I'm

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
really nice looking figure I really like

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.550 
really nice looking figure I really like
it<00:02:59.400> as<00:02:59.490> for<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.700> weapons<00:03:00.090> they<00:03:00.960> can<00:03:01.140> just<00:03:01.350> peg

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
it as for the weapons they can just peg

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.620 
it as for the weapons they can just peg
in<00:03:01.680> there<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.150> really<00:03:03.360> gotta<00:03:03.510> be<00:03:03.540> careful

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
in there and you really gotta be careful

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.300 
in there and you really gotta be careful
because<00:03:03.990> I've<00:03:04.290> already<00:03:04.410> seen<00:03:04.560> stretch<00:03:04.980> marks

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
because I've already seen stretch marks

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.270 
because I've already seen stretch marks
online<00:03:06.020> and<00:03:07.020> I've<00:03:07.170> seen<00:03:07.560> other<00:03:07.740> people's<00:03:08.100> do

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
online and I've seen other people's do

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.190 
online and I've seen other people's do
that<00:03:08.430> as<00:03:08.520> well<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.000> be<00:03:09.570> careful<00:03:09.930> when<00:03:10.020> you<00:03:10.080> put

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
that as well so be careful when you put

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.840 
that as well so be careful when you put
the<00:03:10.260> weapons<00:03:10.560> into<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:10.890> hands<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.610> that's

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
the weapons into the hands and that's

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.890 
the weapons into the hands and that's
for<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.090> piece<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.480> would<00:03:12.630> have<00:03:12.720> been<00:03:12.840> his

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
for this piece this would have been his

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.440 
for this piece this would have been his
hose<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.800> vehicle<00:03:14.070> mode<00:03:14.220> when<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:14.910> fold<00:03:15.360> this

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
hose and vehicle mode when I fold this

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.870 
hose and vehicle mode when I fold this
piece<00:03:15.630> out<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.860> then<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.040> can<00:03:17.160> rotate<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
piece out and then we can rotate the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.390 
piece out and then we can rotate the
hose<00:03:18.060> underneath<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.870> there<00:03:19.770> is<00:03:19.890> a<00:03:19.920> shield<00:03:20.220> I

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
hose underneath and there is a shield I

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.010 
hose underneath and there is a shield I
really<00:03:20.820> really<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.150> how<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.360> transforms

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
really really like how that transforms

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.110 
really really like how that transforms
that's<00:03:22.230> really<00:03:22.440> cool<00:03:22.880> then<00:03:23.880> I'm<00:03:23.940> just<00:03:24.000> gonna

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
that's really cool then I'm just gonna

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.260 
that's really cool then I'm just gonna
peg<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.750> his<00:03:24.840> hand<00:03:25.640> no<00:03:26.640> big<00:03:26.790> deal<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
peg that to his hand no big deal and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.480 
peg that to his hand no big deal and
they<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.290> Sentinel<00:03:28.650> Prime<00:03:28.860> for<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.220> shield

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
they have Sentinel Prime for the shield

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.780 
they have Sentinel Prime for the shield
and<00:03:29.820> his<00:03:29.970> sword<00:03:30.660> so<00:03:31.470> very<00:03:32.040> very<00:03:32.220> cool<00:03:32.400> looking

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
and his sword so very very cool looking

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.210 
and his sword so very very cool looking
I<00:03:33.110> really<00:03:34.110> really<00:03:34.620> like<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.860> look<00:03:34.980> at<00:03:35.130> this

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
I really really like the look at this

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.110 
I really really like the look at this
figure<00:03:35.460> now<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:36.630> terms<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.050> size<00:03:37.260> comparison

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
figure now in terms of a size comparison

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.160 
figure now in terms of a size comparison
here<00:03:39.120> he<00:03:39.210> is<00:03:39.300> next<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.570> reveal<00:03:39.960> the<00:03:40.050> shield

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
here he is next to reveal the shield

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.440 
here he is next to reveal the shield
windcharger<00:03:40.710> so<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.070> can<00:03:41.220> see<00:03:41.460> there<00:03:42.180> really

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
windcharger so you can see there really

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.780 
windcharger so you can see there really
isn't<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.930> big<00:03:43.170> size<00:03:43.500> difference<00:03:43.530> between<00:03:44.370> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
isn't a big size difference between the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.510 
isn't a big size difference between the
two<00:03:45.560> obviously<00:03:46.560> wind<00:03:46.740> charge<00:03:47.010> is<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> lot<00:03:47.340> more

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
two obviously wind charge is a lot more

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.600 
two obviously wind charge is a lot more
bulky<00:03:48.030> but<00:03:48.300> as<00:03:48.660> height<00:03:49.020> wise<00:03:49.430> sentinels<00:03:50.430> about

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
bulky but as height wise sentinels about

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.250 
bulky but as height wise sentinels about
the<00:03:50.700> same<00:03:50.880> size<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.300> scout<00:03:51.570> is<00:03:51.840> one<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.200> the

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
the same size as a scout is one of the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.730 
the same size as a scout is one of the
biggest<00:03:52.440> size<00:03:52.710> of<00:03:52.830> most<00:03:52.920> figures<00:03:54.200> so<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.620> know

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
biggest size of most figures so you know

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.170 
biggest size of most figures so you know
for<00:03:55.980> those<00:03:56.070> worried<00:03:56.370> about<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.640> size<00:03:56.820> they

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
for those worried about the size they

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.090 
for those worried about the size they
are<00:03:57.300> about<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.810> size<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:57.990> a<00:03:58.170> scale<00:03:58.470> or<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.740> small

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
are about the size of a scale or a small

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.730 
are about the size of a scale or a small
scout<00:03:59.430> so<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.900> know<00:04:00.990> that<00:04:01.170> that's<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.590> size

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
scout so you know that that's the size

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.880 
scout so you know that that's the size
comparison<00:04:02.130> just<00:04:02.490> so<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.670> can<00:04:02.790> see<00:04:03.890> for

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890

hip ball jointed knee and the feet can

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.130 
hip ball jointed knee and the feet can
pivot<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.359> wouldn't<00:04:21.630> recommend<00:04:21.900> it

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
pivot but I wouldn't recommend it

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.470 
pivot but I wouldn't recommend it
because<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.350> kind<00:04:22.680> of<00:04:22.910> there's<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.030> few<00:04:24.210> stress

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
because it kind of there's a few stress

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.700 
because it kind of there's a few stress
marks<00:04:24.840> down<00:04:24.960> there<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.380> wouldn't<00:04:25.620> really

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
marks down there so I wouldn't really

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.500 
marks down there so I wouldn't really
recommend

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
recommend

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.430 
recommend
but<00:04:27.510> you<00:04:27.630> know<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.870> is<00:04:27.990> about<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.410> for

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
but you know that is about it for

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.850 
but you know that is about it for
Sentinel<00:04:29.280> in<00:04:29.490> robot<00:04:29.850> mode<00:04:30.680> it's<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:31.830> a

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
Sentinel in robot mode it's just a

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.380 
Sentinel in robot mode it's just a
really<00:04:32.070> nice<00:04:32.220> little<00:04:32.400> figure<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.700> do<00:04:32.820> like<00:04:33.060> him

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
really nice little figure I do like him

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.420 
really nice little figure I do like him
and<00:04:33.870> let's<00:04:34.110> get<00:04:34.260> in<00:04:34.320> transform<00:04:34.740> back<00:04:34.950> since<00:04:35.280> we

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
and let's get in transform back since we

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.270 
and let's get in transform back since we
can<00:04:36.500> take<00:04:37.500> too<00:04:37.620> long<00:04:37.830> with<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.730> shield<00:04:40.010> on<00:04:41.010> peg

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
can take too long with the shield on peg

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.390 
can take too long with the shield on peg
this<00:04:41.930> back<00:04:42.930> section<00:04:43.640> follow<00:04:44.640> up<00:04:44.760> head<00:04:46.400> rotate

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
this back section follow up head rotate

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:56.230 
this back section follow up head rotate
these<00:04:48.270> around<00:04:48.890> like<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:53.660> okay<00:04:54.660> so<00:04:55.070> and<00:04:56.070> then

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
these around like that okay so and then

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.760 
these around like that okay so and then
gonna<00:04:57.240> rotate<00:04:57.480> off<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.170> side<00:04:58.380> like<00:04:58.790> that

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
gonna rotate off to the side like that

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:08.110 
gonna rotate off to the side like that
rotate<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.400> feet<00:05:02.730> around<00:05:03.560> flip<00:05:04.560> up<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:04.710> feet

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.370 

attach<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.270> legs<00:05:09.450> together<00:05:10.700> like<00:05:11.700> that<00:05:12.380> then

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
attach the legs together like that then

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.650 
attach the legs together like that then
kind<00:05:14.130> of<00:05:14.190> trying<00:05:14.730> to<00:05:14.850> try<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.270> get<00:05:15.390> this<00:05:15.450> other

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
kind of trying to try and get this other

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.070 
kind of trying to try and get this other
way<00:05:15.750> but<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.080> can<00:05:16.669> kind<00:05:17.669> of<00:05:17.700> fiddly<00:05:18.060> I'm<00:05:18.900> gonna

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
way but you can kind of fiddly I'm gonna

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.370 
way but you can kind of fiddly I'm gonna
try<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.470> angle<00:05:19.710> this<00:05:19.860> off<00:05:20.870> like<00:05:21.870> that<00:05:22.050> it's

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
try and angle this off like that it's

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.710 
try and angle this off like that it's
kind<00:05:22.530> of<00:05:22.560> fiddly<00:05:22.950> to<00:05:22.980> get<00:05:23.160> it<00:05:23.280> in<00:05:23.419> what<00:05:24.419> you<00:05:24.600> do

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
kind of fiddly to get it in what you do

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.760 
kind of fiddly to get it in what you do
and<00:05:25.080> it<00:05:25.260> goes<00:05:25.380> like<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:28.880> pegged<00:05:29.880> in<00:05:30.770> like

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
and it goes like that pegged in like

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.500 
and it goes like that pegged in like
that<00:05:33.290> take<00:05:34.290> these<00:05:34.440> pieces<00:05:34.620> and<00:05:35.240> this<00:05:36.240> will

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
that take these pieces and this will

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.940 
that take these pieces and this will
fold<00:05:37.050> up<00:05:37.380> like<00:05:38.090> that<00:05:39.090> when<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.330> take<00:05:39.510> a<00:05:39.570> shield

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
fold up like that when I take a shield

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.030 
fold up like that when I take a shield
put<00:05:40.950> this<00:05:41.040> up<00:05:41.310> rotate<00:05:42.090> that<00:05:42.180> around<00:05:42.410> and<00:05:43.410> this

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
put this up rotate that around and this

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.800 
put this up rotate that around and this
I'm<00:05:44.640> gonna<00:05:44.729> try<00:05:44.970> to<00:05:45.030> hold<00:05:45.180> that<00:05:45.270> in<00:05:45.479> there<00:05:45.630> for

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
I'm gonna try to hold that in there for

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.590 
I'm gonna try to hold that in there for
a<00:05:46.140> bit

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
a bit

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.909 
a bit
it's<00:05:48.600> kind<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.840> fiddly<00:05:49.140> to<00:05:49.169> get<00:05:49.380> a<00:05:49.410> shield<00:05:49.740> on

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
it's kind of fiddly to get a shield on

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.000 
it's kind of fiddly to get a shield on
properly<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:50.520> mean<00:05:50.880> I<00:05:50.940> kind<00:05:51.270> of<00:05:51.330> sit<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:51.960> there

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
properly I mean I kind of sit it there

00:05:52.010 --> 00:06:04.400 
properly I mean I kind of sit it there
and<00:05:53.360> try<00:05:54.360> and<00:05:54.390> peg<00:05:54.780> it<00:05:54.930> in<00:06:03.260> something's<00:06:04.260> gone

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
and try and peg it in something's gone

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.219 
and try and peg it in something's gone
wrong<00:06:04.470> there<00:06:05.400> there<00:06:05.729> we<00:06:05.790> go

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:06.229 
wrong there there we go

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.510 
wrong there there we go
take<00:06:07.229> that<00:06:07.350> in<00:06:07.530> and<00:06:08.490> take<00:06:08.760> the<00:06:09.050> sword<00:06:10.050> I<00:06:10.430> get<00:06:11.430> on

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
take that in and take the sword I get on

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.090 
take that in and take the sword I get on
there<00:06:11.700> and<00:06:12.260> they're<00:06:13.260> set<00:06:13.560> on<00:06:13.590> firing<00:06:13.890> back

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
there and they're set on firing back

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.550 
there and they're set on firing back
your<00:06:14.220> vehicle<00:06:14.400> mode<00:06:15.020> overall<00:06:16.020> I<00:06:16.050> really

your vehicle mode overall I really
really<00:06:16.860> like<00:06:16.979> the<00:06:17.100> look<00:06:17.250> of<00:06:17.640> this<00:06:17.790> figure<00:06:18.120> so

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
really like the look of this figure so
