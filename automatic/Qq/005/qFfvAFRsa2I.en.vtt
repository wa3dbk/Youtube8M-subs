00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
but look this is a 1960 model cylinder

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.550 
but look this is a 1960 model cylinder
head<00:04:25.700> look<00:04:26.700> at<00:04:26.910> that<00:04:27.150> lay<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.840> heart<00:04:28.169> shape

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
head look at that lay the heart shape

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.430 
head look at that lay the heart shape
that<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.580> carved<00:04:30.150> into<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.750> pulled<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.320> out

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
that I carved into it pulled it out

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.580 
that I carved into it pulled it out
lowered<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.400> got<00:04:32.550> out<00:04:32.760> of<00:04:32.790> it<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.330> mean<00:04:33.960> I'll

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
took some old iron input 2014 technology

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.520 
took some old iron input 2014 technology
into<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.729> cylinder<00:05:03.210> head<00:05:03.600> of<00:05:03.990> course<00:05:04.289> when<00:05:04.500> I

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530
