00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
understand why this is so much different

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.700 
understand why this is so much different
especially<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> look<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.530> those

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
terms and I think what we do as direct

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.820 
terms and I think what we do as direct
sellers<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.270> sort<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.649 
sellers is we sort of think we have to
have<00:01:25.979> this<00:01:26.189> certain<00:01:26.549> agenda<00:01:27.060> when<00:01:27.509> we're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
have this certain agenda when we're

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.289
