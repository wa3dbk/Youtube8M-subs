everytime would be to go for long layers
now<00:01:49.290> depending<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.369> how<00:01:50.430> long<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.299> want<00:01:51.479> your

shoulder length hair can kind of have
that<00:03:56.120> body<00:03:56.540> already<00:03:57.019> especially<00:03:57.409> if<00:03:57.829> it's<00:03:57.949> in

that body already especially if it's in
a<00:03:58.099> blunt<00:03:58.430> cut<00:03:58.729> which<00:03:58.970> means<00:03:59.239> it's<00:03:59.419> a<00:03:59.510> straight

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
a blunt cut which means it's a straight

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.679 
a blunt cut which means it's a straight
cut<00:04:00.260> then<00:04:00.979> it<00:04:01.280> can<00:04:01.489> kind<00:04:01.760> of<00:04:01.819> have<00:04:02.060> the<00:04:02.269> volume

00:04:02.679 --> 00:04:02.689 
cut then it can kind of have the volume

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:05.530 
cut then it can kind of have the volume
but<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.019> has<00:04:03.169> a<00:04:03.199> kind<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.590> triangular<00:04:04.250> shape<00:04:04.609> so

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
but it has a kind of triangular shape so

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.869 
but it has a kind of triangular shape so
you<00:04:05.599> want<00:04:06.109> to<00:04:06.229> kind<00:04:06.439> of<00:04:06.470> diffuse<00:04:06.949> that<00:04:07.310> by<00:04:07.579> kind

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
you want to kind of diffuse that by kind

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.319 
you want to kind of diffuse that by kind
of<00:04:07.970> having<00:04:08.389> a<00:04:08.629> more<00:04:09.340> downward<00:04:10.340> triangular

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
of having a more downward triangular

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.089 
of having a more downward triangular
shape<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.810> kind<00:04:12.049> of<00:04:12.109> make<00:04:12.319> your<00:04:12.530> hair<00:04:12.739> a<00:04:12.979> little

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
shape to kind of make your hair a little

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.180 
shape to kind of make your hair a little
bit<00:04:13.400> less<00:04:13.609> bulky<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:15.049> if<00:04:15.470> you<00:04:15.650> have<00:04:15.829> kind<00:04:16.099> of

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
bit less bulky so if you have kind of

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.759 
bit less bulky so if you have kind of
shorter<00:04:16.849> layers<00:04:17.509> round<00:04:17.930> your<00:04:18.109> face<00:04:18.349> and<00:04:18.680> I'm

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
shorter layers round your face and I'm

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.589 
shorter layers round your face and I'm
always<00:04:18.949> a<00:04:19.250> fan<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.549> shorter<00:04:20.030> lows<00:04:20.180> around<00:04:20.329> your

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
always a fan of shorter lows around your

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:21.759 
always a fan of shorter lows around your
face<00:04:20.779> because<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.169> think<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.529> just<00:04:21.650> really

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
face because I think it just really

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.660 
face because I think it just really
frames<00:04:22.279> your<00:04:22.520> face

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
frames your face

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.430 
frames your face
you<00:04:23.730> have<00:04:23.910> kind<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.240> shorter<00:04:24.720> layers<00:04:24.930> so

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
you have kind of shorter layers so

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.860 
you have kind of shorter layers so
something<00:04:25.860> like<00:04:25.890> this<00:04:26.220> like<00:04:26.940> round<00:04:27.300> your<00:04:27.600> face

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
something like this like round your face

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.500 
something like this like round your face
then<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.070> kind<00:04:29.250> of<00:04:29.280> really<00:04:29.520> softens<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.360> look

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
then it kind of really softens the look

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.120 
then it kind of really softens the look
and<00:04:30.840> if<00:04:31.230> you've<00:04:31.380> got<00:04:31.560> shoulder<00:04:31.890> length<00:04:32.010> hair

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
and if you've got shoulder length hair

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.460 
and if you've got shoulder length hair
you<00:04:32.430> know<00:04:32.550> you<00:04:32.610> can<00:04:32.850> kind<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.150> pin<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:33.900> up<00:04:34.080> like

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
you know you can kind of pin it up like

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.210 
you know you can kind of pin it up like
that

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
that

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.010 
that
and<00:04:35.310> that<00:04:35.760> kind<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.060> thing<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.540> just<00:04:36.570> have<00:04:36.840> the

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
and that kind of thing and just have the

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.350 
and that kind of thing and just have the
shorter<00:04:37.440> layers<00:04:37.620> kind<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.160> just<00:04:38.370> falling

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
shorter layers kind of just falling

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.140 
shorter layers kind of just falling
around<00:04:39.840> and<00:04:40.140> it's<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.350> very<00:04:40.590> soft<00:04:40.950> very<00:04:41.760> pretty

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
around and it's a very soft very pretty

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.670 
around and it's a very soft very pretty
sort<00:04:42.540> of<00:04:42.660> look<00:04:42.900> um<00:04:44.330> but<00:04:45.330> don't<00:04:45.930> let<00:04:46.290> the<00:04:46.470> layers

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
sort of look um but don't let the layers

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.400 
sort of look um but don't let the layers
start<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.730> high<00:04:48.000> up<00:04:48.240> because<00:04:48.540> then<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.110> can<00:04:49.260> be

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
start to high up because then it can be

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.020 
start to high up because then it can be
really<00:04:49.710> really<00:04:49.740> hot<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.250> grow<00:04:50.430> them<00:04:50.610> out<00:04:50.760> and

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
really really hot to grow them out and

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.550 
really really hot to grow them out and
when<00:04:51.180> they<00:04:51.270> get<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:51.630> that<00:04:51.780> kind<00:04:51.990> of<00:04:52.050> awkward

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
when they get to that kind of awkward

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.240 
when they get to that kind of awkward
there<00:04:53.250> and<00:04:53.810> stayed<00:04:54.810> which<00:04:55.110> is<00:04:55.260> what<00:04:55.440> I<00:04:55.470> had<00:04:55.800> it

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
there and stayed which is what I had it

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.760 
there and stayed which is what I had it
can<00:04:56.940> kind<00:04:57.420> of<00:04:57.570> look<00:04:57.780> a<00:04:57.840> little<00:04:58.050> bit<00:04:58.230> weird<00:04:58.470> and

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
can kind of look a little bit weird and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.620 
can kind of look a little bit weird and
they<00:04:58.920> can<00:04:59.160> kind<00:04:59.430> of<00:04:59.460> spring<00:05:00.000> up<00:05:00.150> all<00:05:00.330> over<00:05:00.360> the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
they can kind of spring up all over the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.440 
they can kind of spring up all over the
place<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:01.260> that's<00:05:01.500> not<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.800> good<00:05:02.010> idea<00:05:02.450> but

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
place and that's not a good idea but

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.160 
place and that's not a good idea but
like<00:05:03.750> I<00:05:03.930> said<00:05:03.990> with<00:05:04.560> my<00:05:04.590> hair<00:05:05.160> um

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
like I said with my hair um

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.380 
like I said with my hair um
it's<00:05:07.170> obviously<00:05:07.560> very<00:05:07.650> curly<00:05:08.220> but<00:05:09.000> it's<00:05:09.120> not

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
it's obviously very curly but it's not

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.420 
it's obviously very curly but it's not
ridiculously<00:05:10.140> thick<00:05:10.560> it's<00:05:10.800> actually<00:05:11.250> for

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
ridiculously thick it's actually for

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.160 
ridiculously thick it's actually for
curly<00:05:11.730> hair<00:05:11.760> quite<00:05:12.480> thin<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.830> um<00:05:14.810> going<00:05:15.810> for

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
curly hair quite thin so um going for

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.570 
curly hair quite thin so um going for
kind<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.440> layers<00:05:16.710> around<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.190> top<00:05:17.370> layer

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
kind of layers around the top layer

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.430 
kind of layers around the top layer
really<00:05:17.970> helps<00:05:18.300> create<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.870> kind<00:05:19.050> of<00:05:19.140> body

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
really helps create that kind of body

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.990 
really helps create that kind of body
that<00:05:20.250> that<00:05:20.820> kind<00:05:21.120> of<00:05:21.440> jusht<00:05:22.440> hair<00:05:23.010> which<00:05:23.430> curly

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
that that kind of jusht hair which curly

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.850 
that that kind of jusht hair which curly
hair<00:05:24.180> always<00:05:24.570> looks<00:05:24.870> much<00:05:25.350> better<00:05:25.590> for

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
hair always looks much better for

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.650 
hair always looks much better for
because<00:05:26.130> otherwise<00:05:26.370> your<00:05:26.760> hair<00:05:26.910> your<00:05:27.360> curls

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
because otherwise your hair your curls

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.350 
because otherwise your hair your curls
can<00:05:27.780> kind<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.080> stick<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.590> your<00:05:28.740> head<00:05:28.950> so<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:30.090> do<00:05:30.180> I
