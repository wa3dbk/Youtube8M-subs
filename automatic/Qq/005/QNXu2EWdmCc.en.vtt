00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
everything so we got a stable we have

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.970 
everything so we got a stable we have
an<00:02:12.970> archery<00:02:13.480> range<00:02:13.510> over<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.440> left<00:02:14.710> and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
an archery range over to the left and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.400 
an archery range over to the left and
you<00:02:15.820> can<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.390> know<00:02:16.420> practice<00:02:16.870> your<00:02:17.020> shooting

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
you can you know practice your shooting

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.290 
you can you know practice your shooting
the<00:02:17.560> only<00:02:17.830> problem<00:02:18.280> is<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.850> when<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.060> shoot

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the only problem is that when you shoot

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.660 
the only problem is that when you shoot
those<00:02:19.510> item<00:02:19.960> frames<00:02:20.230> they<00:02:20.740> disappear<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.400> you

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
those item frames they disappear so you

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.370 
those item frames they disappear so you
might<00:02:22.000> want<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.210> put<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.390> full<00:02:22.660> block<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.110> some

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
might want to put a full block and some

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.860 
might want to put a full block and some
fence<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.220> personally<00:02:24.850> I<00:02:24.880> prefer<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.420> item

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
fence but personally I prefer the item

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.320 
fence but personally I prefer the item
frame<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.440> looks<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.740> lot<00:02:26.890> nicer<00:02:27.040> so<00:02:27.760> let's

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
frame it looks a lot nicer so let's

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.420 
frame it looks a lot nicer so let's
remove<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.290> only<00:02:29.440> thing<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.860> did<00:02:30.040> not<00:02:30.220> add

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
remove that the only thing I did not add

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.930

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.479 
kind of explore a bit of a bench over
here<00:04:09.550> um<00:04:10.420> you<00:04:10.780> know<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.260> much<00:04:11.440> space<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:12.430> you

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
here um you know so much space so you

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.430 
here um you know so much space so you
know<00:04:12.820> you<00:04:12.880> can<00:04:13.000> have<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.209> Kings<00:04:13.570> quarters<00:04:13.870> you

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
first floor you might even be able to

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.800 
first floor you might even be able to
add<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.989> underground<00:04:20.650> dungeon<00:04:21.370> it's<00:04:22.210> very<00:04:22.479> very

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
add a underground dungeon it's very very

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.020 
add a underground dungeon it's very very
if<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.979> building<00:04:24.190> has<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.430> lot<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.669> potential

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
if this building has a lot of potential

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.490 
if this building has a lot of potential
in<00:04:25.390> my<00:04:25.630> opinion<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.110> think<00:04:26.169> it's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
in my opinion I think it's

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.190 
in my opinion I think it's
quite<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.650> nicer<00:04:27.130> keep<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:28.480> I<00:04:28.810> will<00:04:29.020> do<00:04:29.170> a

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
quite a nicer keep so I will do a

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.140 
quite a nicer keep so I will do a
tutorial<00:04:29.440> on<00:04:30.040> that<00:04:30.190> building<00:04:30.520> as<00:04:30.670> well<00:04:30.850> it's

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
tutorial on that building as well it's

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.600 
tutorial on that building as well it's
quite<00:04:31.420> a<00:04:31.450> big<00:04:31.750> one<00:04:31.930> so<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.680> might<00:04:33.100> have<00:04:33.130> to<00:04:33.280> split

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
quite a big one so I might have to split

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.250 
quite a big one so I might have to split
it<00:04:33.730> up<00:04:33.820> into<00:04:34.030> two<00:04:34.150> or<00:04:34.390> three<00:04:34.420> parts<00:04:34.930> kind<00:04:35.110> of

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
it up into two or three parts kind of

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.600 
it up into two or three parts kind of
depends<00:04:35.620> how<00:04:35.710> long<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:36.370> will<00:04:36.520> take<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.790> build

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
depends how long it will take to build

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.390 
depends how long it will take to build
and<00:04:39.610> then<00:04:40.390> finally<00:04:40.900> we<00:04:41.170> have<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.680> new<00:04:42.040> house

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
and then finally we have the new house

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.700 
and then finally we have the new house
design<00:04:42.640> which<00:04:43.300> actually<00:04:43.780> started<00:04:44.200> out<00:04:44.320> as<00:04:44.470> a

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
design which actually started out as a

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.010 
design which actually started out as a
two<00:04:44.770> floor<00:04:45.250> building<00:04:45.460> but<00:04:45.760> it<00:04:45.850> looks<00:04:46.000> so<00:04:46.390> weird

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
two floor building but it looks so weird

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.280 
two floor building but it looks so weird
and<00:04:47.470> then<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.860> added<00:04:48.070> this<00:04:48.340> top<00:04:48.670> open-air<00:04:49.480> kind

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
and then I added this top open-air kind

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.220 
and then I added this top open-air kind
of<00:04:50.410> storage<00:04:50.710> place<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.390> kind<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.020> came

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
of storage place and I just kind of came

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.800 
of storage place and I just kind of came
alive<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.830> looks<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.070> lot<00:04:54.190> nicer<00:04:54.570> again<00:04:55.570> this<00:04:55.690> is

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
alive it looks a lot nicer again this is

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.210 
alive it looks a lot nicer again this is
actually<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.140> same<00:04:56.350> building<00:04:56.770> as<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.070> one

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
actually the same building as the one

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.920 
actually the same building as the one
that's<00:04:57.430> in<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.610> barracks<00:04:58.060> but<00:04:58.510> you<00:04:58.600> can<00:04:58.750> use

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
that's in the barracks but you can use

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.140 
that's in the barracks but you can use
this<00:04:59.080> style<00:04:59.380> to<00:04:59.590> expand<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.250> it<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.580> you<00:05:01.030> know

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
this style to expand on it and you know

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.909 
this style to expand on it and you know
you<00:05:01.210> can<00:05:01.480> use<00:05:01.630> different<00:05:01.900> designs<00:05:02.410> and<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.800> will

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
you can use different designs and I will

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.420 
you can use different designs and I will
do<00:05:03.130> tutorial<00:05:03.790> videos<00:05:04.120> on<00:05:04.300> these<00:05:04.870> buildings
