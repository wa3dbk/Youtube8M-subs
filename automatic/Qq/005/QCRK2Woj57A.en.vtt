00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040
 hello this matter space flavor sangria 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.280
 where there is always something interesting to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.280
 you 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.540
 to correctly choose some lenses 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.119
 that fit your face type 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.910
 this is the golden rule choose ones that 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.430
 go against your face shape if 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.310
 is angled or with defined lines you choose 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.150
 rounded ones with smooth curves if 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.390
 Conversely 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.070
 is of rounded curves choose ones with 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.960
 more edges 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.540
 The size of the telescope is directly 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.760
 proportional to the size of the body and 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.710
 not only with the face by 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.750
 example if you are short eyeglasses 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.370
 They should be rather boys to 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.040
 there is some harmony with the rest of the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.190
 body and if you are high it will be the opposite 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.500
 if you choose rectangular it is best to choose 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.989
 square frames that cover the height of 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.940
 face and deep colors because 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.310
 minimize attention on how to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.620
 the face 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.600
 If your face is square, they are 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.300
 advisable rounded lenses u 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.240
 ovals and frames that soften the shape 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.880
 eye rounded but not round 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.549
 with triangular face with well in lenses 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.210
 of square and round shape and frames 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.940
 wide and thick 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.280
 for the round face the glasses that 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.710
 They are better with curves 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.050
 natural and that tend to form more 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.940
 square that a circle must be avoided 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.479
 those that are totally straight or with 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.580
 edges for the diamond type face like 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.649
 you have pronounced cheekbones and the 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.140
 front and narrow the chin 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.750
 lenses that are going to favor you are the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.050
 ovals now well for the lucky ones 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.000
 that have an oval face can 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.509
 experiment with different styles and 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.820
 sizes in general all the lenses 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.680
 it is going well 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.870
