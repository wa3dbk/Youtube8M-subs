Casey<00:01:29.850> was<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.439> student<00:01:32.130> at<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:35.100> school

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
Casey was not a student at the school

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
Casey was not a student at the school
that<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:38.100> range<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.210> Rangers<00:01:40.130> were

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
that the range the other Rangers were

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
that the range the other Rangers were
Todd<00:01:41.850> had<00:01:42.119> he<00:01:42.570> was<00:01:42.689> actually<00:01:43.110> more<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.530> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
Todd had he was actually more like a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.450 
Todd had he was actually more like a
cowboy<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.729> servant<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.130> proves

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
cowboy a servant so it kind of proves

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.230 
cowboy a servant so it kind of proves
that<00:01:48.270> even<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.829> person<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.460> seems<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that even the person that seems the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.639 
that even the person that seems the
weakest<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.040> strongest<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
weakest can be the strongest so this

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.959 
weakest can be the strongest so this
episode<00:01:56.090> kind<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.500> makes<00:01:58.500> me<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:59.369> think<00:01:59.640> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
episode kind of makes me you think that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.280 
episode kind of makes me you think that
you<00:02:00.840> don't<00:02:01.020> need<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.430> best<00:02:03.079> you<00:02:04.079> don't

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
you don't need to be the best you don't

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.010 
you don't need to be the best you don't
have<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.890> seem<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.430> best<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:07.229> be<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.250> best

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
have to seem the best to be the best

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.330

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
the all early seasons of Power Rangers

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.440
