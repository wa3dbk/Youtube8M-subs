00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.870 
in a sense this can be true if you
always<00:01:27.750> utilize<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> belt<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.920> gym<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
always utilize a belt in a gym all the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
always utilize a belt in a gym all the
time<00:01:30.329> whenever<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:30.810> any<00:01:30.960> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.259> lift

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
time whenever you do any kind of lift

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
time whenever you do any kind of lift
sometimes<00:01:32.400> people<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:32.909> then

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
sometimes people will then

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.880 
sometimes people will then
overcompensate<00:01:33.990> when<00:01:34.170> they're<00:01:34.290> not<00:01:34.500> wearing

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
overcompensate when they're not wearing

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249 
overcompensate when they're not wearing
a<00:01:34.979> belt<00:01:35.220> or<00:01:35.450> because<00:01:36.450> they're<00:01:36.659> wearing<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> belt

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a belt or because they're wearing a belt

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.719 
a belt or because they're wearing a belt
they<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:37.799> they<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.040> go<00:01:38.189> ahead<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.579> have

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
they think they can go ahead and have

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.760 
they think they can go ahead and have
bad<00:01:39.030> form<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> belt<00:01:40.110> will<00:01:40.259> compensate

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
bad form and the belt will compensate

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.620 
bad form and the belt will compensate
and<00:01:40.920> take<00:01:41.100> care<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.640> which<00:01:42.119> definitely

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and take care of that which definitely

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.569 
and take care of that which definitely
isn't<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:42.990> case<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.530> several<00:01:44.250> studies

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
isn't the case in several studies

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.920 
isn't the case in several studies
there's<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:45.180> been<00:01:45.329> shown<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.810> people

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
there's actually been shown that people

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.530 
there's actually been shown that people
that<00:01:46.170> wear<00:01:46.320> belts<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.920> hurt<00:01:47.189> more<00:01:47.430> often<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that wear belts get hurt more often so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
that wear belts get hurt more often so
if<00:01:48.899> you're<00:01:49.290> wearing<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.710> belt<00:01:49.890> because<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
if you're wearing a belt because you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.859 
if you're wearing a belt because you
think<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.880> compensate<00:01:51.240> for<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.600> bad

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
think you can compensate for your bad

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.510 
think you can compensate for your bad
form<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.409> allow<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.770> guy<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.220> things

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
form and allow you to guy to do things

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.550 
form and allow you to guy to do things
differently<00:01:54.000> I<00:01:54.299> wouldn't<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.140> go<00:01:55.380> that

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
differently I wouldn't really go that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.870 
differently I wouldn't really go that
route<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:56.040> you're<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.490> putting<00:01:56.790> yourself

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
route as you're really putting yourself

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.749 
route as you're really putting yourself
at<00:01:57.240> risk<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.600> injury<00:01:58.079> also<00:01:58.829> what<00:01:59.369> you'll<00:01:59.520> find

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
at risk for injury also what you'll find

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.520 
at risk for injury also what you'll find
is<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.479> studies<00:02:00.750> done<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.200> people<00:02:01.439> who

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
is there are studies done for people who

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.170 
is there are studies done for people who
wear<00:02:01.680> belts<00:02:02.100> as<00:02:02.219> part<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> their<00:02:02.640> work<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
wear belts as part of their work so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.420 
wear belts as part of their work so
people<00:02:03.390> who<00:02:03.600> do<00:02:03.750> manual<00:02:04.200> labor<00:02:04.439> they<00:02:05.100> found

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
people who do manual labor they found

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
people who do manual labor they found
that<00:02:05.579> they<00:02:05.729> often<00:02:05.969> got<00:02:06.240> injured<00:02:06.659> outside<00:02:06.930> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that they often got injured outside of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.770 
that they often got injured outside of
work<00:02:07.829> because<00:02:08.369> again<00:02:08.700> they're<00:02:09.270> used<00:02:09.629> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
work because again they're used to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420 
work because again they're used to
having<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.170> belt<00:02:10.379> there<00:02:10.590> for<00:02:10.860> protection

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
having a belt there for protection

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.500 
having a belt there for protection
they're<00:02:11.610> used<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.879> doing<00:02:12.030> things<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.480> certain

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
they're used to doing things a certain

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.449 
they're used to doing things a certain
way<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.930> your<00:02:13.170> body<00:02:13.439> will<00:02:13.620> adapt<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.010> wearing

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
way and your body will adapt to wearing

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.250 
way and your body will adapt to wearing
that<00:02:14.579> belt<00:02:14.819> then<00:02:15.510> when<00:02:15.689> you<00:02:15.780> take<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:16.200> away

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that belt then when you take that away

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.410 
that belt then when you take that away
and<00:02:16.829> try<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.129> do<00:02:17.340> things<00:02:17.519> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.909> same<00:02:18.090> fashion

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
and try to do things in the same fashion

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.869 
and try to do things in the same fashion
you<00:02:18.810> really<00:02:19.439> can<00:02:19.650> potentially<00:02:20.099> get<00:02:20.340> hurt

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
you really can potentially get hurt

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.000 
you really can potentially get hurt
so<00:02:21.180> as<00:02:21.329> far<00:02:21.510> as<00:02:21.569> belts<00:02:21.959> go<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.140> do<00:02:22.349> believe<00:02:22.829> they

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
so as far as belts go I do believe they

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.100 
so as far as belts go I do believe they
can<00:02:23.189> be<00:02:23.310> beneficial<00:02:23.579> however<00:02:24.540> they<00:02:24.750> must<00:02:24.930> be

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
can be beneficial however they must be

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.110 
can be beneficial however they must be
used<00:02:25.349> accordingly<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.730> me<00:02:26.879> what<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
used accordingly and to me what that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.460 
used accordingly and to me what that
means<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.659> when<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.019> doing<00:02:28.200> extremely

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
means is when you're doing extremely

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.490 
means is when you're doing extremely
heavy<00:02:29.220> weights<00:02:29.549> for<00:02:29.790> low<00:02:30.000> reps<00:02:30.299> or<00:02:30.540> maxing<00:02:31.379> out

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
heavy weights for low reps or maxing out

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.020 
heavy weights for low reps or maxing out
or<00:02:31.829> doing<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.220> power<00:02:32.459> lifting<00:02:32.790> type

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
or doing a power lifting type

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.210

competition they can really help you out
in<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.489> sense<00:02:35.819> however<00:02:36.480> if<00:02:36.900> you're<00:02:37.049> going

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
in this sense however if you're going

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.679 
in this sense however if you're going
and<00:02:37.439> training<00:02:37.799> with<00:02:37.980> very<00:02:38.340> high<00:02:38.670> reps<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.359> low

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
and training with very high reps and low

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.330 
and training with very high reps and low
weights<00:02:39.959> they're<00:02:40.530> not<00:02:40.739> going<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.129> much

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
weights they're not going to be a much

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.009 
weights they're not going to be a much
benefit<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.299> you<00:02:42.450> could<00:02:42.659> potentially

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
benefit to you and you could potentially

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.960 
benefit to you and you could potentially
get<00:02:43.409> injured<00:02:43.620> from<00:02:44.040> them<00:02:44.220> what<00:02:44.639> they<00:02:44.760> also

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
get injured from them what they also

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.119 
get injured from them what they also
aren't<00:02:45.359> meant<00:02:45.569> to<00:02:45.659> do<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:45.989> correct<00:02:46.409> bad<00:02:46.680> form

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
aren't meant to do is correct bad form

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.039 
aren't meant to do is correct bad form
so<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.760> still<00:02:48.120> need<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.359> get<00:02:48.510> your<00:02:48.629> form<00:02:48.989> right

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
so you still need to get your form right

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.050 
so you still need to get your form right
