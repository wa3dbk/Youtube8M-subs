00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.839
 [musics] 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.820
 Well then 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.700
 You are far from me 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:18.940
 I'm certain that a good way if a lot of it Well this time that 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.260
 Simple but important things are in 3 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.170
 I'll do it 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.850
 First of all the first step is yes 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.580
 Parent It is delicious 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.620
 I this go this heaven especially say to the back 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:39.470
 When you go to the bar please go well 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:43.220
 The reason is that the person who wears this back gets strong teeth 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.970
 So the bar fits the bone like this 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.050
 Because I do various things 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.100
 The leaves are multiplied by the number and not strong 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 Well then I will do it 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.149
 The angle is this 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.940
 Most people do this but this is a mistake 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.320
 This is 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.320
 So 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.350
 At first this much 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 Stroke 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.180
 So please press firmly 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.180
 Strong good 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:23.380
 The face of this unity when using it and the back is absolutely straight 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.380
 Please do not do the character five 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.390
 Is 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.070
 And if you look at cola, there is a lot, but it is fine if it has this line firmly 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.939
 Chinami This investment is 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.939
 It is No. 300 in the rough in the next 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.160
 You can use Nakato lathe 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.160
 The same thing with 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:21.980
 So in the end 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.980
 This is the finish 8000 but it is the same thing again 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.650
 So that 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.159
 I will not do this when I call the back 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.159
 Here 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.090
 So I will start to put some leaves when the back end is over 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.940
 So that sometimes Well usually 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.990
 If but it's such a lathe with in this 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.160
 It is 3 million if I have such a new 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.610
 Since it is kana absolute Iran 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.610
 If you have one , please start from this way 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.490
 Time of sharpening is completely different 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.560
 So 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.970
 Well this is the core to match this secret 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.519
 So 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.100
 Bring your finger here 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.990
 Put this force when you go on in 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.720
 If you go down, let's go over a little 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:32.240
 The other important thing is the finger 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.750
 It is to go in order like this 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.750
 If it is public and Muto here is not absolutely here 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.500
 So more than speed 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:52.560
 I don't mind at this speed 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.680
 Put stress on this finger 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.740
 so 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.940
 In this way 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.990
 move 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.990
 This is the point 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:17.540
 At the same time sharpening the Akono angle along with a left finger taken along with the thumb of the right in here and here 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:25.390
 I'm from the date you want to go on at 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.390
 At this time, it is not possible to go with the brace with this left finger alone 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.980
 Well, until this trip or until a burger comes out 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.980
 So we 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:49.050
 Also Well 3 minutes when you're in this kind of question 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.050
 Please press Ginoura about the floor 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:03.040
 In Fu the teeth like this even when leaving far to say this 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:07.570
 Absolutely in when there was far do you have to you have bent Then this floating 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:11.400
 The leaves do not hit on the investment so 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:19.280
 Let's go back to one in three minutes 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:19.280
 This became the teeth of Toko to do about 15 minutes will also return to the original we have hit still 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.509
 Do this work 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.509
 Nakato 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.270
 then 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.270
 And then in the stomach finish
