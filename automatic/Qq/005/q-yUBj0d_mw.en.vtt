you know believe it or not gonna get it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.320 
you know believe it or not gonna get it
on<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.229> track<00:02:09.500> do<00:02:09.979> some<00:02:10.160> Auto<00:02:10.340> crossing<00:02:10.940> they

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
on the track do some Auto crossing they

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.530 
on the track do some Auto crossing they
have<00:02:11.450> speed<00:02:11.780> stop<00:02:12.110> they<00:02:12.530> have<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.650> show<00:02:13.540> section

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540

have speed stop they have a show section
of<00:02:14.660> that<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.840> think<00:02:14.990> five<00:02:15.170> different<00:02:15.230> events<00:02:16.040> so

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
of that I think five different events so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:39.290 
of that I think five different events so
really<00:02:16.670> looking<00:02:16.940> forward<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.300> seeing<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.000 

the<00:02:40.300> car<00:02:40.540> turned<00:02:40.810> out<00:02:41.050> here<00:02:41.380> at<00:02:41.590> eleven

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
the car turned out here at eleven

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.670 
the car turned out here at eleven
hundred<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.340> fifty<00:02:42.730> pounds<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.300> putting<00:02:43.720> 150

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
hundred and fifty pounds and putting 150

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.650 
hundred and fifty pounds and putting 150
horsepower<00:02:44.950> down<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.610> ground<00:02:45.880> although

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
horsepower down on the ground although

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.210 
horsepower down on the ground although
we<00:02:46.900> haven't<00:02:47.170> got<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.350> really<00:02:47.590> play<00:02:47.830> with<00:02:47.860> it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
we haven't got to really play with it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.800 
we haven't got to really play with it
which<00:02:48.490> we'll<00:02:48.670> get<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.820> do<00:02:49.000> next<00:02:49.330> week

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
which we'll get to do next week

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.420 
which we'll get to do next week
I<00:02:49.840> think<00:02:50.260> things<00:02:50.590> just<00:02:50.680> going<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:50.980> put<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.190> smile

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
I think things just going to put a smile

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.910 
I think things just going to put a smile
on<00:02:51.460> their<00:02:51.700> face
