00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.639
 and well today we had a duel 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.400
 cardiac go that between ivory coast 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.380
 and they grabbed very well I 'm the first 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.570
 time he passes to Greece to the round of 16 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.640
 in the history of a world cup I 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.700
 I ask for a just triumph of Greece 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.649
 with a penalty in his hands is difficult to 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.939
 talk about justice the result is the 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.939
 that marks the fate of the teams 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.190
 greece had the van learning teacher 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.190
 little bit 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.180
 I got tired of talking about the lack of 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.590
 concentration of the innocence of the 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.840
 lack of responsibility in some 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.540
 moment of the African coast teams 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.220
 of ivory once more gives me the reason two 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.450
 blunders one in the first 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.950
 time that allows the opening of the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.300
 marker for greece that had 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.300
 shown as throughout the tournament 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.950
 apathetic mobitv with sporadic attacks 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.690
 very disconnected with a lot of mass that 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.800
 they run tighten but in what is 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.600
 from midfield to forward they have 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.910
 seen very very disconnected always a 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.190
 little of samaras the front center of the 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.780
 celtic some fake salt and very little is 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.800
 wrong in the output lose a value 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.100
 the 1-0 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.300
 ivory coast goes with all the attack 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.340
 his offensive men we know they are 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.070
 dangerous today played drug start 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.940
 salomon with gervinho on the left yaya 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.200
 I toured arriving from the bottom 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.090
 they pushed the whole party until 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.040
 they get the pate on a play 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.020
 combined in offensive of the one that had 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.880
 graduated bony however in the last 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.830
 minute in the last play of the match 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.150
 with classified ivory coast and already 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.670
 thinking who was going to be his next 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.470
 rival commit a very childish fault in 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.050
 the area that the celtic player 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.360
 sÃ¡maras defines with a lot of classics 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.910
 a lot of security or greece is 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.340
 already in eighths fair or not today the team 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.740
 greek went from phase iii where we have 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.780
 to observe as we talk about what 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.740
 uruguay italy and all teams 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.630
 when they are fans they are 90 minutes as is 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.730
 possible that a ball of that 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.620
 area when they had won the 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.210
 match he wins the tie he wore 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.490
 for that ball appeared then of some 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.190
 place because there was not pressed I say are 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.050
 things that apparently did not understand 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.540
 party management I do not think talking 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.130
 Speaking of justice is just what 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.080
 they make the two goals clear 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.239
 so if we had to do a 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.270
 analysis we would think and well who played 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.610
 better or who football nicest or how much 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.320
 who had a better position that we could 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.060
 say statistics are shipped all 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.450
 this kind of thing but at the end of 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.000
 accounts wins the one that gets the most goals and that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.880
 He is justly deserving of the effort 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.530
 for the intention to always be 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.270
 struggling to score a goal at best 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.840
 It has so much quality 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.450
 not so often comes usa 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.940
 came in the first match against the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.200
 African team and won at the end of 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.420
 accounts and the other team was 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.400
 coming and so many have come 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.650
 encounters will not possibly throw you 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.990
 many times this has been done to italy 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.110
 this type of questioning will 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.240
 Uruguay but win they win and they are teams 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.550
 in the end they are all world champions 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.950
 these have been given are have been champions 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.860
 of the world and you have to give that value 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.380
 because it is a value that really something 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.510
 they do so well that they continue to do us 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.520
 to date we have in mind that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.490
 greece I will face now until rum 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.620
 costa rica and the winner of that key in 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.540
 a future could face if mexico 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.920
 is lucky to overtake Holland with 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.220
 the team excelled very well to costa rica 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.190
 a rival with like greece or would have 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.690
 cost less against ivory coast 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.580
 accessible to greece I feel that it has more 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.260
 conditions and is more purposeful despite 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.480
 of these flaws that they have and are 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.730
 innocence is the object of lack of 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.110
 commitment of some players but 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.040
 Ivory Coast is a more solid equipment 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:11.989
 with more unbalancing players but 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:14.180
 the increase that greece earned him is 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.669
 because you are more compact and more 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.070
 accustomed to those to those trajines 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:25.040
 Europeans and players put 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:27.260
 different businesses at the expense of ivory is 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.600
 something that usually makes it arrive 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.820
 a lot and it fails a lot or is it good 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.090
 football has very skillful elements very 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.740
 able and then fails the same then 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.050
 Greece is a team that we have seen 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.450
 over the years is a team that knows 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.960
 stop very well closes perfectly 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:53.289
 well they hardly hurt him 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:53.289
 and now if greece is still like that 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.970
 but colombia beat Greece 3 a 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.039
 0 when with certain as already in some 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.449
 passages to me greece I get a 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.630
 very cute team has two good 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:10.610
 central and the others accompany all the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.470
 possibility then but go through 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.300
 first time in its history how much to what 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:17.330
 what I was referring to is that Greece will be 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.310
 more complicated for Costa Rica than other 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.590
 team that wants to attack because Costa 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.770
 rich is doing well with his five line 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.490
 back with his and he plays very well in that 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.530
 sector 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.509
 Greece is not going to deliver as they have 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.360
 made the other equipment and has caused 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.430
 those spaces that ultimately he has 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.320
 capitalized very well the coast team 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.010
 rich but here the importance is 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.180
 it is precisely 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.980
 characteristic of the equipment that is going to 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.120
 be more complicated I think to cost 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.120
 they tie forces
