00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 good these fears to a new video 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.080
 good rumor runs about a new 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.510
 possible hidden mode we could say 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.920
 custom warfare caps really like 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.340
 I say this could be enough 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.900
 quite fake as we all can 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.400
 say all the leaks that arise 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.690
 from a totally strange site because 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.910
 good if a lot of people are doing 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.289
 I miss you this news angel is not so 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.930
 audible basically because it comes from 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.369
 very very fucking sites not really 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.500
 that can be invented by anyone 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.760
 comes completely specifically from a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.219
 forum of a person supposedly 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.730
 he has tried or has seen secretly 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.420
 this mode usually does as a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.489
 day this was not put in reddit 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.129
 and then this message that put the 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.629
 shoulder was basically eliminated what 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.760
 what did you say that will guanabarÃ¡ a new way 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.370
 a fourth new mode called hills bound 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.079
 that would be like a satanic way 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.449
 we could say the player appears 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.420
 we could say in a room well with 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.519
 pentagram looks more covered in second 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.250
 a room full of blood and all this 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.199
 good everything very dark satanic and others 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.110
 the game mode would be based we could 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.570
 say in something quite similar to the way 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.050
 treyarch zombies we would have bosses 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.110
 we would have a multitude of enemies 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.240
 different demons goat minotaurs 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.850
 finish from between minotaur goat 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.649
 we could say dark and then class 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.920
 similar to what it would be in mode 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.229
 extinction of infinity ward and then 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.230
 we could also say that it would be for 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.200
 eight players 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.600
 of play would not only be limited to 4 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.190
 when will be the pcd 4 versus 4 as the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.460
 zombie mode werder black ops' all 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.640
 we have a basically good way 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.020
 that there are neither pictures nor temper nor anything 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.870
 leaked out there that you can not see 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.490
 nothing of all this I the truth that yes 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.230
 what do you want it to be or can it be 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.840
 true or it can be a lie and my opinion 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.660
 it can be for me false we did not 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.930
 comes from nowhere, let me say what 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.790
 I believe directly not at all or is it 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.530
 as it does not come from anything is not that is how 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.260
 then as if there is no source 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.700
 legitimate so I do not really do not know 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.320
 to tell you a lot you ask me about 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.110
 this way but I really do not know that 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.580
 tell you the text that this man put 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.280
 it has been eliminated I do not know if it has been 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.970
 removed by it or if it has been removed 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.850
 by activision or why but this maybe 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.410
 it increases the nervousness of the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.420
 people that if it can be true or can 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.570
 be a lie because I do not know I do not know if 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.560
 really the hammer game want 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.450
 surprise people but next and 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.100
 not three years to develop a mode 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.900
 cooperative in conditions and mode 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.730
 they taught us because it was not at all what 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.190
 what people expected to have 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 cured and have done a mega way like this 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.140
 demons and others that this ultra mega 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.150
 handsome because I do not know the same, the same 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.090
 mega new fashion better than the zombies and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.190
 all this but good I do not really 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.990
 I think it looks he says otherwise 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.520
 It looks like the way we 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.800
 taught the cooperative is the one that is going to be 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.030
 and it's already so good we'll see 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.530
 what ends up happening until 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.590
 you see the game that we will not know 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.720
 is the typical mode that is discovered when 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.200
 the game comes out and in fact we'll see 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.790
 see what happens if 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.790
 operate in light or not only will there be 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.850
 wait and nothing my vote can be true 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.790
 It may be entity really not me 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.890
 I think directly I do not know the same way 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.930
 wrong we prefer to be wrong 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.300
 I prefer to go wrong with hype and that 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.459
 I thought that's going to be true, not at all 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.650
 I do not believe it if you want one of 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.900
 you well this has made it a 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.840
 uncle who is neither a developer nor anything 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.700
 it's a guy out there loose and it 's the same 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.320
 has filtered it like that when I 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.450
 has leaked so now we see each other in 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.450
 the next video nothing until the next
