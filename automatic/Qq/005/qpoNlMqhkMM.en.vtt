them to step forward and I think Alan's

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.120 
them to step forward and I think Alan's
wonderful<00:01:43.450> in<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.689> way<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:44.020> he's<00:01:44.229> kind<00:01:45.070> of

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
wonderful in the way that he's kind of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.440

made<00:01:45.430> Snape<00:01:45.909> who

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.850 

I've<00:01:53.450> always<00:01:53.630> enjoyed<00:01:53.780> work<00:01:54.110> without<00:01:54.320> me<00:01:54.680> in

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
I've always enjoyed work without me in

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.700 
I've always enjoyed work without me in
the<00:01:55.040> way<00:01:55.160> he<00:01:55.460> thinks<00:01:56.210> about<00:01:56.390> scenes<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.590> way

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
the way he thinks about scenes the way

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.320 
the way he thinks about scenes the way
breaks<00:01:58.010> them<00:01:58.190> down<00:01:58.220> it's<00:01:59.120> quite

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
breaks them down it's quite

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.610 
breaks them down it's quite
inspirational<00:01:59.600> so<00:01:59.960> I<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.350> sort<00:02:00.560> of

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
inspirational so I think that sort of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.550 
inspirational so I think that sort of
made<00:02:00.830> me<00:02:01.070> forced<00:02:01.490> me<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.790> raise<00:02:02.360> my<00:02:02.410> my<00:02:03.410> own

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
made me forced me to raise my my own

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.520 
made me forced me to raise my my own
standards<00:02:04.280> in<00:02:05.060> many<00:02:05.180> ways<00:02:05.450> Harry<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.990> all<00:02:06.260> the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
standards in many ways Harry of all the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.680 
standards in many ways Harry of all the
characters<00:02:06.770> I'd<00:02:07.160> say<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.790> most<00:02:08.300> difficult

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
characters I'd say is the most difficult

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.790 
characters I'd say is the most difficult
to<00:02:09.260> play<00:02:09.500> he<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.399> one<00:02:10.610> who<00:02:11.540> is<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.530> least

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
to play he is the one who is the least

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.060 
to play he is the one who is the least
defined<00:02:13.610> in<00:02:14.060> terms<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.540> his<00:02:14.720> personality<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
defined in terms of his personality and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.910 
defined in terms of his personality and
I<00:02:16.160> think<00:02:16.340> Deb<00:02:16.550> has<00:02:16.790> brought<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.420> real<00:02:17.780> truth<00:02:18.500> to

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
I think Deb has brought a real truth to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.640 
I think Deb has brought a real truth to
