00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.140
 ah 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.890
 this is a smaller video 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.720
 hello youtube people and then the 5 and in 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.809
 this new tutorial 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.529
 let's see how to transfer files via 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.930
 bluetooth from pc to cell phones 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.000
 Well first of all I want to say that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.310
 you have to have correctly 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.820
 install the peripheral drivers of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.160
 bluetooth 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.370
 on your computer good here to be 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.180
 Honest I personally am going to go to 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 stop sound hardware control 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.880
 and I'm going to go here administrator of 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.880
 dispositives 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:50.280
 and here I have 5 drivers 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.110
 but this leaves me an error there used 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 an error or a warning 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.399
 better said because I have to 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.010
 update it manually but that's not 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.230
 influences the in the permanent connection 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.059
 from your phone with the computer 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.509
 so I do not do it now to follow 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.759
 with the good tutorial to start this 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.510
 tutorial we are going to go to panel 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:17.260
 of control add a device 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.290
 and we expect maximum 1 minute until 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.400
 phone appears on your phone 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.250
 remember that it has to be activated 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.400
 absolute and configured to show to 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:32.780
 all incoming devices ok 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.040
 let's go to my phone is already added to 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.620
 computer but I will do the test 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.690
 with another to see how the process is going 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.350
 to select the phone and win 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.350
 following 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.830
 and on your phone you will appear in your 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.490
 phone will appear an application 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.050
 of linking your computer you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.530
 they will give 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.369
 yes 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.369
 to accept 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.670
 and on your phone it will look like a 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.100
 key for example in this example is 82 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.980
 93 43 and on computer as you see 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.930
 that same number also comes out then 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.590
 here they will mark that if yes that is 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.590
 they match 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.310
 I'll try again because I 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.270
 puts a lot with the explanation that I'm going 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.270
 to do a little faster now 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.730
 I give him to accept if 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.110
 and on my cell phone he's going to say adding 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.710
 the list of devices linked by 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.220
 example 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.640
 Bah 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.840
 is going to wait a bit and we give 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.950
 next and this was going to be 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.950
 configuring the device 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.340
 and later 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.070
 installing driver software 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.690
 device that is the driver and there I 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.130
 is saying that it is being installed 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.460
 other than the first if it is 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.780
 correctly and the device was added 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.780
 correctly this equipment 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.079
 and here we finish the coupling 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.790
 well now let's send any 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.790
 archive 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.270
 let's go to the folder where we have 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.270
 our file that we want to send to 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.270
 cellular for example any image 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.410
 for example is 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.160
 of the penguins we are going to click 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.880
 right and we will give send to 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.880
 bluetooth devices 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.180
 and we're going to see that our device 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.349
 following 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.970
 and since it is already attached to the phone it 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.630
 will receive the file automatically and 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.630
 very simply 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.690
 and on your phone you will show 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.750
 to check that your file has been 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:26.660
 sent without any problem and 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:27.800
 disappear with absolute success good them 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.680
 I want to say that this tool is very 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.930
 simple is not at all difficult as 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.080
 is the blues program or law that requires 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:40.419
 of an external USB usb device 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.860
 that program is quite complex because 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:47.169
 requires updating followed by 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.990
 learn a lot to know that program does not 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.639
 it's easy, that's why people 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.039
 consult a lot in other blues videos 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.800
 or what have I done because the truth that 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:59.420
 I do not understand a very difficult subject 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.060
 It is a very difficult program to use 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.680
 but that with time one goes away 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.810
 getting used to using the program and going 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.960
 can send your files or control the 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.910
 computer or whatever it is correctly 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.190
 good 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.880
 thank you very much friends for watching this video 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.880
 and until next time
