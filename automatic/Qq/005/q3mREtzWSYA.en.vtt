00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
some skills have more than one attack

you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:31.980> take<00:00:32.099> advantage<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.940> stay

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
you can take advantage of this and stay

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.130 
you can take advantage of this and stay
on<00:00:33.239> minimum<00:00:33.510> range<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.110> deal<00:00:34.230> damage<00:00:34.700> an

increasing<00:00:38.640> damage<00:00:38.940> per<00:00:39.090> second<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.750> by<00:00:40.020> using

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
increasing damage per second is by using

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.619 
increasing damage per second is by using
shift<00:00:40.530> cancelling<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.940> know<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.510> can
