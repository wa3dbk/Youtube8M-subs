today we're going to show you a problem

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.420 
today we're going to show you a problem
we<00:00:15.349> found<00:00:15.559> with<00:00:15.679> a<00:00:15.710> fuel<00:00:16.070> pump

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
we found with a fuel pump

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.700 
we found with a fuel pump
that<00:00:17.030> caused<00:00:17.240> us<00:00:17.510> some<00:00:17.540> frustration<00:00:18.380> maybe

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
that caused us some frustration maybe

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.030 
that caused us some frustration maybe
it'll<00:00:18.920> save<00:00:19.190> you<00:00:19.430> some<00:00:19.700> we're<00:00:20.510> working<00:00:20.810> on<00:00:20.930> a

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
it'll save you some we're working on a

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.360 
it'll save you some we're working on a
96<00:00:22.040> Chevy<00:00:23.030> Express<00:00:23.480> full<00:00:23.870> sized<00:00:24.110> fan<00:00:24.440> the

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.370 
96 Chevy Express full sized fan the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.220 
96 Chevy Express full sized fan the
complaint<00:00:25.760> basically<00:00:26.000> was<00:00:26.450> the<00:00:26.480> no<00:00:26.720> start<00:00:27.080> and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
complaint basically was the no start and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.440 
complaint basically was the no start and
we<00:00:27.800> diagnosed<00:00:28.310> it<00:00:28.520> as<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.790> fuel<00:00:29.030> pump<00:00:29.240> being

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
we diagnosed it as the fuel pump being

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.960 
we diagnosed it as the fuel pump being
bad<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.020> it<00:00:30.230> was<00:00:30.380> bad<00:00:30.680> but<00:00:31.400> we<00:00:31.520> also<00:00:31.670> had<00:00:31.940> a

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
bad and it was bad but we also had a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.120 
bad and it was bad but we also had a
problem<00:00:32.300> with<00:00:32.660> the<00:00:32.810> cinder<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.860> reason

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
problem with the cinder and the reason

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.220 
problem with the cinder and the reason
we<00:00:34.250> said<00:00:34.460> that<00:00:34.700> is<00:00:34.790> because<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:35.480> fuel<00:00:36.020> sender

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
we said that is because the fuel sender

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.560 
we said that is because the fuel sender
didn't<00:00:36.710> show<00:00:36.860> completely<00:00:37.400> empty<00:00:38.060> but<00:00:38.270> when<00:00:38.420> we

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
didn't show completely empty but when we

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.390 
didn't show completely empty but when we
pulled<00:00:38.810> the<00:00:38.870> fuel<00:00:39.140> pump<00:00:39.410> out<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:40.100> was

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
pulled the fuel pump out it was

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.300 
pulled the fuel pump out it was
completely<00:00:40.970> empty<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.570> new<00:00:42.470> fuel<00:00:42.710> pump<00:00:42.890> fixed

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
completely empty the new fuel pump fixed

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.520 
completely empty the new fuel pump fixed
the<00:00:43.400> no<00:00:43.520> start<00:00:43.880> it<00:00:44.240> started<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:44.930> ran<00:00:45.079> normally

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
the no start it started and ran normally

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.590 
the no start it started and ran normally
but<00:00:45.740> the<00:00:45.890> fuel<00:00:46.130> gauge<00:00:46.310> level<00:00:46.790> did<00:00:47.060> not<00:00:47.240> read

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
but the fuel gauge level did not read

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.700 
but the fuel gauge level did not read
correctly<00:00:49.240> now<00:00:50.240> the<00:00:50.300> issue<00:00:50.570> here<00:00:51.050> is<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
correctly now the issue here is the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.479 
correctly now the issue here is the
wrong<00:00:51.890> part<00:00:52.250> based<00:00:52.790> on<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.840> year<00:00:54.200> now<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:55.280> van

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
wrong part based on the year now the van

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.940 
wrong part based on the year now the van
were<00:00:55.700> working<00:00:56.030> on<00:00:56.150> with<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.540> was<00:00:56.930> built<00:00:57.200> in<00:00:57.470> 6<00:00:57.770> of

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
96 we needed a fuel pump and we ordered

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.639 
96 we needed a fuel pump and we ordered
a<00:01:01.430> 97<00:01:02.180> model<00:01:02.570> because<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.079> lot<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.410> times

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.460 
they'll move up to that next year well
this<00:01:06.800> where<00:01:07.190> a<00:01:07.220> mistake<00:01:07.640> started<00:01:08.229> we<00:01:09.229> should

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
this where a mistake started we should

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.930 
this where a mistake started we should
have<00:01:09.590> ordered<00:01:09.920> it<00:01:10.040> by<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.280> correct<00:01:10.670> VIN

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
have ordered it by the correct VIN

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
number and not by the build date so let

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.969 
number and not by the build date so let
me<00:01:14.390> show<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.810> these<00:01:14.990> fuel<00:01:15.290> pumps<00:01:15.620> what<00:01:15.830> we

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
me show you on these fuel pumps what we

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.820 
me show you on these fuel pumps what we
found<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.549> how<00:01:16.729> we<00:01:16.790> resolved<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.590> now<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.770> is

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
found and how we resolved it now this is

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.719 
found and how we resolved it now this is
our<00:01:19.159> original<00:01:19.250> fuel<00:01:19.850> pump<00:01:20.120> a<00:01:20.299> 6<00:01:20.659> of<00:01:20.810> 96<00:01:21.350> build

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
our original fuel pump a 6 of 96 build

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.610 
our original fuel pump a 6 of 96 build
the<00:01:22.729> fuel<00:01:23.000> sender<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.510> on<00:01:23.659> side<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.170> pumps<00:01:24.470> on

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
the fuel sender is on side the pumps on

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.770 
the fuel sender is on side the pumps on
the<00:01:24.740> inside<00:01:25.130> but<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.850> sender<00:01:26.090> actually<00:01:26.600> has<00:01:26.750> a

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
the inside but the sender actually has a

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.530 
the inside but the sender actually has a
float<00:01:27.260> on<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.590> our<00:01:27.950> floats<00:01:28.640> missing<00:01:29.180> but<00:01:29.330> this

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
float on it our floats missing but this

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.609 
float on it our floats missing but this
is<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.930> sender<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:31.490> normally<00:01:32.200> if<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.440> in

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
is the sender now normally if this in

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.410 
is the sender now normally if this in
the<00:01:33.740> down<00:01:33.950> position<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.790> your<00:01:34.909> float<00:01:35.240> were

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
the down position and your float were

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.230 
the down position and your float were
down<00:01:35.630> that<00:01:35.840> would<00:01:36.020> be<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.260> empty<00:01:36.680> position<00:01:37.369> so

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
down that would be the empty position so

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.910 
down that would be the empty position so
we're<00:01:38.390> actually<00:01:38.540> going<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:38.900> use<00:01:39.049> our<00:01:39.200> D<00:01:39.380> vom

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
we're actually going to use our D vom

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.200 
we're actually going to use our D vom
and<00:01:40.220> look<00:01:40.729> at<00:01:40.850> our<00:01:40.970> reading<00:01:45.159> reading<00:01:46.159> around<00:01:46.549> 6

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
and look at our reading reading around 6

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.410 
and look at our reading reading around 6
or<00:01:47.330> so<00:01:47.540> six<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.080> a<00:01:48.110> half<00:01:48.140> ohms

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.090 

we're<00:01:52.420> going<00:01:52.539> to<00:01:52.630> take<00:01:52.810> our<00:01:52.990> gas<00:01:53.200> gauge<00:01:53.530> as<00:01:53.920> if

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
we're going to take our gas gauge as if

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.859 
we're going to take our gas gauge as if
there<00:01:54.310> was<00:01:54.460> full<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.819> gas<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.359> move<00:01:55.569> it<00:01:55.719> all

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
there was full of gas and move it all

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.709 
there was full of gas and move it all
the<00:01:55.990> way<00:01:56.109> up<00:01:56.229> to<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.469> top<00:01:56.679> and<00:01:57.009> watch<00:01:57.999> our<00:01:58.329> DB

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
the way up to the top and watch our DB

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:06.449 
the way up to the top and watch our DB
om<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.799> we're<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.310> high<00:02:03.460> 90s<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:05.530> full<00:02:05.920> now

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
om so we're in the high 90s for full now

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.070 
om so we're in the high 90s for full now
you<00:02:06.520> know<00:02:06.729> as<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.060> move<00:02:07.270> this<00:02:07.450> down<00:02:07.719> to<00:02:07.929> one

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
you know as you move this down to one

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.619 
you know as you move this down to one
half<00:02:08.319> full<00:02:08.709> which<00:02:09.489> is<00:02:09.640> about<00:02:09.879> half<00:02:10.090> half<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
half full which is about half half the

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.170 
half full which is about half half the
reading<00:02:10.959> you<00:02:11.140> move<00:02:11.319> down<00:02:11.590> same<00:02:12.580> thing<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.090> you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
reading you move down same thing so you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.539 
reading you move down same thing so you
can<00:02:13.330> see<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.840> cinder<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.290> working<00:02:14.769> but

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
can see that the cinder is working but

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.759 
can see that the cinder is working but
it<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:15.849> wasn't<00:02:16.120> accurate<00:02:16.810> because<00:02:17.200> when<00:02:17.620> it

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
it just wasn't accurate because when it

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.759 
it just wasn't accurate because when it
was<00:02:17.950> at<00:02:18.250> zero<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:19.420> was<00:02:19.599> showing<00:02:19.840> four<00:02:20.349> ohms<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
was at zero it was showing four ohms and

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.509 
was at zero it was showing four ohms and
we<00:02:23.769> had<00:02:23.980> no<00:02:24.220> gas<00:02:24.459> in<00:02:24.489> there<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:26.950> let's<00:02:27.280> move<00:02:27.459> to

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
we had no gas in there now let's move to

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.729 
we had no gas in there now let's move to
our<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:28.209> replacement<00:02:28.930> we<00:02:29.049> ordered<00:02:29.410> out<00:02:29.530> which

our the replacement we ordered out which
is<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> 97<00:02:31.769> now<00:02:32.769> remember<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> other<00:02:33.459> ones<00:02:33.610> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
old this is a brand new unit but it's

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.880

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
got our float all the way to down so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.759 
got our float all the way to down so
this<00:02:42.190> would<00:02:42.430> indicate<00:02:42.780> empty<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.959> we're<00:02:44.680> at

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.580 
about an eighth of a tank of gas when we
put<00:04:19.760> the<00:04:19.850> new<00:04:19.880> one<00:04:20.180> in<00:04:20.329> with<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.019> same<00:04:21.229> amount

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
put the new one in with the same amount

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.379 
put the new one in with the same amount
of<00:04:21.650> gas<00:04:21.859> in<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.250> now<00:04:22.430> it<00:04:22.490> was<00:04:22.669> showing<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:23.060> half<00:04:23.270> a

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
of gas in it now it was showing a half a

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.330 
of gas in it now it was showing a half a
tank<00:04:23.630> which<00:04:23.930> we<00:04:24.139> knew<00:04:24.350> was<00:04:24.590> incorrect<00:04:25.130> it

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
tank which we knew was incorrect it

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.279 
tank which we knew was incorrect it
couldn't<00:04:25.700> be<00:04:25.789> that<00:04:25.820> so<00:04:26.539> instead<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:26.990> putting

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
couldn't be that so instead of putting

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.500 
couldn't be that so instead of putting
in<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.620> 97<00:04:28.190> which<00:04:28.490> we'd<00:04:28.669> ordered<00:04:29.030> out

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
in the 97 which we'd ordered out

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.200 
in the 97 which we'd ordered out
we<00:04:29.810> ordered<00:04:30.110> out<00:04:30.260> a<00:04:30.289> 96<00:04:31.010> module<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.760> does<00:04:31.820> not

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
we ordered out a 96 module that does not

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.110 
we ordered out a 96 module that does not
have<00:04:32.510> an<00:04:32.660> anti<00:04:32.990> slush<00:04:33.410> module<00:04:33.979> put<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:34.669> in<00:04:34.910> and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
have an anti slush module put it in and

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.300 
have an anti slush module put it in and
now<00:04:35.450> everything<00:04:35.900> was<00:04:36.050> correct<00:04:36.289> if<00:04:36.919> you<00:04:37.010> get

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
now everything was correct if you get

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.790 
now everything was correct if you get
the<00:04:37.460> wrong<00:04:37.640> one<00:04:37.780> your<00:04:38.780> readings<00:04:39.229> will<00:04:39.440> be<00:04:39.590> off

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
the wrong one your readings will be off

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.550 
the wrong one your readings will be off
and<00:04:40.190> your<00:04:40.490> gauge<00:04:40.760> won't<00:04:41.150> be<00:04:41.300> accurate<00:04:41.450> be<00:04:42.350> sure

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
and your gauge won't be accurate be sure

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.409 
and your gauge won't be accurate be sure
and<00:04:42.740> decode<00:04:43.130> your<00:04:43.280> VIN<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:43.880> make<00:04:44.030> sure<00:04:44.240> you're

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
and decode your VIN to make sure you're

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.210 
and decode your VIN to make sure you're
getting<00:04:44.539> the<00:04:44.840> right<00:04:44.870> model<00:04:45.500> year<00:04:45.710> that's<00:04:45.950> in

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
getting the right model year that's in

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.460 
getting the right model year that's in
there<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.669> get<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.300> right<00:04:47.450> pump<00:04:47.810> but<00:04:48.289> when

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
there and get the right pump but when

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.740 
there and get the right pump but when
you<00:04:48.590> get<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.950> out<00:04:49.070> check<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.639> against<00:04:50.030> your<00:04:50.360> own

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
you get it out check it against your own

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.050 
you get it out check it against your own
values<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:51.889> that<00:04:52.039> you<00:04:52.190> don't<00:04:52.400> have<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.700> put<00:04:52.940> it

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
values so that you don't have to put it

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.510 
values so that you don't have to put it
in<00:04:53.180> there<00:04:53.389> like<00:04:53.419> we<00:04:53.570> did<00:04:54.130> put<00:04:55.130> it<00:04:55.220> all<00:04:55.340> back

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
in there like we did put it all back

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.430 
in there like we did put it all back
underneath<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.180> van<00:04:56.330> fill<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.080> up

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
underneath the van fill it up

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.840 
underneath the van fill it up
find<00:04:57.650> out<00:04:57.800> your<00:04:57.830> wrong<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.370> have<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.580> drop

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
find out your wrong and have to drop

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.000 
find out your wrong and have to drop
that<00:04:59.030> tank<00:04:59.330> and<00:04:59.479> do<00:04:59.630> it<00:04:59.720> again<00:04:59.900> twice<00:05:00.229> we<00:05:00.860> don't

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
that tank and do it again twice we don't

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.920 
that tank and do it again twice we don't
want<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.190> do<00:05:01.310> them<00:05:01.430> again<00:05:01.490> twice<00:05:01.910> so<00:05:02.539> hopefully

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
want to do them again twice so hopefully

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.950 
want to do them again twice so hopefully
this<00:05:03.080> will<00:05:03.229> save<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.560> some<00:05:03.740> time
