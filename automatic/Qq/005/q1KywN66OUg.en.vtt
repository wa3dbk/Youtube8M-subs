00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
walk around in and the hyperdunks are

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.119 
walk around in and the hyperdunks are
definitely<00:00:50.700> more<00:00:50.850> comfortable<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.949> you<00:00:52.949> can

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
see the file on is a lot more squishy

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.200 
see the file on is a lot more squishy
and<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> hyperfuse<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.350> lot<00:01:01.469> more<00:01:01.530> tough

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
and the hyperfuse it's a lot more tough

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.020 
and the hyperfuse it's a lot more tough
the<00:01:03.210> hyper<00:01:03.420> fuses<00:01:03.930> are<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:05.159> more<00:01:05.189> durable

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the hyper fuses are a lot more durable

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.770 
the hyper fuses are a lot more durable
and<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:07.619> hyperdunks<00:01:08.250> cuff<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.030> lot<00:01:09.630> more

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
and the hyperdunks cuff a lot more

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.289 
and the hyperdunks cuff a lot more
easily<00:01:11.119> but<00:01:12.560> the<00:01:13.560> hyper<00:01:13.950> fuses<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.060> have

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
easily but the hyper fuses do not have

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.670 
easily but the hyper fuses do not have
the<00:01:15.600> carbon<00:01:16.530> fiber<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:21.170> got<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.380> hyper

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the carbon fiber and I got the hyper

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.460 
the carbon fiber and I got the hyper
fuses<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.520> east<00:01:23.909> bay<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.439> good

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
fuses from east bay for a really good

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.999 
fuses from east bay for a really good
price<00:01:25.650> um<00:01:27.950> yeah<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:30.110> hyperdunks<00:01:31.110> came

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
price um yeah and the hyperdunks came

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.039 
price um yeah and the hyperdunks came
from<00:01:32.310> dicks<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:34.340> overall<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> think<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
from dicks and overall I think the

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.859 
from dicks and overall I think the
hyperdunks<00:01:37.049> are<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.290> better<00:01:37.560> all-around<00:01:37.920> shoe

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
hyperdunks are a better all-around shoe

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
hyperdunks are a better all-around shoe
but<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.900> hyper<00:01:40.229> fuses<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:41.009> definitely<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
but the hyper fuses are definitely a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.819 
but the hyper fuses are definitely a
better<00:01:41.610> game<00:01:41.909> shoe<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.540> they<00:01:43.079> look<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.680> little

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
better game shoe and they look a little

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.550 
better game shoe and they look a little
bit<00:01:44.070> better<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.869> I'm<00:01:45.869> gonna<00:01:45.990> turn<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> over

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
bit better and I'm gonna turn this over
