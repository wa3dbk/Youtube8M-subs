00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
okay to for it to actually write to your

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.479 
okay to for it to actually write to your
SIM<00:02:45.090> card<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.870> need<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.200> go<00:02:46.350> ahead<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.920> click

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
SIM card you need to go ahead and click

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.180 
SIM card you need to go ahead and click
right<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:48.480> sim<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:52.560> going<00:02:52.739> pretty<00:02:52.950> slow

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
right to sim and it's going pretty slow

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.380 
right to sim and it's going pretty slow
going<00:02:53.430> what<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:53.820> um<00:02:54.239> I<00:02:54.530> have<00:02:55.530> about<00:02:55.769> um<00:02:56.390> 690

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
going what it's um I have about um 690

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.660 
going what it's um I have about um 690
something<00:02:57.720> contacts<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:59.160> some<00:02:59.370> reason

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
something contacts and for some reason

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.610 
something contacts and for some reason
it<00:02:59.790> only<00:03:00.030> copies<00:03:00.450> 55<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.290> them

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it only copies 55 of them

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.979 
it only copies 55 of them
it<00:03:02.010> keeps<00:03:02.220> crashing<00:03:02.670> maybe<00:03:02.880> it's<00:03:03.480> cuz<00:03:03.690> I'm<00:03:03.810> I'm

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
it keeps crashing maybe it's cuz I'm I'm

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.930 
it keeps crashing maybe it's cuz I'm I'm
a<00:03:04.049> t-mobile<00:03:04.500> user<00:03:04.769> maybe<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.549> because<00:03:05.760> I'm

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
a t-mobile user maybe it's because I'm

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.250 
a t-mobile user maybe it's because I'm
using<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.570> Givi<00:03:06.810> sim<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.290> don't<00:03:08.190> know<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:09.260> for

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
using the Givi sim I don't know so for

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.350 
using the Givi sim I don't know so for
some<00:03:10.410> reason<00:03:10.709> it<00:03:10.830> doesn't<00:03:10.950> copy<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.519> mall<00:03:11.940> but

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
some reason it doesn't copy the mall but

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.620 
some reason it doesn't copy the mall but
it<00:03:12.480> copies<00:03:12.810> most<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.350> them<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.760> copies<00:03:15.120> 55

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
it copies most of them so it copies 55

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.809 
it copies most of them so it copies 55
of<00:03:15.840> them<00:03:16.700> so

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
of them so

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.670 
of them so
pretty<00:03:17.939> much<00:03:18.060> after<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.599> is<00:03:18.780> done<00:03:19.230> you've

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
pretty much after this is done you've

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.199 
pretty much after this is done you've
already<00:03:19.920> copied<00:03:20.340> your<00:03:20.730> SIM<00:03:20.999> cards<00:03:22.639> I'll<00:03:23.639> wait

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
already copied your SIM cards I'll wait

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:32.179 
already copied your SIM cards I'll wait
for<00:03:24.420> two<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:30.090> crashes<00:03:30.569> at<00:03:30.689> 55<00:03:31.290> but<00:03:31.889> it<00:03:31.980> caught

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189 
for two it crashes at 55 but it caught

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.349 
for two it crashes at 55 but it caught
these<00:03:32.340> them<00:03:32.870> or<00:03:33.870> if<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.920> don't<00:03:35.129> hear<00:03:35.909> I'll<00:03:36.120> go
