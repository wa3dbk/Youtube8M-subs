00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.229
 Yes / Yes 

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.370
 but somehow I had car crew me procured 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.789
 October wife is a farmer Ewald both women after a stupid slogan 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:13.439
 if I've spent anything now reports the defensive performance 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.089
 I will keep going 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.789
 another dining room in the m-dax is now a bit strange 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:25.449
 but go Dr 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
 but we have opened up, he himself is guilty 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.430
 what's going on here 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.530
 we go 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.960
 that just should not be around 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.940
 why Mannheim 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.850
 should come in addition 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 we'll see why our opponents keep claiming it 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.580
 Aha 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.650
 we use 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.200
 We can look to it 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.770
 who super middleweight 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.260
 there was also so taken one of Europe 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.170
 yes us 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.610
 No 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.610
 the band 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.730
 they have judges always answer well to the critical voices 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.030
 it did not use anything 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.390
 still are 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 and somehow not make and get out 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.700
 but not liberating 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 I 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.170
 just really awesome 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 that was not good 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.720
 a little known 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.600
 What is it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.110
 OK, that's your match winner Hello 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.060
 Welcome to Bölt's study 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.720
 whoever blames or gives that is maybe one soon 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.720
 good program Euro 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.280
 Wait a moment 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 you know what I do not speak this 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 if seen now or had played themselves branches of business 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.009
 these are the operating systems Fr 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.409
 So Pfeifer resonates 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.599
 Gamer 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.439
 Percent cousin 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.439
 Also humor and Komikers then adjourn animals 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.599
 Putin 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.599
 Gomes achieved 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.369
 Rome Oberjoch being God 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.819
 but what happens now? 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.759
 that is heavily courted at that time was still on 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:43.759
 So I have to say that something like that happens 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.829
 as well as Georgia 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.519
 OK 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.069
 by one degree 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.469
 What are you doing 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.869
 so stupid 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.559
 for which Dekra is both clubs 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.909
 secondary 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.909
 to buy such a Porsche 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.699
 yes, such an asshole 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.549
 but something like that 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.230
 you have a minute so that's a degree 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.230
 abolished 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:20.929
 BU 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.909
 Go 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.909
 to the vulture 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:28.899
 Bio 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.899
 such a coincidence that but never waiting for me were guests 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.109
 luck 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.499
 Goch 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.219
 Although she must have made a big mistake 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.309
 Asbeck 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.309
 they disobeyed their orders 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:46.159
 maybe they will soon be paid the price 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.619
 Euro 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:53.039
 Red 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.609
 the water must 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.230
 As they could see, the operation ran a rearing program 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.629
 from Lüttwitz whether kg I did not see that you just tell me 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.559
 October in gold was kept secret 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.279
 Of course, it is purely civil purposes 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.209
 I assume that you understand that 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.539
 but maybe they already knew about this program 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.539
 Eden must have had doubts when they saw sector one 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.659
 SRX 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:24.479
 a faithful reproduction of the Bykow system by sr3 one night 80 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.199
 I wondered, that's what I said 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.460
 An ideal environment for the breeding of Alpha Gabbert scepter and so there was hardly eGame 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.460
 Type and no please do not 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.699
 In the context of this research drafting procedure developed the growth substantially 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:42.360
 can accelerate 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.900
 just imagine 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.700
 a mega macs step within a few days from a larva craft 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.279
 but these studies are now complete 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:55.539
 the DAX has tracked down its natural enemy 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:00.379
 At this moment, one of the Asterix is ​​right here 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.439
 is a few 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.439
 own the Asterix 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.599
 gets protested gets 1 1 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:15.949
 That means there are several laptops several 1 6 6 4 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.379
 the torture is not really surprising 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.059
 As you know, Ax proliferate sexually through cell division 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.300
 roots 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.860
 as a result of these biological conditions are 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.919
 meanwhile not less than 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:33.030
 10 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.470
 11 European records Phil shx 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.490
 on board this station 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.740
 Samus they have to flee 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.360
 Oh, now I have to flee 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.849
 Max Uhlig from wasting them from here they hurry up 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.199
 otherwise they are easy prey for that is an ex-profi Demir fine 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:52.919
 make do 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.600
 just think they have just spilled one of their own Zions 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.439
 Appointments to connect I do not know what that 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.389
 Headquarters to say the recent incidents 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.379
 they should report as soon as possible 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.379
 the others are clear 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:09.629
 not really 

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.139
 but yes 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.199
 then they are on their way now 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.259
 Wuxi 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.339
 is that necessary 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.879
 I've expected a lot with a lot in the two coming 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.879
 Choice could not be required 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.939
 but that is what I want 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.860
 but rejected 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.330
 for large projects 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.950
 the topix-index behavior just 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.050
 as commented but would have responded appropriately 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.300
 his criticism 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.680
 but maybe relentless but still responsible 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.699
 the park-like is not occupied by their duty 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.020
 a computer 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.020
 is not capable of such understanding 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.869
 Yes that's true 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:57.159
 whether were closer
