today ill show you how i did this super easy summer bronze makeup.

00:00:11.986 --> 00:00:18.809
and i used only this eyeshadow quad by MAC and 
 only 1 angled brush!! so please keep on watching.

00:00:20.229 --> 00:00:23.035
alright. so ill start with this quad which i bought several years ago.

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:29.522
you dont have to use the exact same colors. if 
 u have 4 different browns, try them too.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:39.650
and for a brush, i use this Sigma SS275 
 which is a bit fluffy angled one.

00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:50.454
usually, i use this brush for nose contouring or highlighting but 
 today ill use only this brush for eye makeup.

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.765
firstly i take this bronze color.

00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:01.738
then apply it on the lid.

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:10.888
if you want a natural look, dont go blend upwards too much.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:25.508
should look like this. and dont forget to blend out the lines.

00:01:28.276 --> 00:01:32.244
and everytime you change the color, wipe the color off on the tissue paper.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:46.550
then take the lightest color on the tip of the 
 brush and apply it on the bottom lashline.

00:01:50.422 --> 00:02:00.530
after that, take the darkest color on the tip of the brush 
 and apply it along the lashline and on the outer corner.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:22.670
the angle of this brush fits perfectly on the 
 curve so its really easy to apply colors.

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.870
i just happened to use this brush one day and since 
 then, im doing this look all the time now.

00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:46.820
and the last one which is kinda optional but apply this bright 
 orange color on the middle of the lid with your finger.

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:50.380
it will add the dimension to your eyes.

00:02:54.734 --> 00:03:00.690
for the lips, ill use this revlon l/s #205. (i already applied mascara.)

00:03:01.482 --> 00:03:03.680
it has some gold shimmer in it.

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:16.560
now the make up is done.

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:21.100
i think this fits this super hot summer.

00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:26.620
today i used this Bourjois CC cream #33.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.910
Asahi was talkin about this in her video so i 
 bought it. it has a pretty good coverage.

00:03:35.228 --> 00:03:38.140
and it corrects the skin color.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:48.470
i should've bought more... but most of the products are already 
 sold out (from japan coz Bourjois is leaving japan...)

00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:53.780
if u are following me on other medias like 
 Instagram, you might already know but 

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:57.340
i had my hair dyed.

00:03:58.173 --> 00:04:07.900
i dont think you can see the actual color under this 
 shitty lighting but i got some gold and red streaks.

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:17.630
actually the tip of my hair is so damaged 
 so the red dye got in so vividly.

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:38.940
so i did this for summer. i wanted to have something cool. i think 
 ill have my hair dye back to dark brown in autumn again.

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:42.440
i really love this red color.

00:04:43.214 --> 00:04:53.140
well thats it for this video. hope you enjoy my 
 super easy summer bronze look using 1 brush.
