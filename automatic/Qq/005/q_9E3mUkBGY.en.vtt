00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
Lego right is this Lego I mean I know

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.470 
Lego right is this Lego I mean I know
the<00:06:53.080> bricks<00:06:53.410> and<00:06:53.650> studs<00:06:53.950> and<00:06:54.400> and<00:06:54.670> that<00:06:55.090> design

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480 
the bricks and studs and and that design

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.160 
the bricks and studs and and that design
is<00:06:55.780> really<00:06:56.140> what<00:06:56.290> I<00:06:56.320> identified<00:06:57.010> with<00:06:57.040> Lego<00:06:58.170> so

00:06:59.160 --> 00:06:59.170 
is really what I identified with Lego so

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.280 
is really what I identified with Lego so
just<00:06:59.410> recently<00:06:59.680> got<00:07:00.280> into<00:07:00.810> these<00:07:01.810> style

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.290 
just recently got into these style

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.280 
just recently got into these style
builds<00:07:02.950> I<00:07:03.670> like<00:07:04.360> it<00:07:04.570> I<00:07:04.690> like<00:07:04.870> putting<00:07:05.170> these

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
builds I like it I like putting these

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.710 
builds I like it I like putting these
together<00:07:05.500> and<00:07:05.920> I<00:07:06.190> think<00:07:06.550> that<00:07:06.820> you<00:07:07.570> can

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
together and I think that you can

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.240 
together and I think that you can
probably<00:07:07.900> do<00:07:08.110> some<00:07:08.290> really<00:07:08.530> cool<00:07:08.710> box<00:07:08.980> with

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
probably do some really cool box with

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:14.040 
probably do some really cool box with
these<00:07:09.430> also<00:07:09.720> but<00:07:10.720> is<00:07:11.710> it<00:07:11.920> Lego<00:07:12.960> should<00:07:13.960> they

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.050 
these also but is it Lego should they

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:15.510 
these also but is it Lego should they
call<00:07:14.290> it<00:07:14.410> something<00:07:14.740> completely<00:07:15.490> different

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
call it something completely different

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.480 
call it something completely different
should<00:07:16.090> it<00:07:16.180> not<00:07:16.420> be<00:07:16.480> Brandis<00:07:17.200> like<00:07:17.470> Hello<00:07:18.310> just

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490
