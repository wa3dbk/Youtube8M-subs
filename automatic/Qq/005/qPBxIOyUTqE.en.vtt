 Hello everyone and this is our comparative 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.890
 xiaomi and goupro test 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 All well, I generally looked at a lot of reviews 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.720
 already on xiaomi is and everyone is talking about 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.630
 microphone right now i think i will 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.880
 speak and will switch on the left u 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.650
 us xiaomi and right goupro will 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.010
 switch between them and you yourself 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.170
 feel how bad the microphone is 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.850
 video how to fix it is necessary her 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.860
 it's easy to disassemble 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.800
 watched and remove the filter but if 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.870
 chosen that dirt will fall right 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.350
 on the membrane or whatever it is called 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.940
 microphone and it will be littered i think 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.620
 some time if both use like 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.620
 he will also score the camera 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.660
 bad there is no sun could be 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:07.730
 comparative test saved take off like 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:15.580
 takes off gopro and xiaomi in the sun here 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:19.520
 I take off these windows you are 980 1920 by 1080 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.160
 frames per second end of this video 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.330
 will be 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:31.030
 coil typewriter and you will appreciate 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:34.180
 how's this footage is better at 60 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.700
 xiaomi or angle pro 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.770
 maximum frame rate 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.780
 go to the right gives us 240 but with some 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.540
 small resolution as well as xiaomi 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.180
 In general, according to their characteristics, they are 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.840
 shooting expensive to start with the fact that she 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:59.720
 shoots in 4k but true 15 frames in 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.850
 For a second, this is not well known. 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.220
 I have just gopro triten new she 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.390
 like shoot and 30 frames per second then 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:16.250
 there is quite normal so here it is 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:21.200

 when with what sound does you think 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:39.610
 able to assess the quality of the picture 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:42.610
 sound let's get down now to 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.610
