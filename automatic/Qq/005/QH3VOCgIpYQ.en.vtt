we will see

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.040 
we will see
zealots<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.410> dragoons<00:02:14.750> and<00:02:15.750> then<00:02:15.870> possibly

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
zealots and dragoons and then possibly

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.920 
zealots and dragoons and then possibly
rivers<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:16.739> well<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:18.420> see<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
rivers as well so we see that the

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.780 
rivers as well so we see that the
cybernetics<00:02:19.500> core<00:02:19.739> was<00:02:19.860> going<00:02:20.099> up<00:02:20.250> first<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
cybernetics core was going up first and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.699 
cybernetics core was going up first and
played<00:02:21.120> by<00:02:21.270> both<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.450> them<00:02:21.720> after<00:02:21.959> they<00:02:22.230> get<00:02:22.410> in

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
played by both of them after they get in

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.199 
played by both of them after they get in
a<00:02:22.950> simulator<00:02:23.310> they<00:02:23.610> create<00:02:23.970> their

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
a simulator they create their

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.080 
a simulator they create their
cybernetics<00:02:24.870> core<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.380> we<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.610> probe<00:02:26.849> is

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
cybernetics core and we see the probe is

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
cybernetics core and we see the probe is
going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.599> scout<00:02:27.870> be<00:02:28.800> soo<00:02:29.010> will<00:02:29.310> find<00:02:29.849> nada<00:02:30.780> as

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
going to scout be soo will find nada as

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.339 
going to scout be soo will find nada as
you<00:02:31.349> can<00:02:31.500> see<00:02:31.650> it's<00:02:31.769> already<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:32.160> there<00:02:32.430> and

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
you can see it's already going there and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.830 
you can see it's already going there and
you<00:02:34.349> should<00:02:34.530> always<00:02:34.650> remember<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.069> scout<00:02:35.400> I

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
you should always remember to scout I

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.500 
you should always remember to scout I
can't<00:02:36.840> say<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.019> agree<00:02:37.200> with<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.769> placement<00:02:38.250> of

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
can't say I agree with the placement of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.870 
can't say I agree with the placement of
visas<00:02:39.510> buildings<00:02:39.930> right<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:40.319> because<00:02:41.280> that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
visas buildings right now because that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.559 
visas buildings right now because that
one<00:02:42.209> pylon<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.950> powering<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.850> lot<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.180> buildings

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
one pylon is powering a lot of buildings

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.840 
one pylon is powering a lot of buildings
so<00:02:46.260> he's<00:02:46.500> he's<00:02:46.950> going<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.160> get<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.310> new<00:02:47.459> pylon

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
so he's he's going to get a new pylon

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.170 
so he's he's going to get a new pylon
very<00:02:48.060> shortly<00:02:48.390> though<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.530> should<00:02:49.739> be<00:02:49.769> okay

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
very shortly though so it should be okay

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.699 
very shortly though so it should be okay
you<00:02:51.180> see<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.360> nada<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.989> not<00:02:52.170> going<00:02:52.440> too<00:02:52.560> fast

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
you see that nada is not going too fast

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.470 
you see that nada is not going too fast
expand<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.430> lots<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.819> Terrans<00:02:54.150> like<00:02:54.330> too

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
expand on this lots of Terrans like too

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.530 
expand on this lots of Terrans like too
fast<00:02:54.690> expand<00:02:55.140> on<00:02:55.819> Longinus<00:02:56.819> because<00:02:57.209> there<00:02:57.420> is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
fast expand on Longinus because there is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.280 
fast expand on Longinus because there is
a<00:02:57.569> three<00:02:58.049> wall<00:02:59.360> you<00:03:00.360> can<00:03:00.690> put<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> barracks

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
a three wall you can put a barracks

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.960 
a three wall you can put a barracks
supply<00:03:01.739> depot<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.160> supply<00:03:02.430> depot<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.880> then

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
supply depot and supply depot and then

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.539 
supply depot and supply depot and then
you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.150> wall<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.660> then<00:03:03.750> fast<00:03:04.019> expand<00:03:04.549> and

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
you can wall and then fast expand and

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.479 
you can wall and then fast expand and
have<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.910> say<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.269> is<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.690> good<00:03:07.489> strategy

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
have to say this is a very good strategy

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.259 
have to say this is a very good strategy
as<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.330> gets<00:03:09.599> your<00:03:09.780> economy<00:03:10.410> started<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.269> very

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
as it gets your economy started and very

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.030 
as it gets your economy started and very
good<00:03:12.599> it's<00:03:12.959> very<00:03:13.080> good<00:03:13.319> for<00:03:13.470> your<00:03:13.650> economy

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
good it's very good for your economy

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.430 
good it's very good for your economy
late<00:03:14.190> game<00:03:14.400> but<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.910> early<00:03:15.060> game<00:03:15.450> it's<00:03:16.200> not

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
late game but in the early game it's not

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.199 
late game but in the early game it's not
too<00:03:16.920> good<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:17.459> a<00:03:17.549> little<00:03:17.640> risky<00:03:17.910> an

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
too good and it's a little risky an

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.720 
too good and it's a little risky an
early<00:03:18.420> game<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:21.630> he's<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.320> gonna<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.250> his

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
early game so he's just gonna do his

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.990 
early game so he's just gonna do his
regular<00:03:23.970> stuff<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.989> factory<00:03:28.579> is<00:03:29.579> also

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
regular stuff the the factory is also

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.880 
regular stuff the the factory is also
being<00:03:30.150> created<00:03:30.480> at<00:03:30.569> this<00:03:30.660> point<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.500> SUV

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
being created at this point and the SUV

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.800 
being created at this point and the SUV
is<00:03:31.980> doing<00:03:32.190> some<00:03:32.340> scouting<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:33.390> see<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.720> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
is doing some scouting you see that the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.090 
is doing some scouting you see that the
Terran<00:03:34.170> always<00:03:34.440> creates<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.769> couple<00:03:35.040> of

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
Terran always creates a couple of

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.539 
Terran always creates a couple of
Marines<00:03:35.340> before<00:03:36.030> they<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:37.470> anything<00:03:37.739> before

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
Marines before they do anything before

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.130 
Marines before they do anything before
they<00:03:38.819> get<00:03:38.970> lots<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.390> tanks<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.840> we<00:03:39.959> see<00:03:40.079> an

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
they get lots of tanks and we see an

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.140 
they get lots of tanks and we see an
academy<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.799> up<00:03:40.890> right<00:03:41.069> now<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:41.819> a<00:03:41.940> bit<00:03:42.060> of

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
academy going up right now it's a bit of

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.170 
academy going up right now it's a bit of
a<00:03:42.209> strange<00:03:42.569> build<00:03:43.760> academies<00:03:44.760> are<00:03:44.790> mostly

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
a strange build academies are mostly

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.830 
a strange build academies are mostly
used<00:03:45.450> for<00:03:46.340> upgrading<00:03:47.340> marines<00:03:47.840> upgrading

also the stimpaks and they are also used

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.569 
also the stimpaks and they are also used
to<00:03:56.220> create<00:03:56.540> scanners<00:03:58.069> these<00:03:59.069> comps<00:03:59.459> at

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
to create scanners these comps at

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.690 
to create scanners these comps at
stations<00:04:00.060> or<00:04:00.359> scanners<00:04:01.319> as<00:04:01.500> i<00:04:01.590> said<00:04:01.799> are<00:04:02.340> very

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
stations or scanners as i said are very

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.330 
stations or scanners as i said are very
useful<00:04:02.910> in<00:04:03.359> Scouting<00:04:04.260> as<00:04:04.440> well<00:04:04.680> as<00:04:04.799> detecting

invisible units and army is that your
opponent<00:04:09.720> has<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:11.250> we<00:04:11.459> see<00:04:11.639> right<00:04:11.850> now<00:04:11.970> not<00:04:12.180> as

opponent has so we see right now not as

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.520 
opponent has so we see right now not as
creating<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.750> pretty<00:04:12.959> large<00:04:13.170> amount<00:04:13.470> of

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.529 
Marines he already has five six one is
coming<00:04:15.989> out<00:04:16.109> very<00:04:16.620> shortly<00:04:17.299> not<00:04:18.299> quite<00:04:18.510> sure

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
coming out very shortly not quite sure

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.960 
coming out very shortly not quite sure
what<00:04:18.900> he's<00:04:18.989> going<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.169> do<00:04:19.350> at<00:04:19.470> this<00:04:19.590> point<00:04:19.709> he

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
what he's going to do at this point he

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.120 
what he's going to do at this point he
he<00:04:21.630> doesn't<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.110> second<00:04:22.470> barracks<00:04:22.740> yet<00:04:22.890> so

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
he doesn't have a second barracks yet so

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.800 
he doesn't have a second barracks yet so
it<00:04:23.760> doesn't<00:04:24.210> really<00:04:24.270> imply<00:04:24.660> if<00:04:25.200> he's<00:04:25.710> doing<00:04:25.950> a

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
it doesn't really imply if he's doing a

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.160 
it doesn't really imply if he's doing a
marine<00:04:27.810> build<00:04:28.050> which<00:04:28.800> is<00:04:29.040> okay<00:04:29.850> but<00:04:30.630> not<00:04:30.990> the

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.170 
marine build which is okay but not the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.960 
marine build which is okay but not the
best<00:04:31.380> choice<00:04:31.470> we<00:04:32.220> see<00:04:32.370> that<00:04:32.550> these<00:04:32.670> marines

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
best choice we see that these marines

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.210 
best choice we see that these marines
are<00:04:33.150> coming<00:04:33.450> out<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:34.170> supported<00:04:35.010> with<00:04:35.130> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
are coming out and supported with the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.040 
are coming out and supported with the
tank<00:04:35.490> animatic<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.240> these<00:04:36.360> drones<00:04:36.810> are

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
tank animatic and these drones are

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.290 
tank animatic and these drones are
forced<00:04:37.350> to<00:04:37.410> retreat<00:04:37.680> rains<00:04:38.460> are<00:04:38.730> sometimes

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
forced to retreat rains are sometimes

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.410 
forced to retreat rains are sometimes
good<00:04:39.720> early<00:04:40.170> game<00:04:40.380> against<00:04:40.920> protoss<00:04:41.250> as<00:04:41.490> they

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
good early game against protoss as they

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.230 
good early game against protoss as they
take<00:04:42.570> for<00:04:42.900> four<00:04:43.770> shots<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.160> die<00:04:44.340> but<00:04:45.030> with<00:04:45.150> this

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
take for four shots to die but with this

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.400 
take for four shots to die but with this
tank<00:04:45.510> support<00:04:45.690> and<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:47.870> medics<00:04:48.870> they're

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
tank support and this medics they're

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.550 
tank support and this medics they're
very<00:04:49.590> deadly<00:04:49.920> in<00:04:50.130> early<00:04:50.430> game<00:04:50.610> two<00:04:50.970> dragoons

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
very deadly in early game two dragoons

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.400 
very deadly in early game two dragoons
because<00:04:52.560> dragoons<00:04:52.950> need<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.370> have<00:04:53.490> pretty

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
because dragoons need to have pretty

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.540 
because dragoons need to have pretty
larger<00:04:55.410> numbers<00:04:55.710> in<00:04:55.920> order<00:04:56.100> to<00:04:56.190> fend<00:04:56.400> off

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
larger numbers in order to fend off

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.020 
larger numbers in order to fend off
these<00:04:57.270> kind<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:57.600> units<00:04:58.370> but<00:04:59.370> if<00:04:59.550> you<00:04:59.670> micro<00:04:59.970> it

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
these kind of units but if you micro it

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.460 
these kind of units but if you micro it
well<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.390> shouldn't<00:05:00.720> be<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.900> problem<00:05:01.170> at<00:05:01.380> all

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
well it shouldn't be a problem at all

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.230 
well it shouldn't be a problem at all
because<00:05:01.680> Marines<00:05:02.100> do<00:05:02.280> very<00:05:02.520> little<00:05:02.580> to<00:05:02.820> damage

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
because Marines do very little to damage

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.660 
because Marines do very little to damage
it's<00:05:04.020> very<00:05:04.350> little<00:05:04.680> damage<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:05.040> do<00:05:05.310> goons<00:05:05.550> as

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
it's very little damage to do goons as

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.130 
it's very little damage to do goons as
well<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:06.420> you<00:05:06.480> see<00:05:06.630> both<00:05:06.810> of<00:05:06.930> them<00:05:07.050> are

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
well so you see both of them are

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.230 
well so you see both of them are
expanding<00:05:07.590> at<00:05:07.710> this<00:05:07.830> point<00:05:08.130> not<00:05:08.760> as<00:05:08.940> taking

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
expanding at this point not as taking

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.240 
expanding at this point not as taking
his<00:05:09.480> expansion<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.200> we<00:05:10.590> see<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.800> vulture<00:05:11.160> is

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
his expansion and we see a vulture is

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.490 
his expansion and we see a vulture is
coming<00:05:11.550> out<00:05:11.670> these<00:05:12.419> vultures<00:05:12.720> will<00:05:13.080> be<00:05:13.230> used

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
coming out these vultures will be used

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.300 
coming out these vultures will be used
to<00:05:13.950> harass<00:05:14.220> the<00:05:14.880> enemy<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:16.500> probes<00:05:16.770> are<00:05:17.100> one

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
to harass the enemy the probes are one

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.470 
to harass the enemy the probes are one
of<00:05:17.400> the<00:05:17.460> main<00:05:17.580> targets<00:05:18.030> that<00:05:18.210> it's<00:05:18.330> going<00:05:18.419> to

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
of the main targets that it's going to

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.420 
of the main targets that it's going to
use<00:05:18.690> and<00:05:18.960> you<00:05:19.590> see<00:05:19.770> right<00:05:19.919> now<00:05:20.070> he's<00:05:20.250> laying

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
use and you see right now he's laying

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.790 
use and you see right now he's laying
mines<00:05:20.760> these<00:05:21.419> mines<00:05:21.720> will<00:05:21.960> effectively<00:05:22.620> be

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
mines these mines will effectively be

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.560 
mines these mines will effectively be
able<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.190> stop<00:05:23.430> any<00:05:23.610> early<00:05:24.120> Dark<00:05:24.360> Templar

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
able to stop any early Dark Templar

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.140 
able to stop any early Dark Templar
attacks<00:05:25.080> and<00:05:25.320> also<00:05:26.070> provide<00:05:26.760> some<00:05:26.970> good

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
attacks and also provide some good

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.290 
attacks and also provide some good
scouting<00:05:28.010> these<00:05:29.010> mines<00:05:29.460> will<00:05:29.730> be<00:05:29.820> able<00:05:29.910> to<00:05:30.030> see

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
scouting these mines will be able to see

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.320 
scouting these mines will be able to see
where<00:05:31.140> the<00:05:31.440> enemy<00:05:32.280> is<00:05:32.310> coming<00:05:32.520> you'll<00:05:33.180> see

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
where the enemy is coming you'll see

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.790 
where the enemy is coming you'll see
that<00:05:33.419> not<00:05:33.600> all<00:05:33.750> will<00:05:33.840> probably<00:05:34.110> pant<00:05:34.350> mines<00:05:34.590> at

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
that not all will probably pant mines at

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.090 
that not all will probably pant mines at
every<00:05:35.010> choke<00:05:35.220> point<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.669> his<00:05:35.790> base<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:37.100> these

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
every choke point to his base and these

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.820 
every choke point to his base and these
also<00:05:38.940> are<00:05:39.540> good<00:05:39.750> against<00:05:39.960> dark<00:05:40.200> templars<00:05:40.590> as<00:05:40.740> i

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
also are good against dark templars as i

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.469 
also are good against dark templars as i
said<00:05:41.010> before<00:05:41.130> because<00:05:41.550> they<00:05:41.850> can<00:05:42.000> they<00:05:42.450> can

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
said before because they can they can

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.890 
said before because they can they can
attack<00:05:43.940> invisible<00:05:44.940> units<00:05:45.210> if<00:05:45.450> they<00:05:45.570> see<00:05:45.630> them

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
attack invisible units if they see them

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.140 
attack invisible units if they see them
moving<00:05:46.460> looking<00:05:47.460> right<00:05:47.580> now<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.729> vultures

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
moving looking right now the vultures

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.219 
moving looking right now the vultures
are<00:05:48.270> just<00:05:48.390> going<00:05:48.570> around<00:05:48.690> doing<00:05:48.960> some

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
are just going around doing some

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.090 
are just going around doing some
scouting<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:50.690> expansion<00:05:51.690> for<00:05:52.229> not<00:05:52.500> be<00:05:52.860> so<00:05:53.010> is

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
scouting the expansion for not be so is

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.270 
scouting the expansion for not be so is
complete<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.580> not<00:05:53.940> as<00:05:54.060> expansion<00:05:54.540> is<00:05:54.630> also

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
complete and not as expansion is also

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.560 
complete and not as expansion is also
going<00:05:56.280> to<00:05:56.370> be<00:05:56.430> finished<00:05:56.669> very<00:05:57.030> shortly<00:05:57.330> as

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
going to be finished very shortly as

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.350 
going to be finished very shortly as
well<00:05:58.100> the<00:05:59.100> second<00:05:59.430> factory<00:05:59.790> is<00:06:00.000> finally

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
well the second factory is finally

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.500 
well the second factory is finally
coming<00:06:00.630> up<00:06:00.720> for<00:06:00.870> nada<00:06:01.020> and<00:06:01.850> I'd<00:06:02.850> say<00:06:03.210> that<00:06:03.419> if

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
coming up for nada and I'd say that if

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.090 
coming up for nada and I'd say that if
you<00:06:03.600> did<00:06:03.720> not<00:06:03.840> get<00:06:04.020> those<00:06:04.169> early<00:06:04.440> five<00:06:04.740> or<00:06:04.919> six

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
you did not get those early five or six

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.370 
you did not get those early five or six
Marines<00:06:05.400> with<00:06:05.729> the<00:06:05.820> tank<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:06.419> medic<00:06:06.720> then

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
Marines with the tank and the medic then

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.710 
Marines with the tank and the medic then
he<00:06:07.530> would<00:06:07.770> have<00:06:08.060> definitely<00:06:09.060> not<00:06:09.419> have<00:06:09.570> been

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
he would have definitely not have been

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.800 
he would have definitely not have been
able<00:06:09.810> to<00:06:09.960> hold<00:06:10.440> his<00:06:10.830> expansion<00:06:11.540> by<00:06:12.540> doing<00:06:12.780> this

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
able to hold his expansion by doing this

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.570 
able to hold his expansion by doing this
he<00:06:12.960> was<00:06:13.140> able<00:06:13.320> to<00:06:14.540> get<00:06:15.540> his<00:06:15.750> expansion<00:06:16.260> up<00:06:16.580> you

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
he was able to get his expansion up you

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.340 
he was able to get his expansion up you
see<00:06:17.760> that<00:06:17.940> be<00:06:18.150> soo<00:06:18.360> was<00:06:18.780> taking<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.110> advantage

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
see that be soo was taking the advantage

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.600 
see that be soo was taking the advantage
of<00:06:21.320> putting<00:06:22.320> a<00:06:22.380> little<00:06:22.530> pressure<00:06:22.590> on<00:06:23.160> nada

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
of putting a little pressure on nada

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.790 
of putting a little pressure on nada
with<00:06:24.419> history<00:06:24.720> goons<00:06:24.930> and<00:06:25.229> he<00:06:25.380> took<00:06:25.560> an

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
with history goons and he took an

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.680 
with history goons and he took an
expansion<00:06:26.280> we<00:06:26.430> see<00:06:26.640> a<00:06:26.669> citadel<00:06:27.030> of<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.479> dune

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
expansion we see a citadel of a dune

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.320 
expansion we see a citadel of a dune
coming<00:06:28.050> up<00:06:28.200> as<00:06:28.380> well<00:06:28.950> as<00:06:29.250> an<00:06:29.550> observatory<00:06:29.940> for

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
coming up as well as an observatory for

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.050 
coming up as well as an observatory for
observers<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:31.560> the<00:06:31.950> citadel<00:06:32.370> of<00:06:32.490> dune<00:06:32.789> will

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 
observers the the citadel of dune will

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.860 
observers the the citadel of dune will
definitely<00:06:33.419> be<00:06:33.510> used

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
definitely be used

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.100 
definitely be used
to<00:06:33.930> make<00:06:34.080> speed<00:06:34.470> lots<00:06:35.090> or<00:06:36.090> in<00:06:36.900> other<00:06:37.050> words

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
to make speed lots or in other words

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.910 
to make speed lots or in other words
they<00:06:37.740> will<00:06:37.890> get<00:06:37.980> the<00:06:38.130> speed<00:06:38.370> upgrade<00:06:38.730> for<00:06:39.060> the

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
they will get the speed upgrade for the

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.170 
they will get the speed upgrade for the
zealots<00:06:40.920> zealots<00:06:41.670> and<00:06:42.740> so<00:06:43.740> let's<00:06:43.920> really<00:06:44.490> need

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
zealots zealots and so let's really need

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.680 
zealots zealots and so let's really need
speed<00:06:45.960> upgrades<00:06:46.500> because<00:06:46.980> they<00:06:47.820> set<00:06:48.360> lots<00:06:48.570> of

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
speed upgrades because they set lots of

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.110 
speed upgrades because they set lots of
times<00:06:48.900> they'll<00:06:49.260> either<00:06:49.500> be<00:06:49.620> used<00:06:49.950> as<00:06:50.190> zealot

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
times they'll either be used as zealot

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.230 
times they'll either be used as zealot
bombs<00:06:51.770> when<00:06:52.770> you<00:06:52.950> take<00:06:53.130> a<00:06:53.160> shuttle<00:06:53.550> and<00:06:53.700> you

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 
bombs when you take a shuttle and you

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.170 
bombs when you take a shuttle and you
drop<00:06:54.720> them<00:06:54.870> in<00:06:55.050> the<00:06:55.140> middle<00:06:55.260> of<00:06:55.620> a<00:06:56.010> Terran<00:06:56.580> army

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
drop them in the middle of a Terran army

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.950 
drop them in the middle of a Terran army
because<00:06:57.960> usually<00:06:58.200> Terrence<00:06:58.920> don't<00:06:59.190> have<00:06:59.960> any

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:00.960 
because usually Terrence don't have any

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.190 
because usually Terrence don't have any
anti<00:07:01.350> air<00:07:01.590> or<00:07:01.890> very<00:07:02.610> little<00:07:02.820> at<00:07:03.030> least<00:07:03.060> and<00:07:03.510> the

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
anti air or very little at least and the

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.560 
anti air or very little at least and the
tanks<00:07:04.650> and<00:07:04.830> mines<00:07:05.160> will<00:07:05.460> do<00:07:05.910> friendly<00:07:06.240> fire<00:07:06.420> we

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
tanks and mines will do friendly fire we

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.240 
tanks and mines will do friendly fire we
see<00:07:06.750> these<00:07:07.140> two<00:07:07.290> is<00:07:07.410> also<00:07:07.590> getting<00:07:07.860> a<00:07:08.010> very

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
see these two is also getting a very

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.670 
see these two is also getting a very
fast<00:07:08.550> expansion<00:07:09.000> at<00:07:09.210> this<00:07:09.360> point<00:07:09.600> at<00:07:10.560> the

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
fast expansion at this point at the

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.950 
fast expansion at this point at the
double<00:07:10.950> gas<00:07:11.130> I<00:07:11.490> don't<00:07:12.120> know<00:07:12.330> if<00:07:12.480> this<00:07:12.750> is<00:07:12.780> the

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
double gas I don't know if this is the

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.810 
double gas I don't know if this is the
version<00:07:13.350> with<00:07:13.620> the<00:07:13.680> double<00:07:13.980> gas<00:07:14.130> it<00:07:14.430> seems

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:14.820 
version with the double gas it seems

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.820 
version with the double gas it seems
like<00:07:15.000> it<00:07:15.030> is<00:07:15.150> we<00:07:15.750> see<00:07:15.870> the<00:07:15.990> fourth<00:07:16.230> gateway<00:07:16.560> for

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:16.830 
like it is we see the fourth gateway for

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.340 
like it is we see the fourth gateway for
be<00:07:16.950> so<00:07:17.010> is<00:07:17.220> also<00:07:17.490> coming<00:07:17.730> up<00:07:17.940> and<00:07:18.180> as<00:07:19.050> I<00:07:19.170> said

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
be so is also coming up and as I said

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.050 
be so is also coming up and as I said
before<00:07:19.380> speed<00:07:20.040> zealots<00:07:20.460> are<00:07:20.610> also<00:07:20.760> very

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.060 
before speed zealots are also very

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.020 
before speed zealots are also very
useful<00:07:21.120> as<00:07:21.740> they<00:07:22.740> can<00:07:22.920> oh<00:07:23.130> this<00:07:23.640> part<00:07:23.910> is

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
useful as they can oh this part is

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.960 
useful as they can oh this part is
ending<00:07:24.390> right<00:07:24.510> now<00:07:24.660> so<00:07:24.900> I
