00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
people might say it to D right because

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.170 
people might say it to D right because
DS<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.090> base<00:02:46.330> yeah<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.500> not<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:48.040> G<00:02:48.400> over<00:02:48.970> D

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
DS in the base yeah it's not to G over D

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.020 
DS in the base yeah it's not to G over D
or<00:02:49.630> if<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.350> wanted<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.650> look<00:02:50.890> at<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.490> D

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
or if you wanted to look at it as a D

or if you wanted to look at it as a D
chord

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
the sus chord or another way of labeling

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.850 
the sus chord or another way of labeling
is<00:03:02.740> AG<00:03:03.580> over<00:03:04.330> D<00:03:04.540> I'll<00:03:04.959> see<00:03:05.170> some<00:03:05.410> people<00:03:05.680> like

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
is AG over D I'll see some people like

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.550 
is AG over D I'll see some people like
say<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.250> that's<00:03:06.520> like<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.790> G<00:03:07.540> chord<00:03:07.570> that's

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
say that that's like a G chord that's

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.050 
say that that's like a G chord that's
not<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.770> G<00:03:09.010> chord<00:03:09.040> I<00:03:09.340> talked<00:03:09.520> about<00:03:09.550> this<00:03:09.820> in<00:03:10.000> a
