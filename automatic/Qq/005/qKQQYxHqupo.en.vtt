00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
started so I'm starting by creating a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.369 
started so I'm starting by creating a
perfect<00:00:53.760> part<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.270> as<00:00:54.360> perfect<00:00:54.750> as<00:00:54.840> possible

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
perfect part or as perfect as possible

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
perfect part or as perfect as possible
in<00:00:55.559> down<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.070> middle<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:56.910> creating<00:00:57.360> two

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
in down the middle then I'm creating two

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.160 
in down the middle then I'm creating two
diagonal<00:00:58.320> parts<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.309> side<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.989> I'm<00:01:00.989> going

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
diagonal parts to the side and I'm going

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.660 
diagonal parts to the side and I'm going
to<00:01:01.199> put<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.469> rest<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> hair<00:01:02.010> away<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.550> do

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
to put the rest of the hair away so I do

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.280 
to put the rest of the hair away so I do
not<00:01:03.000> get<00:01:03.239> messed<00:01:03.480> up<00:01:05.750> then<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.200> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
not get messed up then I'm just going to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
not get messed up then I'm just going to
start<00:01:07.500> braiding<00:01:07.740> like<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> would<00:01:08.430> normally<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
start braiding like I would normally a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.270 
start braiding like I would normally a
French<00:01:09.360> braid<00:01:09.570> starting<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:12.260> and

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
French braid starting from the top and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.950 
French braid starting from the top and
this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> really<00:01:14.610> simple<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.360> long<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.780> did

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
this is really simple as long as you did

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140 
this is really simple as long as you did
your<00:01:16.140> parts<00:01:16.950> correctly<00:01:17.159> that's<00:01:17.670> probably<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
your parts correctly that's probably the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.999 
your parts correctly that's probably the
hardest<00:01:18.180> part<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> once<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.500> reach<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
hardest part so once you reach the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.679 
hardest part so once you reach the
bottom<00:01:23.220> you're<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.880> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> curve<00:01:24.450> your

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
bottom you're just going to curve your

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.380 
bottom you're just going to curve your
braid<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.619> side<00:01:26.130> kind<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.210> I'm

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
braid to the side kind of the way I'm

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.469 
braid to the side kind of the way I'm
doing<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.250> grab<00:01:29.250> all<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> baby<00:01:29.820> hairs<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.270> have

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
doing and grab all the baby hairs I have

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.179 
doing and grab all the baby hairs I have
lots<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.020> them<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.590> kind<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> start

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
lots of them and just kind of start

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.300 
lots of them and just kind of start
braiding<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> side<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.189> have

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
braiding to the side and you don't have

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
braiding to the side and you don't have
to<00:01:35.460> braid<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.909> lot<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> little

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
to braid a lot you can just do a little

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.530 
to braid a lot you can just do a little
bit<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.650> long<00:01:37.799> as<00:01:37.979> it's<00:01:38.130> secure<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> then

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
bit just as long as it's secure and then

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.850 
bit just as long as it's secure and then
just<00:01:39.720> braid<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> normal<00:01:40.470> braid<00:01:40.680> without

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
just braid like a normal braid without

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.170 
just braid like a normal braid without
attaching<00:01:41.640> any<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:42.090> hair<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.000 

so<00:01:48.900> once<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.260> your<00:01:49.380> little<00:01:49.500> braids<00:01:49.770> just

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
so once you have your little braids just

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.970 
so once you have your little braids just
pin<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.120> side<00:01:51.330> of<00:01:51.480> your<00:01:51.570> head<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:54.980> then

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:55.980 
pin it to the side of your head and then

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.800 
pin it to the side of your head and then
for<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.280> second<00:01:56.640> part<00:01:56.910> you<00:01:57.090> might<00:01:57.510> have<00:01:57.690> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
for the second part you might have to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.090 
for the second part you might have to
redo<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> couple<00:01:58.320> times<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.800> make<00:01:58.920> sure

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
redo it a couple times to make sure

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.290 
redo it a couple times to make sure
they're<00:01:59.250> both<00:01:59.400> symmetrical<00:02:00.150> because

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
they're both symmetrical because

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.060 
they're both symmetrical because
