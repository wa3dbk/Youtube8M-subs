drilling device you've got here what
what's<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.800> application<00:00:26.369> for<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.550> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
what's the application for that the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.480 
what's the application for that the
application<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.500> for<00:00:29.010> cross<00:00:29.189> tiles

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
application for this is for cross tiles

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.519 
application for this is for cross tiles
for<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.910> drilling<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> holes<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.410> make

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
for the drilling of the holes to make

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.110 
for the drilling of the holes to make
sure<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.859> they<00:00:31.920> all<00:00:32.070> stay<00:00:32.369> lined<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:32.940> you

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
sure that they all stay lined up you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.940 
sure that they all stay lined up you
want<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.450> crossed<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.960> perfectly<00:00:34.500> centered

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
want your crossed out perfectly centered

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.880 
want your crossed out perfectly centered
with<00:00:35.250> your<00:00:35.460> connector<00:00:36.390> bolt<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.440> we're<00:00:37.620> not

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
with your connector bolt so we're not

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.410 
with your connector bolt so we're not
we're<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.219> ready<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> assemble<00:00:38.940> hardware

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
we're now ready to assemble hardware

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.700 
we're now ready to assemble hardware
category<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.110> what<00:00:40.260> we're<00:00:40.379> talking<00:00:40.649> about

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
category is what we're talking about

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
category is what we're talking about
here<00:00:40.860> that's<00:00:41.340> exactly<00:00:41.489> right<00:00:41.940> yep<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.750> it's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
here that's exactly right yep so it's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
here that's exactly right yep so it's
just<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> very<00:00:43.350> very<00:00:43.440> simple<00:00:43.829> way<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
just a very very simple way to do it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
just a very very simple way to do it
it's<00:00:44.879> just<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.329> chunk<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.629> metal<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:46.469> see<00:00:46.649> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it's just a chunk of metal we see in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889 
it's just a chunk of metal we see in
seated<00:00:47.100> out<00:00:47.280> Papa<00:00:48.059> couple<00:00:48.390> holes<00:00:48.570> where<00:00:48.809> they

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
seated out Papa couple holes where they

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.569 
seated out Papa couple holes where they
exactly<00:00:49.260> should<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> takes<00:00:50.219> all<00:00:50.430> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
exactly should be so it takes all the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.770 
exactly should be so it takes all the
guesswork<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.180> keeping<00:00:51.449> everything

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
guesswork out of keeping everything

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.470 
guesswork out of keeping everything
perfectly<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.620> line<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.670> once<00:00:53.910> we've<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.270> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
perfectly in line so once we've got this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.770 
perfectly in line so once we've got this
secure<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> piece<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.730> hole<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.660> going

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
secure do a piece the one hole is going

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.569 
secure do a piece the one hole is going
to<00:00:57.840> come<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.109> way<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> bolt<00:00:58.800> second

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
to come this way for the bolt second

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.939 
to come this way for the bolt second
hole<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.390> dowel<00:01:00.570> whoa<00:01:01.020> there's

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
hole this way for the dowel whoa there's

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
hole this way for the dowel whoa there's
the<00:01:02.070> drop<00:01:02.309> test<00:01:02.550> how'd<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> do<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.359> it's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the drop test how'd I do right it's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.570 
the drop test how'd I do right it's
great<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:04.559> durable<00:01:04.830> it's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
great and it's very durable it's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.020 
great and it's very durable it's
extremely<00:01:06.090> durable<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.820> most<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.939> your

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
extremely durable and most of your

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.640 
extremely durable and most of your
products<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.510> anodized<00:01:10.020> aluminum<00:01:10.470> right

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
products are anodized aluminum right

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.090 
products are anodized aluminum right
just<00:01:11.010> about<00:01:11.189> every<00:01:11.490> single<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.390> right

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
just about every single one that's right

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
just about every single one that's right
now<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:14.580> looks<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.479> great<00:01:15.810> little

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
now this one looks like a great little

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380 
now this one looks like a great little
problem<00:01:16.710> solver<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.430> what<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.180> got<00:01:18.360> here

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
problem solver and what do we got here

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.230 
problem solver and what do we got here
this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> called<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> bit<00:01:19.650> vice<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:21.119> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
this is called the bit vice and what you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.140 
this is called the bit vice and what you
do<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> it's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> big<00:01:22.770> hunk<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.159> aluminum<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
do is it's a big hunk of aluminum and a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.120 
do is it's a big hunk of aluminum and a
couple<00:01:24.390> pieces<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.810> stainless<00:01:25.320> steel<00:01:25.350> that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
couple pieces of stainless steel that

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.569 
couple pieces of stainless steel that
act<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> jaw<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.810> keep<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.409> cutter<00:01:28.890> still

act as a jaw to keep your cutter still

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
act as a jaw to keep your cutter still
it's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.420> whole<00:01:30.600> lot<00:01:30.840> easier<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.290> try<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> switch

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it's a whole lot easier to try to switch

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's a whole lot easier to try to switch
out<00:01:32.159> bearings<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.900> nuts<00:01:34.110> and

table or in the router even worse you
risk<00:01:43.890> damaging<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.520> cutter<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.390> your<00:01:45.750> fingers

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
risk damaging the cutter or your fingers

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.800 
risk damaging the cutter or your fingers
so<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.680> far<00:01:47.159> far<00:01:47.460> easier<00:01:47.729> far<00:01:48.180> safer<00:01:48.450> just<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so it's far far easier far safer just to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.510 
so it's far far easier far safer just to
do<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.170> here<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.680> vice<00:01:49.890> but

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
do it right here in the bit vice but

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
do it right here in the bit vice but
it's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.060> great<00:01:51.270> point<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.780> because<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.110> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it's a great point here because one of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.740 
it's a great point here because one of
the<00:01:52.259> things<00:01:52.320> I've<00:01:52.649> seen<00:01:52.829> happen<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.369> that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
the things I've seen happen is that

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.850 
the things I've seen happen is that
woodworkers<00:01:54.750> will<00:01:54.960> work<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
woodworkers will work on this in the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.499 
woodworkers will work on this in the
router<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.520> put<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> collar<00:01:56.909> trench<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
router and they put a collar trench on

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.209 
router and they put a collar trench on
there<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.469> they<00:01:58.619> don't<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.979> there

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
there and what they don't know is there

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.830 
there and what they don't know is there
actually<00:01:59.549> loosening<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> Kyle<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.630> at<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
actually loosening the Kyle it at the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.359 
actually loosening the Kyle it at the
same<00:02:01.049> time<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.439> their<00:02:01.560> loosening<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> nut<00:02:02.100> up

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
same time as their loosening the nut up

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.130 
same time as their loosening the nut up
on<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:02.969> they<00:02:03.360> find<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
on here and they find that out when the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.530 
on here and they find that out when the
bit<00:02:04.290> comes<00:02:04.530> loose<00:02:04.770> under<00:02:05.250> power<00:02:05.640> which<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
bit comes loose under power which is

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.330 
bit comes loose under power which is
generally<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.350> bad<00:02:07.409> thing<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> pretty

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
generally a bad thing not a pretty

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
generally a bad thing not a pretty
picture<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:09.090> right<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.720> nice<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.080> it's

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
picture that's right very nice and it's

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.620 
picture that's right very nice and it's
man<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.890> substantial<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.000> is

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
man is that substantial that is

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.850 
man is that substantial that is
very<00:02:12.750> heavy<00:02:12.930> yeah<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:16.170> had<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> second

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
very heavy yeah if this had a second

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.500 
very heavy yeah if this had a second
hole<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.160> here<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.430> would<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> two-bit<00:02:18.300> vice

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
hole in here it would be a two-bit vice

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.300 
hole in here it would be a two-bit vice
that's<00:02:18.870> right<00:02:21.260> all<00:02:22.260> right<00:02:22.380> now<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.130> not

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that's right all right now this is not

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.360 
that's right all right now this is not
just<00:02:23.990> now<00:02:24.990> in<00:02:25.140> addition<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.500> these<00:02:25.710> products

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
you've got a whole new concept on a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.980 
you've got a whole new concept on a
feather<00:02:29.130> board<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.940> walk<00:02:30.570> us<00:02:30.600> through

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
feather board here so walk us through

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.210 
feather board here so walk us through
what<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.290> got<00:02:31.440> cooking<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> new

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
what you got cooking with the new

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.250 
what you got cooking with the new
feather<00:02:32.430> board<00:02:32.640> okay<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.300> big<00:02:33.480> idea<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:34.050> this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
feather board okay the big idea on this

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.560 
feather board okay the big idea on this
is<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:34.950> totally<00:02:35.400> new<00:02:35.580> twist<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.270> feather

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
is it's a totally new twist on a feather

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.990 
is it's a totally new twist on a feather
board<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.080> order<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.890> adjust<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.400> tension<00:02:38.610> on

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
board in order to adjust the tension on

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.270 
board in order to adjust the tension on
your<00:02:39.350> feathers<00:02:40.350> on<00:02:40.860> every<00:02:41.160> other

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
your feathers on every other

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.340 
your feathers on every other
featherboard<00:02:41.820> out<00:02:42.000> there<00:02:42.240> you're<00:02:43.020> having<00:02:43.260> to

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
featherboard out there you're having to

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.980 
featherboard out there you're having to
lift<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.830> lower<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:45.210> entire<00:02:45.450> feather<00:02:45.780> board

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
lift and lower the entire feather board

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.170 
lift and lower the entire feather board
up<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.320> down<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.770> set<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.730> write<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:47.970> our

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
up and down and set it just write to our

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.390 
up and down and set it just write to our
stock<00:02:48.540> or<00:02:49.080> try<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.470> set<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.010> right<00:02:50.190> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
stock or try to set it just right and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.400 
stock or try to set it just right and
try<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.760> do<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.090> right<00:02:51.270> exactly<00:02:51.990> where<00:02:52.170> this

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
try to do it right exactly where this

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.070 
try to do it right exactly where this
you<00:02:53.220> rested<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.730> your<00:02:53.880> board<00:02:54.090> tighten<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.960> up

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
you rested on your board tighten it up

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.960 
you rested on your board tighten it up
and<00:02:55.320> that's<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.830> last<00:02:56.070> time<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.550> ever<00:02:56.580> have

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and that's the last time you ever have

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.270 
and that's the last time you ever have
to<00:02:57.150> move<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.510> entire<00:02:57.780> feather<00:02:58.140> board<00:02:58.350> instead

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to move the entire feather board instead

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.300 
to move the entire feather board instead
we<00:03:00.210> use<00:03:00.240> this<00:03:00.660> plate<00:03:00.990> drive<00:03:01.740> it<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.160> down

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
we use this plate drive it up and down

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.910 
we use this plate drive it up and down
and<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.640> puts<00:03:02.940> more<00:03:03.330> or<00:03:03.660> less<00:03:03.960> pressure<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.590> the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
and it puts more or less pressure on the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.440 
and it puts more or less pressure on the
feathers<00:03:05.250> themselves<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.000> it<00:03:06.120> doesn't<00:03:06.270> make

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
feathers themselves so it doesn't make

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.850 
feathers themselves so it doesn't make
them<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:06.780> flexible<00:03:07.200> when<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.590> all<00:03:07.740> the<00:03:07.830> way

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
them so flexible when it's all the way

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.570 
them so flexible when it's all the way
down<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.490> position<00:03:10.100> when<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.130> slide<00:03:11.430> it

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
down in that position when you slide it

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.690 
down in that position when you slide it
up<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:12.840> takes<00:03:13.050> all<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> pressure<00:03:13.320> off<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.520> it's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
up it takes all the pressure off so it's

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.400 
up it takes all the pressure off so it's
a<00:03:14.880> like<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.210> micro<00:03:15.600> adjust<00:03:15.960> for<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.170> feather

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
a like a micro adjust for a feather

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.160 
a like a micro adjust for a feather
board<00:03:16.670> well<00:03:17.670> that's<00:03:17.790> pretty<00:03:17.970> cool<00:03:18.240> now<00:03:18.540> from

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
board well that's pretty cool now from

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.600 
board well that's pretty cool now from
here<00:03:19.200> what<00:03:19.530> we're<00:03:19.680> going<00:03:19.770> to<00:03:19.860> do<00:03:19.950> move<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.520> a

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
here what we're going to do move just a

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.400 
here what we're going to do move just a
little<00:03:20.640> bit<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.150> there's<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.690> whole<00:03:21.870> table

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
tool that we could possibly have so give

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.800 
tool that we could possibly have so give
us<00:03:47.400> kind<00:03:47.580> of<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.790> low-down<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.360> what<00:03:48.510> the

products<00:03:49.230> are<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.620> what<00:03:49.740> they're<00:03:49.920> all<00:03:50.040> about

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
products are and what they're all about

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.949 
products are and what they're all about
sure<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.180> actually<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.630> really<00:03:51.840> cool

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
sure this is actually a really cool

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.840 
sure this is actually a really cool
program<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.920> we've<00:03:53.040> got<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.550> on<00:03:53.640> with

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
program that we've got going on with

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.840 
program that we've got going on with
woodpeckers<00:03:54.500> we<00:03:55.500> get<00:03:55.650> ideas<00:03:56.160> from<00:03:56.370> customers

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
woodpeckers we get ideas from customers

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.270 
woodpeckers we get ideas from customers
and<00:03:57.060> sometimes<00:03:57.420> within<00:03:57.750> our<00:03:57.959> own<00:03:58.100> company<00:03:59.100> of

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and sometimes within our own company of

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.280 
and sometimes within our own company of
tools<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.270> would<00:04:00.330> be<00:04:00.480> awesome<00:04:00.660> if<00:04:01.020> we<00:04:01.140> can

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
tools that would be awesome if we can

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.770 
tools that would be awesome if we can
make<00:04:01.440> them<00:04:01.590> but<00:04:01.950> impossible<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.610> stock<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.420> we

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
make them but impossible to stock so we

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.680 
make them but impossible to stock so we
let<00:04:03.959> customers<00:04:04.200> pre-order<00:04:05.090> these<00:04:06.090> tools<00:04:06.360> and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
let customers pre-order these tools and

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.780 
let customers pre-order these tools and
we<00:04:06.840> only<00:04:07.080> make<00:04:07.410> enough<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.980> fill<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> orders

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
we only make enough to fill the orders

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.820 
we only make enough to fill the orders
so<00:04:09.450> we<00:04:09.570> end<00:04:09.690> up<00:04:09.810> with<00:04:09.989> some<00:04:10.200> really<00:04:10.500> really

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
so we end up with some really really

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.280 
so we end up with some really really
cool<00:04:11.190> tools<00:04:11.580> like<00:04:11.940> this<00:04:12.150> one<00:04:12.360> here<00:04:12.630> oops

machined out of one chunk of aluminum so

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.480 
machined out of one chunk of aluminum so
this<00:04:48.750> this<00:04:48.960> started<00:04:49.440> life<00:04:49.620> as<00:04:49.890> one<00:04:50.100> big<00:04:50.280> piece

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
this this started life as one big piece

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.210 
this this started life as one big piece
there<00:04:50.760> are<00:04:50.850> no<00:04:50.970> welds<00:04:51.390> in<00:04:51.510> there<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.220> the

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
there are no welds in there and the

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.030 
there are no welds in there and the
concept<00:04:53.700> is<00:04:53.850> I'm<00:04:54.030> putting<00:04:54.390> a<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:55.680> can't

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
concept is I'm putting a I can't

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.320 
concept is I'm putting a I can't
remember<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.430> ledge<00:04:56.610> size<00:04:56.880> a<00:04:56.990> what<00:04:57.990> Evan<00:04:59.330> into

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
remember the ledge size a what Evan into

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.570 
remember the ledge size a what Evan into
the<00:05:00.419> hole<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.930> scratch<00:05:01.860> a<00:05:02.010> line<00:05:02.160> with<00:05:02.400> that

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
the hole and scratch a line with that

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.850 
the hole and scratch a line with that
you<00:05:02.880> got<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.240> all<00:05:03.479> right<00:05:03.690> so<00:05:03.870> that's<00:05:03.960> one<00:05:04.320> and

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
you got it all right so that's one and

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.960 
you got it all right so that's one and
then<00:05:05.220> we've<00:05:05.580> got<00:05:05.810> various<00:05:07.010> tools<00:05:08.010> same

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
then we've got various tools same

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.290 
then we've got various tools same
concept<00:05:09.590> different<00:05:10.590> size<00:05:10.979> almost<00:05:11.880> dropped

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
concept different size almost dropped

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.219 
concept different size almost dropped
that<00:05:12.479> one<00:05:12.660> like<00:05:12.810> i<00:05:12.900> did<00:05:14.510> this<00:05:15.510> radius<00:05:15.990> jig

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
that one like i did this radius jig

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.540 
that one like i did this radius jig
that's<00:05:16.440> pretty<00:05:16.680> cool<00:05:16.830> what<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.130> got<00:05:17.250> cooking

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
that's pretty cool what you got cooking

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.270 
that's pretty cool what you got cooking
there<00:05:17.700> let<00:05:18.030> me<00:05:18.150> get<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.390> board

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.930 

in<00:05:21.760> order<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.060> put<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.480> real<00:05:23.020> nice<00:05:23.670> corner<00:05:24.670> on

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
in order to put a real nice corner on

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.810 
in order to put a real nice corner on
here<00:05:25.389> radius<00:05:26.200> all<00:05:26.889> you<00:05:27.130> do<00:05:27.250> on<00:05:27.370> this<00:05:27.520> one<00:05:27.730> you

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
here radius all you do on this one you

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.250 
here radius all you do on this one you
don't<00:05:27.850> have<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.300> nail<00:05:28.510> it<00:05:28.540> you<00:05:28.810> don't<00:05:29.050> have<00:05:29.110> to

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
don't have to nail it you don't have to

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.510 
don't have to nail it you don't have to
double<00:05:29.889> side<00:05:30.100> tape<00:05:30.130> it<00:05:32.910> like<00:05:33.910> that<00:05:35.280> I've<00:05:36.280> got

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
double side tape it like that I've got

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.900 
double side tape it like that I've got
like<00:05:37.270> that<00:05:37.540> okay<00:05:38.310> you<00:05:39.310> can<00:05:39.460> hold<00:05:39.610> it<00:05:39.760> with<00:05:39.850> your

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
like that okay you can hold it with your

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.480 
like that okay you can hold it with your
finger<00:05:40.419> and<00:05:40.570> do<00:05:40.990> your<00:05:41.230> horn<00:05:41.919> and<00:05:42.070> do<00:05:42.130> a<00:05:42.160> flush

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
finger and do your horn and do a flush

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.240 
finger and do your horn and do a flush
trim<00:05:42.720> that's<00:05:43.720> that<00:05:44.110> is<00:05:44.350> really<00:05:44.680> cool<00:05:44.860> that's

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
trim that's that is really cool that's

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.670 
trim that's that is really cool that's
well<00:05:45.880> beyond<00:05:46.389> the<00:05:46.600> radius<00:05:47.050> so<00:05:47.260> it<00:05:47.380> ends<00:05:47.620> up

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
well beyond the radius so it ends up

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.980 
well beyond the radius so it ends up
nice<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:47.980> smooth<00:05:48.460> no<00:05:48.760> transitions<00:05:49.510> visible

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
nice and smooth no transitions visible

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.870 
nice and smooth no transitions visible
because<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.919> way<00:05:51.040> it's<00:05:51.220> captured<00:05:51.700> on<00:05:51.850> the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
because the way it's captured on the

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.810 
because the way it's captured on the
wood<00:05:52.440> lends<00:05:53.440> itself<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:53.890> the<00:05:54.070> lateral

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
wood lends itself to the lateral

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.980 
wood lends itself to the lateral
pressure<00:05:55.120> that's<00:05:55.390> going<00:05:55.510> to<00:05:55.570> come<00:05:55.720> from<00:05:55.810> the

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
pressure that's going to come from the

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.900 
pressure that's going to come from the
flush<00:05:56.169> trim<00:05:56.320> anyway<00:05:56.680> you<00:05:56.919> got<00:05:57.100> it<00:05:57.280> you<00:05:57.700> got<00:05:57.760> it

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
flush trim anyway you got it you got it

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.030 
flush trim anyway you got it you got it
and<00:05:58.270> there's<00:05:58.570> these<00:05:58.840> there's<00:05:59.230> six<00:05:59.590> different

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
and there's these there's six different

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.490 
and there's these there's six different
ones<00:06:00.190> of<00:06:00.430> these<00:06:00.690> so<00:06:01.690> i<00:06:01.720> have<00:06:02.080> a<00:06:02.140> total<00:06:02.350> of

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
ones of these so i have a total of

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.590 
ones of these so i have a total of
twelve<00:06:02.770> different<00:06:03.070> radius<00:06:03.550> options<00:06:04.000> it's

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
twelve different radius options it's

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.680 
twelve different radius options it's
really<00:06:04.930> slick<00:06:05.169> that's<00:06:05.800> nice<00:06:06.040> and<00:06:08.400> standard

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
really slick that's nice and standard

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.690 
really slick that's nice and standard
dovetail<00:06:10.690> layout<00:06:11.080> tools<00:06:11.590> absolutely<00:06:12.580> and

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
dovetail layout tools absolutely and

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.460 
dovetail layout tools absolutely and
these<00:06:12.880> are<00:06:13.060> you<00:06:13.510> know<00:06:13.630> a<00:06:13.660> lot<00:06:14.050> different<00:06:14.410> than

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
these are you know a lot different than

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.930 
these are you know a lot different than
any<00:06:14.650> of<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.860> other<00:06:15.010> ones<00:06:15.190> you<00:06:15.280> can<00:06:15.400> find<00:06:15.640> again

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
any of the other ones you can find again

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.090 
any of the other ones you can find again
because<00:06:16.300> it's<00:06:16.630> not<00:06:16.810> just<00:06:16.870> an<00:06:17.290> extrusion<00:06:17.710> it's

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
because it's not just an extrusion it's

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.700 
because it's not just an extrusion it's
not<00:06:18.250> just<00:06:18.490> act<00:06:18.700> up<00:06:18.880> a<00:06:19.120> million<00:06:19.690> at<00:06:19.810> a<00:06:19.900> time<00:06:20.080> that

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
not just act up a million at a time that

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.670 
not just act up a million at a time that
they're<00:06:20.979> all<00:06:21.130> CNC<00:06:21.880> machine<00:06:22.530> exactly<00:06:23.530> what

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
they're all CNC machine exactly what

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.440 
they're all CNC machine exactly what
they<00:06:23.800> need<00:06:23.950> to<00:06:24.040> be<00:06:24.160> so<00:06:24.880> this<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.240> cool

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
they need to be so this is a cool

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.050 
they need to be so this is a cool
program<00:06:25.750> now<00:06:26.140> if<00:06:26.710> somebody's<00:06:27.580> ordering<00:06:27.940> out

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
program now if somebody's ordering out

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.400 
program now if somebody's ordering out
of<00:06:28.150> this<00:06:28.240> realistically<00:06:28.810> how<00:06:28.990> long<00:06:29.050> are<00:06:29.320> they

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
of this realistically how long are they

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.310 
of this realistically how long are they
going<00:06:29.530> to<00:06:29.620> wait<00:06:29.740> to<00:06:29.919> get<00:06:30.010> their<00:06:30.250> tool<00:06:30.640> in<00:06:30.850> hand

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
going to wait to get their tool in hand

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.469 
going to wait to get their tool in hand
longer<00:06:32.320> than<00:06:32.500> anybody<00:06:32.530> wants<00:06:33.190> it's<00:06:33.729> usually

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
longer than anybody wants it's usually

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.020 
longer than anybody wants it's usually
about<00:06:34.630> two<00:06:35.169> months<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:36.580> takes<00:06:36.729> a<00:06:36.850> long<00:06:36.970> time

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
about two months it takes a long time

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.120 
about two months it takes a long time
but<00:06:37.900> they're<00:06:38.229> going<00:06:38.320> to<00:06:38.410> get<00:06:38.530> exactly<00:06:39.010> what

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
but they're going to get exactly what

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:45.240 
but they're going to get exactly what
they<00:06:39.280> want<00:06:39.430> because<00:06:40.120> it's<00:06:41.020> customary<00:06:44.250> it's

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
they want because it's customary it's

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.940 
they want because it's customary it's
very<00:06:45.490> cool<00:06:45.700> so<00:06:46.000> again<00:06:46.630> Justin<00:06:47.260> here<00:06:47.470> from
