now<00:01:36.900> thinking<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.500> definition<00:01:37.920> from

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
now thinking about that definition from

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
now thinking about that definition from
3m<00:01:38.490> corporations<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.509> makes<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:39.960> about

3m corporations it makes you think about

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.080 
3m corporations it makes you think about
tinkering<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.890> his<00:01:41.100> creativity<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
tinkering and his creativity in the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.359 
tinkering and his creativity in the
senses<00:01:42.450> creativity<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> designer<00:01:43.649> how<00:01:44.189> he

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
senses creativity as a designer how he

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.920 
senses creativity as a designer how he
would<00:01:44.490> took<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.759> industrial<00:01:45.420> product<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
would took an industrial product that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.370 
would took an industrial product that
wasn't<00:01:46.409> necessarily<00:01:47.040> made<00:01:47.399> for<00:01:47.670> shoes<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
wasn't necessarily made for shoes and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.990 
wasn't necessarily made for shoes and
put<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.890> Jordan<00:01:50.250> 5<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> basically

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
put it on the Jordan 5 and basically

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.020

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
made it iconic I think it is those small

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.510 
made it iconic I think it is those small
signature<00:01:54.810> pieces<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.649> those<00:01:55.799> soft<00:01:56.070> signs<00:01:56.340> of
