 welcome to 9 in the gree 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.720
 technique 2013 challenger pleased to 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.270
 present the two new machines the 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.800
 series is behind me you can see the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:30.660
 new 700 series and that includes the new 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:35.760
 sert engine and kobe ​​hauer cylinders with 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.890
 greater power greater torque is 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.970
 reduced consumption clearly of 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.100
 fuel and sound levels decidedly 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.540
 lower than the previous series one 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.960
 new feature of this machine 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.470
 is the fuel capacity we have 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.860
 increased total capacity and now how 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 option you can have up to 770 3 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.570
 liters of diesel to get one 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.509
 greater capacity of diesel the cabin is 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.829
 been moved forward is raised by two 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:10.500
 inches to make room for the tanks 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.380
 now the tanks are also in the two 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.179
 rear fenders more power 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.780
 as much weight as possible we can put 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:23.069
 also in wagons the additional weights 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.789
 this to transmit the power to the 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:30.880
 ground the pull bar the 700 series e 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:33.039
 presents new powers and new weights 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.210
 we can add weights on the carts 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:39.609
 as well as on frontal work and the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.829
 wheels and to maintain the same 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:45.159
 ground pressure 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:48.219
 we have introduced the new ones exclusively 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.009
 34-inch singles thanks to the singles 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.350
 from 34 inches we can keep the 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.880
 very low compaction levels that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.939
 it is a characteristic of the challenger 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.509
 challenger once again introduces 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.219
 the only tractor that is exclusively 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.289
 designed designed to be a 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.310
 crawler tractor is not a compromise 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.819
 is a machine entirely dedicated to 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.819
 tracks 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.769
 another novelty that challenger present 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.230
 at the hanover fair is the 800 e series 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.510
 three important features of this 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.780
 machine are the new acco thruster 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.209
 power 12 cylinders we have a new one 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.879
 one redesigned steering linkage 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.209
 best geometry that provides a 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.400
 better control and has something new 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.000
 now the lift is available 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.140
 also on the 875 series the car more 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.329
 great 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.470
 new aco power propellers provide 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.569
 more couple and 20 more horses in a 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.440
 each of the four models in the series 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.440
 800 e
