00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.750
 we are here with doctor remains managing director of ben ten x 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.899
 which are the doctor's news that you present at the fair 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.119
 at the fair that this year we have several innovations alma we have a line 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.839
 complete with sterilization systems 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.979
 among these we present in the model we say more advanced than that 

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.749
 arranged sterilization of turbine handpieces 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.820
 ken systematic plus been then we pole our traditional machines 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.890
 which are the autoclaves with non-steel chambers instead of steel ones 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.310
 I'm from the domina plus line and then we have a new line of jo autoclaves 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.130
 multifunctional that are of the xia line completely in stainless steel 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.050
 model domina plus p is a sterilization machine that presents 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.130
 Punic and exclusive features on the sterilization art market 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.320
 beautiful car is equipped with a copper chamber 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.860
 themes that on the side of you that to the thermal conduction much higher than the stainless steel 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.870
 and this allows to sterilize all the instruments without thermal shocks 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.920
 therefore without deterioration especially of the more delicate instrumentation than 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.180
 normally that dynamic turbine handle 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.960
 it has a very low consumption therefore it is also compatible with those that are 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.270
 environmental trends god reduction of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.230
 for energy needs 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.760
 tv also with ma l me regulatory requirements and the machine is equipped with a system of 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.580
 traceability you will ensure there is sterilization and can have a 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.790
 storage of all cycles and this can take place either through the printer 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.080
 which, however, has become a bit like a half insole yes through more systems 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.310
 evolved as for example the system here is the key huwei headquarters who comes 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.970
 connected on which all the information of the be stored 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.020
 cycle 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.969
 with the same features martin moto miniaturizzato we have 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.139
 attica plus that having the smallest room allows everyone to be sterilized 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:08.039
 if the instruments very quickly then also between one patient and the other 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.649
 this is very important because normally 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.639
 the endowment of dynamic instrumentation in a fairly limited euro study 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.049
 can't wait a whole day before doing a cycle 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.129
 sterilization with this machine can be sterilized according to the rules 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.139
 of the class b therefore with systems 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.870
 ikea suitable for collecting air even from the expensive parts of the instrumentation 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:34.119
 all dinner instruments less than 12 13 minutes so even between a patient 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.370
 the high you can make a sterilization cycle I would like to do and see 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.870
 also another product that we present to you exclusively 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.180
 who is the axia plus model of is a machine that uses the same 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.970
 technology of this the same components of the more models 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.080
 known require lustra little first so it dominates plus b attica however it is 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.770
 slightly simplified guarantees quality standards of performance 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.969
 high but with prices 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:06.180
 slightly more competitive and we consider the trends to be somewhat opposite to that 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.709
 The maida is also affecting the dental sector for many years 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.759
 particularly suitable product 

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.179
 dental terraclean and also for other emerging sectors such as those of the 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:20.909
 aesthetic but of the podiatry tattoo artists and so on
