hi I'm Bill from CJ Pony parts it's no
secret<00:00:11.790> by<00:00:12.120> now<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.389> wheel<00:00:12.690> hop<00:00:12.929> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
secret by now that wheel hop is

secret by now that wheel hop is
definitely<00:00:13.590> an<00:00:13.679> issue<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> 2015

in the factory bushing locations and are

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.780 
in the factory bushing locations and are
gonna<00:00:37.440> stiffen<00:00:37.800> up<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> rear<00:00:38.280> subframe

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
gonna stiffen up the rear subframe

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
gonna stiffen up the rear subframe
that's<00:00:39.149> gonna<00:00:39.300> eliminate<00:00:39.540> wheel<00:00:40.020> hop<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.530> the

that's gonna eliminate wheel hop at the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.959 
that's gonna eliminate wheel hop at the
same<00:00:40.800> time<00:00:41.040> will<00:00:41.219> cause<00:00:41.399> no<00:00:41.610> increase<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
same time will cause no increase in

with<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.479> jack<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.140> you<00:01:20.200> start<00:01:20.440> by<00:01:20.530> removing

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
with a jack and you start by removing

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.050 
with a jack and you start by removing
the<00:01:20.950> bolts<00:01:21.280> we're<00:01:21.460> gonna<00:01:21.550> start<00:01:21.850> with<00:01:21.970> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
the bolts we're gonna start with the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:31.450 
the bolts we're gonna start with the
rear

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490 

before<00:01:32.390> we<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.510> remove<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.870> front<00:01:33.080> bolt

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
before we can remove the front bolt

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.200 
before we can remove the front bolt
these<00:01:33.800> two<00:01:34.070> small<00:01:34.340> bolts<00:01:34.610> to<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.730> bracket<00:01:35.120> up

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
these two small bolts to the bracket up

00:01:35.210 --> 00:02:04.630 
these two small bolts to the bracket up
come<00:01:35.360> off<00:01:35.480> first

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.820 

we're<00:02:05.630> gonna<00:02:05.750> slowly<00:02:06.020> lower<00:02:06.350> down<00:02:06.530> the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
we're gonna slowly lower down the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.410 
we're gonna slowly lower down the
subframe<00:02:09.340> come<00:02:10.340> down<00:02:10.490> too<00:02:10.729> far<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:11.300> enough

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
subframe come down too far just enough

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.590 
subframe come down too far just enough
to<00:02:11.660> get<00:02:11.780> up<00:02:11.870> inside<00:02:12.230> there

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
to get up inside there

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.510 
to get up inside there
you<00:02:14.600> take<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.990> thicker<00:02:15.380> spacer<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.310> go<00:02:16.430> on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
you take the thicker spacer so we go on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.250 
you take the thicker spacer so we go on
the<00:02:16.580> top<00:02:16.850> if<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.180> look<00:02:17.420> it's<00:02:17.810> actually<00:02:18.230> a

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
the top if you look it's actually a

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.700 
the top if you look it's actually a
cutout<00:02:18.910> you'll<00:02:19.910> turn<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.720> I'll<00:02:20.870> drop<00:02:21.380> into

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
cutout you'll turn it and I'll drop into

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.310 
cutout you'll turn it and I'll drop into
place<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.130> have<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.580> right<00:02:22.700> spot

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
place and you have it in the right spot

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.140 
place and you have it in the right spot
and<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.530> lower<00:02:24.770> spacer<00:02:25.370> has<00:02:25.670> these<00:02:25.850> cutouts

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
and the lower spacer has these cutouts

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:34.520 
and the lower spacer has these cutouts
here<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:27.020> go<00:02:27.170> around<00:02:27.410> these<00:02:27.530> edges

facing<00:02:56.220> upward<00:02:56.880> we're<00:02:57.000> gonna<00:02:57.120> start<00:02:57.300> by

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
facing upward we're gonna start by

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.840 
facing upward we're gonna start by
installing<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.930> small<00:02:58.200> piece<00:02:58.610> let's<00:02:59.610> spray<00:02:59.820> a

installing a small piece let's spray a
little<00:02:59.970> lubricant<00:03:00.630> make<00:03:01.260> our<00:03:01.410> life<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> little

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
little lubricant make our life a little

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.470 
little lubricant make our life a little
bit<00:03:01.950> easier<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.250> get<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.610> there

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.540 

when<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> star<00:03:07.260> from<00:03:07.470> front<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.160> sort<00:03:08.489> of

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
when the star from front and sort of

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.500 
when the star from front and sort of
turn<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.150> into<00:03:09.390> place<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:11.640> small<00:03:11.970> screwdriver

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
turn it into place the small screwdriver

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.339 
turn it into place the small screwdriver
will<00:03:12.599> make<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.780> little<00:03:13.019> bit<00:03:13.230> easier

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.170 

now<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:19.010> put<00:03:19.189> the<00:03:19.280> other<00:03:19.400> piece<00:03:19.640> in<00:03:19.849> from<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
now you put the other piece in from the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.610 
now you put the other piece in from the
outside<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:23.269> we'll<00:03:23.450> tighten<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:24.049> bolts<00:03:24.409> here

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
outside and we'll tighten the bolts here

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.970 
outside and we'll tighten the bolts here
to<00:03:24.709> draw<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:24.980> two<00:03:25.219> pieces<00:03:25.430> together

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.399 

now<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:31.940> bushings<00:03:32.420> in<00:03:32.569> place<00:03:32.840> we<00:03:33.019> lift<00:03:33.290> our

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
now the bushings in place we lift our

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.380 
now the bushings in place we lift our
subframe<00:03:33.860> back<00:03:34.220> up<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:34.580> chassis<00:03:34.819> and<00:03:35.239> bolt

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
subframe back up to the chassis and bolt

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.560 
subframe back up to the chassis and bolt
it<00:03:35.540> back

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.000 

we<00:03:43.570> get<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.810> close<00:03:44.080> but<00:03:44.320> don't<00:03:44.470> tighten<00:03:44.770> it<00:03:44.920> all

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
we get it close but don't tighten it all

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.410 
we get it close but don't tighten it all
the<00:03:45.040> way<00:03:45.250> until<00:03:45.400> we<00:03:45.610> get<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.820> front<00:03:46.060> end<00:03:46.210> then

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
the way until we get the front end then

00:03:46.420 --> 00:04:12.050 
the way until we get the front end then
we'll<00:03:46.510> torque<00:03:46.720> them<00:03:46.840> all<00:03:46.930> now

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.940 

now<00:04:12.900> we're<00:04:13.020> going<00:04:13.110> to<00:04:13.170> torque<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.560> bolts<00:04:13.709> to

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
now we're going to torque the bolts to

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:28.640 
now we're going to torque the bolts to
129<00:04:14.730> foot-pounds

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.690
