wheel the bearings are going to be your

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.789 
wheel the bearings are going to be your
only<00:00:12.980> default<00:00:13.659> only<00:00:14.659> bad<00:00:15.079> thing<00:00:15.349> about<00:00:15.589> these

wheels<00:00:16.670> we<00:00:17.359> do<00:00:17.480> have<00:00:17.660> an<00:00:17.750> upgraded<00:00:18.170> bearing

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:18.589 
wheels we do have an upgraded bearing

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.320 
wheels we do have an upgraded bearing
which<00:00:18.920> is<00:00:18.949> actually<00:00:19.369> a<00:00:19.429> car<00:00:19.640> bearing<00:00:19.970> for<00:00:20.179> car

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
which is actually a car bearing for car

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.779 
which is actually a car bearing for car
racing<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:20.949> they'll<00:00:21.949> hold<00:00:22.160> for<00:00:22.429> a<00:00:22.460> lot<00:00:22.609> better

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
racing and they'll hold for a lot better

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.429 
racing and they'll hold for a lot better
weight<00:00:23.720> and<00:00:24.080> speed<00:00:25.660> most<00:00:26.660> of<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:26.900> time<00:00:27.109> people

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
weight and speed most of the time people

will<00:00:27.529> blow<00:00:27.710> these<00:00:27.890> bearings<00:00:28.279> out<00:00:28.400> because

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
will blow these bearings out because

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.040 
will blow these bearings out because
they<00:00:28.880> over<00:00:29.210> tighten<00:00:29.539> the<00:00:29.659> bolt<00:00:31.509> but<00:00:32.509> over

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
they over tighten the bolt but over

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.270 
they over tighten the bolt but over
tightening<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.500> bolt<00:00:33.739> you're<00:00:33.890> basically

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
tightening the bolt you're basically

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.189 
tightening the bolt you're basically
pressing<00:00:34.789> out<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.239> center<00:00:35.570> piece<00:00:35.780> here<00:00:35.809> and

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
pressing out the center piece here and

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.010 
pressing out the center piece here and
it<00:00:37.039> just<00:00:37.070> presses<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:37.730> past<00:00:37.940> further<00:00:38.600> past<00:00:38.899> the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
it just presses it past further past the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.270 
it just presses it past further past the
bearings<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:39.500> then<00:00:39.620> it's<00:00:39.770> not<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:39.949> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
bearings and then it's not in the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.310 
bearings and then it's not in the
bearing<00:00:40.550> groove<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.629> it<00:00:41.750> just<00:00:41.930> blows<00:00:42.170> them

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
bearing groove and it just blows them

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.020 
bearing groove and it just blows them
out<00:00:42.469> you<00:00:42.710> can<00:00:42.770> blow<00:00:43.010> them<00:00:43.100> out<00:00:43.250> within<00:00:43.550> one

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
out you can blow them out within one

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.420 
out you can blow them out within one
ride<00:00:44.270> if<00:00:45.079> you<00:00:45.260> over<00:00:45.500> tighten<00:00:45.680> them<00:00:45.859> so<00:00:46.100> be

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
ride if you over tighten them so be

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.779 
ride if you over tighten them so be
careful<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:46.969> over<00:00:47.210> tightening<00:00:47.510> them<00:00:48.640> if<00:00:49.640> you

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
careful and over tightening them if you

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.729 
careful and over tightening them if you

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.630 
mountain you probably want a little bit
narrower<00:01:41.900> burn<00:01:42.140> axle<00:01:42.530> just<00:01:42.740> because<00:01:43.460> it's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
narrower burn axle just because it's

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.620

from<00:01:54.460> pitching<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.550> bike<00:01:55.700> over<00:01:55.940> sideways<00:01:56.330> and

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
from pitching the bike over sideways and

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.420 
from pitching the bike over sideways and
actually<00:01:57.080> falling<00:01:57.410> over<00:01:57.650> falling<00:01:57.680> off<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.190> it

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
actually falling over falling off of it

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.980 
actually falling over falling off of it
or<00:01:58.490> anything<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.030> it's<00:01:59.660> going<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.840> keep

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
or anything like that it's going to keep

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.410 
or anything like that it's going to keep
your<00:02:00.170> center<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.590> gravity<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:01.280> little<00:02:02.270> bit

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
your center of gravity a little bit

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.290 
your center of gravity a little bit
lower<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.530> more<00:02:04.100> spread<00:02:04.490> out<00:02:04.520> which<00:02:05.000> is<00:02:05.150> what

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
lower and more spread out which is what

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.190 
lower and more spread out which is what
you<00:02:05.420> want<00:02:05.630> for<00:02:05.810> 360s<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.560> anything<00:02:07.280> like<00:02:07.430> that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
you want for 360s and anything like that

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.860 
you want for 360s and anything like that
so<00:02:09.200> when<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.590> comes<00:02:09.769> down<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.870> tightening

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
so when it comes down to tightening

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.320 
so when it comes down to tightening
these<00:02:12.379> these<00:02:12.650> are<00:02:12.799> going<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.950> be<00:02:13.040> this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
these these are going to be this

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.580 
these these are going to be this
same<00:02:14.020> thing<00:02:14.260> if<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.220> put<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.410> have

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
same thing if you put it on and you have

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.910 
same thing if you put it on and you have
your<00:02:18.810> your<00:02:19.810> bowl<00:02:20.050> when<00:02:20.320> you're<00:02:20.410> tightening<00:02:20.650> it

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
your your bowl when you're tightening it

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.510 
your your bowl when you're tightening it
up<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.440> don't<00:02:23.620> want<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.890> over<00:02:24.130> tighten<00:02:24.310> it

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
up you don't want to over tighten it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.220 
up you don't want to over tighten it
because<00:02:24.700> over<00:02:25.150> tightening<00:02:25.570> it<00:02:25.720> is<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.140> to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
because over tightening it is going to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.160 
because over tightening it is going to
be<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:27.310> worst<00:02:27.550> parts<00:02:28.030> worst<00:02:28.660> thing<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.990> can
