00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
jailbreak process just like that so

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.039 
jailbreak process just like that so
pretty<00:01:20.130> straightforward<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.570> tethered

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
pretty straightforward it is a tethered

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
pretty straightforward it is a tethered
jailbreak<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> only<00:01:23.009> unfortunate

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
jailbreak that's the only unfortunate

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
jailbreak that's the only unfortunate
part<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.150> jailbreak<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.840> tether<00:01:25.500> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
part of this jailbreak but tether is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310 
part of this jailbreak but tether is
better<00:01:26.009> than<00:01:26.220> nothing<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:26.759> opinion<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.990> now

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
better than nothing in my opinion so now

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.950 
better than nothing in my opinion so now
it<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.850> downloading<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.090> jailbreak<00:01:30.659> data

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
it is downloading the jailbreak data

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
it is downloading the jailbreak data
this<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.380> familiar<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.340> matrix

this is familiar all your little matrix

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
this is familiar all your little matrix
screen<00:01:33.119> there<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> it'll<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.530> go<00:01:34.710> through

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
screen there and it'll just go through

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.840 
screen there and it'll just go through
here<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.600> get<00:01:36.600> everything<00:01:36.810> set<00:01:37.350> up

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
here and get everything set up

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.270 
here and get everything set up
accordingly<00:01:39.200> now<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> only<00:01:40.530> unfortunate

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
accordingly now the only unfortunate

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.190 
accordingly now the only unfortunate
part<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.939> jailbreak<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
part of this jailbreak is that it is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.630 
part of this jailbreak is that it is
tethered<00:01:43.680> meaning<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.520> to
