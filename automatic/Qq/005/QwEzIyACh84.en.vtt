00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
too much thud in too much oomph in what

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.530 
too much thud in too much oomph in what
you're<00:01:18.150> doing

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you're doing

switch it over I'm gonna go back to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.530 
switch it over I'm gonna go back to
normal<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.590> another<00:01:22.590> thing<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.220> mic

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540

the<00:01:24.540> rejection<00:01:24.930> from<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> rear<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:26.070> it's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the rejection from the rear because it's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.539 
the rejection from the rear because it's
a<00:01:26.400> cardioid<00:01:26.909> pattern<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.450> insane<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.710> can

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
a cardioid pattern is insane you can

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.569 
a cardioid pattern is insane you can
almost<00:01:29.700> hear<00:01:29.970> nothing<00:01:30.659> from<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.320> rear<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:32.040> far

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
almost hear nothing from the rear as far

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.399 
almost hear nothing from the rear as far
as<00:01:32.700> high<00:01:32.850> frequency<00:01:33.420> goes<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.900> almost<00:01:34.140> picks

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
as high frequency goes it almost picks

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.140 
as high frequency goes it almost picks
up<00:01:34.560> nothing<00:01:34.950> maybe<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.549> bit<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.820> Rumble

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
up nothing maybe a little bit of Rumble

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.030 
up nothing maybe a little bit of Rumble
I<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.869> looking<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> frequency<00:01:37.799> response

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I was looking at the frequency response

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.120 
I was looking at the frequency response
graph<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.479> think<00:01:39.780> any<00:01:40.140> usually<00:01:40.860> things

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
graph and I think any usually things

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.210 
graph and I think any usually things
around<00:01:41.460> under<00:01:41.790> 700<00:01:42.570> Hertz<00:01:42.770> will<00:01:43.770> make<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
around under 700 Hertz will make it to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
around under 700 Hertz will make it to
the<00:01:44.250> make<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> mic<00:01:45.240> but<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:46.380> really

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the make it to the mic but it's really

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.020 
the make it to the mic but it's really
not<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.829> big<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.280> deal<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.820> can't

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
not that big of a deal you really can't

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.520 
not that big of a deal you really can't
hear<00:01:48.180> anything<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.049> said<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.439> is

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
hear anything and like I said if that is

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.350 
hear anything and like I said if that is
a<00:01:49.560> problem<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.759> bass<00:01:50.939> roll-off

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
a problem you get that bass roll-off

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.730 
a problem you get that bass roll-off
you're<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.659> getting<00:01:51.869> anything<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:52.680> you

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
