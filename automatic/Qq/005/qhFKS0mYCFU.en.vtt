00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
they're so slippery and you can see that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720

doesn't give you any traction at all

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.090 
doesn't give you any traction at all
because<00:00:39.120> it's<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.570> slippery<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.320> there's

because it's very slippery and there's
actually<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> way<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.540> make<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
actually a way that you can make this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.770 
actually a way that you can make this
stick<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:44.969> you're<00:00:45.149> not<00:00:45.180> sliding<00:00:45.690> all

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
stick so that way you're not sliding all

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.569 
stick so that way you're not sliding all
over<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> place<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.950> actually<00:00:47.100> did<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> on

and what this is going to do once you
start<00:01:02.070> walking<00:01:02.219> around<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.820> gravel<00:01:03.210> or

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
start walking around and like gravel or

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.039 
start walking around and like gravel or
anything<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.750> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
um the gravel is gonna rough this up and

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.109 
um the gravel is gonna rough this up and
it's<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> make<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.159> get<00:01:08.280> sticky<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.729> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
it's going to make it get sticky and so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.270 
it's going to make it get sticky and so
it's<00:01:09.960> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.229> make<00:01:10.470> your<00:01:10.650> foot<00:01:10.920> stick<00:01:11.159> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280

it's going to make your foot stick to
the<00:01:11.369> ground<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.670> little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.880> better<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.330> then

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the ground a little bit better and then

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.750 
the ground a little bit better and then
also<00:01:12.630> some<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.680> tiny<00:01:13.890> rocks<00:01:14.220> might<00:01:14.490> stick

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
also some little tiny rocks might stick

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.190 
also some little tiny rocks might stick
to<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> give<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to it and that's going to give you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.010 
to it and that's going to give you
better<00:01:16.350> traction<00:01:16.820> um<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.060> well<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:18.930> not

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
better traction um as well so you're not

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
better traction um as well so you're not
slipping<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.590> sliding<00:01:19.740> all<00:01:19.950> over<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.610> also

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

you can take something like this which
is<00:01:23.189> just<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.880> um<00:01:24.590> caulking<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:26.270> silicone

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
is just like um caulking like silicone

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.109 
is just like um caulking like silicone
caulk<00:01:27.600> for<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.409> tiles<00:01:28.950> or<00:01:29.250> weather<00:01:29.640> proofing

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
caulk for like tiles or weather proofing

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.880 
caulk for like tiles or weather proofing
windows<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.630> stuff<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.770> can

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
windows and stuff like that and you can

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.350 
windows and stuff like that and you can
get<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> squeeze<00:01:32.729> tube<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.119> well

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
get it in like a squeeze tube as well

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969
