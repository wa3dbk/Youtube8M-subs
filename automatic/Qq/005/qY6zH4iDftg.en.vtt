their team needs and see what players

their team needs and see what players
could<00:00:17.220> be<00:00:17.310> possible<00:00:17.789> targets<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.420> fill<00:00:18.630> those

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
could be possible targets to fill those

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050 
could be possible targets to fill those
team<00:00:19.109> needs<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.920> first<00:00:20.160> let's<00:00:20.670> take<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.850> look

team needs but first let's take a look
at<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> draft<00:00:21.539> selections<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.050> they<00:00:22.199> have

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
at the draft selections that they have

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.179 
at the draft selections that they have

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
selections the Cardinals have coming

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.089 
selections the Cardinals have coming
into<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.199> draft<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.650> don't<00:00:28.859> have<00:00:29.070> a

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
into the draft they don't have a

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.220 
into the draft they don't have a
seventh-round<00:00:29.820> pick<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.179> they<00:00:30.269> do<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.660> 26

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
seventh-round pick but they do have 26

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.139 
seventh-round pick but they do have 26
round<00:00:31.470> selections<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> overall<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.000> don't

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
round selections and overall I don't

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.850 
round selections and overall I don't
think<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> Cardinals<00:00:33.899> are<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> bad<00:00:34.440> football

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
think the Cardinals are a bad football

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
think the Cardinals are a bad football
team<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.430> they<00:00:35.520> do<00:00:35.579> have<00:00:35.910> some<00:00:36.149> areas<00:00:36.570> they

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
team but they do have some areas they

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.420 
team but they do have some areas they
can<00:00:37.200> use<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:37.620> improvement<00:00:38.129> when<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> look

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
can use some improvement when you look

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.459 
can use some improvement when you look
at<00:00:38.520> their<00:00:38.670> team<00:00:38.910> needs<00:00:39.180> obviously<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:40.260> need

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
at their team needs obviously they need

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560 
at their team needs obviously they need
a<00:00:40.500> quarterback<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> biggest<00:00:41.700> need<00:00:42.300> in

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
a quarterback that's the biggest need in

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
a quarterback that's the biggest need in
my<00:00:42.750> opinion<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> Cardinals<00:00:44.309> their

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
my opinion for the Cardinals their

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
my opinion for the Cardinals their
offensive<00:00:44.760> line<00:00:44.879> could<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.390> byproduct<00:00:45.870> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
offensive line could be a byproduct of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.930 
offensive line could be a byproduct of
the<00:00:46.620> quarterback<00:00:46.950> play<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.460> they<00:00:47.550> also<00:00:47.700> need

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the quarterback play but they also need

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
the quarterback play but they also need
linemen<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.780> they<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.079> some<00:00:49.289> options<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.129> go

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
linemen so they have some options to go

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.680 
linemen so they have some options to go
in<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.550> draft<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> deep<00:00:51.390> trap

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
in this draft and this is a deep trap

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
in this draft and this is a deep trap
overall<00:00:52.289> look<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.129> round<00:00:53.309> pick

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
overall look in the first round pick

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
overall look in the first round pick
number<00:00:53.850> seven<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
number seven I think they go with the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
number seven I think they go with the
guard<00:00:55.649> i<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.039> chance<00:00:56.370> Warmack<00:00:56.969> will<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
guard i think chance Warmack will be a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.260 
guard i think chance Warmack will be a
great<00:00:58.379> fit<00:00:58.620> for<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.070> offensive<00:00:59.579> line<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
great fit for this offensive line and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
great fit for this offensive line and
the<00:01:00.329> reason<00:01:00.629> why<00:01:00.719> i<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:01.020> warm<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.500> going<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the reason why i have warm at going to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.740 
the reason why i have warm at going to
the<00:01:02.160> Cardinals<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.730> due<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> fact<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.629> i

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the Cardinals is due to the fact that i

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
the Cardinals is due to the fact that i
believe<00:01:04.019> Geno<00:01:04.290> Smith<00:01:04.619> will<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.070> off<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.610> board

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
believe Geno Smith will be off the board

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.910 
believe Geno Smith will be off the board
so<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.060> take<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.390> next<00:01:06.750> best<00:01:07.229> option<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.860> do

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
so you take the next best option I do

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
so you take the next best option I do
believe<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.430> offensive<00:01:08.820> lineman<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
believe the offensive lineman out of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.390 
believe the offensive lineman out of
Alabama<00:01:09.840> makes<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.830> sense<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
Alabama makes a lot of sense for the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.039 
Alabama makes a lot of sense for the
Cardinals<00:01:16.909> in<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.150> second<00:01:18.570> round<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.810> think

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
Cardinals in the second round I think

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.390 
Cardinals in the second round I think
this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.470> where<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:19.890> can<00:01:20.070> get<00:01:20.189> their

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
this is where they can get their

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
this is where they can get their
quarterback<00:01:20.970> Tyler<00:01:21.420> Wilson<00:01:21.689> has<00:01:22.049> every

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
quarterback Tyler Wilson has every

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.200 
quarterback Tyler Wilson has every
attribute<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.490> want<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:24.000> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
attribute that you want out of a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
attribute that you want out of a
quarterback<00:01:24.659> reminds<00:01:25.080> me<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> Brett

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
quarterback reminds me a lot of Brett

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.920 
quarterback reminds me a lot of Brett
Favre<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> that's<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> good<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.479> bad

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Favre and that's the good and the bad

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
Favre and that's the good and the bad
the<00:01:27.990> fact<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.409> he<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> see<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.220> throw<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
the fact that he can see it and throw it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.580 
the fact that he can see it and throw it
and<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.299> strong<00:01:30.659> arm<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.140> trust<00:01:31.409> his

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and has that strong arm and trust his

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.499 
and has that strong arm and trust his
arm<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> about<00:01:32.729> him<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> does

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
arm I like that about him but it does

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.810 
arm I like that about him but it does
get<00:01:33.750> him<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.020> trouble<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.530> times<00:01:35.009> by<00:01:35.280> forcing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
get him in trouble at times by forcing

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.760 
get him in trouble at times by forcing
passes<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.329> nonetheless<00:01:36.570> he<00:01:37.229> will<00:01:37.439> be<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
passes but nonetheless he will be the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
passes but nonetheless he will be the
best<00:01:37.979> option<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> best<00:01:39.090> fit<00:01:39.390> for<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
best option I think the best fit for the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.490 
best option I think the best fit for the
Cardinals<00:01:40.350> passing<00:01:40.710> game

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.380 

in<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.800> third<00:01:48.070> round<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.520> Cardinals<00:01:48.970> do<00:01:49.180> need

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
in the third round the Cardinals do need

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.210 
in the third round the Cardinals do need
help<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.870> secondary<00:01:50.290> I<00:01:50.410> think<00:01:50.650> Earl<00:01:50.860> Wolff

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
help in the secondary I think Earl Wolff

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.710 
help in the secondary I think Earl Wolff
strong<00:01:51.640> safety<00:01:52.060> would<00:01:52.150> be<00:01:52.210> an<00:01:52.360> outstanding

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
strong safety would be an outstanding

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.960 
strong safety would be an outstanding
option<00:01:53.500> not<00:01:53.590> only<00:01:53.860> can<00:01:54.040> he<00:01:54.130> come<00:01:54.310> up<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.640> lay

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
option not only can he come up and lay

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.180 
option not only can he come up and lay
the<00:01:55.030> lumber<00:01:55.270> he<00:01:55.780> also<00:01:56.020> has<00:01:56.380> two<00:01:56.590> ball<00:01:56.830> skills

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
the lumber he also has two ball skills

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.950 
the lumber he also has two ball skills
and<00:01:57.370> that's<00:01:57.490> rare<00:01:57.730> for<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:58.060> strong<00:01:58.360> safety<00:01:58.810> I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
and that's rare for a strong safety I

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.780 
and that's rare for a strong safety I
think<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.350> would<00:01:59.500> be<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.620> great<00:01:59.890> pick<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.520> the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
think it would be a great pick in the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:08.430 
think it would be a great pick in the
third<00:02:01.030> round<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.540> Arizona<00:02:07.020> any<00:02:08.020> time<00:02:08.259> you're

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
third round for Arizona any time you're

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.139 
third round for Arizona any time you're
running<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.770> 3-4<00:02:09.220> defense<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.759> have<00:02:09.970> to

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
running a 3-4 defense you have to

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.850 
running a 3-4 defense you have to
continue<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.720> stockpile<00:02:11.260> outside

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
continue to stockpile outside

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.740 
continue to stockpile outside
linebackers<00:02:12.580> not<00:02:12.760> Brandon<00:02:13.150> Jenkins<00:02:13.360> could

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
linebackers not Brandon Jenkins could

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.060 
linebackers not Brandon Jenkins could

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
have been a first-round pick last year

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.370 
have been a first-round pick last year
had<00:02:15.730> he<00:02:15.880> not<00:02:16.060> gotten<00:02:16.120> injured<00:02:16.750> he<00:02:17.020> went<00:02:17.200> back

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
had he not gotten injured he went back

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.170 
had he not gotten injured he went back
to<00:02:17.440> school<00:02:17.709> got<00:02:18.010> injured<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.520> that's<00:02:19.030> why

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
to school got injured and that's why

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.090 
to school got injured and that's why
he's<00:02:19.360> gonna<00:02:19.480> fall<00:02:19.780> probably<00:02:20.320> later<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
he's gonna fall probably later in the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.470 
he's gonna fall probably later in the
draft<00:02:21.280> but<00:02:21.490> if<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.670> Cardinals<00:02:21.910> are<00:02:22.120> able<00:02:22.390> to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
draft but if the Cardinals are able to

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.850 
draft but if the Cardinals are able to
snatch<00:02:22.720> him<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.260> think<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.620> will<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.740> a

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
snatch him up I think that will be a

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.010 
snatch him up I think that will be a
steal<00:02:24.250> for<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.550> scene<00:02:24.820> I<00:02:30.360> think<00:02:31.360> later<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.690> in

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
steal for the scene I think later on in

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.510 
steal for the scene I think later on in
the<00:02:32.110> draft<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.530> Cardinals<00:02:32.920> can't<00:02:33.130> continue

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
the draft the Cardinals can't continue

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.310 
the draft the Cardinals can't continue
to<00:02:33.580> build<00:02:33.820> depth<00:02:34.150> on<00:02:34.300> it<00:02:34.420> offensive<00:02:34.780> line<00:02:35.020> so

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
to build depth on it offensive line so

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.140 
to build depth on it offensive line so
look<00:02:35.620> for<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:35.890> guy<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.040> Xavier<00:02:36.490> Nixon<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.000> be

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
look for a guy like Xavier Nixon to be

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.490 
look for a guy like Xavier Nixon to be
around<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.660> think<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.050> would<00:02:38.170> be<00:02:38.260> an<00:02:38.320> ideal

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
around I think that would be an ideal

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.970

the Southland Conference does a great

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.630 
the Southland Conference does a great

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:04.719 
picks in the sixth round I think they

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.780 
picks in the sixth round I think they
can<00:03:04.900> target<00:03:05.170> another<00:03:05.709> wide<00:03:06.010> receiver<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.609> add

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
trap I have him falling to Arizona that

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.190 
trap I have him falling to Arizona that
would<00:03:15.010> be<00:03:15.159> an<00:03:15.250> ideal<00:03:15.400> fit<00:03:16.060> for<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.689> passing

would be an ideal fit for that passing

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.629 
would be an ideal fit for that passing
game<00:03:17.319> where<00:03:17.500> he<00:03:17.620> can<00:03:17.769> be<00:03:17.859> the<00:03:18.040> fourth<00:03:18.340> option

in<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.359> offense<00:03:19.750> now<00:03:19.989> when<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.319> look<00:03:20.439> at<00:03:20.560> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
in that offense now when you look at the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.379 
in that offense now when you look at the
total<00:03:21.069> selections<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.879> I've<00:03:22.000> given<00:03:22.180> the

total selections that I've given the
