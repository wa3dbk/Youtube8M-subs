it<00:00:23.330> actually<00:00:23.449> comes<00:00:23.750> out<00:00:23.990> like<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:25.160> nozzle

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
it actually comes out like the nozzle

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
looks more like one of the better

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.120 
looks more like one of the better
quality<00:00:29.119> ones<00:00:29.510> I've<00:00:29.779> actually<00:00:29.990> seen<00:00:30.410> but<00:00:30.920> I've

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
quality ones I've actually seen but I've

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.270 
quality ones I've actually seen but I've
not<00:00:31.400> tried<00:00:31.550> it<00:00:31.789> yet<00:00:32.019> so<00:00:33.019> we'll<00:00:33.260> say<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.100> is

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
not tried it yet so we'll say this is

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.950 
not tried it yet so we'll say this is
the<00:00:34.370> chrome<00:00:34.610> bumper<00:00:35.000> on<00:00:35.120> it<00:00:35.329> enter<00:00:35.840> spray<00:00:36.520> it's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
the chrome bumper on it enter spray it's

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.750 
the chrome bumper on it enter spray it's
nicely<00:00:38.960> polished<00:00:39.380> and<00:00:40.360> it's<00:00:42.430> dust<00:00:43.430> free

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
nicely polished and it's dust free

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
grease free everything else free that I

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.069 
grease free everything else free that I
can<00:00:46.640> possibly<00:00:46.879> think<00:00:47.090> it<00:00:47.420> was<00:00:47.510> been<00:00:47.719> stored<00:00:48.020> in

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
can possibly think it was been stored in

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.750 
can possibly think it was been stored in
the<00:00:48.140> garage<00:00:48.350> in<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:48.860> plastic<00:00:49.280> wrapping<00:00:49.489> up

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
the garage in the plastic wrapping up

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.450 
the garage in the plastic wrapping up
until<00:00:50.000> now<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:51.320> what<00:00:51.620> I<00:00:51.649> intend<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.070> do<00:00:52.280> is

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
until now so what I intend to do is

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.430 
until now so what I intend to do is
coated<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:53.390> make<00:00:53.539> sure<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.020> doesn't<00:00:54.170> get

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
coated to make sure that it doesn't get

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.650 
coated to make sure that it doesn't get
any<00:00:54.590> less<00:00:54.820> obviously<00:00:55.820> this<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.149> going<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:56.450> be

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
any less obviously this is going to be

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.950 
any less obviously this is going to be
difficult<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.700> film<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:58.969> Sprite<00:00:59.570> at<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.719> same

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
difficult to film and Sprite at the same

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.689 
difficult to film and Sprite at the same
time<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.469> what<00:01:00.620> I<00:01:00.649> tend<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:00.980> do<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:01.340> just<00:01:01.550> do<00:01:01.670> a

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
time so what I tend to do is just do a

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.869 
time so what I tend to do is just do a
quick<00:01:02.360> spray<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:02.719> start<00:01:03.140> with<00:01:03.379> and<00:01:03.649> then<00:01:04.579> sort

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
quick spray to start with and then sort

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.129 
quick spray to start with and then sort
of<00:01:04.939> like<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:05.149> show<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.570> progressive

00:01:06.129 --> 00:01:06.139 
of like to show you the progressive

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:10.029 
of like to show you the progressive
parts<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.889> it<00:01:07.009> as<00:01:07.159> I'll<00:01:07.310> get<00:01:07.520> going<00:01:08.560> so<00:01:09.560> here<00:01:09.950> we

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
parts of it as I'll get going so here we

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:20.859 
parts of it as I'll get going so here we
go<00:01:17.889> that's<00:01:18.889> the<00:01:18.950> first<00:01:19.249> breakdown<00:01:19.659> it's<00:01:20.659> gone

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
go that's the first breakdown it's gone

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.129 
go that's the first breakdown it's gone
on<00:01:21.279> and<00:01:22.279> it's<00:01:22.759> definitely<00:01:23.240> sort<00:01:23.539> of<00:01:23.630> made<00:01:23.899> the

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:24.139 
on and it's definitely sort of made the

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:26.679 
on and it's definitely sort of made the
color<00:01:24.939> disappear<00:01:25.939> or<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.240> crime<00:01:26.479> disappear

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
from from the bumper itself it seems to

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.690 
from from the bumper itself it seems to
be<00:01:30.560> drying<00:01:30.829> up<00:01:31.069> and<00:01:32.229> leaving<00:01:33.229> a<00:01:33.590> duller<00:01:34.340> coat
