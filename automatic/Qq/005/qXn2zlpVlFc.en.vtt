guys have adapted the Futaba spektr
module<00:00:32.860> version<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:33.969> work<00:00:34.660> in<00:00:34.840> it<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:34.989> i've

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
module version to work in it and i've

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.040 
module version to work in it and i've
done<00:00:35.440> that<00:00:35.500> at<00:00:35.860> one<00:00:36.010> time<00:00:36.040> myself<00:00:36.960> reduces<00:00:37.960> the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
done that at one time myself reduces the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.509 
done that at one time myself reduces the
fake<00:00:38.260> channels<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:39.100> beauty<00:00:39.489> of<00:00:39.519> the<00:00:40.149> OEM

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519 
fake channels the beauty of the OEM

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.700 
fake channels the beauty of the OEM
conversion<00:00:42.519> is<00:00:42.730> it<00:00:43.149> will<00:00:43.329> give<00:00:43.510> me<00:00:43.719> all<00:00:43.929> 12<00:00:44.530> of

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
conversion is it will give me all 12 of

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.220 
conversion is it will give me all 12 of
my<00:00:44.739> channels<00:00:45.309> back<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:45.820> realign<00:00:46.629> the<00:00:46.839> channel

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
my channels back and realign the channel

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.319 
my channels back and realign the channel
order<00:00:47.530> to<00:00:47.710> line<00:00:48.249> up<00:00:48.460> with<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.699> spectrum<00:00:49.059> line

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
order to line up with the spectrum line

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.470 
order to line up with the spectrum line
so<00:00:49.719> we're<00:00:50.589> going<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.829> do<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:51.879> today<00:00:52.120> let<00:00:52.420> me

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
so we're going to do that today let me

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.040 
so we're going to do that today let me
take<00:00:52.659> a<00:00:52.690> few<00:00:52.960> minutes<00:00:53.319> and<00:00:54.839> reposition<00:00:55.839> things

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
take a few minutes and reposition things

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.930 
take a few minutes and reposition things
going<00:00:56.289> over<00:00:56.409> to<00:00:56.559> an<00:00:56.649> any<00:00:56.829> stamp<00:00:57.280> map<00:00:57.550> it's<00:00:57.850> a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
going over to an any stamp map it's a

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.669 
going over to an any stamp map it's a
little<00:00:58.120> static<00:00:58.690> electricity<00:00:59.109> and<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.469> dry

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
little static electricity and the dry

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.700 
little static electricity and the dry
weather<00:00:59.979> so<00:01:00.370> we'll<00:01:01.059> do<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.269> and<00:01:01.659> we'll<00:01:02.289> set

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
weather so we'll do that and we'll set

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.799 
weather so we'll do that and we'll set
the<00:01:02.800> camera<00:01:03.190> up<00:01:03.249> so<00:01:03.309> you'll<00:01:03.729> be<00:01:03.879> listened<00:01:04.690> to

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
the camera up so you'll be listened to

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.390 
the camera up so you'll be listened to
by<00:01:04.930> talking<00:01:05.379> hands<00:01:05.650> of<00:01:05.830> looking<00:01:06.070> over<00:01:06.130> my

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
by talking hands of looking over my

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.340 
by talking hands of looking over my
shoulder<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.300> we'll<00:01:07.510> be<00:01:07.630> right<00:01:07.810> back

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
shoulder and we'll be right back

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.649

back<00:01:08.950> and<00:01:09.340> as<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.939> can<00:01:10.060> see<00:01:10.119> we've<00:01:10.450> got<00:01:10.600> our

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
back and as you can see we've got our

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.219 
back and as you can see we've got our
radio<00:01:11.530> and<00:01:12.630> here's<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.840> box

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
radio and here's the box

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.130 
radio and here's the box
let's<00:01:14.380> spectrum<00:01:14.829> equipment<00:01:15.640> in<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.689> you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
let's spectrum equipment in it and you

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.810 
let's spectrum equipment in it and you
can<00:01:17.229> see<00:01:17.409> it<00:01:17.500> also<00:01:17.649> comes<00:01:18.040> with<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.399> 12

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
can see it also comes with the 12

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.270 
can see it also comes with the 12
channel<00:01:19.210> receiver<00:01:19.750> this<00:01:20.439> antenna<00:01:20.890> would<00:01:21.130> go

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
channel receiver this antenna would go

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.520 
channel receiver this antenna would go
if<00:01:21.399> you<00:01:21.549> were<00:01:21.670> converting<00:01:22.180> a<00:01:22.210> 30-30<00:01:22.840> multiplex

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
if you were converting a 30-30 multiplex

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.889 
if you were converting a 30-30 multiplex
radio<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.490> we'll<00:01:25.090> set<00:01:25.329> them<00:01:25.450> off<00:01:25.659> to<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.869> side

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
radio so we'll set them off to the side

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.969 
radio so we'll set them off to the side
we've<00:01:26.350> got<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.710> things<00:01:26.950> we<00:01:27.130> need<00:01:27.430> out<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.700> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
we've got the things we need out of it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.429 
we've got the things we need out of it
we've<00:01:29.979> got<00:01:30.130> our<00:01:30.280> antenna<00:01:33.960> our<00:01:34.960> spectrum

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
we've got our antenna our spectrum

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.190 
we've got our antenna our spectrum
module<00:01:37.350> connect<00:01:38.350> your<00:01:38.530> wire<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:40.200> little

module connect your wire and a little

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.099 
module connect your wire and a little
velcro<00:01:41.380> pad<00:01:41.829> but<00:01:42.700> first<00:01:42.909> things<00:01:43.180> first<00:01:43.299> we've

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
velcro pad but first things first we've

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.590 
velcro pad but first things first we've
got<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.259> 72<00:01:44.680> Omega<00:01:45.070> Hertz<00:01:45.310> radio<00:01:45.729> here<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.329> we

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
got a 72 Omega Hertz radio here and we

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.529 
got a 72 Omega Hertz radio here and we
need<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:46.840> change<00:01:47.049> that<00:01:47.350> over<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:48.520> we'll<00:01:49.240> flip

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
need to change that over so we'll flip

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.029 
need to change that over so we'll flip
that<00:01:49.780> over<00:01:50.729> pop<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.909> back<00:01:52.119> off<00:01:52.560> as<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.829> can

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
that over pop the back off as you can

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.899 
that over pop the back off as you can
see<00:01:54.219> we've<00:01:54.909> got<00:01:55.119> our<00:01:55.179> 72<00:01:55.869> megahertz<00:01:56.909> scanner

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
see we've got our 72 megahertz scanner

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.380 
see we've got our 72 megahertz scanner
and<00:01:58.270> underneath<00:01:58.689> that<00:01:58.750> is<00:01:59.289> the<00:02:00.119> module<00:02:01.119> for

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
and underneath that is the module for

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.810 
and underneath that is the module for
the<00:02:01.450> frequency<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.829> that<00:02:02.979> simply<00:02:03.369> pulls<00:02:03.609> right

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
the frequency so that simply pulls right

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.020 
the frequency so that simply pulls right
off<00:02:03.880> just<00:02:04.060> carefully<00:02:05.429> work<00:02:06.429> that<00:02:06.640> off<00:02:06.850> the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
off just carefully work that off the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.370 
off just carefully work that off the
board<00:02:07.179> the<00:02:07.420> two<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.719> those<00:02:07.810> boards<00:02:08.229> are

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
board the two of those boards are

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.200 
board the two of those boards are
together<00:02:08.500> and<00:02:09.039> set<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.729> off<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.119> side

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
together and set that off to the side

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.699 
together and set that off to the side
the<00:02:11.200> antenna<00:02:11.590> simply<00:02:12.070> removes<00:02:13.170> by<00:02:14.170> pushing<00:02:14.500> it
