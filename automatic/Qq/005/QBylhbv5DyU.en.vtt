00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
Saturn no they don't but I think that

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.959 
Saturn no they don't but I think that
with<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.229> debut<00:01:53.590> of<00:01:53.799> this<00:01:54.009> car<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:54.430> the

after European opals I think that's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.070 
after European opals I think that's
really<00:02:07.470> a<00:02:07.650> smart<00:02:07.830> move<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.369> knowing<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.330> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
really a smart move and knowing that you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.070 
really a smart move and knowing that you
know<00:02:10.110> Bob<00:02:10.380> Lutz<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> real<00:02:11.070> car<00:02:11.310> guy<00:02:12.080> these

like the sky cars like the aura and the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.709 
like the sky cars like the aura and the
next<00:03:54.709> generation<00:03:54.799> view<00:03:55.459> which<00:03:55.670> they<00:03:56.480> showed<00:03:56.689> a

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:56.719 
next generation view which they showed a

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:59.259 
next generation view which they showed a
concept<00:03:57.109> vehicle<00:03:57.530> in<00:03:58.099> Frankfurt<00:03:58.609> that<00:03:59.030> kind

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
concept vehicle in Frankfurt that kind

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.479 
concept vehicle in Frankfurt that kind
of<00:03:59.379> gives<00:04:00.379> a<00:04:00.469> preview<00:04:00.799> of<00:04:00.859> what<00:04:01.099> that<00:04:01.219> car<00:04:01.400> is

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
of gives a preview of what that car is

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.339 
of gives a preview of what that car is
going<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.639> be<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:01.939> think<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:03.049> they're<00:04:03.200> going

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
going to be I think that they're going

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:05.229 
going to be I think that they're going
someplace<00:04:03.620> absolutely<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.639> I<00:04:04.730> think<00:04:04.760> Saturn

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
someplace absolutely and I think Saturn

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.089 
someplace absolutely and I think Saturn
I<00:04:05.510> think<00:04:05.719> I<00:04:05.750> hope<00:04:06.409> said<00:04:06.650> it<00:04:06.739> will<00:04:06.829> be<00:04:06.920> able<00:04:06.980> to

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
I think I hope said it will be able to

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.740 
I think I hope said it will be able to
turn<00:04:07.219> it<00:04:07.280> around<00:04:07.430> because<00:04:07.849> your<00:04:08.480> sales

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
turn it around because your sales

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.069 
turn it around because your sales
philosophy<00:04:09.319> you<00:04:09.409> know<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.590> no<00:04:09.709> haggle<00:04:10.069> sales

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
philosophy you know the no haggle sales

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.839 
philosophy you know the no haggle sales
is<00:04:12.079> a<00:04:12.170> great<00:04:12.530> one<00:04:12.650> and<00:04:12.799> people<00:04:13.099> love<00:04:13.430> buying

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
is a great one and people love buying

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.220 
is a great one and people love buying
satyrs<00:04:14.359> it's<00:04:14.750> just<00:04:15.019> that<00:04:15.109> they<00:04:15.200> don't

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
satyrs it's just that they don't

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.259 
satyrs it's just that they don't
necessarily<00:04:15.469> like<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.130> cars<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.519> much<00:04:16.699> so

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
necessarily like the cars that much so

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.580 
necessarily like the cars that much so
how<00:04:17.419> does<00:04:17.479> this<00:04:17.599> compare<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.199> miata

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
how does this compare to the miata

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.650 
how does this compare to the miata
though<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:19.190> know<00:04:19.699> we<00:04:19.910> can't<00:04:20.120> talk<00:04:20.239> about<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.509> on

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
though I know we can't talk about it on

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.240 
though I know we can't talk about it on
the<00:04:20.720> road<00:04:20.989> yet<00:04:21.229> but<00:04:21.590> how<00:04:21.739> do<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.130> it's

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
the road yet but how do you think it's

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.499 
the road yet but how do you think it's
gonna<00:04:22.370> how<00:04:22.759> do<00:04:22.820> you<00:04:22.910> think<00:04:22.970> it's<00:04:23.180> going<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.360> do

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
gonna how do you think it's going to do

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.589 
gonna how do you think it's going to do
versus<00:04:23.960> than<00:04:24.110> we<00:04:24.229> are<00:04:24.259> well<00:04:24.919> it's<00:04:25.009> heavier

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
versus than we are well it's heavier

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.240 
versus than we are well it's heavier
right<00:04:26.599> now<00:04:26.750> they're<00:04:27.160> estimating<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
right now they're estimating the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.890 
right now they're estimating the
horsepower<00:04:28.580> I'll<00:04:28.669> be<00:04:28.759> about<00:04:28.940> 170<00:04:29.630> which<00:04:29.750> is

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
horsepower I'll be about 170 which is

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.360 
horsepower I'll be about 170 which is
the<00:04:30.020> same<00:04:30.199> as<00:04:30.259> the<00:04:30.440> miata<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:31.009> when<00:04:31.130> you've<00:04:31.250> got

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
the same as the miata so when you've got

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.370 
the same as the miata so when you've got
same<00:04:31.820> horsepower<00:04:32.120> ever<00:04:32.780> your<00:04:33.020> curb<00:04:33.199> weight

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
same horsepower ever your curb weight

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.560 
same horsepower ever your curb weight
I'm<00:04:34.130> not<00:04:34.430> really<00:04:34.580> seeing<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.090> on<00:04:35.210> a

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
I'm not really seeing that on a

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.150 
I'm not really seeing that on a
