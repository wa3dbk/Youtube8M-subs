00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Oh 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.190
 but 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.100
 hello all youtube friends is unique 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.060
 striker hd and good here you have the myth 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.000
 number 8 what is called and if I decide 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.880
 change the course of recording of occasions 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.369
 of myths because right now I'm not with 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.430
 nobody and well now I can record as if 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.410
 outside 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.590
 as you already know energetics to andreas 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.120
 there was a place where there were satellites and 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.670
 good even though you get 5 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.610
 it was the map of san andreas 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.560
 here it is and I have decided to go investigate 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.600
 a little bit and good what I find 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.600
 They are stairs that can be climbed 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.550
 and I go up the stairs to see that 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.070
 there were in these huge satellites because 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.050
 They are huge and why why are unique 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.940
 so they are the question to which I fell not 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.370
 but well, those satellites 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.630
 suppose they are to pick up signals 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.299
 extraterrestrial to capture 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.219
 the aliens like from gt5 now there are many 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.920
 esther ex of aliens but very many 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:17.600
 we go like michael that you 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.700
 kidnap or go out later 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.909
 what crazy weird cuts that kill 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.500
 roses and then here when there are many 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.950
 the stress of someone when you spend the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.729
 game that you come across with a mounic 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.710
 we go many things and then nothing here 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.369
 this is to capture the signals 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.940
 extraterrestrials and there are quite a few 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.979
 five or six I remember well and good 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.830
 it could be said that this is a double 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.930
 mystery a double myth because you'll see 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.840
 that you are going to see below what 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.179
 thing else will happen just happened and 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.500
 good with the car I took I went to 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.300
 investigate a little bit to see if 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.310
 I found something more some people and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.740
 there I found two people looking at the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.319
 UFOs and like that and leave me a little bit 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.649
 disguise I think I get close enough 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.569
 I did not get out of the car, not all right, I did not catch 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.220
 be they left any is the thematic 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.209
 this one approached me I thought it's going to 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.600
 hit the other walked away and I saw the 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.990
 other 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.510
 running in a very strange way 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.820
 that's why I took the car and decided to go to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.500
 chase him to see what the hell he had 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.820
 grabbed because it ran like it was a 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.580
 Little girl and well, it ran like that and I said 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.740
 I'm going to approach an era see what happens and what 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.350
 I saw winning something by the hand 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.150
 principle that was that but then I 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.640
 realized that it was a mobile and now 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.280
 You will see how it is perceived during all this 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.570
 good time because here emerges a bit of 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.040
 he took a lot of advantage 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.440
 I immediately left the car and took 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.830
 the phone by I put the camera and as you see 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.270
 I caught him running there I'm not going to 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.820
 put in slow motion right now for 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.740
 see how it looks in a photo tells not 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.570
 he sees very well but you can tell he is holding a 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.310
 mobile now we have the slow motion like 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.550
 I say good because here we see him on camera 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.200
 slow and apologized the quality of my 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.330
 capturing but you can see that it's a 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.210
 mobile of course something rectangular I do 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.940
 with the smartphone I made the photo and if it is 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.430
 a mobile phone was running there with the mobile 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.260
 you are turning a very strange way of 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.600
 I had never run into something 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.070
 like it can be a book 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.830
 anything but it's something pretty 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.600
 weird to find him go to investigate the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.030
 satellites and find me with this as 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.830
 which it seems a little weird I have 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.180
 called the hipster worker in the title 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.560
 I'll put in myth hunters number 8 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.020
 look for researching the satellites and the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.810
 hipster worker is that it's pretty weird 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.650
 a worker with a smartphone is that never 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.540
 never the existing tea and then nothing was going 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.000
 running the worker that usher all over 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.400
 the quiet map san andreas de jeta 5 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.350
 I was going to go with the phone giving it 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.030
 to the dollar la la and I chasing him 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.250
 all the time to see if he stopped in 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.810
 somewhere if I stopped running because 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.720
 this guy did not get tired he was running 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.880
 there as if nothing and in the end I decided 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.710
 invest him in throwing him to the ground to see if 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.390
 something would happen if he left his cell phone 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.050
 he got up and well he gave me a wafer for 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.630
 course and I, well, what I did then 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:20.989
 was to kill him of course because 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.130
 the only one is that I've never seen 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.410
 a worker x 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.760
 I never picked up the bat and you know what 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.760
 could pass
