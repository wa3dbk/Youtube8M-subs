these plastic elastics these little

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.710 
these plastic elastics these little
elastics<00:02:58.320> they<00:02:59.320> are<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.739> clear<00:03:00.310> ones<00:03:00.549> I<00:03:01.150> think

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720

once and twice now when you wind it for
the<00:03:33.730> third<00:03:33.970> time<00:03:35.070> pull<00:03:36.070> downward<00:03:36.549> on<00:03:37.090> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
the third time pull downward on the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.690 
the third time pull downward on the
elastic

elastic

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.470 
elastic
so<00:03:40.700> don't<00:03:40.940> take<00:03:41.120> it<00:03:41.180> all<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.390> way<00:03:41.480> up<00:03:41.660> see<00:03:41.930> that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
so don't take it all the way up see that

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.380 
so don't take it all the way up see that
and<00:03:44.480> I'm<00:03:44.780> going<00:03:44.930> to<00:03:45.020> turn<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.250> like<00:03:46.790> kind<00:03:47.270> of

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
and I'm going to turn it like kind of

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.580 
and I'm going to turn it like kind of
wind<00:03:47.660> it<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.080> do<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.980> same<00:03:49.220> thing<00:03:50.290> but<00:03:51.290> pull

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
wind it and do the same thing but pull

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.910 
wind it and do the same thing but pull
downward<00:03:51.920> so<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:52.580> you're<00:03:52.700> getting<00:03:53.060> like

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
downward so that you're getting like

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.990 
downward so that you're getting like
little<00:03:54.920> zigzags<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:57.610> you'll<00:03:58.610> see<00:03:58.820> in<00:03:58.910> a

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
little zigzags and you'll see in a

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.300 
little zigzags and you'll see in a
second<00:03:59.420> what<00:03:59.720> this<00:03:59.959> does<00:04:00.320> once<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:00.950> let<00:04:01.130> go

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
second what this does once you let go

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:10.110 
second what this does once you let go
okay<00:04:02.060> so<00:04:02.150> turn<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.510> again<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:08.140> if<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.290> let<00:04:09.500> go

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
okay so turn it again and if you let go

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.520 
okay so turn it again and if you let go
it's<00:04:11.120> going<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.420> do<00:04:11.510> like<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.750> little<00:04:11.959> thing

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
it's going to do like a little thing

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.820 
it's going to do like a little thing
like<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.989> okay<00:04:14.989> so<00:04:15.080> take<00:04:15.380> another<00:04:15.650> elastic

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
like that okay so take another elastic

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.120 
like that okay so take another elastic
and<00:04:16.840> right<00:04:17.840> where<00:04:18.140> that<00:04:18.169> one<00:04:18.500> ended<00:04:18.890> right

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
and right where that one ended right

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.120 
and right where that one ended right
there<00:04:20.380> loop<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.680> couple<00:04:22.040> times<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:24.130> then

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
there loop it a couple times and then

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.159 
there loop it a couple times and then
repeat<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.940> same<00:04:26.120> process<00:04:26.570> so<00:04:26.810> you'll<00:04:26.990> take

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
repeat the same process so you'll take

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:41.209 
repeat the same process so you'll take
it<00:04:28.660> turn<00:04:29.660> it

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.200 

and<00:04:42.219> it's<00:04:42.400> okay<00:04:42.669> if<00:04:42.759> your<00:04:42.879> hair<00:04:43.060> does

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
and it's okay if your hair does

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.390 
and it's okay if your hair does
something<00:04:43.539> like<00:04:43.689> that<00:04:43.900> because<00:04:44.860> we'll<00:04:45.219> just

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
something like that because we'll just

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.490 
something like that because we'll just
tuck<00:04:45.610> it<00:04:45.639> behind<00:04:45.969> so<00:04:46.689> we'll<00:04:46.870> do<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.080> again<00:04:47.139> take

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
tuck it behind so we'll do it again take

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:56.249 
tuck it behind so we'll do it again take
another<00:04:47.889> elastic<00:04:48.629> and<00:04:49.629> start<00:04:50.469> it<00:04:54.719> so<00:04:55.719> once<00:04:56.110> you

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
another elastic and start it so once you

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:58.469 
another elastic and start it so once you
get<00:04:56.379> to<00:04:56.439> the<00:04:56.650> bottom<00:04:57.150> you're<00:04:58.150> going<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.330> have

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
get to the bottom you're going to have

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.909 
get to the bottom you're going to have
just<00:04:58.719> like<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.900> straight<00:04:59.319> piece<00:04:59.500> like<00:04:59.740> this

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
just like a straight piece like this

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.550 
just like a straight piece like this
what<00:05:00.879> you'll<00:05:01.030> do<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.740> wrap<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:04.319> so<00:05:05.319> we<00:05:05.379> wrap

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
what you'll do is wrap it so we wrap

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.390 
what you'll do is wrap it so we wrap
it's<00:05:05.860> tight<00:05:06.159> as<00:05:06.490> you<00:05:06.520> would<00:05:06.879> like<00:05:06.909> poem<00:05:07.719> tell

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
it's tight as you would like poem tell

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.309 
it's tight as you would like poem tell
now<00:05:09.400> when<00:05:09.759> it<00:05:09.879> gets<00:05:10.060> pretty<00:05:10.389> tight<00:05:10.810> loop<00:05:11.590> this

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
now when it gets pretty tight loop this

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.100 
now when it gets pretty tight loop this
but<00:05:14.319> don't<00:05:14.849> pull<00:05:15.849> that<00:05:15.879> through<00:05:16.389> and<00:05:16.629> this<00:05:16.900> is

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
but don't pull that through and this is

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.809 
but don't pull that through and this is
basically<00:05:17.349> what<00:05:17.830> that's<00:05:17.949> going<00:05:18.219> to<00:05:18.279> create<00:05:18.460> is

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.819 
basically what that's going to create is

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:20.490 
basically what that's going to create is
kind<00:05:19.090> of<00:05:19.150> like<00:05:19.210> a<00:05:19.270> hook<00:05:19.599> for<00:05:19.629> your<00:05:20.020> bobby<00:05:20.229> pin
