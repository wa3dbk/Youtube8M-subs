00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.510
 hello Wool in this video is about 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.510
 photographed lost places 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.270
 here will already set a video 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.680
 made about lost places and it is 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.200
 meanwhile really difficult in such 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.520
 to come in places left over everywhere 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.720
 is the protection of the partially are the 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.400
 demolished 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.510
 Part of it is also dangerous in that 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.250
 building to go in knows the whole 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.200
 time has rained everything is rotten etc 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.810
 I found a place here in the 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.910
 near Berlin you can legally the rhine 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.460
 people are exaggerated nice and accurate 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.920
 Here we photograph today where is 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.940
 this place you ask me now I can 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.489
 unfortunately do not betray you 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.920
 take fun of course I'll tell you 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.809
 it is in elstal that is near by 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.610
 Berlin this is the old olympic village 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.440
 where we are right you see the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.120
 looks pretty nice yes everywhere 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.739
 But these old things are still long 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.330
 not everything somehow swimming pool and 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.820
 a lot of other cool stuff i have 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.440
 the 600d here today I have one 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.330
 fisheye objective on it I have you yes 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.710
 ever shown in the last video and 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.820
 just a tripod and just that 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.710
 are in the end the things that I do 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.239
 Because of this, use fischer here today 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.619
 we are in closed rooms and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.059
 just get a lot of it 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.860
 and that's why I have the eight 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.680
 millimeter and think that will me 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.880
 Do a pretty good job today 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.890
 Now let's see what's so many here 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.869
 cool places we are here we believe 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.200
 I was in that it was the house 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.640
 are theater house people lieutenant 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.920
 Commanders the complete selection so 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.250
 not hindenburg it is said i believe 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.570
 here 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.920
 we are definitely in it now and 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.909
 We check in the other houses 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.869
 We like to key in and do 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.280
 like photos i am looking forward to the 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.619
 Swimming pool I already have outside 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.100
 seen somewhere and then see 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.100
 Otherwise we are 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.630
 We are now here in the swimming hall 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.259
 and I have to talk a little quieter 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.409
 because here's just stop just stop 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.020
 Keep it a bit and the natural 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.000
 About blitz location will be such a blue 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.330
 Tile over all the floor mirror like that 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.090
 a little bit and they blatantly ceiling of 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.300
 the jump board and i will do it here 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.830
 a photo of this pool directly from the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.530
 pool, so to speak, make it pretty far 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.780
 down and is pretty cool out of me 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.890
 show you this time sees this tripod 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.360
 construction looks a bit weird 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.060
 but i have a simple reason 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.250
 want to go as deep as possible and have 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.280
 that's why the back leg folded 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.530
 because I have these two ladders on it 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.150
 and that's why it is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.709
 retracted back leg 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.840
 and I'm as close to the wall as possible 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.590
 It's almost because of the fisheye 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.780
 180 degrees view and have these two 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.239
 things now exactly it yet accurate 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.220
 look here and very important 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.080
 In any case, I always find symmetry 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.150
 That's why I'm right in the middle 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.850
 on this black line the camera 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.250
 positioned that quasi the center 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.700
 and then on both sides just that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.280
 same 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.049
 and I 'm doing a hdr here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.519
 For safety's sake, I often do so 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.049
 lost places because I have three 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.299
 Exposures definitely safe 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.400
 are the power the camera automatically 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:09.870
 I simply on these self-timer 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.099
 put three pictures in a row 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.739
 I can do three exposures afterwards 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.970
 decide some HDR created, namely 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.590
 an exposure to underexposure 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.599
 overexposure or normal 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.080
 I always find exposure 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.080
 very useful 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.060
 in a house you might have 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.000
 already seen in the fischer videos 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.580
 fish went a general and are now 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.130
 inside i think second floor and 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.810
 Just explore here a bit 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.820
 the buildings and have this room here 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.010
 discovered that I find over cool because he 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.050
 on the one hand sand bottom has almost ever 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.570
 completely strange is why two always 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.210
 pillars drown these nailed to 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.590
 window with these boards the light 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.660
 the sun shines in here and has 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.940
 this shadow play and this 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.000
 play of light on the floor and me 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.990
 take pictures of all fish protein here 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.580
 Firstly, it is interesting in fish 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.690
 a few things to photograph 21 den 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.640
 Look but also cool 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.990
 and I also play with the consciously 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.940
 look it you can see here in the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.560
 photo what was doing here shift 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.210
 that's a bit up the ais 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.430
 fisheye lens so to speak that I am so of 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.230
 actually shoot down to the top 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.930
 with normal lens so not with that 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.550
 I would only have fischer up there now 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.260
 on it quasi but by the fact that I such a 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.730
 I have a bit of a tip 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.910
 really cool dynamic effect in it 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.820
 so these pillars here do that 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.130
 this line at the back goes down 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.840
 somehow this bow goes here 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.640
 up so it's completely sick 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.280
 just look at it and the photo shows it 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.730
 although the room itself is not so 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.820
 looks 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.960
 Do you have a photo about nice so that is 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.180
 already an exposure cool out I do 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.710
 yes several exposures always the 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.990
 normal exposure are already over fresh 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.360
 from and I think the hdr could already 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.460
 What will go awesome in the day is simply the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.020
 normal exposure probably here 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.610
 take my recommendation to you if 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.740
 this species of fish just tries around 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.810
 to raise a little bit to the top 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.520
 turn down to turn then 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.860
 you see how that changes in space 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.260
 and that can look really cool that 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.500
 places i celebrate that when 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.030
 Just run it easy 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.470
 looks sometimes comes in here and 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.160
 then you have a great room here you 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.390
 you're still watching and it's over fresh 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.580
 You can just go through this thing 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.210
 through and you think old I'm already 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.750
 again at about crass of the giant 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:45.650
 fitness adventure park is simply great 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:48.069
 I celebrate the excessive places exaggerated 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.069
 be crazy 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.160
 the house commanders bit of a 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.880
 shot endangered we should rather 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.880
 not pure but said
