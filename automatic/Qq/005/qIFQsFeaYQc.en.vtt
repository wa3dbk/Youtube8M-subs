00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
speakers which I was very unsuccessful

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.100 
speakers which I was very unsuccessful
but<00:00:18.880> that's<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.420> reason<00:00:19.690> why<00:00:19.810> I'm<00:00:19.870> making

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
but that's the reason why I'm making

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.470 
but that's the reason why I'm making
this<00:00:20.350> video<00:00:20.770> for<00:00:21.070> those<00:00:21.670> who<00:00:22.120> were<00:00:22.240> thinking

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
going to be making a couple of videos

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.120 
going to be making a couple of videos
right<00:00:28.750> now<00:00:28.780> I'm<00:00:29.140> going<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.440> be<00:00:29.560> installing<00:00:29.980> on

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
right now I'm going to be installing on

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.619 
my dash because with Boston Acoustics
three<00:00:34.149> and<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.359> half<00:00:34.949> but<00:00:36.179> I'm<00:00:37.179> going<00:00:37.329> to<00:00:37.390> show

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
three and a half but I'm going to show

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.599 
three and a half but I'm going to show
you<00:00:37.659> I've<00:00:38.260> already<00:00:38.620> taken<00:00:38.859> it<00:00:39.010> apart

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
you I've already taken it apart

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:42.139 
you I've already taken it apart
but<00:00:40.510> it's<00:00:40.659> very<00:00:40.809> simple<00:00:41.319> and<00:00:41.409> easy<00:00:41.589> to<00:00:41.769> do

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but it's very simple and easy to do

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.430 
but it's very simple and easy to do
three<00:00:43.149> steps<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:45.510> plastic<00:00:46.510> part<00:00:46.809> that's

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
three steps the plastic part that's

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.340 
three steps the plastic part that's
actually<00:00:47.889> covering<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:49.210> speakers<00:00:49.719> which

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
actually covering the speakers which

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.270 
actually covering the speakers which
would<00:00:50.649> be<00:00:51.870> along<00:00:52.870> with<00:00:52.929> your<00:00:53.350> air<00:00:53.799> vent

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
would be along with your air vent

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.389 
would be along with your air vent
therefore<00:00:54.789> the<00:00:54.850> defrost<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:56.530> pops<00:00:56.949> up<00:00:57.100> very

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
therefore the defrost that pops up very

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.520 
therefore the defrost that pops up very
easily<00:00:57.789> but<00:00:58.209> you<00:00:58.359> cannot<00:00:58.629> just<00:00:58.690> pop<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.409> out

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
easily but you cannot just pop it out

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.629 
easily but you cannot just pop it out
without<00:01:00.399> removing<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.209> pillar<00:01:01.510> covers

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:02.639 
without removing the pillar covers

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:06.139 
without removing the pillar covers
there's<00:01:03.639> a<00:01:03.760> clip<00:01:04.539> plastic<00:01:05.140> clip<00:01:05.439> coming<00:01:05.860> from

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
there's a clip plastic clip coming from

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.969 
there's a clip plastic clip coming from
that<00:01:07.149> section<00:01:07.719> there<00:01:07.990> where<00:01:08.380> you<00:01:08.500> need<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.770> pop

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
that section there where you need to pop

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.249 
that section there where you need to pop
up<00:01:09.189> to<00:01:09.340> get<00:01:09.490> to<00:01:09.579> the<00:01:09.670> speakers<00:01:10.090> so<00:01:10.810> in<00:01:10.930> order<00:01:11.110> to

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
up to get to the speakers so in order to

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.899 
up to get to the speakers so in order to
do<00:01:11.469> that<00:01:11.649> you<00:01:11.860> have<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.159> remove<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.520> pillar

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
do that you have to remove the pillar

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.359 
do that you have to remove the pillar
covers<00:01:14.039> which<00:01:15.039> right<00:01:15.850> here<00:01:16.859> which<00:01:17.859> I<00:01:18.009> already

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
covers which right here which I already

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.719 
covers which right here which I already
removed<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.590> got<00:01:20.710> to<00:01:20.799> be<00:01:20.920> very<00:01:21.159> careful<00:01:21.640> with

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
removed you got to be very careful with

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.399 
removed you got to be very careful with
it<00:01:21.969> because<00:01:22.149> there<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.539> the<00:01:22.689> wires<00:01:22.899> going<00:01:23.289> on

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409
