00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
but when we just read a comment like

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.920 
but when we just read a comment like
that<00:03:51.100> it's<00:03:51.640> easy<00:03:51.850> to<00:03:52.030> make<00:03:52.239> assumptions<00:03:52.810> in

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
that it's easy to make assumptions in

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.100 
that it's easy to make assumptions in
our<00:03:53.019> head<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.530> then<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.489> can<00:03:54.640> be<00:03:55.050> can<00:03:56.050> be

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
our head and then that can be can be

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.360 
our head and then that can be can be
very<00:03:56.320> limiting<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:56.830> I<00:03:56.890> like<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:57.220> use

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
very limiting so I like to use

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.240 
very limiting so I like to use
real-world<00:03:57.910> examples<00:03:58.570> and<00:03:58.959> I'll<00:03:59.620> comment<00:04:00.070> on

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
real-world examples and I'll comment on

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.440
