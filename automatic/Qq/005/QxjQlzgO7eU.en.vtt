00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
fun playing the retards and and I think

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.280 
fun playing the retards and and I think
how<00:03:52.260> do<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.440> think<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:52.800> will<00:03:52.860> be<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:54.510> play

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
how do you think this will be a play

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.650 
how do you think this will be a play
differently<00:03:55.710> on<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.520> controller<00:03:57.060> compared<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
differently on a controller compared to

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.140 
differently on a controller compared to
keyboard<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.530> think<00:03:59.460> it's<00:03:59.580> going<00:03:59.730> to<00:03:59.850> be<00:03:59.940> a<00:03:59.970> lot

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
keyboard I think it's going to be a lot

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.770 
keyboard I think it's going to be a lot
better<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.900> saying<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:02.690> they're<00:04:03.690> looking

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
better just saying and they're looking

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.300 
better just saying and they're looking
around<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.290> moving<00:04:04.560> abida<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.950> analogs

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
around and moving abida to analogs

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.520 
around and moving abida to analogs
obviously<00:04:05.730> iter<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.930> job<00:04:07.110> Robbie<00:04:07.650> be<00:04:07.770> was<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
obviously iter the job Robbie be was a

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.710 
obviously iter the job Robbie be was a
hidden<00:04:10.530> could<00:04:10.920> be<00:04:11.010> like<00:04:11.160> or<00:04:11.340> art<00:04:11.640> or<00:04:11.880> button<00:04:12.510> or

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
hidden could be like or art or button or

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.260 
hidden could be like or art or button or
left<00:04:13.230> phone<00:04:13.380> right<00:04:13.920> bone<00:04:14.100> or<00:04:14.250> left<00:04:14.400> phone<00:04:14.580> yeah

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
left phone right bone or left phone yeah

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.240 
left phone right bone or left phone yeah
so<00:04:15.540> basically<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.320> think<00:04:16.560> it's<00:04:16.680> gonna<00:04:16.859> be<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.010> lot

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
so basically I think it's gonna be a lot

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.030 
so basically I think it's gonna be a lot
easier<00:04:17.310> than<00:04:17.700> using<00:04:18.270> a<00:04:18.480> laptop<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:19.080> PC

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
easier than using a laptop or PC

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.650 
easier than using a laptop or PC
whatever<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.670> you're<00:04:20.910> using<00:04:21.120> because<00:04:21.480> I

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
whatever it is you're using because I

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.380 
whatever it is you're using because I
never<00:04:22.080> really<00:04:22.590> clicked<00:04:23.460> with<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.760> keyboard<00:04:23.970> I

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
never really clicked with the keyboard I

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.900
