00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:44.700 
you've only got so many order tokens
you've<00:05:42.969> only<00:05:43.180> got<00:05:43.389> so<00:05:43.659> many<00:05:43.810> leadership<00:05:44.169> cards

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
you've only got so many leadership cards

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.290 
you've only got so many leadership cards
and<00:05:44.919> they<00:05:45.280> may<00:05:45.430> not<00:05:45.550> let<00:05:45.729> you<00:05:45.849> control<00:05:46.150> the

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
and they may not let you control the

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.999 
and they may not let you control the
unit's<00:05:46.599> you<00:05:46.719> want<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.199> control<00:05:47.530> so<00:05:47.800> there's<00:05:47.949> a

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
unit's you want to control so there's a

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.800 
unit's you want to control so there's a
real<00:05:48.370> bit<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.699> strategy<00:05:49.180> that's<00:05:49.389> involved

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
real bit of strategy that's involved

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.760 
real bit of strategy that's involved
there<00:05:50.039> now<00:05:51.039> unfortunately<00:05:51.969> that<00:05:52.539> good<00:05:53.469> length

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
there now unfortunately that good length

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.529 
there now unfortunately that good length
of<00:05:54.009> play<00:05:54.400> that<00:05:54.639> I<00:05:54.669> mentioned<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.300> doesn't

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
of play that I mentioned it doesn't

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:57.629 
of play that I mentioned it doesn't
apply<00:05:55.810> it<00:05:55.870> all<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.409> the<00:05:56.530> setup<00:05:56.770> this<00:05:57.430> game

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
apply it all to the setup this game

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.100 
apply it all to the setup this game
takes<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:57.969> long<00:05:58.150> time<00:05:58.180> to<00:05:58.539> set<00:05:58.719> up<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.020> it's

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
takes a long time to set up and it's

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.050 
takes a long time to set up and it's
really<00:05:59.259> labor-intensive<00:05:59.710> because<00:06:00.340> not<00:06:00.729> only

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
really labor-intensive because not only

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.459 
really labor-intensive because not only
do<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.240> have<00:06:01.270> to<00:06:01.479> set<00:06:01.659> up<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:01.930> board<00:06:02.110> but<00:06:02.380> you

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
do you have to set up the board but you

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:04.950 
do you have to set up the board but you
also<00:06:02.650> have<00:06:02.979> to<00:06:03.130> assemble<00:06:03.460> the<00:06:03.729> units<00:06:04.090> and<00:06:04.419> I

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
also have to assemble the units and I

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.659 
also have to assemble the units and I
found<00:06:05.199> a<00:06:05.289> couple<00:06:05.469> times<00:06:05.830> that<00:06:06.159> that<00:06:06.400> long

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
found a couple times that that long

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.760 
found a couple times that that long
set-up<00:06:07.150> time<00:06:07.360> actually<00:06:07.990> prevents<00:06:08.560> such<00:06:08.740> a

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
set-up time actually prevents such a

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:11.059 
set-up time actually prevents such a
great<00:06:09.039> game<00:06:09.280> from<00:06:09.639> hitting<00:06:10.000> the<00:06:10.090> table<00:06:10.270> at<00:06:10.599> all

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
great game from hitting the table at all

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:13.860 
great game from hitting the table at all
so<00:06:12.069> another<00:06:12.490> con<00:06:12.849> that<00:06:13.120> some<00:06:13.330> people<00:06:13.599> see<00:06:13.750> in

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
so another con that some people see in

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.020 
so another con that some people see in
this<00:06:14.020> game<00:06:14.229> is<00:06:14.530> the<00:06:14.860> level<00:06:15.130> of<00:06:15.219> randomness<00:06:15.610> so

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.030 
this game is the level of randomness so

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.180 
this game is the level of randomness so
if<00:06:16.120> you're<00:06:16.270> really<00:06:16.539> into<00:06:16.930> strategy<00:06:17.440> there<00:06:18.039> is

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
if you're really into strategy there is

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.559 
if you're really into strategy there is
a<00:06:18.219> little<00:06:18.490> bit<00:06:18.580> of<00:06:18.669> randomness<00:06:18.940> in<00:06:19.090> this<00:06:19.360> game

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569 
a little bit of randomness in this game

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:21.480 
a little bit of randomness in this game
there<00:06:20.050> are<00:06:20.080> a<00:06:20.229> dice<00:06:20.469> roll<00:06:20.650> with<00:06:21.039> the<00:06:21.159> order

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
there are a dice roll with the order

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.219 
there are a dice roll with the order
tokens<00:06:21.940> there<00:06:22.210> are<00:06:22.419> leadership<00:06:22.840> cards<00:06:23.139> that

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
tokens there are leadership cards that

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:24.870 
tokens there are leadership cards that
are<00:06:23.319> drawn<00:06:23.530> randomly<00:06:23.740> so<00:06:24.219> you<00:06:24.310> are<00:06:24.460> gonna<00:06:24.639> face

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
are drawn randomly so you are gonna face

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.149 
are drawn randomly so you are gonna face
that<00:06:24.909> if<00:06:25.419> you're<00:06:25.569> a<00:06:25.599> purely<00:06:26.139> strategy<00:06:26.740> person

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
that if you're a purely strategy person

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:28.469 
that if you're a purely strategy person
that<00:06:27.400> might<00:06:27.580> bother<00:06:27.819> you<00:06:28.030> a<00:06:28.060> little<00:06:28.330> bit

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
that might bother you a little bit

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.370 
that might bother you a little bit
