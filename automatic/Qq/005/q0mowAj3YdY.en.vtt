00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
we have been stuck this is the glow tube

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.230 
we have been stuck this is the glow tube
triple-a<00:00:16.740> version<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.760> here's<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.030> look<00:00:18.120> at

let's go ahead and put the battery in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.820 
let's go ahead and put the battery in
and<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.879> what<00:00:33.059> does<00:00:36.770> printing<00:00:37.770> the

through the modes on to stop on the
desired<00:01:36.840> level<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:42.150> glow<00:01:42.360> tube<00:01:42.630> is<00:01:42.840> actually

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
desired level the glow tube is actually

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
desired level the glow tube is actually
waterproof<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.850> approximately<00:01:45.450> 200<00:01:46.230> foot

waterproof to approximately 200 foot

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.550 
waterproof to approximately 200 foot
that's<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:47.130> 60<00:01:47.550> meters<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> unless<00:01:49.380> you're

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
that's about 60 meters so unless you're

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.730 
that's about 60 meters so unless you're
doing<00:01:49.890> very<00:01:50.070> deep-sea<00:01:50.670> diving

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740

this<00:01:52.740> will<00:01:52.950> stand<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.370> to<00:01:53.640> any<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.990> water

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
this will stand up to any kind of water

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.100 
this will stand up to any kind of water
abuse<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.760> speak<00:01:57.210> I've<00:01:57.480> been<00:01:57.659> using<00:01:57.840> glow

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
abuse so to speak I've been using glow

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.660 
abuse so to speak I've been using glow
tubes<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.590> years<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:59.010> think<00:01:59.370> they're<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> great

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
tubes for years I think they're a great

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.470 
tubes for years I think they're a great
alternative<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.720> emergency<00:02:01.560> light<00:02:01.740> sticks

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
alternative to emergency light sticks

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.520 
alternative to emergency light sticks
especially<00:02:03.480> when<00:02:03.630> used<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.960> conjunction<00:02:04.110> with

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
especially when used in conjunction with

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.950 
especially when used in conjunction with
the<00:02:04.770> lithium<00:02:05.100> battery<00:02:05.240> these<00:02:06.240> things<00:02:06.750> can

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the lithium battery these things can

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.100 
the lithium battery these things can
have<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.140> shelf<00:02:07.409> life<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:07.860> up<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.099> 10<00:02:08.399> years<00:02:08.670> the

have a shelf life of up to 10 years the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.699 
have a shelf life of up to 10 years the
construction<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.229> these<00:02:10.409> is<00:02:10.679> really

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
construction on these is really

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.369 
construction on these is really
first-class<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.819> will<00:02:12.659> definitely<00:02:12.810> put<00:02:13.290> up

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
first-class and will definitely put up

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.070 
first-class and will definitely put up
with<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.680> lot<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.069> abuse<00:02:14.480> I've<00:02:15.480> had<00:02:15.870> mine<00:02:16.050> for

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
with a lot of abuse I've had mine for

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.589 
with a lot of abuse I've had mine for
about<00:02:16.319> three<00:02:16.709> years<00:02:16.739> now<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:18.360> never
