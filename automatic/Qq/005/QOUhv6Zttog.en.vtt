aren't you having it set to do beautiful
watch<00:03:08.340> that's<00:03:08.670> Ross<00:03:08.850> thinking<00:03:09.210> more<00:03:09.870> time<00:03:10.140> or

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
watch that's Ross thinking more time or

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
entire litter 4 to 6 hours and switches

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.750 
entire litter 4 to 6 hours and switches
so<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.500> conservation<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.280> literally<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.700> just

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
so the conservation it literally is just

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.050 
so the conservation it literally is just
if<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.450> beams<00:03:21.630> broken<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.740> it<00:03:22.770> simple<00:03:23.310> okay

y'see listen to scoop up this was it

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.970 
y'see listen to scoop up this was it
doing<00:03:42.190> back

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
doing back

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.270

but<00:03:44.980> it's<00:03:45.099> drying<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:46.769> kind<00:03:47.769> of<00:03:47.830> sneaks<00:03:48.040> them

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
but it's drying it kind of sneaks them

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.610 
but it's drying it kind of sneaks them
up<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:49.090> mechanics<00:03:49.629> or<00:03:49.810> turning<00:03:50.200> them<00:03:50.349> moving

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
up the mechanics or turning them moving

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.680 
up the mechanics or turning them moving
them<00:03:50.769> okay<00:03:51.129> okay<00:03:54.000> distillation<00:03:55.000> smooth<00:03:55.540> it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
them okay okay distillation smooth it

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.170 
them okay okay distillation smooth it
all<00:03:55.840> out<00:03:55.870> so<00:03:56.379> it<00:03:56.500> looks<00:03:56.680> nice<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:56.890> evenly<00:03:57.370> over
