 the three years the chain three years our 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.810

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.499
 years to me lift your thumbs up and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.450
 and here is video special 3 years and 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:18.609
 Minecraft videos resume from me 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.289
 I will explain why so everything 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:25.869
 first will give you some stats 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:28.890
 then 12 1635 subscribers 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.540
 it is our current number of subscribers 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.940
 for the three years of chain 2 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.690
 million 3,178 thousand thirty-one views 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.580
 for about 380 video as can 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.760
 see in the video manager we 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.830
 in real we have 392 video but there are some 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.040
 who are deprived of the blow it must come 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.160
 to the aces and it must be towards the 3 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.360
 187% something like that 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.680
 so here is three years of the chain 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.080
 18 in tomorrow mode so I hope we're going 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.430
 talk about it on minecraft friends 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.520
 so today we find ourselves 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.210
 on minecraft then minecraft is a game 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:11.039
 very special since it is about nomura 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.550
 direct ary jack so why this 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.690
 video I told you yes I do the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.420
 feast of the coup I am more too what 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.700
 so I put it in when you already see a 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.070
 beautiful microphone from me for my 18 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.200
 years it is beautiful it is a budget ti 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.820
 a little youtube base is full 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.079
 which one is frankly it is super 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.299
 you train a great job and so 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.890
 as I wanted to say the videos 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.799
 minecraft on my part will resume 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.790
 as well as fashion presentations 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.319
 simply because before 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.610
 it was before and today it's 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.220
 today no before we had 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.750
 lumbres 17.9 and all that is now 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.980
 there is 1.8 for a little bit of 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.070
 time except it still has no mode 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.670
 that came out at a point 8 or so that 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.980
 I did not find 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.000

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.570

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.580
 not so 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.530

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.140
 directly 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.450
 and there in the meantime I will do 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.590

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.650

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.739
 stopped making videos minecraft 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.950

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.639
 minecraft who do not like it at all 1 at 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.840
 early I did not understand being the one that 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.799
 I asked several people they 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.250

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.359

 So I saw that windows 8 but its good 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.400
 luck not everything but it's mostly through 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.630
 processors and map 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.060

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.630
