00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
we is a test every game we must show our

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.729 
we is a test every game we must show our
potential<00:02:35.299> like<00:02:36.299> we<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.600> no<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.560> key<00:02:37.709> thing

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
potential like we have no the key thing

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.740 
potential like we have no the key thing
is<00:02:37.950> performance<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.790> key<00:02:39.030> thing<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.299> the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
is performance the key thing is the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.410 
is performance the key thing is the
players<00:02:39.989> doing<00:02:40.320> their<00:02:40.470> jobs<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:42.150> do

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
players doing their jobs and if we do

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.590 
players doing their jobs and if we do
that<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.900> we<00:02:43.079> have<00:02:43.230> done<00:02:43.500> previously<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
that like we have done previously the

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.920 
that like we have done previously the
results<00:02:46.019> will<00:02:46.109> follow

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.750 

this<00:02:51.930> year<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.230> make<00:02:52.530> all<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:52.950> almost<00:02:53.460> all<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
this year I make all the almost all the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.350 
this year I make all the almost all the
preseason<00:02:54.120> solders<00:02:54.840> also<00:02:56.060> helped<00:02:57.060> me<00:02:57.210> not

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
preseason solders also helped me not

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.660 
preseason solders also helped me not
because<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.200> years<00:02:58.530> ago<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.860> always<00:02:59.430> came

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
because the the years ago I always came

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.490 
because the the years ago I always came
late<00:02:59.940> for<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.420> have<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.780> play<00:03:00.900> with<00:03:01.140> national

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
late for I have to play with national

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.730 
late for I have to play with national
team<00:03:01.740> i<00:03:01.950> have<00:03:02.160> little<00:03:02.460> bit<00:03:02.700> extra<00:03:02.850> holiday<00:03:03.420> so

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
team i have little bit extra holiday so

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.740 
team i have little bit extra holiday so
maybe<00:03:04.740> in<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.070> beginning<00:03:05.190> before<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.390> didn't

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
maybe in the beginning before I didn't

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.340 
maybe in the beginning before I didn't
play<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.170> I<00:03:08.090> think<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.209> season<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.690> the

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
play but I think this season is the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.410 
play but I think this season is the
thing<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.680> doing<00:03:10.920> good<00:03:11.130> i<00:03:11.190> think<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:12.390> are

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
thing is doing good i think we are

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.290 
thing is doing good i think we are
winning<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:14.010> sixth<00:03:14.340> game<00:03:14.459> in<00:03:14.550> a<00:03:14.730> row<00:03:14.760> so

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
winning the sixth game in a row so

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.820 
winning the sixth game in a row so
that's<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.780> very<00:03:15.990> important<00:03:16.620> for<00:03:16.709> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
that's a very important for the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.670 
that's a very important for the
confident<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.640> team<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.110> course<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.320> only

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
confident for the team of course is only

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.830 
confident for the team of course is only
the<00:03:19.860> beginning<00:03:19.980> no<00:03:20.520> it's<00:03:20.670> not<00:03:20.850> we<00:03:21.720> are

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the beginning no it's not we are

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.690 
the beginning no it's not we are
champing<00:03:22.170> already<00:03:22.500> but<00:03:22.770> we<00:03:23.070> are<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.550> way

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
champing already but we are in the way

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940 
champing already but we are in the way
so<00:03:23.760> i<00:03:24.060> hope<00:03:24.570> we<00:03:24.870> come<00:03:25.080> keep<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:25.590> doing<00:03:25.800> like

never gather offer concrete offer for me
so<00:03:53.380> I<00:03:53.740> was<00:03:54.460> I<00:03:54.940> was<00:03:55.090> quiet<00:03:55.450> West<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.900> was<00:03:56.200> gone<00:03:56.710> I

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
so I was I was quiet West I was gone I

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.890 
so I was I was quiet West I was gone I
was<00:03:56.890> thinking<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.610> in<00:03:57.850> this<00:03:58.000> season<00:03:58.750> that

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
was thinking in the in this season that

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.470 
was thinking in the in this season that
is<00:03:59.050> very<00:03:59.260> important<00:03:59.710> for<00:03:59.880> for<00:04:00.880> me<00:04:01.030> for<00:04:01.330> 20

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
is very important for for me for 20

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.930 
is very important for for me for 20
because<00:04:02.020> we<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> very<00:04:02.740> good<00:04:02.950> squad<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.580> I

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
because we have a very good squad and I

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.090 
because we have a very good squad and I
think<00:04:04.240> we<00:04:04.300> can<00:04:04.480> do<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:04.690> lot<00:04:05.050> of<00:04:05.110> things<00:04:05.230> so<00:04:05.710> I

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
think we can do a lot of things so I

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.370 
think we can do a lot of things so I
didn't<00:04:07.090> think<00:04:07.240> about<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.600> i<00:04:07.810> always<00:04:08.050> say

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
didn't think about that i always say

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.890 
didn't think about that i always say
