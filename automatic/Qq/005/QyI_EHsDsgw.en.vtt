ugly no matter where we go but I think

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.109

if<00:01:48.950> we<00:01:49.040> just<00:01:49.070> keep<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.430> ball<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.640> play<00:01:49.850> in

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
if we just keep the ball in play in

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.540

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
we'll be good I don't think there's a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.320 
we'll be good I don't think there's a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.610 
way to really eliminate my think you
know<00:01:56.420> Jays<00:01:56.659> a<00:01:56.690> good<00:01:56.930> nut<00:01:57.110> bowl<00:01:57.290> or<00:01:57.409> where<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
know Jays a good nut bowl or where you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.020 
know Jays a good nut bowl or where you
can<00:01:57.740> figure<00:01:57.890> out<00:01:58.040> what<00:01:58.220> he<00:01:58.280> needs<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:58.880> i

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
can figure out what he needs to but i

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.630 
can figure out what he needs to but i
think<00:01:59.450> if<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.570> can<00:01:59.780> keep<00:02:00.770> two<00:02:01.100> or<00:02:01.250> three<00:02:01.460> guys

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
think if we can keep two or three guys

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.880 
think if we can keep two or three guys
kind<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.600> keep<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:02.990> ball<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.170> front<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.500> us<00:02:03.620> i

kind of keep the ball in front of us i

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.280 
kind of keep the ball in front of us i
think<00:02:04.520> it<00:02:04.640> will<00:02:04.760> you<00:02:05.450> know<00:02:05.570> it'll<00:02:05.900> play<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.200> our

then<00:02:52.160> everybody<00:02:52.489> else<00:02:52.580> is<00:02:52.790> doing<00:02:52.819> it<00:02:53.060> too

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
then everybody else is doing it too

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.770 
then everybody else is doing it too
that's<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.220> best<00:02:55.430> part

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.970 

why<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.960> think<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.290> lot<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.530> these<00:02:59.710> guys<00:02:59.920> are

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
why do you think a lot of these guys are

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.390 
why do you think a lot of these guys are
missing<00:03:00.250> spares<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.980> mean<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.160> think

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
missing spares I mean I think

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.770 
missing spares I mean I think
everybody's<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:03.880> focused<00:03:04.270> on<00:03:04.360> what's<00:03:04.570> going

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
everybody's so focused on what's going

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.480 
everybody's so focused on what's going
on<00:03:04.840> on<00:03:04.990> the<00:03:05.080> pattern<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.590> sometimes<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.400> get

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
on on the pattern that sometimes you get

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.100 
on on the pattern that sometimes you get
to<00:03:06.760> focus<00:03:07.060> on<00:03:07.180> your<00:03:07.210> trackball<00:03:07.570> you<00:03:07.870> don't<00:03:08.020> pay

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
to focus on your trackball you don't pay

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.350 
to focus on your trackball you don't pay
enough<00:03:08.290> attention<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.770> your<00:03:08.890> spare<00:03:09.100> ball<00:03:09.360> my

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
enough attention to your spare ball my

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.120 
enough attention to your spare ball my
opinion<00:03:11.010> don't<00:03:12.010> stay<00:03:12.160> focused<00:03:12.550> on<00:03:12.670> both<00:03:12.850> shots

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
opinion don't stay focused on both shots

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.560 
opinion don't stay focused on both shots
do<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.220> think<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.610> scoring<00:03:16.120> pace<00:03:16.300> is<00:03:16.420> going

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
do you think the scoring pace is going

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.830 
do you think the scoring pace is going
to<00:03:16.630> be<00:03:16.690> low<00:03:16.840> on<00:03:16.870> this<00:03:17.200> show<00:03:17.380> this<00:03:18.160> morning<00:03:18.370> base

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
to be low on this show this morning base

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.140 
to be low on this show this morning base
will<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:19.930> low<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:20.470> think<00:03:20.770> the<00:03:20.890> first<00:03:21.040> match<00:03:21.430> and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
will be low I think the first match and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.580 
will be low I think the first match and
then<00:03:22.330> once<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:22.630> become<00:03:22.870> define<00:03:23.230> getting

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
then once they become define getting

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.870 
then once they become define getting
into<00:03:23.740> the<00:03:23.830> second<00:03:24.190> match<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.460> think<00:03:24.520> we'll<00:03:24.790> get

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
into the second match I think we'll get

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.090 
into the second match I think we'll get
higher<00:03:25.060> scoring<00:03:25.390> that's<00:03:26.140> too

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
higher scoring that's too

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.410 
higher scoring that's too
person<00:03:28.760> will<00:03:28.880> be<00:03:28.970> a<00:03:29.000> grind<00:03:29.800> yes<00:03:30.800> and<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:32.270> think

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
person will be a grind yes and you think

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.980 
person will be a grind yes and you think
Jason's<00:03:32.810> look<00:03:32.990> is<00:03:34.300> solid<00:03:35.300> then<00:03:35.720> look<00:03:35.870> at

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
Jason's look is solid then look at

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.830 
Jason's look is solid then look at
easing<00:03:36.460> her<00:03:37.460> bit<00:03:37.700> and<00:03:38.210> then<00:03:38.330> whether<00:03:38.660> or<00:03:38.750> not

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
easing her bit and then whether or not

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.360 
easing her bit and then whether or not
they<00:03:38.990> transition<00:03:39.500> too<00:03:39.650> much<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.690> him<00:03:42.620> if<00:03:43.280> he

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
they transition too much to him if he

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.770 
they transition too much to him if he
starts<00:03:43.580> laughing<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.300> Sean<00:03:44.480> start

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
going to go could be an issue but we'll

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.480 
going to go could be an issue but we'll
see<00:03:50.470> it'd<00:03:51.470> be<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> bloodbath<00:03:52.690> I<00:03:53.690> mean<00:03:54.500> me<00:03:54.950> I<00:03:54.980> feel

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.670 

fine<00:04:06.540> what<00:04:06.930> do<00:04:07.080> you<00:04:07.110> think<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.350> need<00:04:07.500> to<00:04:07.530> put<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
fine what do you think you need to put a

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.880 
fine what do you think you need to put a
little<00:04:07.800> surface<00:04:08.070> on<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.310> were<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.460> leave<00:04:08.580> it

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.920 

but<00:04:12.520> I<00:04:12.760> mean<00:04:13.060> obviously<00:04:13.150> this<00:04:13.450> makes<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.780> most

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
but I mean obviously this makes the most

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.690 
but I mean obviously this makes the most
sense<00:04:14.020> wait<00:04:14.860> was<00:04:14.980> I<00:04:15.190> don't<00:04:15.310> know<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.580> you're

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
sense wait was I don't know that you're
