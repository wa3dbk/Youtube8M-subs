00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:08.490
 good day good evening 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:13.760
 In this video you will be shown 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:19.520
 how to increase the volume 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:22.220
 of its seven and 791 without needing 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.490
 applications that really show for 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.490
 nothing 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:38.530
 0 77 91 98 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.870
 although such must be different 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.870
 of default hits 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.500
 he must measure in other ways 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.500
 but I do not know 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.190
 different flavors looks different 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.190
 normal factory 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.060
 good to start 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.860
 the best secret because I showed it to you 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.860
 is 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.080
 Asterix hanging asterix play 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.240
 36 66 33 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.540
 also until it is not marked only 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.450
 squeeze cats again this child enters 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:42.050
 here this record video of 3 hours 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.870
 to 771 applications 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.450
 we go to this menu and we go to where 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.530
 He says 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.530
 to hate 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 we 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.240
 see this way 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:08.360
 to start we go to the normal normal no 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:12.019
 is the ringing notifications as 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.220
 they hear the tones of a message 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:21.580
 volume of the message sound 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:25.200
 here I have it like that in 156 to 255 but 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.710
 please come in 120 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.530
 120 sorry 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.350
 by default it should be like this 120 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.830
 your 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.750
 they will serve you 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:47.320
 what they want until the 155 because if you 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:50.790
 they go up the maximum of 160 more seats 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.790
 then the maximum volume 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.540
 can thunder the 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:02.849
 gosling walk that cell so they 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.849
 I recommend that you only pass 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.530
 at the time of putting the 155 him 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:17.790
 we press the set and this message appears 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.790
 audio in volume 7 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:27.120
 logically we press him ok 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:32.550
 and we got out of there and entered the people 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:35.930
 by sections and this is for the 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:40.659
 headphones earphones 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.659
 by defaul comes at 130 euros 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.390
 they will put it here if they can 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.390
 put the always 60 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:55.450
 because many people like it 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:03.069
 listen to music at full volume or I do not know 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:07.030
 how but there it is 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:10.920
 or put 140 and 145 as you want 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.860
 they squeeze you 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.120
 the set and the same message appears from that 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.720
 moment and we bring you because we went out and 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.639
 we press sprinter mode light is the 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.499
 loudspeaker 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:33.379
 and have it same in itself and was in 120 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:33.379
 also by debugging at 120 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.830
 and here we have to help 150 and 50 50 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.150
 I recommend 150 because center without 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.570
 strong times because if they are heard 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.520
 much more so that all his whole family 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.390
 approaching a person who accepts 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.470
 You were listening 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:58.920
 with 33 points a body by itself is already 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.920
 hear 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.460
 especially it not always is going to take out a 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.460
 little bit 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.960
 they are all 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.840
 It is also that we leave it this way 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.840
 we leave 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.840
 all right 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.960
 and good 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.650
 without given case they do not like the volume 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.180
 to lower you serve and keep 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.180
 entering at the same time you know 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.130
 that's all 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:50.250
 with memories that only to see 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.250
 for 77 91 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.330
 good that has been like that with everything today 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.509
