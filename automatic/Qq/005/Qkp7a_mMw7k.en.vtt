00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.440 

the<00:03:45.720> only<00:03:45.989> text<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.590> this<00:03:46.769> game<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.970> wasn't

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
the only text in this game that wasn't

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.830 
the only text in this game that wasn't
in<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.660> original<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.799> few<00:03:50.160> press<00:03:50.340> l<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.610> our

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
in the original is a few press l on our

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.750 
in the original is a few press l on our
screen<00:03:51.840> shows<00:03:52.230> up<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.799> it's<00:03:53.370> all<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.580> Japanese

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
screen shows up and it's all in Japanese

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.050 
screen shows up and it's all in Japanese
so<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:54.420> have<00:03:54.690> no<00:03:54.959> clue<00:03:55.230> what<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.790> only

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
so I have no clue what it is the only

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.710 
so I have no clue what it is the only
thing<00:03:57.209> I'm<00:03:57.330> guessing<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.930> sleep<00:03:58.380> mode<00:03:59.720> or

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
thing I'm guessing is this sleep mode or

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:12.940 
thing I'm guessing is this sleep mode or
not<00:04:05.870> well<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.850> that's<00:04:09.269> my<00:04:09.480> unboxing<00:04:10.100> and
