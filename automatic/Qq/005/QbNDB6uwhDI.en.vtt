 upper and on the lower line e 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:54.180
 then I smear it with eyeshadow

 black with pencil I create cuts on 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 lips 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.720
 starting from the center and going towards 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.720
 the outside 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.720
 finish the lips continue with the

 going to join the ears e 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:20.120
 creating with pencil 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:20.120
 the mandibular bony part of the skull 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:35.609
 inside the those to give 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:38.700
 depth with white cream liner 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:41.760
 I'm going to surround all traits is the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.159
 line that I created with the black pencil and 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:51.230
 to give depth and a sense of 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:51.230
 three-dimensional stitching 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.379
 on the middle with a red cream eye shadow 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.349
 or even a lipstick is fine 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:09.069
 red drawing a rose a note 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.129
 slightly and stylized as you will have 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:17.400
 noticed this make up for halloween is 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:22.540
 dedicated to the saint muerte which is precisely 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:27.390
 a legend born among the populations of the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:32.590
 mexico of this woman 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.769
 death that has followers of having their own 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.430
 followers see their own workers and faithful 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.769
 who believe in her and who does what they do 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.510
 on his bedside of the promises in the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.239
 in case these promises did not come 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.430
 maintained for some reason the 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.049
 santa muerte will bring death not to 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.379
 faithful who did not keep his promise 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:04:03.250
 but one of the closest loved ones 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:05.889
 b on the rose I applied laner in 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.900
 white cream always to give depth 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:13.840
 re a sense of three-dimensionality ai 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:17.440
 petals and now I'm creating leaves the 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.989
 leaves creates them with a green pencil 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.289
 I used a dark green pencil being 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.099
 a little all the look very very bleak and 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.590
 obviously also the leaves will come later 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:32.770
 treated as a white cream liner 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.430
 always to have this sense of 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.770
 realistic three - dimensionality of rial 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.949
 as you can see right now I'm sorry 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.250
 that you see really blurred however it renders 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.940
 the idea on the forehead design one 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.110
 Spider web 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.820
 this is also possible, do not look 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.820
 to make the perfect one would not make sense 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:05:01.360
 finished drawing with white liners 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.880
 I go to the sides of the various ones 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.990
 black traces always for the usual 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:16.870
 speech of depth with a hide 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:18.460
 spongy and a matte black eye shadow that 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.500
 can you could easily be 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.099
 the same eye shadow used for 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.880
 blend the black around the eyes 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:31.060
 I'm going to fill the corners slightly 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.250
 lateral that there are 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.169
 that I created with white as you are 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.889
 seeing right now always serves 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:42.880
 to give depth and three-dimensional 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:45.160
 dimensionality to the drawing e 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.020
 obviously with black we also go to 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:56.590
 perfect what precisely design 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:59.169
 of the spider web all shaded of course 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.270
 see I do not touch the multiple times 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.040
 black with the black that I took 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:08.320
 initially on the duvet I go on 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.250
 the whole design right now 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:17.320
 instead applying a gel in a cream e 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:20.280
 black cream liner to darken the parts 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:23.830
 always the always sides of the web 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:27.250
 so where I passed the line el hombre 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:37.050
 black vat but also niner 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:40.510
 black this very long dream job 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.280
 very restricted let's say for the tutorial 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.470
 for you I can't do a tutorial a 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.660
 longer than two hours, however, this work 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.110
 very delicate and take away a lot 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.060
 time 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.770
 if you want to do this kind of trick for 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.010
 halloween boy is playing of the uterus 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:59.050
 glasses but because otherwise it does not make it 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:01.030
 does I apply false eyelashes on both 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.210
 upper eyelid than on the side 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.150
 lower and always began to apply 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.300
 with the false eyelash glue the beads 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.190
 of metal are the beads he had 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.100
 house of normalissimi anno a 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:18.010
 buy them I apply along the whole 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.200
 design in return to the eye choose 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.690
 what you prefer the important thing 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:27.880
 applied homogeneously between a 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:30.070
 eye and the other with the dirty brush 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.270
 of black eyeshadow I'm going to fade long 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.780
 all the drawings I created on my face 

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:39.440
 then web of points along the 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:41.900
 lips and rose trying to blend the most 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:47.030
 possible because it will give a sense of reality 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.990
 to our our makeup for 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.420
 complete the look 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.910
 I pulled on the hair applied on 

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:57.710
 side part of silk flowers o 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:08:00.200
 also used a lace foularino 

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:03.770
 which you can choose to keep or 

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.900
 I hope on the hairstyle or décolleté 

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.030
