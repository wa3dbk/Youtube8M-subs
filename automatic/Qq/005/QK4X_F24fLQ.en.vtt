Hi everyone, in this video we are going to use Pebeo colors the Prisme line

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.640
I think these colors are fantastic because they create wonderful surface effects

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.120
Realize this pendent is very easy! We start with a black clay sheet of 2mm thickness

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.660
and I apply on top a thinner pearlescent clay sheet

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.220
we remove air and we make them fit together

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.080
Using a round cutter we cut the base of our pendent 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:59.240
Obviously you can choose the shape you want, but it needs to be flat since the colors are pretty liquid 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.300
so they would fall down using a no flat shape

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:11.774
We can divide the two clay sheets and re-use them for another project

00:01:11.774 --> 00:01:15.934
And this is the our base for the pendent

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:21.834
with a needle tool we create a hole on top before baking 

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:29.455
We bake it at 130 celsius degree for 20 minutes

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:34.215
In the meanwhile the pendent is in the oven

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.240
I want to advise you to do not put into the oven these kind of colors

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.280
because they are not meant to tolerate high temperatures so they burn

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:59.400
Furthermore I advise you to do not use them even with the clay liquid because they smell really really bad while baking... they burn..

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.380
We need to apply them after baking on our creations and let them air dry as normal paint

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.740
To get completely dry they need till 72 hours

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:26.913
Once the clay is baked we can remove eventual imperfections with a sandpaper

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.340
Mix the colors a bit before using them...

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.420
I'm using the emerald and gold colors

00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:42.956
I mix it again before applying it

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.600
and I'm going to apply it uniformly on all the surface 

00:03:21.823 --> 00:03:24.703
Now I apply the gold color

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:30.112
I will not follow a particular design or scheme

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.720
I'm going to put some drops of color...

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.720
and see what will happen...

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.640
Our pendent is finished, we let it dry for 72 hours

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.460
and once it is dried we will apply this pendant support 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.800
How you have seen it is very easy to create this beautiful surface effect

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.620
I hope you enjoyed the tutorial and see you to the next one

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.840
Byeee!
