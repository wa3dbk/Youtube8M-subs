 we want him to continue two dancers 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.939
 ballroom dancing 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:11.099
 he went with it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.409
 after one 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.409
 whole evening can also dance accordingly 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.169
 one is a very simple slow waltz thing 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.560
 the 4 since when 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.560
 APA, we're all getting up now 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.489
 Gentlemen, we start with which 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.319
 since 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:31.599
 left back 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.150
 since 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.920
 "We do not step forward but start life back 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.800
 Sad 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.070
 he is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 Zarate 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.120
 4 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.120
 perhaps 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.250
 one two three 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.500
 5 6 Staab 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.850
 all the things the series even ladies would learn though 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.910
 This will offer from now on 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.070
 Jeter 13 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.020
 Which 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.360
 Knicks and 6 on the dance floors in the 50s under the dance class the best 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.560
 Possibility of body contact with the opposite sex 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.170
 Instrumental music was played because in the lyrics numbers came before the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.410
 to spoil for youth 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.410
 but even then everything else turned earlier 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.500
 just three years later 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 in addition to being independent 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.650
 Manila 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.650
 the years have come 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.870
 the slow waltz works wonders 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
 then as today, the hearts beat faster 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.300
 Brian Stow three of her four years losses of her party 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.669
 Boeing is 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.669
 Borussia 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.040
 Maren m 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040
 the standard manual change 07 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.109
 the deep looks were directed and fled 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.669
 Delicate recovered at Miele 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:41.149
 They all have one thing in common first time in the tough school they wrote in 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.149
 seventh heaven 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.959
 The students are preferred to be danced in alone 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:03.089
 w 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.279
 that was once 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:11.329
 Mr. Dr naja everything is missing 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.329
 the men were in practice 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.519
 so far is better 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.329
 think falls 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.399
 therefore it is always 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.009
 there is no one 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.689
 there are 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.689
 opposite Dr 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.479
 the foxtrot adds even more momentum to the event 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:37.199
 How many of the teenagers would be too excited if you give them this 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.999
 Dance art 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.999
 in their school today 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.019
 on 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.319
 like Prof 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.159
 therefore he continues 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.459
 November 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.459
 No, that's over 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.749
 the 1 6 4 off 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.749
 only about it 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.280
 definitely 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.660
 Furthermore, a school lesson for a lot of conversation 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.680
 the rider 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680
 Interesting 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.460
 Dr 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.469
 OK 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.909
 The dance lesson obviously has a very delicate effect on this second child 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.210
 that is why the prince is after a last years 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.889
 is its the end-2 1 has recently got a look 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.949
 and become a different person now turns his way as it then becomes 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.110
 it would not come 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.860
 Art can be a Mayan devotion 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.979
 In any case, in the first semester, the interlude 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.580
 the meeting is 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.939
 are awarded in no case 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.279
 but it will still be about
