00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
and I love when it comes to with a big

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.930 
and I love when it comes to with a big
mirror<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.880> as<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.090> could<00:02:33.209> see<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:34.470> compact

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
mirror and as you could see the compact

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.330 
mirror and as you could see the compact
it<00:02:35.940> isn't<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.239> big<00:02:36.510> well<00:02:36.780> palette<00:02:37.319> but<00:02:38.160> it's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
it isn't that big well palette but it's

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.390

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
it's got a little weight to it but not

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.860 
it's got a little weight to it but not
too<00:02:43.049> much<00:02:43.079> you<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.340> little<00:02:44.870> brush

pigmented<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.790> they<00:02:56.970> almost<00:02:57.180> got<00:02:57.480> like<00:02:57.690> a

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
pigmented so and they almost got like a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.409 
pigmented so and they almost got like a
slight<00:02:58.200> cream<00:02:58.950> feel<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.940> it's<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:00.239> exactly

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
slight cream feel but it's not exactly

cream I know it's really hard to

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.400 
cream I know it's really hard to
