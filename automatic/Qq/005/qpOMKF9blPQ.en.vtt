00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:12.530
 Very rare This video will explain how to put items on amazon 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.230
 Let's get started 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.620
 At first we log in from account service 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.740
 Count the listings 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:27.810
 You see this screen 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.810
 In Press the product registration of part of individual stock 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.460
 Product name or here 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:39.270
 It is Toka Jean code of goods I invoice of goods 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.270
 it's here 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:49.090
 Yes The delivery note for such a product, even if purchased from amazon 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.140
 Chan code this I am a person of Jean code 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.660
 We will register for the exhibition 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.950
 Others 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.220
 in this way 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:05.210
 The product name is written and the product code is written 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:10.120
 Tower Records's just is not changed only the product name 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.590
 I do not see Jancord, so I look at the product and act Jean 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.040
 In this way to the delivery note 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:20.260
 It has been described in the in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 First delivery chapter in a row in such a form 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.130
 Prepare 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.720
 Put the person of Jean code is liked by entering 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:48.010
 Then I first check if the item is for me like this . 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:51.050
 This is the same as it is opened with another tag 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:58.190
 I can see that 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:00.310
 If the price Toka me to sell back to check here always price you'll be set at this time 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.060
 But 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.060
 Say First I will continue a little start exhibition 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:15.360
 Also put the condition described in the low new 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.240
 Paste the stuff 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:23.570
 The price at this time is the price I want to sell 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.810
 It is good to set and after 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.590
 Machine 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:35.520
 Deterrent to if in the for example 4800 yen want you to take care is reflected once as Zaiko 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:40.580
 There is also a risk that you will be bought at a good time if you 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:47.390
 In the case of me, for example, 6,500 yen because it is put to fba 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:49.960
 Because it is seldom bought 6500 yen by the general seller if it is permitted 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:56.320
 I think that it is that okay 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:59.170
 In this way, the corners are a, not always in line with the current price 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:06.240
 Please set higher 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.240
 This is because the stock is usually reflected as an exhibitor 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:16.650
 A little stock quantity is appropriate and good at any time fba when firmly listing 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.650
 Because you have to change the quantity 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.610
 Save in this way and finish etc 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:32.610
 Then it will be exhibited in the Amazon, but here 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:37.850
 It takes time until it is reflected here 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.850
 We will continue to steadily registering more and more this because 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.770
 This is also my figure though 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.500
 8,668 yen 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:13.970
 At best I did a little stock check, so it was another rival exhibition 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.970
 12,500 yen etc. that I did 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.310
 Because this is each person 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:30.190
 It is at this time 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.849
 I think that it does not matter otherwise because it can be rotated after the price 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:39.409
 I always do this 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:43.449
 At the time of product registration, after checking the number of fba sellers and deciding the price already 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:43.449
 It has completely neglected 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:56.020
 Then 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.350
 One item is exhibited and it will be reflected again here, but here before 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.840
 Product 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.860
 a 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.860
 Is coming out 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.950
 I will try to register more and more in this way 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:17.009
 In this way, we were able to register the item for sale to Amazon 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:19.969
 In the case of normal self-shipment 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:23.400
 Because it is reflected 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:28.770
 Self-shipping if pre-sold 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:35.970
 If you do n't use fba, you should end with this 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:39.419
 From here I will turn all the stock into fba listings, so that's another video 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:43.390
 Now in it we will continue to commentary in the way of 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:48.060
 About the product exhibition registration of amazon is over 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.060
 See you in the next video
