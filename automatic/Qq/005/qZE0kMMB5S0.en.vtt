00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.000
 you download on average fire and 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.350
 use it only before 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.930
 before you will have to have another 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.960
 tribe-censored program 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.700
 to activate it tasso are you 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.920

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.320

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.710
 want to dictate the menu and so on 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:27.750
 for example here on the menu I want to avoid 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:31.200
 the menu I will think here goes there 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.050
 introduce me to the top panel 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:41.900

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:23.380
