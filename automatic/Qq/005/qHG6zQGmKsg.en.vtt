and chapter 15 why are you standing in a
corner<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:12.910> they<00:02:13.239> count<00:02:13.480> they<00:02:13.660> drop<00:02:13.900> down

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
corner because they count they drop down

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.320 
corner because they count they drop down
on<00:02:14.290> either<00:02:14.470> side<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.040> I'm<00:02:15.489> maximizing<00:02:16.239> the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
on either side and I'm maximizing the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.290 
on either side and I'm maximizing the
blast<00:02:16.569> radius<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:18.100> it<00:02:18.280> gets<00:02:18.340> everyone<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
blast radius so it gets everyone on the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.520 
blast radius so it gets everyone on the
elevator<00:02:19.569> if<00:02:19.900> you're<00:02:20.019> right<00:02:20.260> out<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
elevator if you're right out in the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.009 
elevator if you're right out in the
middle<00:02:20.620> in<00:02:21.040> packs<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.400> two<00:02:21.459> yeah<00:02:22.420> that's<00:02:22.900> the

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
middle in packs of two yeah that's the

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.780 
middle in packs of two yeah that's the
first<00:02:23.230> two<00:02:23.380> waves<00:02:23.590> were<00:02:23.800> yeah<00:02:24.190> they'll<00:02:24.400> all<00:02:24.610> be

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
first two waves were yeah they'll all be

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.650 
first two waves were yeah they'll all be
packed<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.739> waves<00:02:27.160> have<00:02:27.660> tar

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
packed to some of the waves have tar

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.690 
packed to some of the waves have tar
babies<00:02:28.989> which<00:02:29.560> sometimes<00:02:29.800> take<00:02:30.190> two<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.459> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
babies which sometimes take two of the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.870 
babies which sometimes take two of the
shots<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.739> just<00:02:32.830> got<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.069> be<00:02:33.130> careful<00:02:33.340> this

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
shots so you just got to be careful this

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.820 
shots so you just got to be careful this
gun<00:02:34.150> takes<00:02:34.450> a<00:02:34.569> really<00:02:34.780> long<00:02:34.870> time<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.350> reload

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
gun takes a really long time to reload

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.729 
gun takes a really long time to reload
you<00:02:36.790> got<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.000> be<00:02:37.090> careful<00:02:37.269> about<00:02:37.540> when<00:02:38.500> you

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
you got to be careful about when you

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.710 
you got to be careful about when you
look<00:02:38.950> some<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.549> waves<00:02:39.819> are<00:02:40.000> right<00:02:40.299> next<00:02:40.510> to

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
look some of the waves are right next to

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.940 
look some of the waves are right next to
each<00:02:40.780> other<00:02:43.590> but<00:02:44.590> and<00:02:44.920> then<00:02:45.519> like<00:02:45.700> also<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.890> you

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
each other but and then like also as you

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.550 
each other but and then like also as you
keep<00:02:48.160> blasting<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.760> same<00:02:48.970> body

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
keep blasting the same body

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.100 
keep blasting the same body
it<00:02:50.560> releases<00:02:50.920> all<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.250> treasure<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.930> their

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
it releases all the treasure in their

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.839 
it releases all the treasure in their
bodies<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:54.220> they'll<00:02:54.340> still<00:02:54.489> get<00:02:54.610> knocked

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
bodies to and they'll still get knocked

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.479 
bodies to and they'll still get knocked
off<00:02:55.030> while<00:02:55.330> supplies<00:02:55.629> uh<00:02:57.120> they<00:02:58.120> might<00:02:59.190> but<00:03:00.190> I

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
off while supplies uh they might but I

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.020 
off while supplies uh they might but I
don't<00:03:00.879> it<00:03:01.150> doesn't<00:03:01.390> look<00:03:01.480> like<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.849> God

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
don't it doesn't look like it that God

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.910 
don't it doesn't look like it that God
just<00:03:04.239> knocks<00:03:04.450> every<00:03:04.840> single<00:03:05.260> room<00:03:05.470> off<00:03:05.650> that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
just knocks every single room off that

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.030 
just knocks every single room off that
yeah<00:03:07.050> it's<00:03:08.050> awesome

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.990 

I'm<00:03:11.519> not<00:03:11.640> even<00:03:11.700> really<00:03:11.939> trying<00:03:12.239> no<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.069> it's<00:03:14.069> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
I'm not even really trying no I it's the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.300 
I'm not even really trying no I it's the
cakewalk<00:03:15.239> it's<00:03:15.900> too<00:03:16.049> easy<00:03:16.079> this<00:03:16.950> part<00:03:17.159> was

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
cakewalk it's too easy this part was

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.520 
cakewalk it's too easy this part was
pretty<00:03:17.670> difficult<00:03:17.909> my<00:03:18.540> first<00:03:18.810> time<00:03:19.019> through

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
pretty difficult my first time through

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.340 
pretty difficult my first time through
yeah<00:03:21.160> yeah

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
yeah yeah

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.210

I<00:03:23.690> the<00:03:24.690> plasma<00:03:25.170> cutter<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.560> javelin

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
I the plasma cutter and the javelin

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.570 
I the plasma cutter and the javelin
thing<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:27.540> off<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.530> javelin<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.430> was<00:03:29.550> a

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
thing and off the javelin it was a

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.010 
thing and off the javelin it was a
terrible<00:03:29.970> no<00:03:30.510> I<00:03:30.540> don't<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:30.960> buck<00:03:31.200> javelin

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
terrible no I don't like buck javelin

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.420 
terrible no I don't like buck javelin
or<00:03:33.010> even<00:03:33.280> like<00:03:33.670> Spears<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:35.920> that<00:03:36.070> you<00:03:36.160> can't

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
or even like Spears is that you can't

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.300 
or even like Spears is that you can't
pick<00:03:36.730> them<00:03:36.880> up<00:03:37.470> no<00:03:38.470> because<00:03:38.770> that<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:39.040> can't

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
pick them up no because that you can't

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.790 
pick them up no because that you can't
use<00:03:40.030> them<00:03:40.210> to<00:03:40.360> knock<00:03:40.570> people<00:03:40.600> off<00:03:41.110> edges<00:03:41.440> if

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
use them to knock people off edges if

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.850 
use them to knock people off edges if
they're<00:03:42.010> not<00:03:42.190> dead<00:03:42.460> hmm<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:44.050> if<00:03:44.380> someone

standing right by a railing or like

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.830 
standing right by a railing or like
right<00:03:46.690> by<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:46.840> cliff<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:48.190> can't<00:03:48.580> like<00:03:49.300> hidden

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
right by a cliff you can't like hidden

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.450 
right by a cliff you can't like hidden
with<00:03:49.930> the<00:03:49.960> spear<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.470> knock<00:03:50.650> him<00:03:50.830> back<00:03:50.860> a<00:03:51.040> foot

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
with the spear and knock him back a foot

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.940 
with the spear and knock him back a foot
and<00:03:51.730> then<00:03:52.210> he<00:03:52.510> just<00:03:52.540> disappears<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.560> then<00:03:53.890> he

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
and then he just disappears and then he

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.620 
and then he just disappears and then he
like<00:03:54.040> falls<00:03:54.340> off<00:03:54.550> to<00:03:54.760> his<00:03:54.880> death<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.540> know

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
like falls off to his death you know

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.070 
like falls off to his death you know
saving<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.320> you<00:03:56.950> know<00:03:57.040> even<00:03:57.220> more<00:03:57.460> time<00:03:58.080> yeah

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
off an edge with the javelin and then

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.660 
off an edge with the javelin and then
they<00:04:04.720> go<00:04:04.750> Kylie<00:04:05.200> fly<00:04:05.680> in<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.040> die<00:04:06.190> with<00:04:06.250> just

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
they go Kylie fly in and die with just

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.100 
they go Kylie fly in and die with just
one<00:04:06.940> instead<00:04:07.240> of<00:04:07.360> like<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.660> know<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.810> hit<00:04:08.020> him

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
with his spear and you know then the PV

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.270 
with his spear and you know then the PV
equals<00:04:13.630> NRT<00:04:13.720> is<00:04:14.140> not<00:04:14.320> changing<00:04:14.860> whether<00:04:15.040> he's

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
equals NRT is not changing whether he's

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.699
