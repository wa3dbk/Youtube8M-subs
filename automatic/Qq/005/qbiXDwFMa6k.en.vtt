00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.580
 I have here 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:17.420
 a pair of skates these are 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.090
 1 pekín is has girón of his landlady 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.210
 When the landlady says I want to give birth 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.669
 peking but please bring melo yes 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.140
 and viscera or with the stomach 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:32.189
 Closed 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.620
 only killed by the neck and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.750
 trying to keep the skin intact 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.360
 have to get an inflator and they go to 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.210
 put the inflator between the skin and the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.750
 neck and they will start to inflate a 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.629
 Once we finish inflating the ducks 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.339
 now if we can open the stomach of the 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.550
 part below we will remove all the 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.190
 interiors and we are going to wash very well 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.220
 the duck on the inside there is 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.309
 wash it until that water that comes out of the 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.070
 stomach does not contain any blood or 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.050
 do not go red with salt 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.240
 perfect this has been this saladito 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:18.980
 now we grab the head and start 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.530
 to bathe the duck 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:25.400
 let's hook it to me I like 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.440
 hook it under the wing 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.630
 that goes more or less by the part of 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.350
 up and I hang it like this 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 so I have a skewer in the garden 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.640
 there so all rustic I have eight teeth 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.640
 of garlic 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.060
 in is a little region I have 34 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.270
 cloves and I have peppers 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.120
 sheet about 10 peppers plate and 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.060
 let's grind in a mortar 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:03.110
 and to give it a touch 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.720
 we have panca chili paste with mashed 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.330
 ají panca and the skin is dry if the 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.550
 People begin to crumple like cardboard ar 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.610
 start to put transparent is there 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.200
 when we have to withdraw them to have 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.910
 about 34 hours could leave you more 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.580
 as long as you control the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.750
 temperature and air and we started to 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.440
 Fill 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.160
 inside the duck to we start sewing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.160
 from above 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.630
 come in, it's the way I do it 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.490
 I make 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.050
 anyway 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.930
 the idea is simply to close it 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:46.010
 I have a syrup here 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:52.569
 I'm all tanned now my 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:55.090
 cylinder has half an hour 40 minutes of 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.260
 of having ignited the coal then 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.130
 let's start by doing a little 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.010
 Garrison 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.870
 and we are going to cut a kind of cane 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.170
 a little thin between juliana and cane 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.170
 gay 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.579
 now I am the same 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.170
 we seize the future that you remember is 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.170
 marinated with sugar vinegar 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.780
 you have to see that 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.900
 what we put 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.860
 the Chinese onion here 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.269
 this has stuck a bit against the 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.360
 wall suddenly is not smeared 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.150
 well look at what a beautiful shoe 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.980
 we are going to remove the puppies this is not 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.129
 that losing them you have to take care of them because 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.569
 they serve but we wash remember that the 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.739
 stuffing is simply for flavoring 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.739
 we do not need it 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.030
 ok we have the other chest there then 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.940
 let's put a little bit of this sauce 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.450
 we put him 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.230
 a good piece of 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.230
 of duck 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.310
 try with us 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.310
 Crispy cool ajicito for you 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.310
 pique 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.870
 It is true 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:32.819
 two
