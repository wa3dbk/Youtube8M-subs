this<00:01:35.820> might<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.270> how<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> rule<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.899> bottle

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
this might be how to rule out bottle

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.200 
this might be how to rule out bottle
caps<00:01:37.590> unless<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.369> just<00:01:38.429> a<00:01:38.670> really<00:01:38.909> tough

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

target in iron going back to my combined
moon<00:01:46.369> target<00:01:50.719> so<00:01:51.719> it's<00:01:52.020> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> bottle<00:01:52.530> cap

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
moon target so it's in the bottle cap

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.910 
moon target so it's in the bottle cap
range<00:01:54.500> let's<00:01:56.359> let's<00:01:57.359> see<00:01:57.569> what<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:58.079> there

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
range let's let's see what that is there

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.529 
range let's let's see what that is there
again<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.340> disc<00:01:59.640> it's<00:01:59.969> not<00:02:00.119> hitting<00:02:00.359> it

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
again with disc it's not hitting it

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.880 
again with disc it's not hitting it
really<00:02:05.720> okay<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:06.780> whatever<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.679> still

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
really okay so whatever it is it's still

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
really okay so whatever it is it's still
in<00:02:08.039> here<00:02:11.060> pin<00:02:12.060> pointer<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.510> broken<00:02:13.549> it's<00:02:14.549> not

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
in here pin pointer is broken it's not

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.960 
in here pin pointer is broken it's not
fun<00:02:15.239> without<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.870> pin<00:02:16.110> pointer<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:19.760> there<00:02:20.760> it

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
fun without a pin pointer and there it

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.610 
fun without a pin pointer and there it
is<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.769> think<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:23.010> may<00:02:23.160> have<00:02:23.190> discovered<00:02:23.700> how<00:02:24.060> to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
is I think I may have discovered how to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.259 
is I think I may have discovered how to
reel<00:02:25.620> out<00:02:25.829> bottle<00:02:26.370> caps<00:02:26.670> that's<00:02:26.879> really

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
reel out bottle caps that's really

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:27.920 
reel out bottle caps that's really
interesting

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
interesting

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.520 
interesting
so<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.829> recap<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:30.030> appears<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.569> bottle<00:02:31.290> caps

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
so to recap it appears that bottle caps

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.210 
so to recap it appears that bottle caps
rusted<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.190> non<00:02:32.579> rusted<00:02:33.139> will<00:02:34.139> hit<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:35.069> know

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
rusted and non rusted will hit you know

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.960 
rusted and non rusted will hit you know
in<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.459> twenty<00:02:35.850> three<00:02:36.090> ish<00:02:36.590> around<00:02:37.590> there

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
in the twenty three ish around there

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.640 
in the twenty three ish around there
without<00:02:38.970> discrimination<00:02:39.660> but<00:02:40.290> once<00:02:40.500> you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
without discrimination but once you

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.710 
without discrimination but once you
start<00:02:40.889> putting<00:02:41.069> in<00:02:41.250> discrimination<00:02:41.880> that

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
start putting in discrimination that

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.569 
start putting in discrimination that
broken<00:02:43.319> up<00:02:43.440> signal

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
broken up signal

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.330 
broken up signal
it<00:02:45.329> just<00:02:45.540> isn't<00:02:45.690> consistent<00:02:46.170> anymore<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:46.980> if

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
it just isn't consistent anymore and if

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.879 
it just isn't consistent anymore and if
you<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.760> listen<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.239> mm<00:02:48.720> depending<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.769> the

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:49.889 
you really listen it mm depending on the

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.470 
you really listen it mm depending on the
mode<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.400> might<00:02:50.579> not<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:50.880> consistent<00:02:51.239> without

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
mode it might not be consistent without

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.520 
mode it might not be consistent without
discrimination

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
discrimination

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.670 
discrimination
I<00:02:52.709> guess<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.849> danger<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.540> coins<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
I guess the danger here is coins that

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.640 
I guess the danger here is coins that
are<00:02:55.799> near<00:02:55.950> iron<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.549> I<00:02:56.579> wouldn't<00:02:56.970> listen<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.650> to

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
are near iron so I wouldn't listen to to

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.620 
are near iron so I wouldn't listen to to
these<00:02:58.799> findings<00:02:59.340> immediately<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.209> would<00:03:00.329> still

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
these findings immediately I would still

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.569 
these findings immediately I would still
check<00:03:00.900> all<00:03:01.079> your<00:03:01.260> signals<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.919> make<00:03:02.069> sure<00:03:02.340> that

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
check all your signals to make sure that

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.699 
check all your signals to make sure that
is<00:03:02.790> not<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:03.000> coin<00:03:03.329> by<00:03:03.569> iron<00:03:03.750> that's<00:03:04.079> causing<00:03:04.440> it

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
is not a coin by iron that's causing it

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.799 
is not a coin by iron that's causing it
