00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
go with that I honestly think that's the

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.810 
go with that I honestly think that's the
best<00:00:45.480> way<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.020> do<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.260> simply<00:00:46.649> because<00:00:46.829> they're

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
best way to do it simply because they're

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.459 
best way to do it simply because they're
the<00:00:47.850> biggest<00:00:48.120> guys<00:00:48.390> they're<00:00:48.719> slow<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.020> they

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
the biggest guys they're slow and they

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.660 
the biggest guys they're slow and they
help<00:00:49.649> they'll<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.860> no<00:00:50.039> time<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.309> hit<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
help they'll have no time to hit you

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.760 
help they'll have no time to hit you
pretty<00:00:50.789> much<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.809> select<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.260> random<00:00:52.379> stage

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
pretty much then select a random stage

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.189 
pretty much then select a random stage
doesn't<00:00:53.160> really<00:00:53.280> matter<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:55.219> sure<00:00:56.219> whatever<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
doesn't really matter up sure whatever I

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.660 
doesn't really matter up sure whatever I
don't<00:00:58.199> think<00:00:58.260> stages<00:00:58.800> ever<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.280> an<00:00:59.370> effect

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
don't think stages ever have an effect

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
don't think stages ever have an effect
on<00:00:59.850> fighting<00:01:00.210> games<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.600> care<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:00.930> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
on fighting games don't care what I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.720 
on fighting games don't care what I
don't<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> why<00:01:01.680> people<00:01:01.710> care<00:01:02.250> about<00:01:02.340> them<00:01:02.579> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.500 
don't know why people care about them so
much<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.750> here<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.260> go<00:01:04.290> now<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.880> point<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
much so here we go now at this point I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.030 
much so here we go now at this point I
was<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:08.010> need<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.299> hundred<00:01:09.659> times

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
was you need to do this a hundred times

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.810 
was you need to do this a hundred times
so<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.070> only<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:11.790> four<00:01:12.650> rounds<00:01:13.650> per<00:01:13.860> game<00:01:14.100> so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so you only get four rounds per game so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
if we can do simple math it's going to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.789 
if we can do simple math it's going to
take<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.460> 25<00:01:17.850> rounds<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.049> did<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> in
