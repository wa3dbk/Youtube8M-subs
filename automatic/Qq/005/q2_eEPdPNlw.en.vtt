then to a G minor chord after those two
chords<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> E<00:01:10.560> string<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> do

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
chords you are the E string and you do

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
chords you are the E string and you do
first<00:01:11.549> third<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.659> string<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.170> to

first third then the a string you to
first<00:01:13.470> start<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:15.830> just<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:18.170> then<00:01:19.170> up

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
first start so just like that then up

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.870 
first start so just like that then up
here<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.710> sixth<00:01:20.040> fret<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> major

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
here the sixth fret you do the major

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
here the sixth fret you do the major
shape<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.390> did<00:01:21.509> over<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.869> same

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
shape you did over there then the same

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
shape you did over there then the same
major<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.979> that's<00:01:31.979> back<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> F<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
major and that's back the F at the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.810 
major and that's back the F at the
beginning<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.320> last<00:01:35.130> part<00:01:35.340> again<00:01:35.369> it's

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
beginning so that last part again it's

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
beginning so that last part again it's
an<00:01:36.329> a-shaped<00:01:36.960> major<00:01:37.530> chord<00:01:39.020> be<00:01:40.020> shaped<00:01:40.290> major

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
an a-shaped major chord be shaped major

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.240 
an a-shaped major chord be shaped major
on<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.040> 6th<00:01:41.280> fret<00:01:42.649> both<00:01:43.649> those<00:01:43.829> are<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.009> six

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on the 6th fret both those are on six

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.090 
on the 6th fret both those are on six
red<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.970> back<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.329> f<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.659> beginning

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.070 

so<00:01:49.100> all<00:01:49.790> together<00:01:50.120> it's<00:01:50.630> just<00:01:50.900> a<00:01:50.960> little

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
so all together it's just a little

00:01:51.080 --> 00:02:11.770 
so all together it's just a little
something<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.440> this<00:02:09.429> so<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:11.300> was<00:02:11.480> just<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
something like this so that was just the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.320 
something like this so that was just the
intro<00:02:12.020> part<00:02:12.310> for<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.400> rest<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.850> song<00:02:14.060> you

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
intro part for the rest of the song you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.480 
intro part for the rest of the song you
use<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.410> exact<00:02:15.680> same<00:02:15.709> chords<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.190> did<00:02:16.340> before

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
use the exact same chords you did before

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.250 
use the exact same chords you did before
but<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.060> just<00:02:17.209> do<00:02:17.360> them<00:02:17.510> in<00:02:17.600> successive<00:02:17.959> in

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
but you just do them in successive in

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.520 
but you just do them in successive in
succession<00:02:18.770> instead<00:02:19.760> of<00:02:19.790> having<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.239> little

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
succession instead of having a little

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.900 
succession instead of having a little
bits<00:02:21.530> of<00:02:22.989> filler<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.260> between<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:25.640> it's<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:27.910> B

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
bits of filler in between so it's the B

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.240 
bits of filler in between so it's the B
major<00:02:29.120> like<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> beginning<00:02:30.550> f<00:02:31.550> G<00:02:33.250> mutters

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
major like the beginning f G mutters

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.130 
major like the beginning f G mutters
i'ma<00:02:34.700> c<00:02:35.420> minor<00:02:35.630> G<00:02:36.530> minor<00:02:36.970> sixth<00:02:37.970> fret<00:02:40.420> F

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:58.199 

there's<00:02:45.140> different<00:02:45.440> drum<00:02:45.680> batters<00:02:55.209> and

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
there's different drum batters and

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.200 
there's different drum batters and
that's<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.570> general<00:02:59.900> by<00:03:00.140> dispatch
