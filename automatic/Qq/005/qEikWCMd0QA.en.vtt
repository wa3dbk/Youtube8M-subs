00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
was you know the 59 design is such a

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.990 
was you know the 59 design is such a
state<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:29.080> is<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.860> epitome<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.430> American

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
state it is the epitome of American

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.810 
state it is the epitome of American
design<00:03:31.330> it's<00:03:31.630> kind<00:03:31.810> of<00:03:31.930> like<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.110> jet<00:03:32.470> age<00:03:32.820> type

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
design it's kind of like a jet age type

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.559 
design it's kind of like a jet age type
of<00:03:33.970> card<00:03:34.209> and<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:35.380> it's<00:03:35.560> long<00:03:35.830> lean

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
of card and so it's long lean

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.970 
of card and so it's long lean
well<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.870> guess<00:03:37.019> people<00:03:37.049> associate<00:03:37.950> that

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
well and I guess people associate that

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.670 
well and I guess people associate that
with<00:03:38.249> like<00:03:38.670> America<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.689> dominating<00:03:40.260> nation

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
with like America the dominating nation

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.270 
with like America the dominating nation
represents<00:03:41.310> excess<00:03:41.939> it<00:03:42.450> represents

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280
