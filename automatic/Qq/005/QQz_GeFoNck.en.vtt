00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.650
 salve salve my name is marcel 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.839
 this one is more of a Video asphalt 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.990
 urban and filming today we will go 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.109
 Seek to hear a little there of the new 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:26.810
 escape of the bike I ended up putting on the motorcycle 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.810
 the escape well rainey xote 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.420
 two in two is an escape that makes 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.559
 Noise even I miss his noise 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.940
 power too but this is a 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.930
 which is not indicated for the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.290
 shorter power even he is the is the 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.680
 Sound of it I think harley without 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.680
 sports exhaust basically 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.020
 I have to look good pot we see that 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.730
 the built- in microphone 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.730
 connected gate group 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.700
 you can hear there that the bike is too 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 a little because it fails to equalize the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.390
 fuel injection 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.140
 I put the sports air filter there 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.440
 You know the reason so I 'm seeing more. 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.460
 air inlet giving more air flow and 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.460
 I did not enrich the mix 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.460
 so this video 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.450
 Are you going to enjoy a little of the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.960
 symphony and xote headquarters 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.960
 come on 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.610
 the cord the tone 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.290
 Galley detail exhaust likes 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.900
 for me, it also becomes the 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.130
 item on the motorcycle because 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.160
 driver of the car that happened in the state 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.600
 original the guys were not listening 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.290
 in most cases they do not 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.630
 they even hear what I already have 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.510
 I commented and previous thulium 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.770
 the bike is the is the weakest link here 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.430
 Traffic 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.430
 so you 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.280
 It has that footprint rock'n roll there looks 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.960
 face enters position too 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.030
 even though you were weaker 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.630
 in the middle of the curve 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.050
 That cart resolves I decided to enter. 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.050
 on the contrary 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.210
 I 'm not slow that much of 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.490
 hit forward with him 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.000
 and regardless of who is right or 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:17.110
 It's wrong for you to live with you, which is 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.790
 ride a bike will suffer more than 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.790
 obvious that it affected the car, right? 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.800
 care sure is good for you to call 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.270
 the same attention 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.270
 besides enjoying the sound of the radio 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.370
 the shortcut I do not recommend comes 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.400
 people and let's remember with affection 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.400

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:06.670
 no one is obliged to 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.799
 Guess what you're going to do 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.799
 no one also has that ability, right? 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.490

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.199

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.229

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.629
