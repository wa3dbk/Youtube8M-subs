 Viktor Drabysh I'm just glad that such 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.700
 there is one group on our project 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.190
 the problem is that this is not my group everything 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.160
 thank you Victor, my life was just 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.310

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.660
 man such groups is very good i 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 the only thing I want to say is not just 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.050
 I wanted to hear 2 voices in the group 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.639
 Names in this calf so that were a little bit 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.610
 only one voice is boring 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.250
 and everything else is fine fine 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.039
 it seems to me that it is very very fashionable you 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.780
 very cool and ranked and played 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.259
 straight fashionable and very clever 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.080

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.020
 as if specially dressed you look very similar 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.020
 to the producer of such a group 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.909
 very cool music and very cool 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.949
 producer you word the thing is that we 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.500
 really we discussed with the guys 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:25.919
 in general, that's exactly this song because I 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:28.050
 afraid that will not be understood by the text of the case 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:32.789
 what verses 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:35.520
 it's very interesting here and here's how they are 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.650
 play with rhyme but they have songs 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.590
 such that this one for the concert 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.060
 more winning though well done coped 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:48.199
 because it all had a drive and 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.199
 well thank you
