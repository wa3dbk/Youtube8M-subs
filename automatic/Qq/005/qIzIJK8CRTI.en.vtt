will<00:01:43.530> probably<00:01:44.040> be<00:01:44.250> packed<00:01:44.910> with<00:01:45.150> drones<00:01:45.690> and

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
will probably be packed with drones and

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.400 
will probably be packed with drones and
then<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.520> will<00:01:47.670> all<00:01:47.820> forget<00:01:48.360> their<00:01:49.020> bloody
