starting off here I changed up the
flames

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
flames

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.160 
flames
I<00:02:00.869> gave<00:02:01.469> Sasuke<00:02:02.250> two<00:02:03.149> different<00:02:03.750> colored

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I gave Sasuke two different colored

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.709 
I gave Sasuke two different colored
flame<00:02:04.469> pieces<00:02:04.979> because<00:02:05.670> before<00:02:06.030> he<00:02:06.360> had<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
flame pieces because before he had the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.809 
flame pieces because before he had the
same<00:02:06.899> color<00:02:07.140> flames<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.799> flames<00:02:08.489> aren't

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
same color flames and flames aren't

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.830 
same color flames and flames aren't
usually<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.300> same<00:02:09.569> color<00:02:10.530> exactly<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.840> felt

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
usually the same color exactly so I felt

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.080 
usually the same color exactly so I felt
like<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.349> more<00:02:13.530> accurate

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
like that was a more accurate

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.780 
like that was a more accurate
and<00:02:14.390> then<00:02:15.849> just<00:02:16.849> put<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.209> down<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:19.370> can<00:02:19.400> see

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and then just put this down you can see

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480

do this video anyways so just put this
on<00:03:09.849> there<00:03:10.849> you<00:03:11.060> go<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.720> you<00:03:11.750> can<00:03:11.870> kind<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.319> see

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
on there you go so you can kind of see

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.470 
on there you go so you can kind of see
so<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.560> added<00:03:15.890> in<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.370> dark<00:03:16.640> blue<00:03:16.910> part<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.330> his

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480

so I added in the dark blue part of his
robe<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:19.239> yeah<00:03:20.239> I<00:03:20.269> think<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.780> just<00:03:20.870> adds<00:03:21.170> to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
robe and yeah I think it just adds to

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.789 
robe and yeah I think it just adds to
the<00:03:21.880> realistic<00:03:22.880> part<00:03:23.120> of<00:03:23.660> Sasuke<00:03:24.140> here<00:03:24.590> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.819 
then the sword I did quite a bit of work
on<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.430> back<00:03:28.640> torso<00:03:29.239> you<00:03:29.359> could<00:03:29.510> see<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.900> put<00:03:30.620> on
