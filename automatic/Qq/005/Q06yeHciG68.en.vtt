00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
what I like about this is that it's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.810 
what I like about this is that it's
non-network<00:00:30.359> specific<00:00:30.990> unlike<00:00:31.800> most<00:00:32.040> modems

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
non-network specific unlike most modems

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.790 
non-network specific unlike most modems
that<00:00:32.940> you're<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.540> from<00:00:33.870> particular

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that you're going to get from particular

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.400 
that you're going to get from particular
UK<00:00:35.460> suppliers<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.750> one<00:00:36.930> obviously<00:00:37.020> doesn't

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
UK suppliers this one obviously doesn't

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.049 
UK suppliers this one obviously doesn't
have<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> network<00:00:37.710> associated<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> idea

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
have a network associated and the idea

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.049 
have a network associated and the idea
is<00:00:39.379> is<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.770> put<00:00:40.920> your<00:00:41.040> sim<00:00:41.280> card<00:00:41.520> inside<00:00:41.879> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
is is you put your sim card inside it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.690 
is is you put your sim card inside it
into<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> top<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> doesn't<00:00:44.460> matter<00:00:44.520> what

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
into the top so it doesn't matter what

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.920 
into the top so it doesn't matter what
you've<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.059> put<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.809> sim<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.520> and<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> goes

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
you've got put your sim in and it goes

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
you've got put your sim in and it goes
voila<00:00:48.930> you've<00:00:49.800> got<00:00:49.980> yourself<00:00:50.250> some<00:00:50.399> internet

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
voila you've got yourself some internet

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.459 
voila you've got yourself some internet

and<00:01:05.820> 2g<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.570> switches<00:01:06.780> depending<00:01:07.320> upon

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and 2g and it switches depending upon

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.950 
and 2g and it switches depending upon
what<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.799> pick<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:09.299> way<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> works<00:01:09.720> is

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
what it can pick up the way it works is

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.859 
what it can pick up the way it works is
I'll<00:01:10.890> demonstrate<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.850> day<00:01:12.630> live

got in front of me plug it in it's got
all<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.890> software<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.430> already<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.299> will

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
all the software on already and it will

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.820 
all the software on already and it will
prompt<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> install<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.650> does

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
prompt you to install it and that does

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.510 
prompt you to install it and that does
it<00:01:19.979> very<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.670> quickly<00:01:20.850> indeed<00:01:21.799> you<00:01:22.799> then<00:01:25.520> you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
it very very quickly indeed you then you

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
it very very quickly indeed you then you
load<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> app<00:01:29.240> yes<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:31.079> quite<00:01:31.200> hard

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
load up the app yes it's quite hard

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.130 
load up the app yes it's quite hard
doing<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.650> backwards

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
doing it backwards

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.990 
doing it backwards
yeah<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.380> asking<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> pin<00:01:35.100> I'm<00:01:35.909> not

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
yeah then asking for the pin I'm not

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.300 
yeah then asking for the pin I'm not
going<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.210> show<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.509> bit<00:01:37.189> what<00:01:38.189> you'd

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
going to show you that bit what you'd

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.310 
going to show you that bit what you'd
normally<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.759> do<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.150> setup<00:01:39.960> your

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
normally have to do is setup your

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.490 
normally have to do is setup your
network<00:01:41.420> properly<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.659> APN<00:01:43.020> settings

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
network properly like the APN settings

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.649 
network properly like the APN settings
so<00:01:43.979> it's<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.400> really<00:01:44.490> something<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.479> do

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
so it's not really something you can do

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.090 
so it's not really something you can do
on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.590> move<00:01:47.330> for<00:01:48.330> the<00:01:48.390> first<00:01:48.540> time<00:01:49.040> yeah<00:01:50.040> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
on the move for the first time yeah you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.050 
on the move for the first time yeah you
have<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.250> make<00:01:50.399> sure<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.580> got<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> settings

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
have to make sure you got the settings

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.310 
have to make sure you got the settings
in<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.330> which<00:01:51.570> took<00:01:51.720> me<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> whole<00:01:51.960> filed<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
in there which took me a whole filed and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.840 
in there which took me a whole filed and
workout<00:01:53.659> connect<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.750> up<00:01:55.850> authenticate

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
workout connect it up authenticate

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.460 
workout connect it up authenticate
pretty<00:01:57.060> quickly<00:01:57.330> as<00:01:58.940> usual<00:01:59.940> there<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.470> and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
pretty quickly as usual there we go and

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.109 
pretty quickly as usual there we go and
you<00:02:01.799> get<00:02:01.950> all<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> stats<00:02:02.340> down<00:02:02.610> here<00:02:02.850> as<00:02:02.940> well

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
storage which is a bit of downer well

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.259 
storage which is a bit of downer well
known<00:03:05.100> native<00:03:05.459> storage<00:03:05.790> because<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.150> good

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
known native storage because the good

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.740 
known native storage because the good
thing<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:07.190> actually<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:09.209> comes<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.720> a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
thing is that actually it comes with a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.900 
thing is that actually it comes with a
little<00:03:09.900> side<00:03:10.170> panel<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:11.579> can<00:03:11.730> put<00:03:11.850> your

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
little side panel we can put your

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.180 
little side panel we can put your
microSD<00:03:12.540> card<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:12.959> there<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:13.350> officially<00:03:13.859> it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
microSD card in there now officially it

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.940 
microSD card in there now officially it
supports<00:03:14.820> up<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.000> an<00:03:15.180> eight<00:03:15.390> gigabyte<00:03:16.200> microSD

supports up to an eight gigabyte microSD

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.890 
supports up to an eight gigabyte microSD
of<00:03:17.820> course<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.120> those<00:03:18.269> big<00:03:18.480> ones<00:03:18.630> out<00:03:18.870> there

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
of course we those big ones out there

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.210 
of course we those big ones out there
and<00:03:19.290> I'm<00:03:19.380> pretty<00:03:19.590> sure<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.890> could<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.190> job

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
and I'm pretty sure it could do the job

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.060 
and I'm pretty sure it could do the job
for<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.609> as<00:03:20.700> well<00:03:20.840> it's<00:03:21.840> got<00:03:22.079> two<00:03:22.380> antennas

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
for that as well it's got two antennas

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.920 
for that as well it's got two antennas
so<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> idea<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.670> it's<00:03:24.060> guaranteed<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.570> get<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
so the idea is it's guaranteed to get a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.479 
so the idea is it's guaranteed to get a
much<00:03:25.230> better<00:03:25.260> signal<00:03:25.980> it's<00:03:26.100> got<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.280> master

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
much better signal it's got the master

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.699 
much better signal it's got the master
and<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.790> slave<00:03:26.940> between<00:03:27.870> them<00:03:28.079> hopefully

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and the slave between them hopefully

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.039 
and the slave between them hopefully
you're<00:03:28.829> getting<00:03:28.859> something<00:03:29.250> good<00:03:29.630> it<00:03:30.630> works

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
you're getting something good it works

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.199 
you're getting something good it works
on<00:03:31.489> just<00:03:32.489> about<00:03:32.579> any<00:03:32.790> operating<00:03:33.120> system

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
on just about any operating system

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.770 
on just about any operating system
you've<00:03:33.600> got<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.049> that's<00:03:34.260> XP<00:03:34.680> Vista<00:03:35.340> no<00:03:36.269> word<00:03:36.569> is

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
you've got so that's XP Vista no word is
