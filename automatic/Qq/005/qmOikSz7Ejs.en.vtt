00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 very good kids since we are in a 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.460
 video this I bring you call of duty cost and 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.500
 good as I have seen a miniature daily 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 of a hacker in chaotic like 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.610
 will remember this series to the dgt to 5 that the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.040
 I will continue without any problem but 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.630
 I wanted to add this because I've been a 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.039
 uncle who has played a lot for tutti in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.869
 his whole life is playing call of duty 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.699
 until it was most fun gta 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.410
 quite a bit and leaves you a little bit 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.390
 but good with this from the hacks and everything 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.760
 the roll, yes, I really wanted 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.990
 upload it and I'll see it reflected 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 You likes to see if you like it or not though 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.349
 continue the series but let's go there I'll 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.300
 explain a little what I bring what 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.280
 I will bring, I will bring especially as 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.770
 in the gta series the things that there are 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.899
 now hacks and stories of this is 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 installed tutti there are very many you have the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.079
 channel of the hacker always in the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.420
 description for you to know and good 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.070
 as we're going to explain we have god mode 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.289
 as you have seen that it is getting into me 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 super speed x but I saw that it is a 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.440
 X but I saw that I uploaded it in the channel 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.930
 just a little bit we are going to do a live 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 streaming distributing then level to the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.440
 people and good as you have seen the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
 principle as regards seeing your city 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.789
 blowjob 30,000 points gave me 30,000 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.199
 points and level up every time 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.810
 I kill myself they go more or less 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.700
 impressive here then it also puts me 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.990
 viewer mode that you could not kill 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.750
 but I could say all over the map 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 flying a savage and good here already 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 we are a little getting into matter 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.020
 As you can see, he puts airplanes that he can put 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.680
 planes be 130s that more could get 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.119
 you hunt an awesome paranoia then 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.530
 it becomes a package that you are going to 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.000
 see now and I can walk as if 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.740
 out a package can convert you to 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.689
 pack by plane in all this you can 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.729
 convert to you and it's a pretty thing 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.829
 cool with guiza and that's the one that 's the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.390
 package and as you are watching it chases me 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.490
 like a kind of head all the time 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 I do not know what it was I do not explain it very 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.970
 well but I do not know is like another player 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.890
 weird and then this last for 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.810
 end the chapter will always be of 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.819
 two minutes one hours and two minutes and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.830
 half as much and good as you see here 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.360
 attracts all the people in the game 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.700
 and you can kill them how do you have the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.619
 God, I took advantage of it a bit but I do 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.569
 You can be killed without any 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.069
 problem and as you see attracts everyone to 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.539
 all to all and you make triple bottoms 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.789
 multiple lows and the whole roll is a 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.080
 killing and good nothing else I wanted to tell you 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.330
 I hope you like this series to see 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.399
 how much light yagami arrived and there I see 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.140
 If you like this series or not, nothing else 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.980
 I hope you liked it obviously and 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.069

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.069

 and
