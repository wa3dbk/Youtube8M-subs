00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:17.150
 Hello, I decided to show it today 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:17.150
 how to dot this sponge 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.130
 it is desirable that she was so big 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.980
 foam can be foam but it is very 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.520
 small 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.960
 texture and get worse as necessary 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.890
 bigger there are different of course but I 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:48.920
 such is present at the moment about 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:58.379
 yes it is 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:01:08.780
 this method is quite expensive painting 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:08.780
 it turns out but for paint quite a lot 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:22.439
 We first feed the sponge and try on 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 some let's say wrong here and there 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:31.520
 then we take turns wobbler Well 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.520
 take this 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:47.030
 and gently take and you to 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.370
 Well, it turns out the other side 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.510
 Well, it turns out we have such points 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:39.430
 You can take a white white 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:46.200
 I'll just take first 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:50.730
 a little bit it will dry up at this time 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.730
 let's do one more 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.000
 poke another 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:16.709
 These are the points we get too 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.709
 no need to press 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:32.819
 here the main thing that was a sponge 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 large 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:52.859
 now this hang let dry out 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:04:01.060
 so this beauty and close a drop 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:04:03.750
 white so it should be wiped here already 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.970
 almost dried up 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:12.120
 that's lips up 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.120
 tear off another piece already of course 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.070
 you cancer like him white 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:55.580
 take can be golden can be white white 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:05:03.080
 at the moment I'm doing just to be 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:08.179
 a little better seen then if you do 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:19.879
 trout q in this way very much 

00:05:08.179 --> 00:05:28.179
 qualitatively but this is not obtained 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:31.179
 I know there can be seen or not here so we do 

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:31.179
 other 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:58.890
 another try golden so where 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:06:05.220
 the Nazis here it is drip a drop 

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.220
 golden live it and that piece and 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:18.669
 need to be desirable when to think so tick 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:21.580
 Dot it to cook a few 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.790
 wobblers to be less consumption 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:32.050
 paint is the greatest paint consumption so far 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:45.330
 it soaks the sponge then less 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:45.330
 of you get so doing took from you 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:56.819
 but it will be worse seen through the camera 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:09.389
 as they say she is there 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.190
 year 

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:24.220
 but in winter 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.220
 that's health 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:35.550
 Well, these have turned out we dots 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.789
 well sponge 

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:56.830
 Thank you all for your attention
