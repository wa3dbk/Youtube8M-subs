00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
no this is a crazy crazy to our action

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.370 
no this is a crazy crazy to our action
here<00:06:06.650> now<00:06:07.090> we're<00:06:08.090> already<00:06:08.330> ascending<00:06:08.870> to<00:06:09.020> the

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.250 

seventh<00:06:12.380> level<00:06:12.650> is<00:06:12.920> it<00:06:13.100> one<00:06:13.430> two<00:06:13.880> three<00:06:14.510> four

five six leading up seventh level i'm a
retard

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:27.850 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.820 

technical<00:06:28.850> engineering<00:06:29.270> up<00:06:30.230> losing<00:06:30.710> one

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
technical engineering up losing one

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.320 
technical engineering up losing one
right<00:06:31.010> there<00:06:32.110> we're<00:06:33.110> currently<00:06:33.500> on<00:06:33.910> 16<00:06:34.910> levels

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
right there we're currently on 16 levels

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.490 
right there we're currently on 16 levels
and<00:06:35.750> still<00:06:35.990> going<00:06:36.200> look<00:06:37.100> at<00:06:37.220> all<00:06:37.310> that<00:06:38.500> they're

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:39.500 
and still going look at all that they're

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:47.490 
and still going look at all that they're
all<00:06:39.650> pizza<00:06:40.040> crust<00:06:40.340> 16<00:06:41.560> Justin<00:06:42.560> holder<00:06:43.900> 16<00:06:44.900> I

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.830 

think<00:06:48.500> we<00:06:48.560> can<00:06:48.680> make<00:06:48.830> you<00:06:48.950> go<00:06:49.070> higher

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.350 

I<00:06:51.960> could<00:06:52.350> shift<00:06:52.650> the<00:06:52.770> structural<00:06:53.250> integrity

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
I could shift the structural integrity

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.700 
I could shift the structural integrity
there<00:06:54.360> we<00:06:54.480> go<00:06:56.120> build<00:06:57.120> a<00:06:57.240> tire<00:06:57.480> all<00:06:58.199> I<00:06:58.350> have<00:06:58.620> to

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:58.710 
there we go build a tire all I have to

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:10.399 
there we go build a tire all I have to
ship<00:06:58.889> the<00:06:58.980> structural<00:06:59.400> integrity

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409 

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:17.730 

perhaps<00:07:11.069> your<00:07:11.219> gets<00:07:11.369> tricky<00:07:11.879> running<00:07:12.300> will

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.260 

that<00:07:18.340> looks<00:07:18.520> awesome<00:07:18.639> getting<00:07:19.060> from<00:07:19.180> the

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
that looks awesome getting from the

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.790 
that looks awesome getting from the
bottom

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800

those<00:07:21.250> huge<00:07:23.250> 01<00:07:24.250> pieces<00:07:24.669> when<00:07:25.300> piece<00:07:25.479> just

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
those huge 01 pieces when piece just

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:27.119 
those huge 01 pieces when piece just
started<00:07:25.990> throwing<00:07:26.199> down<00:07:26.530> to<00:07:26.680> admit<00:07:26.919> oh<00:07:26.949> we're

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:27.129 
started throwing down to admit oh we're

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:31.370 
started throwing down to admit oh we're
switching<00:07:27.250> the<00:07:27.460> Jews

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.410 

see<00:07:32.010> we<00:07:32.130> got<00:07:32.250> some<00:07:32.400> support<00:07:32.760> beam<00:07:33.030> action

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420 
see we got some support beam action

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.290 
see we got some support beam action
going<00:07:33.630> in<00:07:33.750> down<00:07:33.900> there<00:07:34.140> can't<00:07:34.680> quite<00:07:34.860> six<00:07:35.300> yeah

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 
going in down there can't quite six yeah

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.080 
going in down there can't quite six yeah
I'm<00:07:36.390> having<00:07:36.660> to<00:07:36.720> hold<00:07:36.840> it<00:07:37.050> up<00:07:37.200> so<00:07:37.820> high<00:07:38.820> tech

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090 
I'm having to hold it up so high tech

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.110 
I'm having to hold it up so high tech
pizza<00:07:39.480> engineering<00:07:40.080> going<00:07:40.230> on<00:07:40.470> here

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120
