00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
about civil engineering what I what I

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.900 
about civil engineering what I what I
told<00:04:33.150> them<00:04:33.419> was<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:34.200> all<00:04:34.790> branches<00:04:35.790> of

way in which they behave chemical
engineers<00:05:11.340> model<00:05:12.180> chemical<00:05:12.780> reactions<00:05:13.229> and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
engineers model chemical reactions and

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.310 
engineers model chemical reactions and
show<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:15.030> influence<00:05:15.450> of<00:05:15.570> things<00:05:15.810> like<00:05:15.990> heat

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
show the influence of things like heat

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.100 
show the influence of things like heat
and<00:05:16.350> and<00:05:16.860> and<00:05:17.460> time<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.150> temperature<00:05:18.690> on<00:05:18.900> them

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
and and and time and temperature on them

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.740 
and and and time and temperature on them
so<00:05:19.710> really<00:05:20.340> we're<00:05:20.490> all<00:05:20.750> mathematical

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
so really we're all mathematical

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.000 
so really we're all mathematical
modelers<00:05:22.110> we<00:05:22.320> use<00:05:22.620> mathematics<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.610> represent

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
modelers we use mathematics to represent

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.350 
modelers we use mathematics to represent
that<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.160> products<00:05:26.550> of<00:05:26.639> engineering<00:05:27.210> and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
that the products of engineering and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
that the products of engineering and
predict<00:05:28.200> how<00:05:28.849> they're<00:05:29.849> going<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:30.360> behave<00:05:30.539> so

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
predict how they're going to behave so

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.520 
predict how they're going to behave so
as<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.650> save<00:05:31.830> money<00:05:32.070> in<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:33.900> manufacture<00:05:34.500> of

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
as to save money in the manufacture of

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.969 
as to save money in the manufacture of
them

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
them

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.270 
them
yeah<00:05:35.160> well<00:05:35.430> that's<00:05:35.610> an<00:05:35.910> option

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
yeah well that's an option

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.520 
yeah well that's an option
to<00:05:36.430> me<00:05:36.550> so<00:05:37.000> I<00:05:37.240> just<00:05:37.480> came<00:05:37.630> today<00:05:37.810> to<00:05:37.930> look<00:05:38.260> at<00:05:38.410> it

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
to me so I just came today to look at it

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.260 
to me so I just came today to look at it
the<00:05:38.950> first<00:05:38.980> time<00:05:39.340> I've<00:05:39.490> been<00:05:39.639> on<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:39.880> campus

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
the first time I've been on the campus

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.060 
the first time I've been on the campus
so<00:05:40.710> yeah<00:05:42.840> made<00:05:43.840> a<00:05:43.870> good<00:05:44.139> first<00:05:44.320> impression<00:05:44.560> I

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
so yeah made a good first impression I

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.990 
so yeah made a good first impression I
guess<00:05:46.169> my<00:05:47.169> basic<00:05:47.470> degree<00:05:47.830> was<00:05:48.100> ijen<00:05:48.669> I<00:05:48.850> am

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
guess my basic degree was ijen I am

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.030 
guess my basic degree was ijen I am
satisfied<00:05:49.330> with<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:50.020> answers<00:05:50.380> I<00:05:50.470> got<00:05:50.740> from

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
satisfied with the answers I got from

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.600 
satisfied with the answers I got from
over<00:05:51.970> here<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.830> after<00:05:53.830> that<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.220> think<00:05:54.490> I'm

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
over here and after that I think I'm

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:15.550 
over here and after that I think I'm
going<00:05:54.730> to<00:05:54.820> apply<00:05:55.000> two<00:05:55.120> bits

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.620
