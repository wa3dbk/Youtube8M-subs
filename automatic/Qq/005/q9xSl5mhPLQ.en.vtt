00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.060 
it or got frustrated with it because it

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.660 
it or got frustrated with it because it
takes<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:40.360> while<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.630> lock<00:00:41.050> in<00:00:41.290> that<00:00:41.470> code<00:00:41.830> now

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
takes a while to lock in that code now

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.880 
takes a while to lock in that code now
on<00:00:42.940> our<00:00:43.060> home<00:00:43.270> link<00:00:43.480> system<00:00:44.050> like<00:00:44.470> all<00:00:44.710> home

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
on our home link system like all home

on our home link system like all home
link<00:00:45.100> systems<00:00:45.550> actually<00:00:45.790> you<00:00:46.330> can<00:00:46.540> program<00:00:46.720> up

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
link systems actually you can program up

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.230 
link systems actually you can program up
to<00:00:47.200> three<00:00:47.470> garage<00:00:47.860> doors<00:00:48.280> or<00:00:48.580> possibly<00:00:48.970> two

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
to three garage doors or possibly two

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.820 
to three garage doors or possibly two
doors<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:49.930> gate<00:00:50.140> you<00:00:50.320> might<00:00:50.500> live<00:00:50.680> in<00:00:50.710> a

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
doors and a gate you might live in a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.260 
doors and a gate you might live in a
gated<00:00:51.040> community<00:00:51.220> and<00:00:51.730> you<00:00:51.910> could<00:00:52.090> actually

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
gated community and you could actually

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.890 
gated community and you could actually
take<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.900> same<00:00:53.710> mud<00:00:54.070> device<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.300> program<00:00:55.780> it

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
take that same mud device and program it

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.300 
take that same mud device and program it
to<00:00:56.050> your<00:00:56.230> home<00:00:56.380> link<00:00:56.560> system<00:00:56.770> because<00:00:57.220> it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.310 
to your home link system because it

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.120 
to your home link system because it
works<00:00:57.460> on<00:00:57.580> the<00:00:57.700> same<00:00:57.910> frequency<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.980> what

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
works on the same frequency so what

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.230 
works on the same frequency so what
we're<00:01:00.220> going<00:01:00.310> to<00:01:00.370> do<00:01:00.550> is<00:01:00.850> we're<00:01:01.090> going<00:01:01.180> to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.439 
we're going to do is we're going to
prepare<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.720> car<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.950> accept<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:03.610> new<00:01:03.730> code<00:01:04.000> and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
prepare the car to accept a new code and

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.719 
prepare the car to accept a new code and
it<00:01:04.780> takes<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.110> little<00:01:05.229> while<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:05.830> this<00:01:06.490> process

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
it takes a little while and this process

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.419 
it takes a little while and this process
is<00:01:06.969> very<00:01:07.270> similar<00:01:07.689> to<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.799> process<00:01:09.009> of

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
is very similar to the process of

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:11.489 
is very similar to the process of
syncing<00:01:10.060> your<00:01:10.359> intelligent<00:01:10.960> key<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.320> your

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
syncing your intelligent key to your

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:14.639 
syncing your intelligent key to your
memory<00:01:11.890> seating<00:01:12.609> and<00:01:13.320> positions<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.439> you

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
memory seating and positions that you

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.609 
memory seating and positions that you
did<00:01:15.189> on<00:01:15.399> the<00:01:15.609> on<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.999> other<00:01:16.119> video<00:01:16.479> so<00:01:17.409> what

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
did on the on the other video so what

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.359 
did on the on the other video so what
we're<00:01:17.770> going<00:01:17.859> to<00:01:17.920> do<00:01:18.039> is<00:01:18.130> we're<00:01:18.219> going<00:01:18.249> to

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.910 
we're going to do is we're going to
reach<00:01:18.520> up<00:01:18.670> here<00:01:19.079> we're<00:01:20.079> going<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.560> push<00:01:20.770> the

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
reach up here we're going to push the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.849 
reach up here we're going to push the
two<00:01:21.069> outside<00:01:21.520> buttons<00:01:21.999> and<00:01:22.329> the<00:01:23.289> light<00:01:23.499> turns

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
two outside buttons and the light turns

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.940 
two outside buttons and the light turns
red<00:01:24.240> we're<00:01:25.240> going<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.450> just<00:01:26.079> continue<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:26.649> hold

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
red we're going to just continue to hold

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.569 
red we're going to just continue to hold
this<00:01:27.249> and<00:01:27.490> wait<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:28.030> this<00:01:28.149> light<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.840> blink

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
this and wait for this light to blink

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.109 
this and wait for this light to blink
and<00:01:30.689> once<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.840> starts<00:01:32.200> blinking<00:01:32.609> like<00:01:33.609> this<00:01:33.850> or

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
and once it starts blinking like this or

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.969 
and once it starts blinking like this or
it<00:01:34.210> goes<00:01:34.389> we're<00:01:35.170> going<00:01:35.289> to<00:01:35.350> hold<00:01:35.530> it<00:01:35.679> until<00:01:35.799> the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
it goes we're going to hold it until the

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:43.760 
it goes we're going to hold it until the
light<00:01:36.159> goes<00:01:36.189> completely<00:01:36.639> out

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.429 

and<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.689> next<00:01:45.990> step<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> we're

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and there it is the next step that we're

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.840 
and there it is the next step that we're
going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> do<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> we're<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> pick<00:01:47.700> up

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
going to do is we're going to pick up

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.210 
going to do is we're going to pick up
our<00:01:48.030> garage<00:01:48.360> door<00:01:48.390> opener<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.619> recommend

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
our garage door opener they recommend

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.450 
our garage door opener they recommend
holding<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.000> fairly<00:01:51.479> close<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.950> mirror

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
holding it up fairly close to the mirror

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.090 
holding it up fairly close to the mirror
and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:54.229> selecting<00:01:55.229> any<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> these<00:01:55.710> buttons

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
and then selecting any of these buttons

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.310 
and then selecting any of these buttons
typically<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.149> first<00:01:57.420> door<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.110> pick

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
typically your first door you would pick

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.249 
typically your first door you would pick
this<00:01:58.560> one<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.189> push<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.420> then<00:02:00.720> take<00:02:01.080> your

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
this one and push it in then take your

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.169 
this one and push it in then take your
garage<00:02:01.439> door<00:02:01.979> button<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> one<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.970> want

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
garage door button the one that you want

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.219 
garage door button the one that you want
to<00:02:03.299> assign<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.560> particular<00:02:05.990> but<00:02:06.990> now

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
to assign to this particular but now

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.540 
to assign to this particular but now
we're<00:02:07.409> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.740> go<00:02:07.979> through<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> same

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
we're going to go through the same

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.400 
we're going to go through the same
process<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.690> went<00:02:09.840> through<00:02:09.959> when<00:02:10.380> we

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
process that we went through when we

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.610 
process that we went through when we
were<00:02:11.239> telling<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.480> home<00:02:12.630> link<00:02:12.810> system<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.470> get

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
were telling the home link system to get

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.270 
were telling the home link system to get
ready<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:14.040> accept<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.640> new<00:02:14.790> code<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.069> first

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
ready to accept a new code so the first

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.309 
ready to accept a new code so the first
thing<00:02:17.549> that<00:02:17.700> has<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:18.030> happen<00:02:18.209> is<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.019> home

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
thing that has to happen is the home

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.650 
thing that has to happen is the home
link<00:02:19.500> system<00:02:19.709> has<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.400> identify<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.239> device

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
link system has to identify the device

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.539 
link system has to identify the device
which<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.019> has<00:02:22.170> done<00:02:22.200> by<00:02:22.739> blinking<00:02:23.220> now<00:02:23.370> when

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
which it has done by blinking now when

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.210 
which it has done by blinking now when
it<00:02:23.640> goes<00:02:24.209> fast<00:02:24.630> like<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.650> means<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.069> it

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
it goes fast like that it means that it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.940 
it goes fast like that it means that it
actually<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.819> finding<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> code<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.830> it

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
actually is finding the code but it

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.650 
actually is finding the code but it
would<00:02:29.160> not<00:02:29.489> have<00:02:29.549> locked<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.360> code

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
would not have locked in on the code

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.800 
would not have locked in on the code
until<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.049> light<00:02:31.230> goes<00:02:31.260> completely<00:02:31.980> out<00:02:32.220> and

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
until the light goes completely out and

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.000 
until the light goes completely out and
there<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.900> go<00:02:34.049> now<00:02:34.230> when<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.470> happens<00:02:34.890> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
there you go now when that happens you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.430 
there you go now when that happens you
just<00:02:35.220> let<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.670> both<00:02:35.850> of<00:02:36.090> them<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.440> then

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
just let go of both of them and then

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.610 
just let go of both of them and then
without<00:02:38.069> touching<00:02:38.340> your<00:02:38.700> garage<00:02:38.970> door<00:02:39.330> opener

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
without touching your garage door opener

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.820 
without touching your garage door opener
push<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:41.310> button<00:02:41.580> right<00:02:41.760> here<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.330> then

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
push this button right here and then

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.199 
push this button right here and then
make<00:02:43.830> sure<00:02:43.860> your<00:02:44.099> garage<00:02:44.250> door<00:02:44.700> goes<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:45.000> and

make sure your garage door goes up and
down<00:02:45.680> now<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.239> event<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:50.370> does<00:02:50.640> not

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
down now in the event that it does not

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.970 
down now in the event that it does not
go<00:02:51.000> up<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.359> down<00:02:51.510> there<00:02:51.900> may<00:02:52.260> be<00:02:52.320> in<00:02:52.799> that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
go up and down there may be in that

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.740 
go up and down there may be in that
small<00:02:53.340> percentage<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:54.030> customers<00:02:54.269> that<00:02:54.540> I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
small percentage of customers that I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.650 
small percentage of customers that I
have<00:02:55.130> their<00:02:56.130> garage<00:02:56.459> door<00:02:56.970> itself<00:02:57.450> may<00:02:57.630> have

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
have their garage door itself may have

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.509 
have their garage door itself may have
some<00:02:58.079> kind<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.380> a<00:02:58.440> device<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.769> they<00:02:59.070> need<00:02:59.280> to

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
some kind of a device that they need to

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.720 
some kind of a device that they need to
adjust<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:01.470> ninety<00:03:01.739> percent<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.489> if

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
adjust but ninety percent of the time if

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.030 
adjust but ninety percent of the time if
I<00:03:02.850> just<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.510> here<00:03:04.079> at<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.290> dealership<00:03:04.709> by

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040
