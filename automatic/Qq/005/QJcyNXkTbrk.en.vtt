and I have to say this thing is awesome
this<00:02:36.210> is<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.450> best<00:02:36.660> display<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.470> I've<00:02:37.560> seen

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
this is the best display that I've seen

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.530 
this is the best display that I've seen
any<00:02:37.950> type<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.160> traveling<00:02:38.610> case<00:02:38.790> as<00:02:39.360> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
any type of traveling case as I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270 
any type of traveling case as I
mentioned<00:02:39.870> before<00:02:39.990> all<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.800> colors<00:02:41.100> look

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
mentioned before all the colors look

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.250 
mentioned before all the colors look
bright<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.450> reason<00:02:42.690> why<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.840> screen<00:02:43.140> is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
bright and the reason why the screen is

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.780 
bright and the reason why the screen is
really<00:02:43.470> good<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.740> because<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> nice<00:02:44.490> form

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
really good is because it is a nice form

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.580 
really good is because it is a nice form
factor<00:02:45.120> so<00:02:45.150> it's<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:45.390> 1080p<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.200> since<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
factor so it's not 1080p but since the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.660 
factor so it's not 1080p but since the
screen<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.100> small<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.430> don't<00:02:47.520> really

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
screen is just small you don't really

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.060 
screen is just small you don't really
need<00:02:47.850> 1080p<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.140> you're<00:02:49.380> able<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.590> sit<00:02:49.800> back<00:02:50.010> a

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
need 1080p and you're able to sit back a

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.440 
need 1080p and you're able to sit back a
little<00:02:50.250> bit<00:02:50.550> since<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.030> really<00:02:51.300> good

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
little bit since it is really good

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.760 
little bit since it is really good
quality<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.750> don't<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.050> be<00:02:52.140> right<00:02:52.410> up<00:02:52.560> on

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
quality you don't have to be right up on

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.080 
quality you don't have to be right up on
the<00:02:52.950> screen<00:02:53.130> itself<00:02:53.520> while<00:02:53.730> you'll<00:02:53.940> be

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.650 
and the screen does a really really good
job<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.400> also<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.880> speakers<00:03:33.270> are<00:03:33.390> pretty

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
job and also to the speakers are pretty

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.630

loud<00:03:33.900> as<00:03:34.080> well<00:03:34.260> I<00:03:34.530> think<00:03:34.890> by<00:03:35.130> default<00:03:35.550> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
loud as well I think by default the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.699 
loud as well I think by default the
speakers<00:03:35.910> are<00:03:36.000> about<00:03:36.209> 50%<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:37.110> when<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.470> first

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
speakers are about 50% and when I first

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.260 
speakers are about 50% and when I first
launched<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.070> up<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.250> had<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.430> turn<00:03:38.580> it<00:03:38.790> down<00:03:38.820> so

to carry around so I was looking for
some<00:04:26.850> cons<00:04:27.120> about<00:04:27.419> this<00:04:27.570> product<00:04:27.960> some<00:04:28.199> bad

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
some cons about this product some bad

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.499

things about it but I really couldn't be
honest<00:04:30.840> I<00:04:30.870> really<00:04:30.960> couldn't<00:04:31.290> find<00:04:31.470> anything

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
honest I really couldn't find anything

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.990 
honest I really couldn't find anything
that<00:04:31.830> was<00:04:31.979> bad<00:04:32.160> this<00:04:32.400> product<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.729> think<00:04:32.759> this

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
that was bad this product I think this

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.879 
that was bad this product I think this
is<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> perfect<00:04:33.479> solution<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.710> able<00:04:34.770> to

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
is the perfect solution to be able to

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.350 
is the perfect solution to be able to
travel<00:04:35.280> on<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.490> road<00:04:35.639> and<00:04:35.880> get<00:04:36.000> your<00:04:36.150> game<00:04:36.330> on

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
travel on the road and get your game on

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.180 
travel on the road and get your game on
so<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.020> can<00:04:37.139> pick<00:04:37.289> up<00:04:37.440> one<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.620> these<00:04:37.770> cases

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
so you can pick up one of these cases

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.029 
so you can pick up one of these cases
for<00:04:38.370> about<00:04:38.580> $2.99<00:04:39.169> $300<00:04:40.169> so<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.560> kind<00:04:40.800> of<00:04:40.860> up

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
for about $2.99 $300 so it is kind of up

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:43.580 
for about $2.99 $300 so it is kind of up
there<00:04:41.250> but<00:04:42.030> for<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.300> display<00:04:42.690> itself<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.380> mean

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
there but for the display itself I mean

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.499 
there but for the display itself I mean
I<00:04:43.830> can<00:04:44.100> kind<00:04:44.280> of<00:04:44.310> see<00:04:44.460> why<00:04:44.669> this<00:04:44.910> is<00:04:45.090> priced<00:04:45.389> a

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
I can kind of see why this is priced a

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.060 
I can kind of see why this is priced a
little<00:04:45.539> bit<00:04:45.720> higher<00:04:45.960> maybe<00:04:46.259> some<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.680> little

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
little bit higher maybe some a little

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.990 
little bit higher maybe some a little
bit<00:04:47.160> higher<00:04:47.280> than<00:04:47.430> some<00:04:47.669> of<00:04:47.759> the<00:04:47.820> other

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
bit higher than some of the other

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.270 
bit higher than some of the other
solutions<00:04:48.449> out<00:04:48.570> there<00:04:48.600> but<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.470> is<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:50.070> best

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
solutions out there but this is the best

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.710 
solutions out there but this is the best
