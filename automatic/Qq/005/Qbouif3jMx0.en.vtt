00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Hello UTB psycho artur and today 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.069
 We will be vidosik on UAZ 111 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.950
 in fact this video was supposed to 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.630
 to leave for a long time planned to release it 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.880
 at that moment when 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.379
 played this fight in which I actually 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.180
 took the master on the UAZ in a hundred 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.320
 eleventh 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 but it so happened that did not work out 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.180
 I kind of sip a vidos at the time 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.570
 here than i was terribly busy there see 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.369
 trips in Minsk all there and then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.610
 something else and somehow this vidos 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.780
 postponed sediment to you well and by the end and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 still decided to post 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 here's a little bit to tell you the right zico 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.920
 this 111 then all the same 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.480
 and did not actually make his conclusion on 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.850
 all this marathon which is already 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.039
 held unequivocally long ago but still 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.770
 In a random, I meet a lot of these 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.210
 UAZ here and I see that people are really on 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.590
 they roll and make mash at random 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.610
 and the mash is done for a reason we say so 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.030
 tanchika actually well i'm real at 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.240
 shocked how good he is 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.570
 purely ttx that were provided 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.210
 which I considered which I thought 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 this is complete crap that's real by 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.479
 compared to how it is tanchiki on 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.540
 It is played and it is played as 112 which 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.049
 just put the plantain that is all 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.759
 what was bad in 112 everyone improved here 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.820
 but the only thing of course is that 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.340
 corners slightly worsened pickup that's 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.220
 the only compromise is everything else 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.880
 only really better this vase q 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.009
 it would in principle give the level of battles 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.740
 that he played against a dozen even with 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.549
 given his bad suck through the be baomi 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.439
 but its characteristics are real with interest 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.670
 compensate for this 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.729
 the disadvantage is that he has bad angles 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.469
 crosstalk and there breaking through 175 grams of minutes like 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.020
 would anyone be really shooting at him 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.360
 lips minutes to the people who are there who 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.540
 no prim tanks which 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.400
 here they need to farm, but I can 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.130
 This tank was mined in order to 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.550
 him fill the statka and be fan of fan 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.890
 in the cut-off level of fighting that's well Say 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.750
 even filed a dozen of this 250 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.880
 orbit accumulating stone and would be enough but 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.710
 if 75 sledgehammer punching with such 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.850
 distances that is seven would be shed and 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.730
 weave would break 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.070
 Here for example in my hangar consists 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 vazik studios 14 9 levels 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.760
 fine he copes with tanking 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
 Today, for example, I rode on it 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.500
 well I just borrowed yes not 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.600
 breaks as if it is ricochets 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.489
 really surprised by this body and 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.400
 most caterpillars are surprised because 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.220
 that you look at them like that here 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.020
 here is the distance between the rinks should be 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.540
 Well, how is more fig yes by 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.970
 compared with features but in fact it 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.770
 those rollers those distances this model 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.930
 the powder we see as if they did not 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.470
 tied to real non hitbox with 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.060
 real model on which they shoot and 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.640
 sort of looking but nothing special 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.440
 but in reality, there are some poly 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.480
 a couple of millimeters there a couple of millimeters 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.299
 here how are these hitboxes and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.670
 so this tanchik in the board is just 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.010
 ohrenet how often does not break it in 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.299
 caterpillars I had a whole bunch 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.030
 situation but 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.850
 which I notice exactly on the ninth 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.840
 level nine vase movie here this though 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.630
 did not skate on it 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.310
 in fact, only seven fights but these blue 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.750
 fights enough for me to understand that this 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.420
 the car just tear it all here it was 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.180
 so real and just shit 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.459
 pipets and really armor of this tank me 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.720
 saved just ohrenet like him 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.549
 the number of situations here have been so important 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.489
 his advantage is exactly the form 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.620
 caterpillars and caterpillar shapes and even with 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.470
 the fact that he would have less 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.040
 armored what 112 ricochet on more often 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.540
 you know why because stria 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.920
 But in the second, there's this and Zaman 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.020
 in which not only did he not strike golda 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.300
 of 3 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.250
 which essentially acts like a troika 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.109
 that is, here it is, if I 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.690
 I'll draw a line here on such 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:26.070
 lines about no longer there, as it were VFD 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.050
 There are these screens there and when 112 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.080
 they just don't go there because they see 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:33.030
 solid sheet with a good slope here 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.730
 nose put us there once fell here 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.530
 20 vld understand that she does not break through and 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.360
 there just are not trying to shoot there 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.240
 turrets vyselivat or n l n l d 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.160
 here on ice float that is 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.050
 They see everything that's here now is supple 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.590
 body shape and thought that with a break him 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.710
 wold 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.560
 and do not pierce do not really pierce 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.310
 plant growth terraces and this crap 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.940
 Well that's really ricochets do anything 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.430
 you can't do 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.050
 the same thing happens at the ninth level 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.120
 look at you like so think 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.669
 there is no armor and they throw me as if offhand 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.650
 I notice for myself that I seem to be used to 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.650
 the fact that a long time ago 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.410
 This vazik start give him vld 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.510
 bounce and think dohrena threw in vld well 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.850
 why the heck could you aim that is 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.570
 Here is the fact that the armor seems to be 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:24.390
 so supple really makes her well 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.760
 as if allowing her to tank 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.690
 Paradoxically it sounded but I think 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.390
 what's really vazik 190 this is real 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.560
 machine that can keep the rest 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.410
 good and 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.440
 fucking awesome and I decided in honor of 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.750
 that he is such an entire aunt on him at once 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:47.130
 ride because well two identical 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.050
 prem tank it is of course fun here but not 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:54.060
 so it would be so cool 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.880
 I decided that on 112 I will roll back a thousand fights 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.600
 Now I have there 500 something poison ride on 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.940
 him a thousand 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.780
 and stop rolling on the twelfth 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.340
 and then begin to roll on here it's 111 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.440
 last couple shot i'm creepy here 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.090
 I sfeylil by three T34 as well, just 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.039
 already chased before i can faster 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.830
 lyustrirovat master wait but on the very 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.050
 business of these four 1900 quite 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.500
 enough especially for the first days when of these 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.900
 arose a lot was not 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.230
 here is not too much experience should have been 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.180
 principle of us thriller he was nines 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:29.260
 quickly and simply and even with the proviso 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.420
 what I gotta go was though okay there was 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.130
 with a 10 thousand discount on anyway i'm on 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.470
 farm that is even in minus this car 

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.840
 doesn't go with such wasteful in 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.300
 using gold but what about people 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.450
 bb format 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:46.030
 owners earn money too 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.550
 Uazikov 111 write in the comments 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.260
 and tell us about Susana 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.130
 how do you this car is it really 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:56.740
 met your expectations that's true 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.870
 what they told you today 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.250
 it did not look unfounded to people 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.320
 could read comments may 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.720
 really wakodo another experience he 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.390
 because I was faced with such an opinion 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.580
 that was no bad he does not hate 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.260
 I like it here but for some reason I have 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.940
 the impression is possible 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.430
 of course due to the fact that a good crew 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.580
 Feast forged and I would use the fire 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:20.640
 but in the end it is precisely these impressions 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.320
 I stayed from driving this tanchika 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.419
