00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.290
 clear steam is synonymous with modern 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.059
 pc gaming but with the big picture mode 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.160
 wolf already in the first step in 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.259
 direction video game console done 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.240
 the practical mode represents the steam 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.740
 user interface so that you can 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.619
 Convenient with a controller from 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.760
 TV can be used sitting 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.630
 wolf is in direct competition with this 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.310
 with sony microsoft nintendo and co now 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.349
 even the half life inventors introduce 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 own operating system a suitable 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.440
 controller and especially your own hardware 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.300
 out the so-called steam mission 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.770
 as a mini computer use linux and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.140
 thus offer a very developer 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.360
 friendly environment the operating system 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 is the name steam os and from 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.950
 farmyard itself develops it transforms 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.320
 a pc, so to speak, in a game console for 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.690
 Steam title with the in home 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.090
 streaming function can even timo it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.949
 play from a windows pc or a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.420
 mac via wlan and on one 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.820
 television 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.109
 who would like to have it even easier 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.579
 but buys one of the directly 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.070
 Machine on the the operating system 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.970
 already pre-installed and ready to play 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.750
 it will be timo it also leads the family 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.580
 sharing 1 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.770
 the inhabitants of a household can do so 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.390
 Your steam games in a common 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.580
 sharing library with each other 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.549
 In addition, extended for parents 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.990
 Jugendschutz options are available 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.520
 due to timo it also throws 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.680
 a special controller for pc 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.479
 player on the market he has none 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.820
 normal analog sticks but two 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.079
 Touchpads with the inputs much more precise 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.210
 should go 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.369
 that's loud for the job especially for that 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.320
 aim in shooters or while playing 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.979
 complex strategy title of great 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.409
 advantage 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.479
 the touchpads of the controller are 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.979
 individually configurable by them 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.619
 adapted to every imaginable game 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.140
 can be thus loud world ago 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.189
 perfect strategy player with all strategy titles 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.470
 an analog stick is it 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.210
 According to experience, a horrible about cards too 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.579
 Scroll and individual units 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.040
 to select with the touchpads that 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.240
 however, they work smoothly 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.250
 Shooters also benefit from the 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.680
 touch sensitive petz there no 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.970
 console in auto aiming is needed around 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.970
 be able to accurately capture the goal 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.120
 in the middle of the controller bank also 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.010
 a mini touch screen 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.600
 This little screen can be from the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.580
 developers for display and administration 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.640
 of important game elements such as 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.260
 to be used in an inventory 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.450
 with the legacy mode you can also do all 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.160
 those games do not control them 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.020
 the new controller are tuned 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.240
 The mode plays with the game in question 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.160
 front one would use mouse and keyboard 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.850
 although in truth it's just wolfs 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.500
 controller in hand is holding something 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.360
 but now distinguishes such a steam 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.730
 mission of the hardware competition the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.560
 unia is also an open on linux 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.810
 based console and therefore good for 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.920
 Big and small developers studios them 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.500
 but has an immature 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.570
 technology and a moderately processed 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.070
 controller is cheaper but in 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.580
 any case and the software is not 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.100
 expensive 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.870
 sometimes even the envia for free 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.340
 Shield is a powerful hand 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.050
 keeps the image for on a 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.640
 stream television and thus to a 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.770
 Full console can be 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.489
 for his primary function as a hand holds 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.020
 he is very expensive 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.970
 the game stick is a mini console the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.400
 very portable is because they only one 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.110
 hdmi stick and a controller 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.610
 his performance is accordingly in the 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.140
 but comparatively small and the 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.690
 Selection of games consists mainly of 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.790
 casual titles 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.950
 the razer edge is the ultimate hybrid 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.959
 between gaming laptop console and 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.070
 handhelds with the right accessories can 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.030
 get the tablet to your needs 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.670
 to adjust 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.050
 actually, however, is a kind mini pc 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.100
 which of course plays on steam 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.860
 get supported 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.450
 but to a high 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.069
 acquisition price 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.110
 the steam machines will be available from 2014 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.280
 however, in different versions with 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.959
 different so far 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.440
 unknown hardware compilations 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.480
 give 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.030
 Thus, the prices will fluctuate 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.830
 the operating system timo it becomes them 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.200
 this brought free of charge 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.739
 when exactly that is allowed but still allowed 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.739
 announce
