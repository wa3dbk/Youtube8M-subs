00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
that no one else does and the way you

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.190 
that no one else does and the way you
can<00:00:30.910> do<00:00:31.029> that<00:00:31.060> is<00:00:31.300> just<00:00:31.390> be<00:00:31.570> creative<00:00:32.020> and

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
can do that is just be creative and

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.870 
can do that is just be creative and
you're<00:00:32.680> only<00:00:32.800> limited<00:00:33.100> by<00:00:33.309> your<00:00:33.640> creativity

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
you can get even more creative so one of

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.299 
you can get even more creative so one of
the<00:00:42.969> classes<00:00:43.329> that<00:00:43.360> I<00:00:43.510> offer<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.260> called<00:00:44.530> dogs

on location and what it is we take a

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.209 
on location and what it is we take a
group<00:00:48.159> of<00:00:48.339> dogs<00:00:48.519> usually<00:00:49.510> somewhere<00:00:49.899> between

six to eight is when I try to keep at
and<00:00:53.289> we<00:00:53.379> work<00:00:53.559> in<00:00:53.679> a<00:00:53.710> semi<00:00:53.980> controlled<00:00:54.429> setting

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
and we work in a semi controlled setting

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.910 
and we work in a semi controlled setting
of<00:00:54.999> a<00:00:55.089> park<00:00:55.329> now<00:00:55.989> I<00:00:56.019> say<00:00:56.289> semi<00:00:56.620> controlled

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
of a park now I say semi controlled

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.649 
of a park now I say semi controlled
because<00:00:57.249> I<00:00:57.399> can<00:00:57.670> control<00:00:57.969> my<00:00:58.120> students<00:00:58.510> around

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
because I can control my students around

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:01.229 
because I can control my students around
but<00:00:58.989> I'm<00:00:59.230> kind<00:00:59.559> of<00:00:59.789> limited<00:01:00.789> because<00:01:00.969> I<00:01:01.089> don't

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
but I'm kind of limited because I don't

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.309 
but I'm kind of limited because I don't
know<00:01:01.300> what's<00:01:01.420> gonna<00:01:01.539> happen<00:01:01.719> in<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:01.989> park<00:01:02.229> I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
know what's gonna happen in the park I

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:03.660 
know what's gonna happen in the park I
don't<00:01:02.440> know<00:01:02.499> who's<00:01:02.620> gonna<00:01:02.739> be<00:01:02.829> there<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:03.640> I

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
don't know who's gonna be there so I

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.340 
don't know who's gonna be there so I
kind<00:01:03.999> of<00:01:04.120> every<00:01:04.360> class<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.839> don't<00:01:04.900> really<00:01:05.110> have

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
kind of every class I don't really have

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.080 
kind of every class I don't really have
an<00:01:05.440> agenda<00:01:05.770> of<00:01:06.010> what<00:01:06.159> I<00:01:06.190> want<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.550> do<00:01:06.670> I<00:01:06.700> just

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
an agenda of what I want to do I just

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.960 
an agenda of what I want to do I just
maybe<00:01:07.390> have<00:01:07.659> an<00:01:07.780> outline<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.920> then<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.700> just<00:01:09.880> go

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
maybe have an outline and then I just go

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.340 
maybe have an outline and then I just go
to<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.120> park<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:10.420> see<00:01:10.570> what's<00:01:10.750> going<00:01:10.960> on<00:01:11.080> and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
to the park and see what's going on and

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.230 
to the park and see what's going on and
we<00:01:11.440> work<00:01:11.620> around<00:01:11.770> those<00:01:12.010> distractions<00:01:12.430> this

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
we work around those distractions this

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.580 
we work around those distractions this
is<00:01:13.420> really<00:01:13.720> cool<00:01:13.930> because<00:01:14.170> this<00:01:14.409> is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
is really cool because this is

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.219 
is really cool because this is
real-world<00:01:14.860> application<00:01:15.820> for<00:01:16.030> people<00:01:16.360> stuff

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
real-world application for people stuff

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.190 
real-world application for people stuff
you<00:01:17.350> do<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.620> an<00:01:17.740> indoor<00:01:18.370> class<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:19.090> great<00:01:19.480> but

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
you do in an indoor class is great but

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.900 
you do in an indoor class is great but
if<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.470> don't<00:01:20.500> practice<00:01:21.010> it<00:01:21.130> in<00:01:21.280> distractible

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
if you don't practice it in distractible

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.400 
if you don't practice it in distractible
environment<00:01:22.420> you're<00:01:22.780> probably<00:01:23.020> not<00:01:23.230> gonna

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
environment you're probably not gonna

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.470 
environment you're probably not gonna
see<00:01:23.620> a<00:01:23.650> lot<00:01:23.800> of<00:01:23.830> compliance<00:01:24.400> on<00:01:24.550> these<00:01:24.700> dogs<00:01:24.940> so

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
see a lot of compliance on these dogs so

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.390 
see a lot of compliance on these dogs so
it's<00:01:25.630> a<00:01:25.690> great<00:01:25.900> way<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.080> give<00:01:26.380> them<00:01:26.500> excuse<00:01:26.980> to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
it's a great way to give them excuse to

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.220 
it's a great way to give them excuse to
get<00:01:27.580> out<00:01:27.730> there<00:01:27.970> in<00:01:28.180> situations<00:01:28.870> that<00:01:28.960> they

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
get out there in situations that they

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.940 
get out there in situations that they
need<00:01:30.160> it<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.430> most<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.940> work<00:01:31.540> with<00:01:31.720> it

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
need it the most and work with it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.230 
need it the most and work with it
because<00:01:32.950> everyone<00:01:33.310> probably<00:01:33.700> gives<00:01:33.970> homework

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
because everyone probably gives homework

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.760 
because everyone probably gives homework
in<00:01:34.330> there<00:01:34.450> basically<00:01:34.630> these<00:01:34.990> classes<00:01:35.530> but

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
in there basically these classes but

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.530 
in there basically these classes but
whether<00:01:36.250> they<00:01:36.460> whether<00:01:36.850> they<00:01:37.000> do<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.210> in

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
whether they whether they do it in

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.500 
whether they whether they do it in
distractible<00:01:38.260> settings<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.890> another<00:01:39.130> story

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
distractible settings is another story

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.700 
distractible settings is another story
this<00:01:40.510> class<00:01:40.780> is<00:01:40.960> also<00:01:41.200> really<00:01:41.380> good<00:01:41.500> for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
this class is also really good for

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.990 
this class is also really good for
reactive<00:01:42.100> dogs<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.670> could<00:01:42.820> actually

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
reactive dogs and you could actually

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.210 
reactive dogs and you could actually
even<00:01:43.360> do<00:01:43.570> it<00:01:43.690> with<00:01:43.840> just<00:01:44.110> reactive<00:01:44.650> dogs<00:01:44.860> and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
even do it with just reactive dogs and

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.310 
even do it with just reactive dogs and
what<00:01:46.150> we<00:01:46.270> do<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.510> we<00:01:46.600> just<00:01:46.630> work<00:01:46.960> a<00:01:47.050> lot<00:01:47.200> of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
what we do is we just work a lot of

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.040 
what we do is we just work a lot of
spacing<00:01:47.770> stuff<00:01:48.180> how<00:01:49.180> dogs<00:01:49.420> would<00:01:49.660> cross<00:01:49.870> each

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
spacing stuff how dogs would cross each

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.530 
spacing stuff how dogs would cross each
other<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.380> path<00:01:50.680> trying<00:01:51.490> to<00:01:51.610> get<00:01:51.730> focus<00:01:52.120> from

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
other on a path trying to get focus from

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.420 
other on a path trying to get focus from
your<00:01:52.690> dog<00:01:52.870> in<00:01:53.230> a<00:01:53.380> distractible<00:01:53.920> environment

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
your dog in a distractible environment

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.130 
your dog in a distractible environment
and<00:01:54.760> I<00:01:55.150> basically<00:01:55.360> just<00:01:55.510> move<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.930> dogs

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
and I basically just move the dogs

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380 
and I basically just move the dogs
around<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.530> lot<00:01:56.680> amongst<00:01:57.070> each<00:01:57.250> other<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.760> we

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
around a lot amongst each other and we

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.840 
around a lot amongst each other and we
really<00:01:58.600> work<00:01:58.810> on<00:01:59.020> how<00:01:59.890> they<00:02:00.070> how<00:02:00.820> they

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
really work on how they how they

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.110 
really work on how they how they
interact<00:02:01.950> how<00:02:02.950> they<00:02:03.070> react<00:02:03.460> with<00:02:03.790> each<00:02:03.820> other

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
interact how they react with each other

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.900 
interact how they react with each other
when<00:02:04.900> they're<00:02:05.110> crossing<00:02:05.590> paths<00:02:06.040> or<00:02:06.400> have<00:02:06.790> to

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
when they're crossing paths or have to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.150 
when they're crossing paths or have to
meet<00:02:07.060> each<00:02:07.180> other<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.570> street<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:08.950> try

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
meet each other on the street so I try

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.380 
meet each other on the street so I try
to<00:02:09.220> come<00:02:09.399> up<00:02:09.429> with<00:02:09.550> some<00:02:09.729> real-world<00:02:10.030> settings

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
to come up with some real-world settings

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.199 
to come up with some real-world settings
like<00:02:10.599> park<00:02:10.840> benches<00:02:11.970> intersections<00:02:12.970> stuff

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
like park benches intersections stuff

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.240 
like park benches intersections stuff
like<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:14.560> then<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.709> see<00:02:14.860> what's<00:02:15.010> going<00:02:15.159> on

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
like that but then I see what's going on

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.070 
like that but then I see what's going on
in<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.400> park<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.819> we<00:02:15.879> work<00:02:16.030> around<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.540> so

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
in the park and we work around that so

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.210 
in the park and we work around that so
it's<00:02:17.230> really<00:02:17.290> good<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:17.800> usually<00:02:18.069> always

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
it's really good it's usually always

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.460 
it's really good it's usually always
filled<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.849> only<00:02:19.599> offer<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.900> couple<00:02:20.080> times<00:02:20.349> a

filled I only offer a couple times a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.690 
filled I only offer a couple times a
year<00:02:20.590> because<00:02:20.739> I'm<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.310> Northeast

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
year because I'm here in the Northeast

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.120 
year because I'm here in the Northeast
I'm<00:02:21.879> kind<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.150> limited<00:02:22.300> by<00:02:22.599> weather<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.980> can

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
I'm kind of limited by weather so I can

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.190 
I'm kind of limited by weather so I can
only<00:02:24.220> do<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.490> couple<00:02:24.610> times<00:02:24.940> before<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:26.020> gets

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
only do it a couple times before it gets

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.350 
only do it a couple times before it gets
either<00:02:26.319> too<00:02:26.590> hot<00:02:26.740> or<00:02:26.800> too<00:02:26.950> cold<00:02:27.250> but<00:02:28.150> it's<00:02:28.300> a

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
either too hot or too cold but it's a

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.130 
either too hot or too cold but it's a
fun<00:02:28.540> class

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
fun class

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.110 
fun class
it's<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.530> great<00:02:29.710> way<00:02:29.860> no<00:02:30.430> one<00:02:30.550> else<00:02:30.610> offers<00:02:30.850> out

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
it's a great way no one else offers out

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.670 
it's a great way no one else offers out
here<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.810> makes<00:02:31.930> me<00:02:32.050> one<00:02:32.200> of<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.350> kind<00:02:32.560> it

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
here so it makes me one of a kind it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.330 
here so it makes me one of a kind it
makes<00:02:32.800> me<00:02:32.920> special

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
makes me special

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.520 
makes me special
so<00:02:33.580> if<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.390> can<00:02:34.569> create<00:02:34.780> these<00:02:35.080> one-of-a-kind

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
so if you can create these one-of-a-kind

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.500 
so if you can create these one-of-a-kind
classes<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.280> no<00:02:36.430> one<00:02:36.580> else<00:02:36.730> offers<00:02:37.120> even<00:02:37.420> if

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
classes that no one else offers even if

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.000 
classes that no one else offers even if
it's<00:02:37.630> just<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:38.080> variation<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:40.330> typical<00:02:40.630> class

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
it's just a variation of a typical class

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.640 
it's just a variation of a typical class
you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.190> really<00:02:42.810> create<00:02:43.810> like<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.050> brand<00:02:44.350> image

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
you can really create like a brand image

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.770 
you can really create like a brand image
for<00:02:44.800> yourself<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.400> special<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.970> people
