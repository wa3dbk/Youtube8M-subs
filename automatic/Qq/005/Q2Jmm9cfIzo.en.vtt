getting through it and then just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.310 
getting through it and then just
arriving<00:00:54.239> at<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> point<00:00:54.690> where<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> can't<00:00:55.199> do

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
don't want to use their extra amount of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.620 
don't want to use their extra amount of
time<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> be<00:01:26.310> using<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.700> other<00:01:27.210> strikes

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
time they can be using on other strikes

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
time they can be using on other strikes
and<00:01:27.840> I'm<00:01:27.900> fit<00:01:28.020> personally<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> good

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and I'm fit personally if I have a good

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.800 
and I'm fit personally if I have a good
team<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> 15<00:01:29.850> minutes<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.180> having<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
team I can do it 15 minutes so having a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.780 
team I can do it 15 minutes so having a
strike<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.380> takes<00:01:31.619> twice<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.400> time<00:01:32.610> as

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
strike that takes twice as much time as

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.130 
strike that takes twice as much time as
other<00:01:32.970> strikes<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> same

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
other strikes and you get the same

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.420 
other strikes and you get the same
amount<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.439> reward<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.250> dumb

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
amount of reward it's just kind of dumb

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.740 
amount of reward it's just kind of dumb
so<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:35.909> they've<00:01:36.030> been<00:01:36.180> doing<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.570> actually

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so what they've been doing is actually

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
so what they've been doing is actually
they've<00:01:37.079> reduced<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.770> health<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.100> valla

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
they've reduced the health on valla

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.130 
they've reduced the health on valla
start<00:01:38.579> by<00:01:38.820> thirty-three<00:01:39.479> percent<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:39.990> he's

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
start by thirty-three percent so he's

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350 
start by thirty-three percent so he's
actually<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:41.130> be<00:01:41.310> able<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.700> killed<00:01:41.880> thirty

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
actually gonna be able to killed thirty

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.510 
actually gonna be able to killed thirty
three<00:01:42.630> percent<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> faster<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.189> if<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
three percent have a faster so if you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
three percent have a faster so if you
started<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> hundred<00:01:45.060> percent<00:01:45.119> he<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:45.930> at

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
started a hundred percent he is now at

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.170 
started a hundred percent he is now at
sixty-six<00:01:46.829> percent<00:01:46.860> hell<00:01:47.310> which<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.939> really

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
sixty-six percent hell which is really

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.789 
sixty-six percent hell which is really
cool<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.540> he<00:01:48.780> did<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> lot<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.500> health

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
cool because he did have a lot of health

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.980 
cool because he did have a lot of health
and<00:01:49.950> he<00:01:50.369> does<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> lot<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:51.149> damage<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.600> it'll

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
and he does do a lot of damage so it'll

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
and he does do a lot of damage so it'll
make<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> fight<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> lot<00:01:52.770> faster<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.250> still

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
make that fight a lot faster it still

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.499 
make that fight a lot faster it still
doesn't<00:01:53.640> really<00:01:53.759> make<00:01:53.909> up<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.240> fact<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
doesn't really make up for the fact that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.020 
doesn't really make up for the fact that
there<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> lot<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> downtime<00:01:55.470> between

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
there is a lot of downtime between

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.100 
there is a lot of downtime between

way defense things that do take a lot
longer<00:01:59.820> than<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> other<00:02:00.299> mission<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.719> I'm

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
idling as well as a reporting system

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.900 
idling as well as a reporting system
just<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.470> plenty<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.860> things<00:02:56.010> as<00:02:56.220> well<00:02:56.670> as<00:02:56.790> a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
just a plenty of things as well as a

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.580 
just a plenty of things as well as a
penalty<00:02:57.210> where<00:02:57.540> you<00:02:57.630> can<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.900> where<00:02:58.500> it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
penalty where you can like where it

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.170 
penalty where you can like where it
basically<00:02:58.710> stops<00:02:59.460> you<00:02:59.640> from<00:02:59.700> playing<00:02:59.970> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
basically stops you from playing the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.060 
basically stops you from playing the
certain<00:03:00.510> playlist<00:03:00.930> if<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.470> keep<00:03:01.800> doing<00:03:01.830> that

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
certain playlist if you keep doing that

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.040 
certain playlist if you keep doing that
so<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.460> crucible<00:03:02.880> and<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.330> do<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.510> idle

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
so if it's crucible and you do a idle

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.200 
so if it's crucible and you do a idle
for<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.290> bit<00:03:04.950> carry<00:03:05.100> ously<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.550> a<00:03:05.580> very<00:03:06.060> long

for a bit carry ously for a very long

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.430 
for a bit carry ously for a very long
time<00:03:06.270> it'll<00:03:06.870> make<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.260> actually
