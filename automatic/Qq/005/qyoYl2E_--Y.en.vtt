00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:55.489 
weight ratio is is a lot greater than

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:57.949 
weight ratio is is a lot greater than
four-stroke<00:01:56.489> they<00:01:57.209> struggle<00:01:57.660> a<00:01:57.690> little<00:01:57.810> bit

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
four-stroke they struggle a little bit

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:01.249 
four-stroke they struggle a little bit
more<00:01:58.289> with<00:01:58.530> traction<00:01:59.300> but<00:02:00.300> as<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.080> mentioned

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
more with traction but as you mentioned

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.609 
more with traction but as you mentioned
the<00:02:01.619> MXD<00:02:02.190> class<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.209> other<00:02:03.239> class<00:02:03.619> for

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the MXD class and the other class for

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.100 
the MXD class and the other class for
coulomb<00:02:05.270> they'll<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.539> a<00:02:06.569> reasonable

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
coulomb they'll have a reasonable

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080 
coulomb they'll have a reasonable
advantage<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.800> those<00:02:07.979> classes<00:02:08.489> because<00:02:08.520> the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
advantage in those classes because the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.050 
advantage in those classes because the
the<00:02:09.509> MX<00:02:10.050> nationals<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.459> track<00:02:11.790> surface

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
the MX nationals are the track surface

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.720 
the MX nationals are the track surface
especially<00:02:12.900> a<00:02:12.959> starting<00:02:13.440> area<00:02:13.620> has<00:02:13.950> been<00:02:14.280> very

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
especially a starting area has been very

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.870 
especially a starting area has been very
well<00:02:15.480> manicured<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.040> all<00:02:17.250> low<00:02:17.520> me<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
well manicured and it's all low me and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.540 
well manicured and it's all low me and
these<00:02:18.330> things<00:02:18.599> seem<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> excel<00:02:19.410> there<00:02:19.620> they

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
these things seem to excel there they

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.460 
these things seem to excel there they
will<00:02:20.760> struggle<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.450> little<00:02:21.569> bit<00:02:21.690> on<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.200> harder

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
will struggle a little bit on the harder

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.400 
will struggle a little bit on the harder
packed<00:02:22.680> tracks<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:23.239> yeah<00:02:24.239> as<00:02:24.540> i<00:02:24.810> say<00:02:24.989> pal<00:02:25.260> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
packed tracks but yeah as i say pal the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.220 
packed tracks but yeah as i say pal the
weight<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:26.550> really<00:02:26.849> got<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.300> on<00:02:27.450> so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
weight they really got it going on so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.570 
weight they really got it going on so
power-to-weight<00:02:28.620> ratio<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.400> want<00:02:29.520> to

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
power-to-weight ratio if you want to

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.190 
power-to-weight ratio if you want to
have<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.910> bit<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.060> fun<00:02:30.330> nice<00:02:30.629> light<00:02:30.930> bike

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
have a little bit of fun nice light bike

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.560 
have a little bit of fun nice light bike
keeper<00:02:32.160> power<00:02:32.370> you've<00:02:32.970> just<00:02:33.150> got<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.300> get<00:02:33.480> it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
keeper power you've just got to get it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
keeper power you've just got to get it
to<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> ground<00:02:33.960> properly

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
to the ground properly

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.860 
to the ground properly
I<00:02:34.620> think<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> two-stroke<00:02:35.850> class<00:02:36.120> being

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
I think the two-stroke class being

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.930 
I think the two-stroke class being
exciting<00:02:37.409> as<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.400> fresh<00:02:38.700> look

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
exciting as it is and the the fresh look

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.240 
exciting as it is and the the fresh look
of<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.180> new<00:02:39.390> yz250<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.830> going<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.069> draw

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
of this new yz250 it's going to draw

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
of this new yz250 it's going to draw
back<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.489> lot<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> writers<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.290> possibly<00:02:43.290> race

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
back a lot of writers that possibly race

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.710 
back a lot of writers that possibly race
two<00:02:43.920> strokes<00:02:44.250> ten<00:02:44.549> or<00:02:44.670> fifteen<00:02:45.000> years<00:02:45.269> ago<00:02:45.330> and

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
two strokes ten or fifteen years ago and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.240 
two strokes ten or fifteen years ago and
they're<00:02:46.110> keen<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.560> have<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.680> little<00:02:46.890> bit<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.069> fun

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
they're keen to have a little bit of fun

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.860 
they're keen to have a little bit of fun
maybe<00:02:47.489> even<00:02:47.819> guys<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.269> aren't<00:02:48.629> writing

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
maybe even guys and aren't writing

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.720 
maybe even guys and aren't writing
anymore<00:02:49.379> can<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:50.069> get<00:02:50.159> hold<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.459> one<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.670> these

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
anymore can can get hold of one of these

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.580 
anymore can can get hold of one of these
bikes<00:02:51.060> don't<00:02:51.569> they<00:02:51.900> know<00:02:52.019> they<00:02:52.170> don't<00:02:52.349> need<00:02:52.440> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
bikes don't they know they don't need to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.170 
bikes don't they know they don't need to
work<00:02:52.769> on<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.099> all<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.340> time<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.819> know<00:02:54.000> it's

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
work on it all the time they know it's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.270 
work on it all the time they know it's
fairly<00:02:54.629> cheap<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.110> run<00:02:55.260> so<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> think<00:02:56.099> it's

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
fairly cheap to run so I think it's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.589 
fairly cheap to run so I think it's
going<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.489> be<00:02:56.610> as<00:02:56.700> such<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:56.970> good<00:02:57.239> thing<00:02:57.420> for

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
going to be as such a good thing for

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.289 
going to be as such a good thing for
Yamaha<00:02:58.129> revamping<00:02:59.129> this<00:02:59.310> thing<00:02:59.610> and<00:03:00.030> putting

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
Yamaha revamping this thing and putting

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.759 
Yamaha revamping this thing and putting
it<00:03:00.450> back<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.840> market<00:03:00.989> as<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> fresh<00:03:01.590> new

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
it back on the market as a fresh new

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.050 
it back on the market as a fresh new
look<00:03:01.950> they're<00:03:02.129> gonna<00:03:02.220> draw<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> lot<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.730> guys<00:03:03.030> up

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
look they're gonna draw a lot of guys up

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.699 
look they're gonna draw a lot of guys up
off<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.390> couch<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:04.019> think<00:03:04.230> back<00:03:04.379> onto<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
off that couch I think back onto the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.890 
off that couch I think back onto the
racetrack
