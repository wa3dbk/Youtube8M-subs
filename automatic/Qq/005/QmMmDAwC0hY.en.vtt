video it was about my skincare routine
basically<00:00:20.100> what<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> use<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.699> weekly<00:00:21.539> daily

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.779 
basis and I did mention the derma roller
in<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.380> but<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.949> didn't<00:00:26.189> really<00:00:26.279> go<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.580> depth

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
little bit more about the science behind

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.040 
little bit more about the science behind
it<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> clean<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.510> use<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.870> when

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
it how to clean it when to use it when

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.410 
it how to clean it when to use it when
not<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.350> use<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.920> all<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.130> good<00:00:35.250> stuff

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
heard of micro derma rolling or micro

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.510 
heard of micro derma rolling or micro
needling<00:00:56.970> I<00:00:57.300> wanted<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.260> go<00:00:58.440> over<00:00:58.950> the<00:00:59.310> science

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
needling I wanted to go over the science

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.970 
needling I wanted to go over the science
behind<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:01.020> also<00:01:01.200> just<00:01:01.530> wanted<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> show

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
behind it and I also just wanted to show

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.420 
behind it and I also just wanted to show
you<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.850> tools<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.360> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you the tools so this is the one that I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.420 
you the tools so this is the one that I
like<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> use<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.470> see<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:08.130> it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
like to use as you can see here it's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.719 
like to use as you can see here it's
just<00:01:08.550> covered<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.780> needles<00:01:10.050> and<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.550> size

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
just covered in needles and the size

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.630 
just covered in needles and the size
that<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.350> 1.5<00:01:14.100> millimeter

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that I like to use is the 1.5 millimeter

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.390 
that I like to use is the 1.5 millimeter
and<00:01:14.940> I<00:01:15.720> did<00:01:15.930> actually<00:01:16.260> have<00:01:16.710> another<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and I did actually have another one that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.910 
and I did actually have another one that
I<00:01:17.430> used<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.790> use<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.660> I<00:01:18.690> don't<00:01:19.020> think<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I used to use but I don't think that it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.030 
I used to use but I don't think that it
got<00:01:20.430> deep<00:01:21.150> into<00:01:21.360> my<00:01:21.570> skin<00:01:21.630> enough<00:01:22.200> because<00:01:23.009> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
got deep into my skin enough because I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.790 
got deep into my skin enough because I
never<00:01:23.399> I<00:01:23.570> didn't<00:01:24.570> bleed<00:01:24.840> from<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.530> from

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
never I didn't bleed from it but from

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.680 
never I didn't bleed from it but from
this<00:01:25.979> one<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.610> actually<00:01:26.850> did<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
this one I actually did have the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.960 
this one I actually did have the
bleeding<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.680> from<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.399> I've<00:01:29.550> heard<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
bleeding which from what I've heard is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.760 
bleeding which from what I've heard is
what<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> want<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:31.590> how

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
what you want to have because that's how

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
what you want to have because that's how
you<00:01:32.580> know<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.330> getting<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.750> there<00:01:33.960> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you know that it's getting in there and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.550 
you know that it's getting in there and
there's<00:01:35.040> some<00:01:35.520> good<00:01:35.670> feeling<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.229> little

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
there's some good feeling so a little

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.820 
there's some good feeling so a little
bit<00:01:37.740> about<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.130> science<00:01:38.460> behind<00:01:38.550> it<00:01:39.830> what

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
bit about the science behind it what

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.040 
bit about the science behind it what
it's<00:01:41.160> doing<00:01:41.610> when<00:01:41.880> you're<00:01:42.330> rolling<00:01:42.690> it<00:01:42.780> across

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
it's doing when you're rolling it across

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.080 
it's doing when you're rolling it across
your<00:01:43.200> skin<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.220> making<00:01:44.550> little<00:01:44.759> tiny

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
your skin is it's making little tiny

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
your skin is it's making little tiny
wounds<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> puncturing<00:01:46.170> your<00:01:46.259> skin<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.310> when

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
wounds and puncturing your skin so when

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.400 
wounds and puncturing your skin so when
your<00:01:47.759> skin<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.090> winded<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:48.960> immediately

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
your skin is winded it's immediately

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.469 
your skin is winded it's immediately
gonna<00:01:49.710> start<00:01:50.039> repairing<00:01:50.940> itself

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
gonna start repairing itself

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.050 
gonna start repairing itself
now<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.289> skin<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.860> going<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.220> use<00:01:53.550> collagen

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
now with skin it's going to use collagen

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.699 
now with skin it's going to use collagen
and<00:01:54.360> elastin<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.229> those<00:01:55.410> are<00:01:55.590> its

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
and elastin because those are its

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.980 
and elastin because those are its
building<00:01:56.039> blocks<00:01:56.119> now<00:01:57.119> everyone<00:01:57.750> knows<00:01:57.780> that

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
building blocks now everyone knows that

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740 
building blocks now everyone knows that
collagen<00:01:58.649> elastin<00:01:59.160> are<00:01:59.580> things<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.090> make

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
collagen elastin are things that make

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870 
collagen elastin are things that make
