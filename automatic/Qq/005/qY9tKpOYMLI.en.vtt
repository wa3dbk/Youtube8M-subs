fun boring the week laser torch it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.210 
fun boring the week laser torch it's
better<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.729> it's<00:01:14.729> able<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.240> burn<00:01:15.420> paper

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
better because it's able to burn paper

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.080 
better because it's able to burn paper
things<00:01:18.470> which<00:01:19.470> raised<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.680> tactical<00:01:20.280> it's

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
things which raised the tactical it's

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.160 
things which raised the tactical it's
not<00:01:21.210> able<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.659> burn<00:01:21.869> things<00:01:23.180> ok<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.630> start<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
not able to burn things ok we start the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.249 
not able to burn things ok we start the
chest<00:01:26.450> for<00:01:27.450> brightness<00:01:29.840> though<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.049> very

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
chest for brightness though it's very

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.390 
chest for brightness though it's very
bright<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:33.650> there<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> shadow<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
bright but there is a shadow in the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.569 
bright but there is a shadow in the
middle<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:39.049> brightness<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
middle so brightness is good but the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.370 
middle so brightness is good but the
tracer<00:01:44.990> has<00:01:45.990> no<00:01:46.170> shadow<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> spot<00:01:48.380> it's

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
tracer has no shadow in the spot it's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.030 
tracer has no shadow in the spot it's
very<00:01:49.710> bright<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.840> but<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> small

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
very bright too but there is a small

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.700 
very bright too but there is a small
angel<00:01:53.520> spot<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.140> ninety<00:01:55.140> percent<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
angel spot and ninety percent on the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.370 

okay<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.510> brightness<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:05.240> good<00:02:06.240> at<00:02:06.479> both

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
okay the brightness is good at both

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:14.480 
okay the brightness is good at both
sides<00:02:09.319> both<00:02:10.319> torches<00:02:12.380> have<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.410> very<00:02:14.250> good

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
sides both torches have a very good

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.460 
sides both torches have a very good
brightness<00:02:17.330> now<00:02:18.330> which<00:02:18.540> s<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
brightness now which s at a time the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.790 
brightness now which s at a time the
duration<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.010> high<00:02:20.700> performance<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:22.230> they're

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
duration of high performance so they're

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.860 
duration of high performance so they're
weak<00:02:23.489> Laser<00:02:23.700> charge<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.330> left<00:02:24.540> has<00:02:24.840> a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
weak Laser charge on the left has a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.170 
weak Laser charge on the left has a
duration<00:02:26.270> about<00:02:27.270> 15<00:02:27.900> minutes<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:29.580> tracer

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
duration about 15 minutes and the tracer

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.280 
torch has a run time about 65 minutes
okay<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.780> runtime<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:38.040> best<00:02:39.000> performance<00:02:39.660> is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.250 

he<00:02:43.290> about<00:02:43.530> 15<00:02:44.310> minutes<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.870> whip<00:02:46.019> laser

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
he about 15 minutes and the whip laser

he about 15 minutes and the whip laser
torch<00:02:46.650> 15<00:02:47.640> minutes<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.970> much<00:02:51.480> better

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
torch 15 minutes and it's much better

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.310 
torch 15 minutes and it's much better

with the tray subject achill it's about

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.590 
with the tray subject achill it's about
65<00:02:55.320> minutes<00:02:55.620> at<00:02:56.610> hundred<00:02:57.150> percent

65 minutes at hundred percent

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:07.960 
65 minutes at hundred percent
performance<00:03:04.280> okay<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:06.030> light<00:03:06.209> quality

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
performance okay the light quality

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.199 
performance okay the light quality
whether<00:03:08.970> week<00:03:09.239> laser<00:03:09.450> torch<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.200> bad<00:03:10.890> because

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
whether week laser torch is bad because

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.910 
whether week laser torch is bad because
there<00:03:12.209> is<00:03:12.329> a<00:03:12.360> shadow<00:03:12.750> in<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.049> middle<00:03:13.350> m<00:03:13.590> the

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
there is a shadow in the middle m the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.220 
there is a shadow in the middle m the
light<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:15.410> really<00:03:16.410> yellow<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.370> red<00:03:17.600> so<00:03:18.600> the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
light is really yellow to red so the

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.509 
light is really yellow to red so the
light<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.190> tracer<00:03:20.790> tactical<00:03:21.450> is<00:03:22.519> without

light of the tracer tactical is without
a<00:03:23.549> shadow<00:03:23.700> and<00:03:24.209> it's<00:03:24.959> nearly<00:03:25.709> daylight<00:03:27.980> okay

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.729 

now<00:03:37.220> here<00:03:37.610> is<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.819> big<00:03:38.420> laser<00:03:38.690> torch<00:03:41.349> now<00:03:42.349> I<00:03:42.379> put

now here is a big laser torch now I put

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.160 
now here is a big laser torch now I put
it<00:03:42.860> on<00:03:43.780> okay<00:03:45.069> takes<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.220> few<00:03:46.400> seconds<00:03:46.849> to<00:03:46.970> start

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
it on okay takes a few seconds to start

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.059 
it on okay takes a few seconds to start
the<00:03:48.170> burner<00:03:49.480> now<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.540> see<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.379> near<00:03:51.590> area

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
the burner now you see in the near area

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.289 
the burner now you see in the near area
it's<00:03:52.489> very<00:03:52.790> bright<00:03:54.069> but<00:03:55.069> it's<00:03:55.730> very<00:03:55.970> difficult

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
it's very bright but it's very difficult

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.710 
it's very bright but it's very difficult
to<00:03:56.720> illuminate<00:03:57.670> objects<00:03:58.670> which<00:03:59.060> are<00:03:59.269> far<00:03:59.569> away

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
to illuminate objects which are far away

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.770 
to illuminate objects which are far away
there<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.140> no<00:04:00.560> spot<00:04:01.040> yeah<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.629> is<00:04:04.780> something

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
there is no spot yeah this is something

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.199 
there is no spot yeah this is something
critical<00:04:07.720> now<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:09.379> will<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.980> difference

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
critical now you will see the difference

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.400 
critical now you will see the difference
you<00:04:11.209> will<00:04:11.359> see<00:04:11.510> the<00:04:11.690> difference<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:12.760> the

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
you will see the difference of the

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.110 
you will see the difference of the
tracer<00:04:15.410> here's<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:16.160> tracer<00:04:16.639> tactical<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:19.120> I

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
tracer here's a tracer tactical and I

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.110 
tracer here's a tracer tactical and I
put<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.389> on<00:04:20.510> now<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.250> then<00:04:22.250> you<00:04:22.490> can<00:04:22.880> see

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
put it on now and then you can see

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.150 
put it on now and then you can see
objects<00:04:23.750> far<00:04:24.470> away<00:04:24.680> see<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:25.780> container<00:04:27.160> it's

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
objects far away see this container it's

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.070 
objects far away see this container it's
more<00:04:28.880> than<00:04:30.280> more<00:04:31.280> than<00:04:31.600> 120<00:04:32.600> meters<00:04:32.960> distance

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
more than more than 120 meters distance

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.600 
more than more than 120 meters distance
so<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:37.789> spot<00:04:38.090> illumination<00:04:39.020> for<00:04:39.289> far<00:04:39.950> objects

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
so the spot illumination for far objects

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.529 
so the spot illumination for far objects
is<00:04:41.050> much<00:04:42.050> better<00:04:42.530> illuminated<00:04:43.280> by<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.610> tracer

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
is much better illuminated by the tracer

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:50.950 
is much better illuminated by the tracer
tactical<00:04:47.349> yeah<00:04:48.349> in<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:48.680> long-distance<00:04:48.919> use<00:04:49.960> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
tactical yeah in a long-distance use the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.760 
tactical yeah in a long-distance use the
weak<00:04:51.110> Laser<00:04:51.320> thought<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.860> not<00:04:52.070> able<00:04:52.510> to<00:04:53.770> catch

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
weak Laser thought is not able to catch

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.870 
weak Laser thought is not able to catch
objects<00:04:55.669> far<00:04:55.940> away<00:04:56.349> now<00:04:57.349> our<00:04:57.650> test<00:04:58.039> was<00:04:58.310> more

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
objects far away now our test was more

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.390 
objects far away now our test was more
than<00:04:59.150> 100<00:04:59.810> meters<00:05:00.139> away<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:00.680> object<00:05:01.070> could<00:05:01.340> be

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
than 100 meters away the object could be

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.690 
than 100 meters away the object could be
seen<00:05:02.270> very<00:05:02.300> well<00:05:02.870> though<00:05:03.110> this<00:05:03.380> is<00:05:03.700> better

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
seen very well though this is better

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.909 
seen very well though this is better
with<00:05:04.970> a<00:05:05.000> trace<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:05.990> tactical<00:05:08.440> now<00:05:09.440> here<00:05:09.680> can

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
with a trace of tactical now here can

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.230 
with a trace of tactical now here can
see<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.250> difference<00:05:11.380> in<00:05:12.380> charging<00:05:13.240> the

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
see the difference in charging the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.330 
see the difference in charging the
battery<00:05:14.570> this<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:15.349> a<00:05:15.380> week<00:05:15.650> laser<00:05:15.860> torch<00:05:16.160> so

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
battery this is a week laser torch so

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.010 
battery this is a week laser torch so
you<00:05:16.490> have<00:05:16.610> to<00:05:16.760> open<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:18.200> body<00:05:18.440> this<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.310> a<00:05:19.340> and

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
you have to open the body this is a and

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.270 
you have to open the body this is a and
nickel<00:05:21.020> battery<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:22.610> you<00:05:22.639> have<00:05:22.940> to<00:05:23.419> choose<00:05:24.280> one

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
nickel battery so you have to choose one

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:34.240 
nickel battery so you have to choose one
this<00:05:25.669> one<00:05:25.940> may<00:05:26.180> be<00:05:28.930> ok<00:05:31.270> no<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.870> one<00:05:33.110> this<00:05:34.039> one

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
this one may be ok no that one this one

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.959 
this one may be ok no that one this one
should<00:05:34.400> be<00:05:34.460> right<00:05:34.990> yeah<00:05:36.250> it's<00:05:37.250> complicated

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
should be right yeah it's complicated

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.779 
should be right yeah it's complicated
the<00:05:39.899> temperatures<00:05:40.469> ends<00:05:40.769> up<00:05:40.889> behind<00:05:41.099> okay

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
the temperatures ends up behind okay

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.619 
the temperatures ends up behind okay
it's<00:05:42.509> complicated<00:05:43.079> more<00:05:43.739> easy<00:05:43.949> is<00:05:44.309> the<00:05:45.029> use<00:05:45.239> in

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
it's complicated more easy is the use in

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.929 
it's complicated more easy is the use in
the<00:05:45.719> charging<00:05:46.289> of<00:05:46.469> the<00:05:47.099> tracer<00:05:48.349> you<00:05:49.349> put<00:05:49.589> it<00:05:49.709> in

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:49.939 
the charging of the tracer you put it in

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:55.219 
the charging of the tracer you put it in
that's<00:05:50.939> all<00:05:51.169> you<00:05:52.169> do<00:05:52.349> not<00:05:52.529> have<00:05:52.799> to<00:05:53.009> open<00:05:54.229> the

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
that's all you do not have to open the

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.619 
that's all you do not have to open the
body<00:05:57.649> now<00:05:58.649> our<00:05:58.919> last<00:05:59.159> point<00:05:59.519> is<00:05:59.729> battery<00:06:00.360> and

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
body now our last point is battery and

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.009 
body now our last point is battery and
charging<00:06:01.049> so<00:06:01.979> it's<00:06:02.610> very<00:06:02.789> complicated<00:06:03.299> to

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:04.019 
charging so it's very complicated to

00:06:04.019 --> 00:06:07.209 
charging so it's very complicated to
charge<00:06:04.409> the<00:06:04.829> laser<00:06:05.219> torch<00:06:05.579> and<00:06:05.959> its

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
charge the laser torch and its

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:12.679 
charge the laser torch and its
nickel-metal<00:06:09.079> battery<00:06:10.309> so<00:06:11.309> it's<00:06:12.239> very<00:06:12.389> easy

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:12.689 
nickel-metal battery so it's very easy

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:17.119 
nickel-metal battery so it's very easy
to<00:06:12.869> chart<00:06:13.289> blazer<00:06:13.829> and<00:06:14.489> it's<00:06:15.059> a<00:06:16.129> lithium

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
to chart blazer and it's a lithium

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.539 
to chart blazer and it's a lithium
battery<00:06:17.779> so<00:06:18.779> it's<00:06:19.019> more<00:06:19.619> comfortable<00:06:20.249> and

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:20.549 
battery so it's more comfortable and

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:23.079 
battery so it's more comfortable and
there<00:06:20.879> is<00:06:21.029> no<00:06:21.299> memory<00:06:21.689> effect<00:06:21.809> in<00:06:22.439> the<00:06:22.529> battery

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:23.089 
there is no memory effect in the battery

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:28.100 
there is no memory effect in the battery
with<00:06:24.089> a<00:06:24.119> tracer<00:06:24.539> tactical<00:06:25.219> so<00:06:26.689> most<00:06:27.689> things

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
with a tracer tactical so most things

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.109 
with a tracer tactical so most things
are<00:06:28.589> better<00:06:28.829> wear<00:06:29.129> that<00:06:29.249> raise<00:06:29.489> the<00:06:29.639> tactical

00:06:30.109 --> 00:06:30.119 
are better wear that raise the tactical

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:33.169 
are better wear that raise the tactical
but<00:06:31.079> the<00:06:31.829> fun<00:06:32.009> part<00:06:32.339> here<00:06:32.519> so<00:06:32.789> we<00:06:32.909> place<00:06:33.149> a

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:33.179 
but the fun part here so we place a

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:36.669 
but the fun part here so we place a
torch<00:06:33.529> but<00:06:34.789> normally<00:06:35.789> that<00:06:36.059> makes<00:06:36.299> no<00:06:36.479> sense

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:36.679 
torch but normally that makes no sense

00:06:36.679 --> 00:06:41.479 
torch but normally that makes no sense
so<00:06:38.269> make<00:06:39.269> your<00:06:39.449> choice
