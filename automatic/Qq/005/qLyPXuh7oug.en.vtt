00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.790
 in one day were very many buses 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.790
 criss-crossing the city 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.980
 but every single bus driver only drives 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.680
 a certain distance the driver calls 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.689
 the stops from who wants to get out 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.689
 must press the hold button 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.040
 Who wants to go by bus somewhere 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.610
 have a ticket sold the 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.610
 bus driver 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.700
 Being a bus driver is nice 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.400
 exhausting 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.000
 You always have to be very careful because of 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.000
 of heavy traffic 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:08.770
 when people have difficulties when 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:10.720
 get in then the driver does not help 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.800
 always fits a children's cart in the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.930
 bus in the morning and in the evening is 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.400
 fully occupied because people work 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.400
 drive or to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.899
 Endstation the last passengers are 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.790
 alighted 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.189
 Now the driver writes on how 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.479
 has sold many tickets with it 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.479
 in the evening the cash is right 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.770
 and because he returns now 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.770
 he has to stop the new endstation 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.830
 if someone has forgotten something in the bus 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.700
 the driver reports it via radio to the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.619
 central 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:27.959
 so that the owner can kick it again 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:30.110
 and the new passengers are already climbing 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.110
 on 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.440
 A bus driver will be eight hours a day 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.440
 between the end stations back and forth 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.370
 But a bus must be longer than eight 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.930
 drive through the city for hours 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.660
 Therefore, the bus driver in the afternoon 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.370
 replaced by a colleague then the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.370
 bus goes into the night 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.860
 this bus driver is now in the evening 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.690
 just have to go to the depot 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.690
 and give his fare
