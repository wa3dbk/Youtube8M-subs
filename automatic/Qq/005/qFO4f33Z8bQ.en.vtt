00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
using the tire were immediately that the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.690 
using the tire were immediately that the

bike moves around on the side wall

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.049 
bike moves around on the side wall
because<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> sidewall<00:00:45.629> flexes<00:00:46.969> given<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
because the sidewall flexes given the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060 
because the sidewall flexes given the
fact<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.420> you'll<00:00:48.600> break<00:00:48.870> breaking<00:00:49.829> hard

so recommended hot precious for those

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.619 
so recommended hot precious for those
tires<00:00:55.469> were<00:00:55.670> for<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> tires<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> was

in the rear and 34 hot in the front
overall<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.760> roll<00:01:09.000> profile<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.200> tire<00:01:10.409> is

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
overall the roll profile of the tire is

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.039 
overall the roll profile of the tire is
substantially<00:01:11.729> different<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:12.450> completely

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
substantially different it is completely

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.990 
substantially different it is completely
different<00:01:13.290> from<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> previous<00:01:13.950> double<00:01:14.460> O<00:01:14.549> 3

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.109 
different from the previous double O 3
Pro<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:16.680> you'll<00:01:16.890> notice<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.759> try<00:01:17.939> those

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
Pro so you'll notice when you try those

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.749 
Pro so you'll notice when you try those
tires<00:01:18.420> out<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.470> when<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.770> initiate<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
tires out that when you initiate the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.880 
tires out that when you initiate the
turn<00:01:21.150> into<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> corner<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.110> tire<00:01:22.409> rolls

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
turn into the corner the tire rolls

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.399 
turn into the corner the tire rolls
immediately<00:01:23.729> right<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.270> edge<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.810> go

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
immediately right to the edge and go

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.100 
immediately right to the edge and go
straight<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.460> knee<00:01:26.670> very<00:01:27.570> different

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
straight to your knee very different

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.190 
straight to your knee very different
from<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.350> old<00:01:28.590> tire<00:01:29.689> it's<00:01:30.689> also<00:01:30.930> very

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
from the old tire it's also very

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
from the old tire it's also very
different<00:01:31.439> obviously<00:01:31.950> with<00:01:32.100> carcass<00:01:32.549> flex<00:01:32.909> in

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
different obviously with carcass flex in

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.890 
different obviously with carcass flex in
terms<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.659> field<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:35.400> there's<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.119> lot<00:01:36.630> more

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
terms of field so there's a lot more

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.440 
terms of field so there's a lot more
feedback<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> tires<00:01:38.100> in<00:01:38.490> terms<00:01:39.180> of

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
feedback from the tires in terms of

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
feedback from the tires in terms of
sidewall<00:01:39.990> flex<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> lot<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
sidewall flex but then a lot of the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700 
sidewall flex but then a lot of the
bumps<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> track<00:01:42.840> are<00:01:43.110> taken<00:01:43.500> away

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
bumps in the track are taken away

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.649 
bumps in the track are taken away
because<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.520> upper<00:01:44.880> part<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.420> tread

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
because the upper part of the tread

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.050 
because the upper part of the tread
pattern<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.320> soft<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.890> does<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> help

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
pattern is so soft it does a lot to help

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.130 
pattern is so soft it does a lot to help
pump<00:01:48.450> absorption<00:01:49.880> as<00:01:50.880> always<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:52.020> you're

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
testing new tires you're gonna have to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.219 
testing new tires you're gonna have to
spend<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> considerable<00:01:54.360> amount<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> time

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
spend a considerable amount of time

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.280 
spend a considerable amount of time
changing<00:01:56.189> chassis<00:01:56.520> geometry<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.659> also

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
changing chassis geometry and also

Bridgestone r10 tire test now a lot of
you<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:25.080> asked<00:02:25.530> specific<00:02:26.100> questions<00:02:26.130> about

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
you have asked specific questions about

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.730 
you have asked specific questions about
this<00:02:26.850> tire<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.960> tire<00:02:28.170> report<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> very

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
this tire so the tire report is very

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.280 
this tire so the tire report is very
comprehensive<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.970> shows<00:02:30.210> lots<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.660> tire<00:02:30.990> wear

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290

for<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.050> test<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.560> did<00:02:37.890> leave<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.190> pressure<00:02:38.700> at

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
for the test I did leave the pressure at

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.540 
for the test I did leave the pressure at
the<00:02:39.210> recommended<00:02:39.750> settings<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:40.650> per<00:02:40.920> braceros

the recommended settings as per braceros
requirements<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:44.370> since<00:02:44.730> changed<00:02:44.900> those

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
requirements I have since changed those

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.699 
requirements I have since changed those
settings<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:47.100> terms<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.580> pressure<00:02:47.940> and

settings in terms of pressure and

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.990 
settings in terms of pressure and
started<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.800> 40<00:02:50.250> hot<00:02:50.459> in<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.700> front

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
started a 40 hot in the front

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090 
started a 40 hot in the front
thirty-eight<00:02:51.840> hunt<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> rear<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.800> was

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
thirty-eight hunt in the rear that was

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.740 
thirty-eight hunt in the rear that was
too<00:02:53.340> much<00:02:53.490> for<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.820> carcass<00:02:54.240> it<00:02:54.390> was<00:02:54.480> actually

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
too much for the carcass it was actually

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.100 
too much for the carcass it was actually
too<00:02:54.990> stiff<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.560> then<00:02:56.130> moved<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.550> 38<00:02:57.240> hot<00:02:57.720> in

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
too stiff and then moved to 38 hot in

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.400 
too stiff and then moved to 38 hot in
the<00:02:58.560> front<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.010> 36<00:02:59.760> hot<00:03:00.000> in<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.360> rear<00:03:00.540> now

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
the front and 36 hot in the rear now

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.410 
the front and 36 hot in the rear now
that<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.860> me<00:03:02.040> made<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.280> best<00:03:02.790> difference<00:03:03.300> of

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
that for me made the best difference of

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.780 
that for me made the best difference of
all<00:03:03.600> simply<00:03:04.170> because<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.890> tire<00:03:05.160> retained<00:03:05.610> its

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
all simply because the tire retained its

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.850 
all simply because the tire retained its
structure<00:03:06.209> under<00:03:06.480> extremely<00:03:07.110> hard<00:03:07.410> braking

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
structure under extremely hard braking

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.550 
structure under extremely hard braking
and<00:03:08.010> acceleration<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.720> got<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.110> lot<00:03:10.500> more

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
and acceleration and it got a lot more

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.340 
and acceleration and it got a lot more
feel<00:03:11.280> out<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.880> tires<00:03:12.180> because<00:03:12.810> I'm<00:03:13.080> used

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
feel out of the tires because I'm used

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.670 
feel out of the tires because I'm used
to<00:03:13.470> harder<00:03:14.070> tires<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.670> more<00:03:15.000> feedback<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:16.050> for

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
to harder tires and more feedback so for

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.770 
to harder tires and more feedback so for
me<00:03:16.769> personally<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.610> tire<00:03:18.239> pressure<00:03:18.480> worked

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
me personally that tire pressure worked

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.500 
me personally that tire pressure worked
better<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.320> not<00:03:19.890> only<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.209> wear

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
better and not only that but the wear

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.009 
better and not only that but the wear
changed<00:03:22.380> too<00:03:22.739> in<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.060> tire<00:03:24.360> lasted

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
changed too in that the tire lasted

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.050 
changed too in that the tire lasted
longer<00:03:25.470> now<00:03:25.950> as<00:03:26.010> always<00:03:26.190> with<00:03:26.640> any<00:03:26.760> tire

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
longer now as always with any tire

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.150 
longer now as always with any tire
pressure<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.959> see<00:03:28.440> what<00:03:28.709> works<00:03:28.950> to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
pressure you have to see what works to

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.370 
pressure you have to see what works to
you<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.150> based<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.660> writing<00:03:31.080> style

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
you and that is based on writing style

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.850 
you and that is based on writing style
it's<00:03:32.130> based<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.519> ambient<00:03:33.150> track<00:03:33.930> temperatures

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
it's based on ambient track temperatures

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.180 
it's based on ambient track temperatures
and<00:03:35.100> air<00:03:35.370> temperatures<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:37.019> bear<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:37.950> in

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
and air temperatures so bear that in

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.400 
and air temperatures so bear that in
