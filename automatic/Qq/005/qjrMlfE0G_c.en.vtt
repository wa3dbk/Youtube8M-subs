 environmental management standards which are 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.890
 possible with the dedication of the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.890

 not meet the environmental management goals 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.850
 prevention of pollution and protection of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.640
 environment 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.699
 implementing standards is not easy and 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.399
 there are specialized companies 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.110
 according to the consultant the certificate 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.790
 strategic for growth 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.490
 of companies 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.549
 the factory was able to achieve the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.280
 quality in the sheds all residues 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.710
 solids are pressed and sold to 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.350
 recycling companies 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 already the sewage that comes here all that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.710
 arrives is treated within these tanks a 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.840
 process that leaves the water 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.270
 to go back to the environment 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.610
 the quality test is done in this 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.670
 aquarium full of loads 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.850
 the fish that are the guinea pigs that this 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 if the death of a competitor occurred 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.840
 yetu something's going wrong 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.790
 no fish have died yet 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.680
 Thank God it's great to 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.030
 initiative that reduces the impact 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.549
 environmental 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.520
 improves the factory's relationship with 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.860
 customers and also with employees 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.740
 caring for the environment has become 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.380
 question of market survival and 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.310
 this is not exclusive to large 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.009
 companies 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.119
 this one for example has little more than 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:12.960
 60 employees and on the wall a 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.180
 iso certified on screen the laws 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.140
 environment in companies and in 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.500
 company 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.420
 the effort to fulfill all those 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 obligations was set up the central 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.230
 waste failure to walk on the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.880
 solid wastes of the company are the 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.740
 waste generated at headquarters also in the 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.720
 our customers are being referred 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.910
 to the central waste have not been there 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.500
 non-recyclable plastic paper that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.240
 then some 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.640
 suppliers we will charge a 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.420
 material for the final treatment of 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.720
 waste 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.480
 already in the collection the garbage is separated until a 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.630
 special box for battery disposal and 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.550
 battery has been installed that 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.990
 goes beyond the nuclei 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.900
 besides the question of the market has this 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.330
 issue is environmental awareness 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.850
 even though it seems that our 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.380
 participation is very small 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.850
 we begin to understand that not because 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.500
 we are infecting the people who 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.210
 are on our laps to start with 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 our collaborators who will infect 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.470
 the family of assembling friends more 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.320
 do not also infect our 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.510
 suppliers, and thus 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.370
 so on and we see that our 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.370
 work is spreading
