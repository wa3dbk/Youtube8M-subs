00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
this out of the packaging and we agree

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.330 
this out of the packaging and we agree
but<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.970> also<00:01:09.560> something<00:01:10.560> cool<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.010> look<00:01:11.130> at

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
but it's also something cool to look at

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.219 
but it's also something cool to look at
and<00:01:12.409> I<00:01:13.409> did<00:01:13.590> look<00:01:13.770> online<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.729> not

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
and I did look online they are not

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.510 
and I did look online they are not
selling<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.439> great<00:01:16.650> deal<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> money<00:01:17.189> but

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
selling for a great deal of money but

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.210 
selling for a great deal of money but
they're<00:01:17.700> still<00:01:18.560> collectible<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.950> we'll<00:01:20.100> be

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
they're still collectible so we'll be

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.740 
they're still collectible so we'll be
careful<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.670> being<00:01:20.850> very<00:01:21.000> careful<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.540> can

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
careful and being very careful and I can

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.320 
careful and being very careful and I can
do<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.990> put<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> right<00:01:23.220> back<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.970> nobody

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
do this put a right back in and nobody

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
do this put a right back in and nobody
will<00:01:24.450> ever<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.860> but<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:25.950> keep<00:01:26.159> these<00:01:26.340> in<00:01:26.490> our

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
will ever know but we keep these in our

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.990 
will ever know but we keep these in our
collections<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:28.340> maybe<00:01:29.340> later<00:01:29.670> we'll<00:01:29.970> find

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
collections so maybe later we'll find

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.819 
collections so maybe later we'll find
more<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.960> keep<00:01:31.110> adding<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> them

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
more and then just keep adding to them

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.460 
more and then just keep adding to them
and<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:33.000> probably<00:01:33.270> paid<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.840> dollar<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and we probably paid a dollar for this

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.730 
and we probably paid a dollar for this
not<00:01:34.740> even<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.189> at<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.850> state<00:01:36.600> sale<00:01:36.900> LPS<00:01:37.470> Jim

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
not even that at a state sale LPS Jim

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
not even that at a state sale LPS Jim
picked<00:01:37.979> him<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.600> can't<00:01:39.600> let<00:01:39.689> me<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.960> him<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
stand so we don't necessarily like

a lot of times were reluctant to do that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.620 
a lot of times were reluctant to do that

this<00:03:13.800> arm<00:03:14.150> does<00:03:15.150> not<00:03:15.420> turn<00:03:15.750> I<00:03:16.020> was<00:03:16.800> thinking

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
this arm does not turn I was thinking

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.440 
this arm does not turn I was thinking
that<00:03:17.160> these<00:03:17.400> would<00:03:17.610> slide<00:03:17.880> down<00:03:17.910> but<00:03:18.330> they

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that these would slide down but they

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.260 
that these would slide down but they
don't<00:03:18.920> to<00:03:19.920> cover<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.430> sides<00:03:20.730> here<00:03:21.090> so

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
don't to cover the sides here so

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.780 
don't to cover the sides here so
