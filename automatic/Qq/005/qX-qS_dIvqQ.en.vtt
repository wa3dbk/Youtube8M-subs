this<00:00:25.170> new<00:00:25.529> album<00:00:27.439> we<00:00:28.439> were<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.650> Hong<00:00:28.859> Kong<00:00:29.130> we

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
this new album we were in Hong Kong we

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.310 
this new album we were in Hong Kong we
didn't<00:00:30.000> even<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.570> were<00:00:30.599> gonna<00:00:30.840> record

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
didn't even know we were gonna record

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.350 
didn't even know we were gonna record
we'd<00:00:31.619> had<00:00:31.740> pressure<00:00:32.040> from<00:00:32.219> people<00:00:32.820> fans

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
we'd had pressure from people fans

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.060 
we'd had pressure from people fans
accepted<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:34.920> thought

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
accepted to do it so we just thought

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010 
accepted to do it so we just thought
well<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.270> without<00:00:36.329> telling<00:00:36.719> anyone

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
well we can do it without telling anyone

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990 
well we can do it without telling anyone
it'll<00:00:37.530> take<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> pressure<00:00:37.980> off<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.820> then

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
it'll take the pressure off but then

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.049 
it'll take the pressure off but then
there<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.360> had<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.660> super<00:00:40.170> idea<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.820> find

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
there we had this super idea to to find

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.150 
there we had this super idea to to find
a<00:00:42.210> studio<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.960> go<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.469> there<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.920> see<00:00:44.129> what

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
a studio and go in there and see what

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.690 
a studio and go in there and see what
happens

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
happens

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
happens
we<00:00:44.969> didn't<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> expect<00:00:46.260> we

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
we didn't really know what to expect we

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.130 
we didn't really know what to expect we
just<00:00:47.059> we<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.270> did<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> we've<00:00:48.750> been<00:00:48.899> playing

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
just we just did it we've been playing

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
just we just did it we've been playing
with<00:00:49.410> each<00:00:49.530> other<00:00:49.710> quite<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> lot<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:51.180> know

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
with each other quite a lot you know

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.240 
with each other quite a lot you know
since<00:00:51.600> 2009<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.559> were<00:00:52.590> quite<00:00:52.800> used<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.100> each

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
since 2009 we were quite used to each

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.360 
since 2009 we were quite used to each
other<00:00:53.460> again<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.590> it<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.800> seemed<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
other again and it just seemed like a

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.119 
other again and it just seemed like a
kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.940> almost<00:00:57.420> obvious<00:00:57.750> thing<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.260> do<00:00:58.440> back

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
kind of almost obvious thing to do back

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.439 
kind of almost obvious thing to do back
in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> 90s<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.699> songs<00:01:00.000> would<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.300> been

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
in the 90s the songs would have been

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
in the 90s the songs would have been
demoed<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> band's<00:01:01.920> become<00:01:02.340> I've

and<00:01:16.580> maybe<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.729> broadcast<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.689> these<00:01:18.990> sorts<00:01:19.380> of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and maybe I broadcast and these sorts of

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
and maybe I broadcast and these sorts of
songs<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.890> people<00:01:20.130> would<00:01:20.369> be<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.520> familiar

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
songs that people would be very familiar

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990 
songs that people would be very familiar
with<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> sonically<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.580> had<00:01:23.759> tons

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
with and sonically you know we had tons

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.109 
with and sonically you know we had tons
about<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> disposal<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:26.009> was<00:01:26.130> maybe<00:01:26.400> some

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
about a disposal so there was maybe some

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.600 
about a disposal so there was maybe some
sort<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> similar<00:01:28.500> sounds<00:01:28.920> keyboard<00:01:29.280> sounds

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
sort of similar sounds keyboard sounds

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.399 
sort of similar sounds keyboard sounds
that<00:01:29.759> weren't<00:01:30.000> particularly<00:01:30.390> at<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.020> default

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that weren't particularly at the default

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.200 
that weren't particularly at the default
setting<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.890> any<00:01:32.070> member<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.670> group<00:01:32.909> so

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
setting of any member of the group so

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.289 
setting of any member of the group so
they<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.600> sound<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:34.820> something<00:01:35.820> different

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
they they sound like something different

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.270 
they they sound like something different
so<00:01:36.689> there's<00:01:37.110> really<00:01:37.409> unfamiliar<00:01:38.009> territory

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
so there's really unfamiliar territory

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.969 
so there's really unfamiliar territory
after<00:01:39.270> us<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.750> reckon<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> lot<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.590> people<00:01:40.860> would

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
after us I reckon a lot of people would

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
after us I reckon a lot of people would
have<00:01:41.070> expected<00:01:41.159> me<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.030> put<00:01:42.240> tons<00:01:42.509> of

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
have expected me it just put tons of

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.090 
have expected me it just put tons of

together<00:02:17.950> was<00:02:18.219> a<00:02:18.250> really<00:02:18.609> good<00:02:18.760> solid<00:02:19.090> piece

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269

together was a really good solid piece
of<00:02:19.299> work<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.200> think<00:02:20.230> that's<00:02:20.500> what<00:02:20.650> we've

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
of work and I think that's what we've

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.500 
of work and I think that's what we've
achieved<00:02:20.920> with<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.459> record<00:02:21.670> because<00:02:22.390> it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
achieved with this record because it

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.420 
achieved with this record because it
does<00:02:22.689> he<00:02:22.810> goes<00:02:22.959> from<00:02:23.200> being<00:02:23.439> something<00:02:24.069> really

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
does he goes from being something really

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.130 
does he goes from being something really
experimental<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.299> really<00:02:25.629> kind<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:25.870> soul

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
experimental to a really kind of soul

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.050 
experimental to a really kind of soul
type<00:02:26.469> song<00:02:26.799> to<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> real<00:02:27.489> kind<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.790> abrasive

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
type song to a real kind of abrasive

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.569 
type song to a real kind of abrasive
kind<00:02:28.659> of<00:02:28.810> upbeat<00:02:29.409> punky<00:02:29.890> type<00:02:30.099> thing<00:02:30.400> it's

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
kind of upbeat punky type thing it's

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.460 
kind of upbeat punky type thing it's
great<00:02:30.790> but<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.060> still<00:02:31.359> sounds<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:31.780> blur<00:02:32.170> I

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
great but it still sounds like blur I

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.080 
great but it still sounds like blur I
think<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.829> kind<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.099> gods<00:02:33.340> were<00:02:33.459> smiling<00:02:33.640> down

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
think the kind of gods were smiling down

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.420 
think the kind of gods were smiling down
on<00:02:34.150> us<00:02:34.299> they<00:02:34.480> knew<00:02:34.900> there<00:02:35.140> had<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.290> be<00:02:35.409> at<00:02:36.159> least

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
on us they knew there had to be at least

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.220 
on us they knew there had to be at least
one<00:02:36.640> war<00:02:36.819> bro<00:02:37.060> record<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.540> was<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.659> decent<00:02:37.900> old

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
one war bro record that was a decent old

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.789 
one war bro record that was a decent old
I<00:02:38.829> think<00:02:39.159> we've<00:02:39.310> achieved<00:02:39.879> it<00:02:40.329> I<00:02:40.560> think<00:02:41.560> Damon

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
I think we've achieved it I think Damon

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.129 
I think we've achieved it I think Damon
has<00:02:42.129> this<00:02:42.310> Great<00:02:42.609> Neck<00:02:42.849> of<00:02:43.120> saying<00:02:43.750> in<00:02:43.900> very
