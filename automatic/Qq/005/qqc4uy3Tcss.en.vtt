yeah i think it's a they are they
progressing<00:01:12.220> in<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.090> beginning<00:01:13.390> was<00:01:13.510> not

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
progressing in the beginning was not

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.690 
progressing in the beginning was not
good<00:01:13.930> but<00:01:14.440> yeah<00:01:14.710> they've<00:01:15.160> been<00:01:15.190> better<00:01:15.490> in<00:01:15.640> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
good but yeah they've been better in the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.700 
good but yeah they've been better in the
last<00:01:15.850> two<00:01:16.450> minutes<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.960> we<00:01:17.110> hopefully<00:01:17.380> your

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
last two minutes and we hopefully your

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.590 
last two minutes and we hopefully your
friend<00:01:17.920> or<00:01:18.040> in<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.340> second<00:01:18.580> half<00:01:18.670> I<00:01:18.940> mean<00:01:19.330> what

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
friend or in the second half I mean what

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.030 
friend or in the second half I mean what
was<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.780> standard<00:01:20.170> light<00:01:20.380> compared<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.010> a

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
was the standard light compared to a

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.540 
was the standard light compared to a
demo<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:22.210> quite<00:01:22.630> quite<00:01:23.140> different<00:01:23.530> basis<00:01:23.890> for

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
demo is quite quite different basis for

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.060 
demo is quite quite different basis for
hosting<00:01:24.880> like<00:01:25.000> using<00:01:25.300> yeah<00:01:26.050> i<00:01:26.080> think<00:01:26.530> it<00:01:26.740> is

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
hosting like using yeah i think it is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.570 
hosting like using yeah i think it is
similar<00:01:27.670> with<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.090> famously<00:01:28.810> but<00:01:29.530> most<00:01:30.370> but

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
similar with the famously but most but

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.280 
similar with the famously but most but
this<00:01:30.670> phone<00:01:31.000> i<00:01:31.240> think<00:01:31.510> this<00:01:31.570> is<00:01:31.690> more<00:01:31.810> physical

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
this phone i think this is more physical

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.620 
this phone i think this is more physical
layer<00:01:32.410> and<00:01:32.740> then<00:01:32.950> we<00:01:33.250> try<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.460> try<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.390> play

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
layer and then we try to try to play

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.630 
layer and then we try to try to play
aluminum<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.740> guys<00:01:35.920> aren't<00:01:36.130> playing<00:01:36.280> at<00:01:36.580> the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
aluminum you guys aren't playing at the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.130 
aluminum you guys aren't playing at the
moment<00:01:36.910> are<00:01:36.940> you<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.240> you're<00:01:37.450> committing<00:01:38.050> the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
moment are you on you're committing the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.810 
moment are you on you're committing the
ranks<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.470> wind<00:01:38.710> is<00:01:38.830> all<00:01:38.950> in<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:39.130> second<00:01:39.790> half

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
ranks of wind is all in this second half

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.469 
ranks of wind is all in this second half
of<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.060> season<00:01:40.180> start<00:01:40.570> this<00:01:41.530> starts<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:43.420> the
