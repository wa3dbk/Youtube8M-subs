00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
dots so we're gonna have them do all of

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.499 
dots so we're gonna have them do all of
those<00:01:22.570> things<00:01:22.960> and<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:24.640> addition<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:25.390> that

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
those things and in addition to that

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:26.880 
those things and in addition to that
we're<00:01:26.020> gonna<00:01:26.110> have<00:01:26.350> them<00:01:26.500> do<00:01:26.649> some

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
we're gonna have them do some

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.139 
we're gonna have them do some
maintenance<00:01:27.100> on<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.580> generator<00:01:28.060> that

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
maintenance on the generator that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.669 
maintenance on the generator that
wouldn't<00:01:28.630> be<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> part<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.319> because<00:01:29.560> this

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
wouldn't be a part of this because this

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:31.770 
wouldn't be a part of this because this
is<00:01:29.740> just<00:01:29.890> for<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.310> coach<00:01:30.550> but<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.300> generator

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
is just for the coach but the generator

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.719 
is just for the coach but the generator
we<00:01:32.110> also<00:01:32.259> want<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.649> change<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.039> air<00:01:33.190> filter

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
we also want to change the air filter

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.800 
we also want to change the air filter
and<00:01:33.759> oil<00:01:34.270> on<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.170> generator<00:01:35.710> too<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.600> do

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
and oil on the generator too and and do

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.480 
and oil on the generator too and and do
some<00:01:38.049> maintenance<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.740> spark<00:01:39.039> arrestor

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
some maintenance on the spark arrestor

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.969 
some maintenance on the spark arrestor
exhaust<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.450> generator<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.799> what<00:01:41.950> I

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
exhaust on the generator and so what I

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.460 
exhaust on the generator and so what I
did<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.340> make<00:01:42.459> things<00:01:42.729> easy<00:01:43.000> for<00:01:43.119> them<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.690> also

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
did to make things easy for them I also

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.809 
did to make things easy for them I also
Choe<00:01:45.100> won<00:01:45.459> it<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.700> choose<00:01:45.909> my<00:01:46.119> own<00:01:46.149> oil<00:01:46.479> but<00:01:47.819> and

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
Choe won it to choose my own oil but and

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.149 
Choe won it to choose my own oil but and
I<00:01:49.119> like<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.630> run<00:01:49.750> synthetic<00:01:50.259> oil<00:01:50.500> in<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.890> coach

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
I like to run synthetic oil in the coach

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.380 
I like to run synthetic oil in the coach
so<00:01:51.819> I<00:01:52.350> got<00:01:53.350> this<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.890> then<00:01:54.069> we<00:01:54.700> also<00:01:54.850> have<00:01:55.209> this

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
so I got this and then we also have this

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.029 
so I got this and then we also have this
oil<00:01:55.929> for<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.560> generator<00:01:57.399> and<00:01:57.959> then<00:01:58.959> I<00:01:59.409> ordered

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
oil for the generator and then I ordered

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.249 
oil for the generator and then I ordered
the<00:02:00.220> parts<00:02:00.490> online<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.600> make<00:02:01.689> sure<00:02:01.899> we'd<00:02:02.109> have

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
the parts online to make sure we'd have

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.990 
the parts online to make sure we'd have
the<00:02:02.469> air<00:02:02.590> filter<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:03.159> oil<00:02:03.250> filter<00:02:03.729> for<00:02:03.909> the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the air filter and oil filter for the

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.779 
the air filter and oil filter for the
generator<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.689> then<00:02:04.899> I<00:02:05.020> already<00:02:05.200> had<00:02:05.530> this

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
generator and then I already had this

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.479 
generator and then I already had this
