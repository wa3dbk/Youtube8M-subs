 form of butterfly I think so 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.440

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.940

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.730
 could wish that change and that 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.140
 there are little butterflies and you can

 Butterflies fly in all colors 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.260
 and shapes and in all colors and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.329
 to form 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.710
 Today I have a good team for you 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.750
 it was so badly overpassed now 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.800
 but come it was a reconciliation though 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.770
 from the do it yourself and indeed there is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.079
 today a German 11 something more individual 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.570
 could not be because it is about 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.379
 Remember it is a memory or 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.890
 we remember those before us decorative 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.129
 want to hold on 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.690
 I am a human being the very very very on 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.030
 does not hang around in many thoughts 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.920
 former situations and enjoy that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
 just go through that again 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.689
 example my my trip to raleigh 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.100
 or whatever and I'm there 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.710
 I come up with something 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.330
 given to someone because I did not want to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.130
 08 15 make a present and I have mine 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.619
 just an empty glass gift with 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.979
 something personal from me and have her 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.229
 said that this empty glass immediately 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.360
 you should be a memorial glass 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.740
 which you take this is you 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.180
 let me have this taken that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.729
 I bought in the depot that has faith 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.960
 I cost five or six euros nicely 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.280
 with a cork you can but also one 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.290
 old glass take what you already have at home 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.759

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.070
 objects when on vacation 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.229
 It is a small stone goes for a walk 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.210
 Is it a sea shell or something 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.700
 It does not matter what it looks like 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.380
 It is important that you in this situation 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.350
 said that it is very nice and me 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.150
 would like this situation 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.310
 happy moment with you as a reminder 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.340
 home I always have a glass of life 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.750
 Here are a few things that I go to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.090
 example in this memorial glass 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.070
 wants to pack something you maybe 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.479
 not quite for everyone where everyone says well 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.950
 that is a good memory or is 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.050
 not for me is this example 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.850
 Map of the fashion week so berlin 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.690
 for a whole week, from show to show 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.100
 has brought in last summer and that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.770
 was something very special for me 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.180
 is that something in me, for example 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.180
 my personal memorial photo 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.840
 i was with a blogger friend 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.739
 Scheme on the way and we have in 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.590

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:36.680
 foto pÃ¼tz quasi like a photo strip 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.300
 definitely belongs to me 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.010
 Remembrance because to really a whole 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.200
 really great time in berlin was in my 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.580
 Reminder glass I was in front of some 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.739
 For example, years are now many 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.870
 youtube reminder a few years ago 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.519
 once invited to the opening of the first 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.930
 playboy clubs in cologne it was very 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.180
 exciting I have many great youtubers 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.500
 met and remembered this band 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.440
 I always stop this evening and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.530
 that's why this band comes in for me 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.209
 my memory glass or you can do it 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.350
 for example you can do that 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.519
 choose how it would be with for example 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.130
 a sample of what he did 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.280
 the first date what you if it is you 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.840
 always remember him then take it and 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.620
 pakistan the memorial glass is like that 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.420
 that can not be more individual 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.890
 and you close your memories there 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.720
 once and every time you look at this 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.370
 glass it comes eventually is filled with 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.799
 quite a lot of memories you know 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.609

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.890
 collect this glass and each of these 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.650
 it has its own parts in it 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.150
 history and for many it will 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.590
 maybe it is for some of you 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.090
 boring but for me that's what 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.470
 is quite nice and I thought so 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.320

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.150

 then you put the passepartout again 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.540
 on these cardboard and cardboard boxes 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.970

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.830
 I have this in the middle of this 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.330
 glued champagne corks and have that 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.300
 Date is very personal for me 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.570
 data entered and / or time were 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.010
 that was and then have the cork in the 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.240
 Of course you can glue it on the middle as well 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.870
 from behind with a zipper the 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.430
 go cork 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.530
 you do not have to stop that right away 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.450
 let it dry for a long time or you can do that 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.310
 first student of her baby from her 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.260
 child from her daughter a son den 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.760
 first student totally sweet ram 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.530
 for example, if you have one 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.350
 you have the nobler institution you can 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:22.070
 whole in noble same frame too 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.230
 Preserve and a reminder of manager 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.240
 Watching panda is then just kept so 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.650
 that's something very simple though 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.080
 I just find these simple things 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.169
 those are the most valuable in the end 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.520
 are and I think memories are like that 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.500
 especially worth your own 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.050
 memories their own moments that 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.120
 to indicate the just more space 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.130
 I would like and I would like to be very happy 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.550
 often because I remember not have the 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.960
 nothing kept or one preserves yes 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.780
 also the pacifier up and it is closed 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.320
 pity that the pacifier in the 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.970
 drawer 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.419
 not so frame expensive special 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.650

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.419

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:01.770
 is a bit take 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.150
 the whole and that should be so 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.509
