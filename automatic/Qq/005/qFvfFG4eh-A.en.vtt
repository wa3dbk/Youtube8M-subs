00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.980
 before you dare to mesh 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.440
 So stuff a hole in one 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.230
 Knitted material is important too 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.389
 know how meshes actually run like 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.820
 the thread is running and you can just 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.380
 You also do not just have to work together 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.790
 you can stretch it too 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.680
 Of course, show it like a scam like that 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.390
 looks when she stitches because the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.590
 you have to wash the stuffing 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 wash after pieces 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.650
 I show you a transparent fabric 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 because then you see that of both 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.100
 pages 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.790
 So that's the first idea 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.469
 if you get that out then you realize 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.430
 actually that it is very easy 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.180
 always back and forth from above and below 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.180
 right to left 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.590
 I have to do a few stitches now 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:22.109
 and then I turn around and do that 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.380
 next row that you can see 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.090
 how they go together and that is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.000
 then in the end also exactly how 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.509
 stuck when you then this fabric 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.329
 it would just dissolve 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:41.849
 what knitted things are left now 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.250
 I turn around because I like to stop 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.479
 right to left 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.079
 Maybe you can not do that anymore 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.079
 attract 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.790
 now I have to get out of there so that 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.450
 of course, then goes best under the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:14.540
 fabric by stuffing and now 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:18.250
 I have to do the next stitch here 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.250
 I now loop in the two 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.900
 if you now have a part to stuff 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.670
 where the stitches are still visible but 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.100
 very thin threads because they 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.670
 are sold then you can virtually so 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.740
 these threads to pieces 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:07.690
 if you know how to do it now 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:10.600
 what's going on row by row like that 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.160
 I turn now , then I go if 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.230
 I'm really down through it now 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.360
 wants to make invisible because that's the front 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.840
 here is the right side then i go 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.959
 so high and makes the next row that 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.820
 is now the next mesh separates 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:29.340
 Of course, not because they are so fixed 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.340
 is here on the transparent fabric 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.659
 that goes on below then looks 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.099
 really out really as I said 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:45.030
 not one can dissolve this material now 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.030
 then would be the left over
