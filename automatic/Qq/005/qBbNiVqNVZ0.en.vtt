at the video if you guys could take just

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.210 
at the video if you guys could take just
a<00:00:19.050> second<00:00:19.289> every<00:00:19.439> time<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.740> give<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.039> like

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
a second every time to give it a like

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.950 
a second every time to give it a like
that<00:00:20.640> would<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:20.910> amazing<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.539> anyways<00:00:21.810> let's

that would be amazing so anyways let's
get<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.350> glitch<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.279> first<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:23.670> for

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
get on to glitch so first of all for

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.160 
get on to glitch so first of all for
this<00:00:23.910> glitch<00:00:24.119> you're<00:00:24.269> gonna<00:00:24.390> get<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.840> get<00:00:24.930> any

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
this glitch you're gonna get and get any

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
this glitch you're gonna get and get any
Pegasus<00:00:25.650> vehicle<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.640> he<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> video<00:00:27.240> i

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
Pegasus vehicle so as he in the video i

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.330 
Pegasus vehicle so as he in the video i
do<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> journey<00:00:28.260> which<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.099> least

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
do have a journey which is the least

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.740 
do have a journey which is the least
expensive<00:00:29.460> car<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.510> get<00:00:30.660> from

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
expensive car that you can get from

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.049 
expensive car that you can get from
Pegasus<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.710> once<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.980> get<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> journey<00:00:32.790> or

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
Pegasus so once you get the journey or

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.760 
Pegasus so once you get the journey or
the<00:00:33.360> limo<00:00:33.690> either<00:00:33.930> one<00:00:34.170> will<00:00:34.320> work<00:00:34.380> but

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the limo either one will work but

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.260 
the limo either one will work but
obviously<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.309> prefer<00:00:35.700> getting<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> journey

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
obviously I prefer getting the journey

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.450 
obviously I prefer getting the journey
because<00:00:36.840> it's<00:00:36.989> less<00:00:37.110> expensive<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.219> once<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
because it's less expensive so once you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.709 
because it's less expensive so once you
get<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> journey<00:00:38.910> or<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> limo<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.510> want<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
get the journey or the limo you want to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:40.970 
get the journey or the limo you want to
go<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.079> want<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> drive<00:00:40.469> over<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.890> your

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
go in and you want to drive over to your

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.709 
go in and you want to drive over to your
garage<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.850> want<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> park<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.420> all<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
garage and you want to park it all the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.479 
garage and you want to park it all the
way<00:00:42.809> against<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:43.890> i'm<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.040> sure<00:00:44.309> if<00:00:44.399> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
way against it now i'm not sure if it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.400 
way against it now i'm not sure if it
works<00:00:44.670> with<00:00:44.820> every<00:00:45.090> single<00:00:45.270> garage<00:00:45.570> obviously

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
works with every single garage obviously

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.690 
works with every single garage obviously
it<00:00:46.530> does<00:00:46.649> work<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.309> has<00:00:47.430> i'm<00:00:47.550> gonna

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
it does work with this one has i'm gonna

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.160 
it does work with this one has i'm gonna
be<00:00:47.789> doing<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.210> video<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.960> i'm<00:00:49.079> not

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
be doing it in the video but i'm not

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.450 
be doing it in the video but i'm not
sure<00:00:49.350> if<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.530> works<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> less<00:00:50.160> expensive

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sure if it works with the less expensive

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
sure if it works with the less expensive
garages<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:51.510> anyways<00:00:51.780> once<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.260> this

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
garages so anyways once you get to this

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.959 
garages so anyways once you get to this
garage<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.070> park<00:00:53.370> your<00:00:53.489> journey<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
garage and you park your journey all the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.400 
garage and you park your journey all the
way<00:00:54.120> against<00:00:54.570> eight<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.020> want<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.260> go<00:00:55.350> ahead

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
way against eight you want to go ahead

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.110 
way against eight you want to go ahead
and<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.680> walk<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.969> put

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and just walk in and it's going to put

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.250 
and just walk in and it's going to put
you<00:00:57.180> through<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.480> animation<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.170> your

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
you through the animation but your

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.080 
you through the animation but your
garage<00:00:58.530> isn't<00:00:58.770> gonna<00:00:59.010> actually<00:00:59.219> open<00:00:59.730> it's

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
garage isn't gonna actually open it's

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
garage isn't gonna actually open it's
going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.390> stuck<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.960> bumper<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
going to be stuck on the bumper the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
going to be stuck on the bumper the
front<00:01:02.129> bumper<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> car<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.940> once<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> go

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
front bumper of the car and once you go

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.579 
front bumper of the car and once you go
in<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.750> garage<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.140> want<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.379> ahead<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.950 
sell so as you see i'm gonna be getting
in<00:01:08.580> this<00:01:08.640> adder<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.450> selling<00:01:09.840> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
in this adder and I'm be selling it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.570 
in this adder and I'm be selling it
because<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> most<00:01:11.040> expensive<00:01:11.189> car

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
think that car is a bit more expensive

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.050 
think that car is a bit more expensive
