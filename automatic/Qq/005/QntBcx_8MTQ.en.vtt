00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.390
 sr 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.069
 for you to get an idea on was announced 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:09.319
 in 1995 I'm not mistaken, and my face was 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.840
 more than 14 years of expensive and 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.220

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.460
 It was the biggest failure he 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:26.810
 below that bad games at that time 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.669
