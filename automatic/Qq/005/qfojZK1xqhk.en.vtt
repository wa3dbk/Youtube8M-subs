00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.030

 The rest of the manual is a cable for USB connection 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.850
 It is said that the later feather archeology is open 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.240
 A while ago 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.670
 I think that I use it in connection with this 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.530
 There was a large version of Mike 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.530

 To refer to the terminal 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:34.210
 Well I'm riding on the noise bar, but if you put on usb, then the sound quality would be better 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.870
 Well this is what comes with 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.580
 I think that it is less like a microphone, so I divided it by the price range of about 3000 yen 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:48.230
 Well amazing I Well 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.750

 Then it looks like this 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:37.720
 One of the things I need to pay attention to is this plug-in power type, so maybe direct 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.480
 I think I could not connect to an amp 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:46.130
 So let's connect to a PC 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:50.600
