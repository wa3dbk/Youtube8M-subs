00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.000
 I was interested in this for the fans 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.920
 because the bus division nearly so am I 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.540
 have found that makes me 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.920
 the reality I said that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.040
 cooperating dream job that makes you 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.820
 so just the landscape fun earlier 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.710
 to drive wonderfully with the tweets 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.400
 the story is on the 27 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.610
 only in 2011 had a person fall in the 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.610
 picture on the beard local station and this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.930
 person has unfortunately from my train 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.580
 has thrown the images were not 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.860
 out of the head it was the day 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.380
 I was relatively slow road has 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.440
 So felt eternity lasted until 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.080
 this person or unfortunately on the belly 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.060
 One has hit a completely new one 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.229
 So you feel the one stands under shop 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.479
 just be easy hands 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.649
 white the face knows you do not know 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.200
 as you yourself at the moment it is one 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.560
 Quite a curious situation and so I have to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.880
 glad that help was there very fast 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.660
 I did not like the other one expired 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 year in total of this whole ten 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.260
 Minutes lasted until the people 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.230
 arrived 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.790
 and I have the man was first 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.500
 alone 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.290
 after that I had technological 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.170
 care and friends circle of acquaintances 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.630
 as well as colleagues also something like that 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.980
 ali khan is pulling at everyone so 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.900
 different or each processed 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.250
 and also different I wanted 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.350
 actually know why he did that 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.050
 had the money problems the family had 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.180
 to expect your problems very human 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.610
 the police directorate data not from 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.930
 are you really then all to yourself 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.400
 me really long on the train 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.780
 Thrown almost over two years 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.190
 you can not fight at the moment 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.450
 drive when you take the picture automatically 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.750
 has again in mind and I am too 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.680
 for a whole time then go through 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.680
 driven through the area 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.110
 you can not really do man 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.090
 forgive 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.800
 It is a very difficult story 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.780
 actually the human has become 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.190
 killed because now he wanted 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.840
 but I did not want it so doubtful 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.580
 to continue this did not exist 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.770
 I really enjoy reading on the way 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.240
 Sometimes sometimes less than 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.300
 There are such and such days as everywhere 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.480
 but basically no, that's what I wanted 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.480
 stop
