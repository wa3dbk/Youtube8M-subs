00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
the cream a little bit before this is

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.080 
the cream a little bit before this is
added<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.409> problem<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.280> people<00:01:17.460> say<00:01:18.060> oh

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
added the problem is that people say oh

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
added the problem is that people say oh
I<00:01:18.299> can't<00:01:18.810> whip<00:01:19.110> cream<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.860> doesn't<00:01:20.280> hold<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
I can't whip cream it doesn't hold and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
I can't whip cream it doesn't hold and
it<00:01:20.850> doesn't<00:01:21.299> rip<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.869> doesn't<00:01:22.200> hold<00:01:22.350> firm

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it doesn't rip and it doesn't hold firm

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
it doesn't rip and it doesn't hold firm
is<00:01:22.979> because<00:01:23.729> they<00:01:23.880> add<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.450> flavoring<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
is because they add the flavoring and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.620 
is because they add the flavoring and
the<00:01:25.409> sugar<00:01:25.590> too<00:01:25.920> soon<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.150> we're<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the sugar too soon so we're going to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
the sugar too soon so we're going to
slip<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.500> tell<00:01:28.680> us<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.950> little

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.440 

now<00:01:48.040> this<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.460> just<00:01:48.490> starting<00:01:49.090> to<00:01:49.120> think<00:01:49.360> a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
now this is just starting to think a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.810 
now this is just starting to think a
little<00:01:49.540> bit<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.680> now<00:01:51.340> is<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.490> time<00:01:51.580> that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
little bit and now is the time that

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.290 
little bit and now is the time that
we'll<00:01:52.150> add<00:01:52.390> our<00:01:52.720> sugar<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.370> vanilla<00:01:54.370> if<00:01:54.880> you

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
add up previous to this time it will not

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:14.940 
add up previous to this time it will not
wear<00:01:58.270> thick

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.380 

just<00:02:15.950> added<00:02:16.160> three<00:02:16.489> tablespoons<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.209> sugar

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
okay see how firm that is and that would

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.110 
okay see how firm that is and that would
not<00:03:32.659> take<00:03:32.989> place<00:03:33.200> if<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:33.650> put<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.129> your<00:03:34.430> sugar
