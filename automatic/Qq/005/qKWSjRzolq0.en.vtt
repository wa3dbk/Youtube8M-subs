 touhou project 2002 under the supervision of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.770
 studio gonzo out first season 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.570
 legendary anime steel alarm 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 the anime was so popular that three 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.129
 a year later it is licensed in russia 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.620
 but unfortunately or fortunately season 2 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.629
 Gonzo did not master and work on the continuation 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.399
 instructed the almost unknown little 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.090
 kyoto studios they mishin 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.789
 founded in 1981 by the yoko couple 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.199
 Hideaki Hata previously did not miss them 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.480
 standalone titles 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.070
 while realizing how large-scale 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.170
 project floor in hand, it was decided 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.840
 divide the story into 2 seasons 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.820
 steel alarm sums which 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.040
 consisted only of fillers and was aimed 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.130
 to attract new audiences and 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.439
 steel alarm 2 where raid was clean 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.780
 history without fan service and branches 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.939
 there was undoubtedly a huge risk that from 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.159
 fillers fans just stop it 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.759
 watch but then the studio was just getting ready 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.070
 show the best she can do 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.619
 2005 appeared on the light seemingly nothing 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.439
 not convoluted series p itself not 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.009
 suspecting Kyoto raised the bar to the genre 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.710
 drama 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.590
 few what could we then cause 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.680
 as many feelings and immediately after the Air 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.140
 Season 3 steel alarm goes success 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.899
 Peyote they less not simply showed 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.649
 themselves broke off the Japanese scene 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.200
 animations 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.650
 but lower the bar even a centimeter, they 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.430
 could not afford 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.870
 some masterpieces that's what they needed 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.650
 melancholy haruhi suzumiya 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.380
 canon lucky star clannad keihin and more 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.690
 many many things gave us this 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.540
 wonderful studio is not really 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.050
 a lot but just forget how terrible 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.630
 a dream 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.210
 but now their new anime is coming out 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.660
 titled about magic diamond park 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.830
 Leon managed to live up to her nose 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.840
 did something bring in new in the ice 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.910
 boom on tacking 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.650
 but all in order and start as always 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.420
 the most painful spot 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:34.090
 The plot lived itself did not tugil himself 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.880
 it was not there that our hero was Japanese 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.980
 schoolboy but far from ordinary 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.560
 charismatic lazy narcissist with 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.890
 complex of own superiority and 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.620
 Generally wise guy handsome to her with her and all 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.500
 it would be okay for our snooker but his 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.560
 omnipresent nothing cute interrupted him 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.350
 given student and suza senta 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.360
 putting a musket to the temple and threatened 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.780
 death forced to go on a date with her 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.209
 in a brilliant park amagi immediately visible 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.310
 lover to carry a gun too 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.550
 too careless but pick up documents 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.750
 another thing after their arrival in the park they 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.160
 I certainly thought that there would be him 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.650
 cut the ass 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.110
 abandoned kiosks broken 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.930
 attractions number of visitors 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.989
 fewer of our likes for video 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.050
 Yes, and with a mountain suzuki and steel 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.450
 alarms dressed in the brain and for no reason 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.580
 attacks all but not here all 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.280
 ok well after such a presentation 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.810
 Isuzu takes a guy like husks 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.450
 which states 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.810
 this park is built by magical inhabitants 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.150
 from another country 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.640
 lives thanks to the crystals obtained from 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.580
 the joys of visitors but if during 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.099
 three months the park will not taste 250 thousand 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.200
 the man will shut him down and all the inhabitants 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.500
 will die and you are here to help us 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.180
 good luck and throughout our entire series 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.970
 hero as chief manager 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.940
 will lure people into this seedy 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.760
 places so what I want to say about them 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.250
 the plot and really stubborn but this was 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.380
 original source of the main plus of this series 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.930
 in the details about which we'll talk 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.930
 the first thing that immediately catches the eye except 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.150
 just great brand pan 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.210
 this is character to most of them 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.310
 patterns but their here is such a cloud that not 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.710
 you have time to love 1 as it appears 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.900
 the second is especially delivered by talismans 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.950
 yet by definition magical creatures 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:37.100
 seemingly cute toys and her husband are black 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.080
 ice them under 40 but pinpoint the topic 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.870
 with characters in we will not be his better 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.060
 see for yourself it's worth it and yet 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.010
 I want to pay attention to music, even though we 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.320
 and often say a few words about the musical 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.450
 if itâ€™s compulsory 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.240
 every issue but here it is so much 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.669
 gorgeous is selected that there will be an error 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.280
 not to mention sometimes it even seemed like 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.860
 play a composition from an old wound series 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.200
 and now finally the answer to the main 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.979
 question whether anime managed to justify 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:10.039
 expectations yes yes and again yes the plot is about 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.289
 moving fast 12 episodes completely yourself 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.690
 justify for watching you are not 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.430
 will be counted for each episode as 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.310
 it happens most titles 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.740
 you will just watch and relax on 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.380
 this all subscribe comment
