00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.990 

so<00:00:00.329> I<00:00:00.359> recently<00:00:00.750> did<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.260> review<00:00:01.680> of<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.190> ego-c

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
so I recently did a review of the ego-c

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.329 
so I recently did a review of the ego-c
twist<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.750> it's<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.259> great<00:00:04.529> battery<00:00:04.830> in<00:00:05.160> my

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
twist and it's a great battery in my

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.340 
twist and it's a great battery in my
opinion<00:00:05.819> it's<00:00:06.060> reliable<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.020> very

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
opinion it's reliable and very

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.980 
opinion it's reliable and very
affordable<00:00:07.710> but<00:00:08.490> today<00:00:08.970> I'm<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.630> review

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
affordable but today I'm going to review

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.160 
affordable but today I'm going to review
the<00:00:10.230> much<00:00:10.500> smaller<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.370> more<00:00:11.730> tiny<00:00:12.120> mini<00:00:12.630> ego

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the much smaller and more tiny mini ego

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.560 
the much smaller and more tiny mini ego
battery<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.950> I'm<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.549> see<00:00:14.820> how<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.240> kind<00:00:15.420> of

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
battery and I'm gonna see how it kind of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.570 
battery and I'm gonna see how it kind of
stacks<00:00:15.990> up<00:00:16.289> against<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> ego-c<00:00:17.760> twist<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> I

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
stacks up against the ego-c twist so I

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000 
stacks up against the ego-c twist so I
stumbled<00:00:23.910> across<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.720> mini<00:00:24.930> ego<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.769> while

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
stumbled across the mini ego a while

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.800 
stumbled across the mini ego a while
back<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.760> thought<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.090> would<00:00:27.210> just<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.480> cool

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
back and I thought it would just be cool

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.620 
back and I thought it would just be cool
to<00:00:28.109> add<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:28.680> collection<00:00:29.090> because<00:00:30.090> it's<00:00:30.330> so

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to add to my collection because it's so

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.850 
to add to my collection because it's so
small<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.890> discreet<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:33.059> portable<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.140> for

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
small and discreet and portable and for

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.520 
small and discreet and portable and for
only<00:00:35.100> 12<00:00:35.399> bucks<00:00:35.700> why<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.230> is

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
only 12 bucks why not and it really is

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.040 
only 12 bucks why not and it really is
quite<00:00:37.829> tiny<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.940> compare<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.780> size

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
quite tiny if I compare it to the size

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.520 
quite tiny if I compare it to the size
of<00:00:40.260> even<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> smallest<00:00:41.160> ego-c<00:00:42.090> twist<00:00:42.350> you<00:00:43.350> can

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
of even the smallest ego-c twist you can

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.100 
of even the smallest ego-c twist you can
see<00:00:43.770> just<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.730> much<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.450> size<00:00:45.750> difference

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
see just how much of a size difference

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.459 
see just how much of a size difference
there<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.030> compare<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.690> one

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
there really is if I compare it to one

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.840 
there really is if I compare it to one
of<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> larger<00:00:50.340> ones<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.280> see<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
of the larger ones you can see that

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.869 
of the larger ones you can see that
there<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.300> massive<00:00:55.020> difference<00:00:55.430> if<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.699> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
there is a massive difference if that is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
there is a massive difference if that is
so<00:00:57.270> small<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.750> when<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.199> attach<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
so small that when I attach it to a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.220 
so small that when I attach it to a
clearomizer<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.940> could<00:01:00.180> even<00:01:00.329> stealth<00:01:00.870> fight

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
clearomizer I could even stealth fight

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.190 
clearomizer I could even stealth fight
this<00:01:01.500> really<00:01:02.100> easily<00:01:05.540> what<00:01:06.540> was<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
this really easily what was that I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.510 
this really easily what was that I
didn't<00:01:07.500> see<00:01:07.650> anything

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
didn't see anything

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.340 
didn't see anything
furthermore<00:01:08.880> its<00:01:09.299> small<00:01:09.540> enough<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> fit<00:01:10.140> into

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
furthermore its small enough to fit into

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.890 
furthermore its small enough to fit into
any<00:01:10.650> pocket<00:01:11.040> or<00:01:11.549> tiny<00:01:11.880> compartment<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.840> one

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
any pocket or tiny compartment and one

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.590 
any pocket or tiny compartment and one
really<00:01:13.619> cool<00:01:13.979> idea<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.490> thought<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:15.180> how<00:01:15.390> they

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
really cool idea I thought was how they

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.620 
really cool idea I thought was how they
attached<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:17.159> bit<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> end<00:01:18.060> so

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
attached this little bit at the end so

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
attached this little bit at the end so
that<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.259> attach<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.280> any<00:01:20.790> keyring

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that you can attach this to any keyring

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.929 
that you can attach this to any keyring
or<00:01:21.869> whatever<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
or whatever so you could just have it

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.810 
or whatever so you could just have it
there<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.750> backup<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.070> case<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.790> day

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there as a backup just in case one day

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.450 
there as a backup just in case one day
your<00:01:27.390> main<00:01:27.720> battery<00:01:28.320> runs<00:01:28.590> out<00:01:28.770> too

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
your main battery runs out too

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.179 
your main battery runs out too
however<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> compare<00:01:30.720> them<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.409> ego-c

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
however when I compare them to the ego-c

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.179 
however when I compare them to the ego-c
twist<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.090> see<00:01:33.299> two<00:01:33.689> big<00:01:34.189> disadvantages

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
twist I can see two big disadvantages

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.580 
twist I can see two big disadvantages
the<00:01:35.640> first<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.900> thing<00:01:37.170> doesn't

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the first is that this thing doesn't

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.819 
the first is that this thing doesn't
have<00:01:38.009> variable<00:01:38.729> voltage<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> ego-c

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
have variable voltage so with the ego-c

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.249 
have variable voltage so with the ego-c
twist<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.939> turn<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.390> little<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:43.020> at

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
twist you can turn this little bit at

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
twist you can turn this little bit at
the<00:01:43.439> end<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.460> you<00:01:44.579> can<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the end I don't know if you can see that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.870 
the end I don't know if you can see that
but<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.869> turn<00:01:46.110> this<00:01:46.500> knob<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
but you can turn this knob so that you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.420 
but you can turn this knob so that you
can<00:01:48.060> make<00:01:48.240> your<00:01:48.540> hits<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:49.020> strong<00:01:49.500> or<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.100> weak

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
can make your hits as strong or as weak

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730 
can make your hits as strong or as weak
as<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.759> like<00:01:51.240> allowing<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> find<00:01:52.470> your

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
as you like allowing you to find your

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.520 
as you like allowing you to find your
perfect<00:01:53.070> sweet<00:01:53.759> spot<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.840> though<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
perfect sweet spot with this though you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.149 
perfect sweet spot with this though you
can't<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.369> it's<00:01:56.640> permanently<00:01:57.329> set<00:01:57.719> at

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
can't do that it's permanently set at

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.980 
can't do that it's permanently set at
3.7<00:01:59.159> volts<00:01:59.189> which<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.149> some<00:02:00.390> people<00:02:00.420> might<00:02:00.960> be

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
3.7 volts which for some people might be

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
3.7 volts which for some people might be
a<00:02:01.170> little<00:02:01.409> weak<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:02.100> too<00:02:02.340> strong

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
a little weak or too strong

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.420 
a little weak or too strong
the<00:02:03.270> second<00:02:03.780> downside<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.500> course<00:02:04.710> is<00:02:04.979> that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
the second downside of course is that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.310 
the second downside of course is that
with<00:02:05.610> such<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> small<00:02:06.180> battery<00:02:06.509> comes<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
with such a small battery comes a

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.880 
with such a small battery comes a
smaller<00:02:07.770> battery<00:02:08.550> life<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.330> this<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.890> 400

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
smaller battery life so this is a 400

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.170 
smaller battery life so this is a 400
mAh<00:02:11.069> battery<00:02:11.910> which<00:02:12.120> means<00:02:12.750> they

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
mAh battery which means they

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.130 
mAh battery which means they
you'll<00:02:13.299> get<00:02:13.510> roughly<00:02:14.260> about<00:02:14.590> four<00:02:15.519> hours

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you'll get roughly about four hours

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.349 
you'll get roughly about four hours
depending<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.319> how<00:02:17.379> hard<00:02:18.040> you've<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.760> if<00:02:19.090> we

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
depending on how hard you've a if we

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.839 
depending on how hard you've a if we
compare<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.290> ego-c<00:02:21.010> twist<00:02:21.040> then

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
compare this to the ego-c twist then

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.000 
compare this to the ego-c twist then
even<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.329> smallest<00:02:22.780> one<00:02:23.170> we're<00:02:23.530> going<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.829> get

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
even the smallest one we're going to get

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.699 
even the smallest one we're going to get
about<00:02:24.219> six<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:24.939> seven<00:02:24.969> and<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.900> largest<00:02:26.530> one

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
about six to seven and the largest one

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.770 
about six to seven and the largest one
we're<00:02:26.859> going<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.129> get<00:02:27.310> about<00:02:27.609> thirteen<00:02:28.390> so

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
we're going to get about thirteen so

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.890 
we're going to get about thirteen so
this<00:02:29.650> one<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.129> definitely<00:02:30.430> not<00:02:31.090> going<00:02:31.389> to<00:02:31.629> last

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
this one is definitely not going to last

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.770 
this one is definitely not going to last
you<00:02:32.290> all<00:02:32.530> day<00:02:32.980> or<00:02:33.370> anything<00:02:33.700> like<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.150> I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
you all day or anything like that I

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.319 
you all day or anything like that I
