of the traveler will say well these
boots<00:00:11.730> were<00:00:11.880> made<00:00:11.910> for<00:00:12.059> walking<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.660> that's

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
boots were made for walking and that's

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.060 
boots were made for walking and that's
just<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.380> they'll<00:00:13.559> do

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
just what they'll do

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.829 
just what they'll do
and<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.910> pair<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.330> chain<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.570> boots

first and the last aspect and so we'll

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.330

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
grab all this stuff and we need this

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.550 
grab all this stuff and we need this
stuff<00:01:20.549> as<00:01:20.700> well<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.299> we'll<00:01:22.229> come<00:01:22.409> back<00:01:22.530> for

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
stuff as well and we'll come back for

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890

the<00:01:22.799> ease<00:01:22.920> enchantment<00:01:23.430> books<00:01:23.689> and<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
the ease enchantment books and so to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.350 
the ease enchantment books and so to
make<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:26.070> need<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.310> put<00:01:26.520> two<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.119> our<00:01:27.210> air

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
make it we need to put two of our air

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.520 
make it we need to put two of our air
shards<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.869> guess<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.170> didn't<00:01:28.350> need<00:01:28.439> those

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
shards so I guess we didn't need those

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.260 
shards so I guess we didn't need those
Arabs<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:30.030> enchanted<00:01:30.420> fabrics<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.079> to

not good to have a ton extra but you
know<00:02:37.209> this<00:02:37.989> is<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.200> tutorial<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:39.459> so<00:02:39.640> we<00:02:39.730> go

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
know this is a tutorial and so we go

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.539 
know this is a tutorial and so we go
back<00:02:39.849> over<00:02:40.150> here<00:02:40.739> we're<00:02:41.739> missing<00:02:42.069> aqua<00:02:42.430> you

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
back over here we're missing aqua you

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.069 
back over here we're missing aqua you
must<00:02:42.730> not<00:02:42.819> have<00:02:42.909> put<00:02:43.090> enough<00:02:43.329> aqua<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.959> we're

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
must not have put enough aqua and we're

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.319 
must not have put enough aqua and we're
missing<00:02:44.410> one<00:02:44.440> aqua<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.250> bet<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.579> that<00:02:45.640> stupid

let<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.069> run<00:02:54.250> faster<00:02:54.700> than<00:02:54.730> normal<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.900> if<00:02:56.620> we

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
let you run faster than normal so if we

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.399 
let you run faster than normal so if we
put<00:02:56.890> them<00:02:57.010> on<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.430> move<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.420> little<00:02:58.569> bit<00:02:58.750> faster<00:02:58.989> I

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
put them on I move a little bit faster I

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.430 
put them on I move a little bit faster I
can<00:02:59.950> jump<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.489> decent<00:03:01.359> amount<00:03:01.510> higher<00:03:01.750> let's

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
can jump a decent amount higher let's

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.099 
can jump a decent amount higher let's
just<00:03:02.739> put<00:03:02.980> some<00:03:03.010> dirt<00:03:03.370> up<00:03:03.670> here<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.239> can<00:03:04.930> jump

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
just put some dirt up here I can jump

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.430 
just put some dirt up here I can jump
two<00:03:05.319> blocks<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:07.750> actually<00:03:07.989> jump<00:03:08.200> three

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
two blocks I can actually jump three

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.259 
two blocks I can actually jump three
blocks<00:03:08.709> without<00:03:09.519> them<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:12.340> can<00:03:12.489> jump<00:03:12.700> one

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
blocks without them we can jump one

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.159 
blocks without them we can jump one
block<00:03:14.099> that's<00:03:15.099> about<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.720> they<00:03:17.109> do

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
block that's about it and so they do

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.900 
block that's about it and so they do
help<00:03:17.470> you<00:03:17.560> jump<00:03:17.799> higher<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.160> they<00:03:18.549> do<00:03:18.609> help

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
help you jump higher and they do help

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.580 
help you jump higher and they do help
you<00:03:19.000> run<00:03:19.180> faster<00:03:19.630> so<00:03:20.019> you're<00:03:20.319> a<00:03:20.349> little<00:03:20.500> bit

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
you run faster so you're a little bit

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.789 
you run faster so you're a little bit
faster<00:03:21.150> inside<00:03:22.150> water<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:23.319> help<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.650> as

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
faster inside water they help you as

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.599 
faster inside water they help you as
well<00:03:24.720> make<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:26.129> probably<00:03:27.129> about<00:03:27.250> your<00:03:27.400> normal

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
well make you probably about your normal

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.979 
well make you probably about your normal
speed<00:03:28.000> of<00:03:28.090> Minecraft<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.569> maybe<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.810> little

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
speed of Minecraft and maybe a little

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.009 
speed of Minecraft and maybe a little
bit<00:03:29.169> slower<00:03:29.319> but<00:03:29.680> it's<00:03:30.430> definitely<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:31.299> lot

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
bit slower but it's definitely a lot

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.780 
bit slower but it's definitely a lot
faster<00:03:32.650> than<00:03:32.680> without<00:03:33.069> them<00:03:33.489> on

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
faster than without them on

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.309 
faster than without them on
I'm<00:03:34.209> your<00:03:34.389> normal<00:03:34.690> speed<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:34.959> Minecraft

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
I'm your normal speed of Minecraft

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.960 
I'm your normal speed of Minecraft
walking<00:03:35.859> on<00:03:35.950> regular<00:03:36.280> land<00:03:36.489> I<00:03:36.639> mean

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
walking on regular land I mean

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.069 
walking on regular land I mean
and<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.319> put<00:03:38.739> them<00:03:38.829> back<00:03:38.980> on<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:40.019> now<00:03:41.019> you

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
and so but put them back on and now you

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.270 
and so but put them back on and now you
can<00:03:41.349> see<00:03:41.530> we're<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.680> little<00:03:41.739> bit<00:03:41.949> faster

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
can see we're a little bit faster

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.420 
can see we're a little bit faster
already<00:03:42.480> jump<00:03:43.480> jumps<00:03:44.349> a<00:03:44.440> lot<00:03:44.560> higher<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:45.250> can

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
already jump jumps a lot higher you can

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.339 
already jump jumps a lot higher you can
fall<00:03:46.120> without<00:03:46.389> taking<00:03:46.690> any<00:03:46.780> fall<00:03:46.989> damage

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
fall without taking any fall damage

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.470 
of float in the air a little bit at
least<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.550> feels<00:05:12.760> like<00:05:13.030> it's<00:05:13.180> quicker<00:05:13.390> than

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.010 
least it feels like it's quicker than
just<00:05:13.750> a<00:05:13.870> run<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:15.420> these<00:05:16.420> are<00:05:16.660> really

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.900 
you can definitely just reverse it like
it's<00:05:32.080> a<00:05:32.140> no<00:05:32.260> big<00:05:32.470> deal<00:05:32.710> don't<00:05:33.340> even<00:05:33.550> go<00:05:33.640> to<00:05:33.700> hold

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
it's a no big deal don't even go to hold

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.910 
it's a no big deal don't even go to hold
in<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.120> jump<00:05:34.420> button<00:05:34.630> just<00:05:35.290> walking<00:05:35.650> around

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
in the jump button just walking around

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.510 
in the jump button just walking around
walking<00:05:36.670> over<00:05:37.030> everything<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.920> so<00:05:38.920> these

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
walking over everything and so these

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.770 
walking over everything and so these
definitely<00:05:39.910> are<00:05:39.970> my<00:05:40.180> boots<00:05:40.420> of<00:05:40.570> choice

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
definitely are my boots of choice

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.090 
definitely are my boots of choice
whenever<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.200> do<00:05:41.290> play<00:05:41.560> feed<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:41.890> beast

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
whenever I do play feed the beast

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.950 
whenever I do play feed the beast
because<00:05:42.670> you<00:05:42.880> can<00:05:43.030> just<00:05:43.180> walk<00:05:43.450> really<00:05:43.810> just

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
because you can just walk really just

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.240 
because you can just walk really just
over<00:05:44.140> anything<00:05:44.620> you<00:05:44.740> don't<00:05:44.800> have<00:05:44.920> to<00:05:45.010> worry

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
over anything you don't have to worry

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.060 
over anything you don't have to worry
about<00:05:45.400> jumping<00:05:46.110> as<00:05:47.110> long<00:05:47.290> as<00:05:47.410> your<00:05:47.530> terrain<00:05:47.830> is

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
about jumping as long as your terrain is

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.580 
about jumping as long as your terrain is
mostly<00:05:48.310> just<00:05:48.820> one<00:05:49.060> block<00:05:49.300> high<00:05:49.540> if<00:05:50.440> you're

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
mostly just one block high if you're

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.500 
mostly just one block high if you're
like<00:05:51.040> scaling<00:05:51.370> a<00:05:51.550> mount<00:05:51.730> and<00:05:51.820> obviously<00:05:52.210> the

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
like scaling a mount and obviously the

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.540 
like scaling a mount and obviously the
jumping<00:05:52.840> will<00:05:52.960> come<00:05:53.170> in<00:05:53.290> handy<00:05:53.440> but<00:05:54.370> just

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
jumping will come in handy but just

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.340 
jumping will come in handy but just
walking<00:05:54.670> around<00:05:55.120> like<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:55.480> perfectly<00:05:56.170> fine

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
walking around like this perfectly fine

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.620 
walking around like this perfectly fine
and<00:05:56.770> like<00:05:57.340> I<00:05:57.430> said<00:05:57.490> they<00:05:57.730> are<00:05:57.760> my<00:05:58.120> boots<00:05:58.420> of

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
and like I said they are my boots of

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.210 
and like I said they are my boots of
choice<00:05:58.870> whenever<00:05:59.200> I<00:05:59.380> am<00:05:59.560> playing<00:05:59.830> feed<00:06:00.100> the

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:00.220 
choice whenever I am playing feed the

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.770 
choice whenever I am playing feed the
beast<00:06:00.460> or<00:06:00.700> any<00:06:00.880> other<00:06:01.000> modded<00:06:01.360> version<00:06:01.390> of

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
beast or any other modded version of

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.590 
beast or any other modded version of
Minecraft<00:06:02.440> that<00:06:02.680> includes<00:06:03.220> thaumcraft<00:06:03.670> and

Minecraft that includes thaumcraft and

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.530 
Minecraft that includes thaumcraft and
