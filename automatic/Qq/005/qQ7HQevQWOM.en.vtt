00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
it's came just like this when I was

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.910 
it's came just like this when I was
young<00:00:36.219> I<00:00:36.520> was<00:00:36.809> really<00:00:37.809> a<00:00:37.840> big<00:00:38.110> fan<00:00:38.350> of<00:00:38.379> football

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
I was used to play but I think that I

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.500 
I was used to play but I think that I
was<00:00:40.870> not<00:00:41.079> so<00:00:41.320> good<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:42.219> be<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.640> big<00:00:43.030> player<00:00:43.239> and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
was not so good to be a big player and

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.990 
was not so good to be a big player and
at<00:00:44.140> that<00:00:44.320> time<00:00:44.530> also<00:00:44.770> it<00:00:45.100> was<00:00:45.280> very<00:00:45.430> important

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
at that time also it was very important

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.920
