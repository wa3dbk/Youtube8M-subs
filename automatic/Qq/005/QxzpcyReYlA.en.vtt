00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
because this was originally a midweek

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
attack and we do end up defending pretty

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.949 
attack and we do end up defending pretty
well<00:03:13.769> meketa<00:03:14.190> columbusoh<00:03:15.000> Lozano<00:03:15.329> and<00:03:15.540> he

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
well meketa columbusoh Lozano and he

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.020 
well meketa columbusoh Lozano and he
does<00:03:16.170> end<00:03:16.349> up<00:03:16.470> scoring<00:03:16.829> poor<00:03:17.220> goalkeeping<00:03:17.579> in

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
does end up scoring poor goalkeeping in

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.550 
does end up scoring poor goalkeeping in
my<00:03:18.209> opinion<00:03:18.540> we<00:03:18.780> played<00:03:19.019> really<00:03:19.349> well

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
my opinion we played really well

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.069 
my opinion we played really well
actually<00:03:20.310> good<00:03:20.819> passing<00:03:21.359> play<00:03:21.599> to<00:03:21.659> actually

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
actually good passing play to actually

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.080 
actually good passing play to actually
gain<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.440> position<00:03:22.950> but<00:03:23.129> in<00:03:23.849> my<00:03:24.000> opinion

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
gain that position but in my opinion
