when I get a chance to get a quick kill

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.370 
when I get a chance to get a quick kill
the<00:01:08.640> knife<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> one-hit<00:01:09.420> kill<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.200> it's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the knife is a one-hit kill so it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.219 
the knife is a one-hit kill so it's
always<00:01:10.650> nice<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.420> other<00:01:12.540> thing<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
always nice to have the other thing is

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.760 
always nice to have the other thing is
to<00:01:13.680> try<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.130> find<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.460> deagle<00:01:15.170> most<00:01:16.170> maps<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to try and find a deagle most maps I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
to try and find a deagle most maps I
think<00:01:16.979> most<00:01:17.130> servers<00:01:17.340> rather<00:01:17.670> are<00:01:18.000> one-hit

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
think most servers rather are one-hit

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
think most servers rather are one-hit
headshot<00:01:19.380> kills<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> details<00:01:21.240> are<00:01:21.330> nice

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
headshot kills so the details are nice

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
headshot kills so the details are nice
to<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.840> because<00:01:22.290> all<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.430> got<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.700> is

to have because all you got to do is

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.100 
to have because all you got to do is
just<00:01:23.909> aim<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> head<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.930> into

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
just aim for the head when you get into

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
just aim for the head when you get into
a<00:01:25.140> shootout<00:01:26.299> and<00:01:27.299> other<00:01:27.540> than<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.549> depending

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
on whether it's a smaller big map

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.020 
on whether it's a smaller big map
