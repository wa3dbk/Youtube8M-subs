00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
what the trick is I think there's

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.580 
what the trick is I think there's
something<00:01:27.570> there<00:01:27.659> head<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.140> there<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
something there head so there you go you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
something there head so there you go you
pull<00:01:29.369> their<00:01:29.460> head<00:01:29.579> low<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.060> they<00:01:30.479> spring<00:01:30.750> up

pull their head low and they spring up

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:31.850 
pull their head low and they spring up
so<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.140> sort<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.290> sprung<00:01:31.500> loads<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
so it sort of sprung loads of

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.010 
so it sort of sprung loads of
transformations<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> work<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.900> app

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
transformations so you work in the app

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990 
transformations so you work in the app
so<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.470> bring<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> new<00:01:35.040> character<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.579> tiny

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
quite new to us well um transformers

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.569 
quite new to us well um transformers
well<00:02:20.900> known<00:02:21.170> for<00:02:21.709> some<00:02:22.099> people<00:02:22.370> saying

well known for some people saying

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.250 
well known for some people saying
they're<00:02:22.730> too<00:02:22.849> hard<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.150> transform<00:02:23.450> there

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
they're too hard to transform there

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.569 
they're too hard to transform there
there's<00:02:24.440> so<00:02:24.620> many<00:02:24.739> transformers<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.370> people

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:25.579 
there's so many transformers that people

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.160 
there's so many transformers that people
have<00:02:25.670> bought<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:26.120> they<00:02:26.239> buy<00:02:26.540> for<00:02:26.599> young<00:02:26.930> kid

younger<00:02:27.590> kids<00:02:27.799> the<00:02:28.400> children<00:02:28.760> find<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.060> hard

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
younger kids the children find it hard

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.000 
younger kids the children find it hard
harder<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.780> actually<00:02:30.110> transform<00:02:30.560> this<00:02:30.709> way<00:02:30.829> so

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
harder to actually transform this way so

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.250 
harder to actually transform this way so
one<00:02:31.430> plus<00:02:32.090> side<00:02:32.360> from<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.750> straightaway

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
one plus side from this straightaway

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.800 
one plus side from this straightaway
that<00:02:33.500> amazing<00:02:34.010> is<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.610> ease<00:02:34.790> of<00:02:34.819> transforming

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
that amazing is the ease of transforming

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.059 
that amazing is the ease of transforming
once<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.110> once<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:36.440> get<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.680> knack<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:36.980> you

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
once you once you get the knack and you

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.190 
once you once you get the knack and you
pull<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.459> head<00:02:37.670> there<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:37.970> go<00:02:38.090> look<00:02:38.959> at<00:02:39.049> that

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
pull that head there you go look at that

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.020 
pull that head there you go look at that
you<00:02:39.769> from<00:02:40.519> car<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.959> robot<00:02:42.769> in<00:02:42.950> like<00:02:43.190> matter<00:02:43.849> of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
you from car to robot in like matter of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.330 
you from car to robot in like matter of
half<00:02:44.569> a<00:02:44.690> second<00:02:45.049> and<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.799> a<00:02:45.829> plus<00:02:46.100> side

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
half a second and that is a plus side

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.780 
half a second and that is a plus side
because<00:02:47.109> younger<00:02:48.109> children<00:02:48.440> need<00:02:49.250> that<00:02:49.489> ease

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
because younger children need that ease

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.610 
because younger children need that ease
and<00:02:50.180> even<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.600> older<00:02:50.840> kids<00:02:51.019> who<00:02:51.139> want<00:02:51.350> to<00:02:51.410> just

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
and even the older kids who want to just

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.770 
and even the older kids who want to just
transform<00:02:52.010> quick<00:02:52.480> maybe<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.750> even

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
transform quick maybe that even

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.830 
transform quick maybe that even
transformation<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.130> that<00:02:55.450> first<00:02:56.450> off<00:02:56.690> is

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
transformation so that first off is

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.180 
transformation so that first off is
really<00:02:57.019> really<00:02:57.290> good<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.560> transformers<00:02:58.069> have

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
really really good and transformers have

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.520 
really really good and transformers have
been<00:02:58.310> been<00:02:58.760> doing<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.239> recently<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.260> year

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530
