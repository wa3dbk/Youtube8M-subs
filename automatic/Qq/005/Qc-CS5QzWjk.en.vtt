I awoke on this video in this video we

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.180 
I awoke on this video in this video we
take<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.240> look<00:00:03.389> of<00:00:03.689> an<00:00:03.959> alternative<00:00:04.319> to<00:00:04.830> windows

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
take a look of an alternative to windows

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.789 
take a look of an alternative to windows
task<00:00:05.520> manager<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:06.240> called<00:00:06.629> d<00:00:06.899> task<00:00:07.350> manager

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
task manager is called d task manager

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.040 
task manager is called d task manager
and<00:00:08.309> this<00:00:08.460> has<00:00:08.610> been<00:00:08.760> recommended<00:00:09.090> by<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.750> full

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
and this has been recommended by a full

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
remember I've had a chance to use it yet

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.490 
remember I've had a chance to use it yet
so<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.780> first<00:00:12.990> time<00:00:13.170> I'm<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.410> to

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
so this is the first time I'm going to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
some look where we can get it from we

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.700 
some look where we can get it from we
can<00:00:18.210> get<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.449> from<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.750> website<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.439> will

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
down a bit so about frequent and you

down a bit so about frequent and you
will<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.619> task<00:00:28.920> manager<00:00:29.269> okay<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.330> it

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
will see the task manager okay so it

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.450 
will see the task manager okay so it
says<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.109> works<00:00:31.289> with<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.980> Windows<00:00:32.250> Vista

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
says it works with up to Windows Vista

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.920 
says it works with up to Windows Vista
we're<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> be<00:00:33.360> trying<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> on

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
we're going to be trying to do it on

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.020 
we're going to be trying to do it on
windows<00:00:34.140> 7<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:35.250> if<00:00:35.309> there's<00:00:35.489> any<00:00:35.640> problems

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
windows 7 see if there's any problems

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
windows 7 see if there's any problems
it's<00:00:36.690> only<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.960> hundred<00:00:37.110> kb<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.950> let's<00:00:38.160> have<00:00:38.280> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
it's only a hundred kb so let's have a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700 
it's only a hundred kb so let's have a
little<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.579> at<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.850> program<00:00:39.210> itself<00:00:39.710> so

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
little look at the program itself so

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.500 
little look at the program itself so
i've<00:00:40.890> already<00:00:41.070> downloaded<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:41.910> here<00:00:42.420> it

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
i've already downloaded it and here it

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600 
i've already downloaded it and here it
is<00:00:42.660> here<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.260> click<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> they're<00:00:44.190> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
is here just click on that they're so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.100 
is here just click on that they're so
tiny<00:00:44.820> little<00:00:45.090> program<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:45.960> see

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
tiny little program as you can see

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
tiny little program as you can see
pretty<00:00:46.829> much<00:00:46.950> similar<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.489> windows<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pretty much similar to windows but it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.020 
pretty much similar to windows but it's
got<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> few<00:00:48.950> others<00:00:49.950> other<00:00:50.430> things<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.000> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
got a few others other things on it that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.600 
got a few others other things on it that
you<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.840> windows<00:00:52.199> doesn't<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.829> so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
you can do that windows doesn't do so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
you can do that windows doesn't do so
let's<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> little<00:00:54.149> comparison<00:00:55.079> let's

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
let's have a little comparison let's

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.040 
let's have a little comparison let's
open<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.280> windows<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.570> we've<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.960> an

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
open up windows that we've got an

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.830 
open up windows that we've got an
applications<00:00:58.680> tab<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.820> same<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
applications tab here the same as this

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.709 
applications tab here the same as this
one<00:01:01.050> also<00:01:01.590> processes<00:01:02.219> services<00:01:02.940> performance

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
one also processes services performance

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.740 
one also processes services performance
networking<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> users<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.270> we<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> on

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
networking in users and we have it on

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.990 
networking in users and we have it on
this<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.260> well<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.770> have<00:01:07.890> ports<00:01:08.310> user

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
this one as well but we have ports user

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.790 
this one as well but we have ports user
modules<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.720> kernel<00:01:10.580> modules

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
modules and kernel modules

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.040 
modules and kernel modules
so<00:01:13.760> let's<00:01:13.940> have<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.090> little<00:01:14.210> look<00:01:14.330> so<00:01:14.750> there<00:01:14.900> are

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
so let's have a little look so there are

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.440 
so let's have a little look so there are
applications<00:01:15.260> are<00:01:15.920> running<00:01:16.070> it<00:01:17.060> shows<00:01:17.300> you

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
applications are running it shows you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.480 
applications are running it shows you
what's<00:01:17.630> running<00:01:17.840> in<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.110> background<00:01:18.490> also

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
what's running in the background also

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.030 
what's running in the background also
processes<00:01:20.000> as<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:20.840> said<00:01:21.080> being<00:01:21.320> come<00:01:21.560> down<00:01:21.800> here

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
processes as I said being come down here

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.650 
processes as I said being come down here
centipede<00:01:22.610> numbers<00:01:23.060> which<00:01:23.270> are<00:01:23.390> very<00:01:23.570> useful

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
centipede numbers which are very useful

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.120 
centipede numbers which are very useful
so<00:01:26.660> we<00:01:26.780> can<00:01:26.930> right<00:01:27.140> click<00:01:27.170> here<00:01:27.560> and<00:01:27.770> what<00:01:28.010> we

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
so we can right click here and what we

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.880 
so we can right click here and what we
got<00:01:28.280> on<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:28.610> right<00:01:28.790> click<00:01:29.030> menu<00:01:29.530> as<00:01:30.530> you<00:01:30.770> can

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
got on the right click menu as you can

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.700 
got on the right click menu as you can
see<00:01:31.010> we've<00:01:31.160> got<00:01:31.190> find<00:01:31.880> target<00:01:32.720> file<00:01:32.960> set

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
see we've got find target file set

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.640 
see we've got find target file set
priority<00:01:34.310> real-time<00:01:35.090> higher<00:01:35.600> normal<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.440> so

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
priority real-time higher normal and so

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.550

on and so on also trim Ram uses i dunno
what<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:40.010> at<00:01:40.160> the<00:01:40.250> moment<00:01:40.430> but<00:01:40.700> it's

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
what that is at the moment but it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.150 
what that is at the moment but it's
obviously<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.420> probably<00:01:41.900> take<00:01:42.110> them<00:01:42.560> trim<00:01:43.130> the

obviously to probably take them trim the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.840 
obviously to probably take them trim the
RAM<00:01:43.520> usage<00:01:43.760> for<00:01:44.150> that<00:01:44.360> process<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.810> down<00:01:45.850> I've

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
RAM usage for that process is down I've

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.620 
RAM usage for that process is down I've
also<00:01:47.030> got<00:01:47.390> trimmed<00:01:47.690> ram<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.530> all<00:01:48.740> processes

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
also got trimmed ram to all processes

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.560 
also got trimmed ram to all processes
we've<00:01:50.630> also<00:01:50.810> got<00:01:51.110> reveal<00:01:51.440> all<00:01:51.710> windows

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
we've also got reveal all windows

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.740 
we've also got reveal all windows
suspend<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:54.070> resume<00:01:55.120> which<00:01:56.120> is<00:01:56.300> quite<00:01:56.540> useful

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
suspend and resume which is quite useful

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.440 
suspend and resume which is quite useful
and<00:01:57.170> also<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.980> process<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:58.730> process<00:01:59.150> trade

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
and also in process in process trade

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.540 
and also in process in process trade
quick<00:01:59.750> process<00:02:00.170> quick<00:02:00.470> process<00:02:00.890> three<00:02:01.250> and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
quick process quick process three and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.090 
quick process quick process three and
also<00:02:01.970> kill<00:02:02.270> process<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.050> kill<00:02:03.320> process<00:02:03.830> tree

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
also kill process and kill process tree

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.970 
also kill process and kill process tree
so<00:02:05.090> that's<00:02:05.360> on<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.720> right<00:02:05.930> click<00:02:06.140> context

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
so that's on the right click context

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.310 
so that's on the right click context
menu<00:02:07.310> we've<00:02:08.270> also<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.660> sometimes<00:02:09.080> they're

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
menu we've also got sometimes they're

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.290 
menu we've also got sometimes they're
near<00:02:09.500> same<00:02:09.800> free<00:02:10.100> suspend<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.240> so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
near same free suspend and so on and so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.590 
near same free suspend and so on and so
on<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:12.680> let's<00:02:13.130> have<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.370> little<00:02:13.580> look<00:02:13.730> what<00:02:14.450> else

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
on so let's have a little look what else

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.900 
on so let's have a little look what else
this<00:02:14.870> does<00:02:15.140> other<00:02:15.440> than<00:02:15.650> what<00:02:15.830> Windows<00:02:16.250> one

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
this does other than what Windows one

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.580 
this does other than what Windows one
does<00:02:17.150> as<00:02:17.330> well<00:02:17.510> well<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.200> got<00:02:18.350> three

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
does as well well it's got three

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.590 
does as well well it's got three
different<00:02:18.620> ways<00:02:19.190> of<00:02:19.489> closing<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:20.030> processes

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
different ways of closing of processes

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.810 
different ways of closing of processes
and<00:02:20.780> said<00:02:20.959> there<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.440> got<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.890> termination

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
and said there is got a termination

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.960 
and said there is got a termination
request<00:02:24.010> which<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.310> standard<00:02:25.550> way<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
request which is the standard way of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.000 
request which is the standard way of
doing<00:02:26.330> things<00:02:26.510> it's<00:02:27.110> also<00:02:27.320> got<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.620> forced

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
doing things it's also got a forced

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.000 
doing things it's also got a forced
termination<00:02:28.220> which<00:02:29.209> is<00:02:29.450> with<00:02:30.020> dialogue

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
termination which is with dialogue

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.250 
termination which is with dialogue
tolerance<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.790> has<00:02:32.330> also<00:02:32.540> got<00:02:32.840> a<00:02:32.870> forced

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
tolerance and has also got a forced

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.740 
tolerance and has also got a forced
tolerant<00:02:33.620> termination<00:02:34.489> of<00:02:34.640> any<00:02:35.360> type<00:02:35.720> of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
tolerant termination of any type of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.350 
tolerant termination of any type of
process<00:02:36.470> by<00:02:36.680> passing<00:02:37.160> all<00:02:37.280> permissions<00:02:37.790> it

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
process by passing all permissions it

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.560 
process by passing all permissions it
can<00:02:38.540> also<00:02:39.730> terminate<00:02:40.730> running<00:02:41.090> processes

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
can also terminate running processes

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.010 
can also terminate running processes
system<00:02:42.260> processes

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
system processes

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.440 
system processes
it<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.680> also<00:02:44.740> suspend<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.760> reactivate<00:02:46.420> your

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
it can also suspend and reactivate your

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.660 
it can also suspend and reactivate your
process<00:02:46.960> as<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.560> can<00:02:47.770> do<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.130> Linux<00:02:48.520> as

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
process as you can do that in Linux as

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.240 
process as you can do that in Linux as
well<00:02:48.930> so<00:02:49.930> that's<00:02:50.050> pretty<00:02:50.380> much<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.890> also

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
well so that's pretty much and also

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.600 
well so that's pretty much and also
another<00:02:51.970> thing<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:52.540> do<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.990> block<00:02:53.680> the

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
another thing you can do is block the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.550 
another thing you can do is block the
leading<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.120> processes<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.020> can<00:02:56.230> i<00:02:56.320> light

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
leading of processes so you can i light

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.920 
leading of processes so you can i light
the<00:02:56.830> whole<00:02:57.010> lot<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.310> them<00:02:57.430> there<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.930> delete

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
the whole lot of them there and delete

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.760 
the whole lot of them there and delete
the<00:02:59.200> whole<00:02:59.350> lot<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.710> one<00:02:59.920> fell<00:03:00.130> swoop<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:01.090> end

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
the whole lot in one fell swoop or end

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.470 
the whole lot in one fell swoop or end
process<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:02.920> should<00:03:03.100> say<00:03:03.220> not<00:03:03.250> delete<00:03:03.730> should

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
process I should say not delete should

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.930 
process I should say not delete should
say<00:03:04.660> kill<00:03:05.410> process<00:03:05.860> or<00:03:06.070> in<00:03:06.250> process<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.880> it

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
say kill process or in process and it

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.340 
say kill process or in process and it
will<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.150> em<00:03:07.240> all<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.510> one<00:03:07.720> fell<00:03:07.750> swoop<00:03:07.960> which

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
will do em all in one fell swoop which

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.710 
will do em all in one fell swoop which
is<00:03:08.470> quite<00:03:08.650> useful<00:03:08.860> for<00:03:09.280> viruses<00:03:10.210> get<00:03:10.540> rid<00:03:10.690> of

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
is quite useful for viruses get rid of

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.150 
is quite useful for viruses get rid of
viruses<00:03:11.170> if<00:03:11.350> they're<00:03:11.500> all<00:03:11.620> running<00:03:11.800> there

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
viruses if they're all running there

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.960 
viruses if they're all running there
okay<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:15.280> let's<00:03:15.430> have<00:03:15.490> a<00:03:15.550> look<00:03:15.610> at<00:03:15.820> the

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
okay so let's have a look at the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.180 
okay so let's have a look at the
performance<00:03:16.510> tab<00:03:16.990> as<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:17.650> can<00:03:17.740> see<00:03:17.890> it's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
performance tab as you can see it's

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.760 
performance tab as you can see it's
saying<00:03:18.490> hi<00:03:18.760> cpu<00:03:19.540> usage<00:03:19.720> there<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.590> not

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
saying hi cpu usage there this is not

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.140 
saying hi cpu usage there this is not
real<00:03:21.010> I<00:03:21.220> don't<00:03:21.490> know<00:03:21.550> what's<00:03:21.700> happened<00:03:22.030> there

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
real I don't know what's happened there

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.550 
real I don't know what's happened there
maybe<00:03:22.360> it's<00:03:22.570> because<00:03:22.660> it's<00:03:22.900> windows<00:03:23.200> seven

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
maybe it's because it's windows seven

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.620 
maybe it's because it's windows seven
but<00:03:24.070> thats<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.550> its<00:03:24.730> use<00:03:24.910> in<00:03:25.090> hundred<00:03:25.360> percent

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
but thats and its use in hundred percent

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.580 
but thats and its use in hundred percent
when<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.020> not<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.950> we've<00:03:27.880> also<00:03:28.060> got<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:29.500> has

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
when it's not so we've also got that has

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.680 
when it's not so we've also got that has
pretty<00:03:29.770> much<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:29.980> same<00:03:30.580> as<00:03:30.820> Windows<00:03:31.420> one

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
pretty much the same as Windows one

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.200 
pretty much the same as Windows one
really<00:03:31.990> also<00:03:32.680> got<00:03:32.860> ports<00:03:33.190> which<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.910> showing

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
really also got ports which is showing

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.810 
really also got ports which is showing
you<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.420> pulse<00:03:34.830> which<00:03:35.830> the<00:03:36.040> machine<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.460> using

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
you the pulse which the machine is using

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.630 
you the pulse which the machine is using
and<00:03:36.940> also<00:03:37.810> we<00:03:38.050> have<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> local<00:03:38.800> pool<00:03:39.130> there<00:03:39.430> and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
and also we have a local pool there and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.750 
and also we have a local pool there and
remote<00:03:40.000> IP<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.900> remote<00:03:41.380> pool<00:03:41.590> protocol<00:03:42.490> and

so<00:03:43.150> on<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.390> so<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:43.860> okay<00:03:44.860> if<00:03:45.070> we<00:03:45.940> might<00:03:46.150> click

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
so on and so on okay if we might click

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.130 
so on and so on okay if we might click
on<00:03:46.510> some<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.810> these<00:03:47.910> now<00:03:48.910> as<00:03:49.240> you<00:03:49.270> can<00:03:49.480> see<00:03:49.540> find

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
on some of these now as you can see find

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.530 
on some of these now as you can see find
a<00:03:50.320> target<00:03:50.770> file<00:03:50.980> if<00:03:51.250> we<00:03:51.640> go<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:51.850> there<00:03:52.150> or<00:03:52.300> go<00:03:52.480> to

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
a target file if we go to there or go to

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.449 
a target file if we go to there or go to
process<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.410> should<00:03:53.860> take<00:03:54.070> us<00:03:54.100> to<00:03:54.430> that

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
process it should take us to that

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.949 
process it should take us to that
location<00:03:55.440> okay<00:03:56.440> so<00:03:57.220> if<00:03:57.520> we<00:03:57.820> right<00:03:58.600> click<00:03:58.630> on

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
location okay so if we right click on

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.650 
location okay so if we right click on
this<00:03:59.170> and<00:03:59.380> find<00:03:59.860> target<00:04:00.310> file<00:04:00.550> it<00:04:01.180> will<00:04:01.360> take

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
this and find target file it will take

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.960 
this and find target file it will take
us<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.990> that<00:04:02.020> target<00:04:02.350> for<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.890> should<00:04:03.160> do<00:04:03.370> but

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
us to that target for it should do but

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.790 
us to that target for it should do but
it's<00:04:04.150> not<00:04:04.330> doing<00:04:04.600> that<00:04:04.630> for<00:04:04.870> some<00:04:05.020> reason<00:04:05.050> I'm

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
it's not doing that for some reason I'm

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.240 
it's not doing that for some reason I'm
not<00:04:05.860> sure<00:04:06.190> why<00:04:06.690> okay<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:07.750> we've<00:04:08.200> got<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.800> kill

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
not sure why okay so we've got a kill

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.880 
not sure why okay so we've got a kill
task<00:04:09.520> override<00:04:10.090> which<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.020> down<00:04:11.260> here<00:04:11.290> as<00:04:11.709> well

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
task override which is down here as well

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.830 
task override which is down here as well
we've<00:04:12.430> got<00:04:12.580> these<00:04:12.760> handy<00:04:13.150> little<00:04:13.270> buttons<00:04:13.750> of

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
we've got these handy little buttons of

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.740 
we've got these handy little buttons of
the<00:04:13.930> bomb<00:04:14.490> okay

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
the bomb okay

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.050 
the bomb okay
this<00:04:17.320> is<00:04:17.500> just<00:04:17.680> taking<00:04:17.950> me<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.609> window<00:04:18.880> is

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
this is just taking me to this window is

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.420 
this is just taking me to this window is
not<00:04:19.329> taken<00:04:19.690> into<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.959> actual<00:04:20.260> file<00:04:21.100> that<00:04:21.400> I

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
not taken into the actual file that I

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.400 
not taken into the actual file that I
wanted<00:04:21.850> that<00:04:22.060> program<00:04:22.540> to<00:04:22.690> use<00:04:22.750> which<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.230> does

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
wanted that program to use which it does

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.140 
wanted that program to use which it does
in<00:04:23.560> Windows<00:04:23.920> I<00:04:24.130> wonder<00:04:24.430> if<00:04:24.490> that's<00:04:24.700> it<00:04:24.880> will

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
in Windows I wonder if that's it will

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.150 
in Windows I wonder if that's it will
fall<00:04:25.750> with<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.900> program<00:04:26.380> left<00:04:26.770> have<00:04:26.920> a<00:04:26.980> little

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
fall with the program left have a little

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.550 
fall with the program left have a little
look<00:04:27.310> at<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:28.420> we<00:04:28.480> also<00:04:28.630> got<00:04:28.900> network<00:04:29.320> in

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
look at that so we also got network in

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.140 
look at that so we also got network in
there<00:04:29.770> this<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.270> basically<00:04:31.270> monitor<00:04:31.840> your

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
there this is basically monitor your

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.650 
there this is basically monitor your
networking<00:04:35.370> bandwidth<00:04:36.370> usage<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.480> just

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
networking bandwidth usage so you just

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.480 
networking bandwidth usage so you just
pick<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.080> card<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.470> you're<00:04:38.740> using<00:04:38.950> so<00:04:39.340> for

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
pick the card that you're using so for

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.550 
pick the card that you're using so for
instance<00:04:39.550> that's<00:04:40.000> my<00:04:40.150> network<00:04:40.510> card<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:41.350> just

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
instance that's my network card you just

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.430 
instance that's my network card you just
click<00:04:41.740> on<00:04:41.860> that<00:04:41.920> and<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:43.510> will<00:04:43.570> show<00:04:43.900> you<00:04:43.960> how

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
click on that and it will show you how

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.110 
click on that and it will show you how
much<00:04:44.680> bandwidth<00:04:45.070> you're<00:04:45.310> using<00:04:45.580> so<00:04:45.940> if<00:04:46.000> you're

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
much bandwidth you're using so if you're

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.460 
much bandwidth you're using so if you're
streaming<00:04:46.390> down<00:04:46.600> you'll<00:04:46.810> see<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.110> bandwidth

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
streaming down you'll see the bandwidth

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.620 
streaming down you'll see the bandwidth
monitor<00:04:47.680> going<00:04:48.100> up<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.370> down<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.820> your<00:04:49.480> left

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
monitor going up and down and your left

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.260 
monitor going up and down and your left
bandwidth<00:04:50.020> history<00:04:50.440> ok<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.280> let's<00:04:52.060> have<00:04:52.240> a

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
bandwidth history ok so let's have a

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.090 
bandwidth history ok so let's have a
look<00:04:52.450> at<00:04:52.540> the<00:04:52.690> user<00:04:52.900> modules<00:04:53.380> here<00:04:53.890> we<00:04:54.010> have

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
look at the user modules here we have

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.740 
look at the user modules here we have
the<00:04:54.220> use<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.370> modules<00:04:54.820> you<00:04:54.970> can<00:04:55.030> click<00:04:55.390> on<00:04:55.570> this

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
the use of modules you can click on this

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.890 
the use of modules you can click on this
say<00:04:55.990> Firefox<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:57.030> basically<00:04:58.030> you'll<00:04:58.600> tell

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
say Firefox and basically you'll tell

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.740 
say Firefox and basically you'll tell
you<00:04:59.050> all<00:04:59.230> of<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.500> ll<00:04:59.740> files<00:05:00.040> or<00:05:00.310> sit<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.510> files

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
you all of the ll files or sit the files

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.320 
you all of the ll files or sit the files
that<00:05:02.020> that<00:05:02.550> application<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.700> using<00:05:03.730> the<00:05:04.180> dish

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
that that application is using the dish

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.710 
that that application is using the dish
you<00:05:04.419> can<00:05:04.540> see<00:05:04.690> quite<00:05:04.930> a<00:05:05.080> lot<00:05:05.260> so<00:05:06.100> if<00:05:06.430> we<00:05:06.720> click

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
you can see quite a lot so if we click

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.170 
you can see quite a lot so if we click
on<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.350> of<00:05:08.380> these<00:05:08.560> now<00:05:08.950> we<00:05:09.760> can<00:05:09.940> all<00:05:10.030> have<00:05:10.150> a

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
on one of these now we can all have a

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.360 
on one of these now we can all have a
freeze<00:05:10.510> this<00:05:10.750> one<00:05:11.020> which<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.530> like<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:11.770> pause<00:05:12.340> in

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
freeze this one which is like a pause in

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.300 
freeze this one which is like a pause in
button<00:05:12.910> it<00:05:13.090> will<00:05:13.270> freeze<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.890> find<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:15.070> target

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
button it will freeze it find the target

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.810 
button it will freeze it find the target
file<00:05:15.760> and<00:05:16.030> also<00:05:16.840> view<00:05:17.500> by<00:05:17.680> module<00:05:18.040> so<00:05:18.280> let's

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
file and also view by module so let's

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.360 
file and also view by module so let's
see<00:05:19.090> what<00:05:19.270> that<00:05:19.419> does<00:05:19.480> so<00:05:19.950> target<00:05:20.950> fire<00:05:21.160> loans

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
see what that does so target fire loans

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.390 
see what that does so target fire loans

located as you can see till to the size
of<00:05:32.830> it<00:05:32.950> and<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.280> path<00:05:33.550> so<00:05:34.300> now<00:05:34.479> we<00:05:34.540> have<00:05:34.750> the

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
of it and the path so now we have the

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.810 
of it and the path so now we have the
path<00:05:35.080> of<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.440> file<00:05:35.680> might<00:05:36.280> be<00:05:36.430> handy<00:05:36.640> for

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
path of the file might be handy for

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.790 
path of the file might be handy for
tracking<00:05:37.330> down<00:05:37.600> viruses<00:05:38.260> and<00:05:38.410> stuff<00:05:38.500> like

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
tracking down viruses and stuff like

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.540 
tracking down viruses and stuff like
that<00:05:38.860> we<00:05:39.280> see<00:05:39.669> C<00:05:39.880> colon<00:05:40.150> backslash<00:05:40.419> programs

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
that we see C colon backslash programs

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.710 
that we see C colon backslash programs
mr.<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.640> Firefox<00:05:43.060> we<00:05:43.210> know<00:05:43.330> that's<00:05:43.540> not<00:05:43.630> a

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
mr. the Firefox we know that's not a

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.659 
mr. the Firefox we know that's not a
virus<00:05:43.960> but<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.860> get<00:05:45.010> the<00:05:45.070> general<00:05:45.280> gist<00:05:45.550> of

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
virus but you get the general gist of

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.490 
virus but you get the general gist of
what<00:05:45.790> I'm<00:05:45.850> on<00:05:45.970> about<00:05:46.000> if<00:05:46.390> that<00:05:46.720> was<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:46.900> virus<00:05:47.169> we

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
what I'm on about if that was a virus we

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.870 
what I'm on about if that was a virus we
can<00:05:47.680> actually<00:05:47.800> track<00:05:48.130> it<00:05:48.280> down<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:48.580> find<00:05:48.760> out

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
can actually track it down and find out

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.090 
can actually track it down and find out
where<00:05:49.030> it's<00:05:49.210> located<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.960> then<00:05:50.140> kill<00:05:50.320> it

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.100 
where it's located and then kill it

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.950 
where it's located and then kill it
or<00:05:51.490> delete<00:05:51.790> it<00:05:51.970> so<00:05:52.780> let's<00:05:53.530> go<00:05:54.100> back<00:05:54.430> a<00:05:54.960> bit

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
or delete it so let's go back a bit

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:02.310 
or delete it so let's go back a bit
there<00:05:57.480> view<00:05:58.480> but<00:05:58.660> process

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.750 

so<00:06:02.950> let's<00:06:03.160> try<00:06:03.430> and<00:06:03.580> pick<00:06:03.760> one<00:06:03.790> that's<00:06:04.180> sir<00:06:05.760> ok

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:06.760 
so let's try and pick one that's sir ok

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.030 
so let's try and pick one that's sir ok
so<00:06:06.820> that's<00:06:07.630> basically<00:06:07.840> that<00:06:08.410> really<00:06:08.740> that's

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
so that's basically that really that's

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.770 
so that's basically that really that's
going<00:06:09.280> to<00:06:09.340> show<00:06:09.550> you<00:06:09.610> how<00:06:10.060> to<00:06:10.120> do<00:06:10.450> that<00:06:10.630> is

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
going to show you how to do that is

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.200 
going to show you how to do that is
pretty<00:06:11.080> self-explanatory<00:06:11.760> I'm<00:06:12.760> really<00:06:13.030> had<00:06:13.180> a

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210
