00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
and the thighs again I'd probably go up

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.340 
and the thighs again I'd probably go up
a<00:00:43.489> size<00:00:43.520> however<00:00:44.390> they<00:00:44.690> do<00:00:44.750> have<00:00:44.870> stretch

material<00:00:45.739> above<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.430> knees<00:00:46.579> so<00:00:47.149> that<00:00:47.750> allows

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
material above the knees so that allows

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.049 
material above the knees so that allows
me<00:00:48.260> plenty<00:00:48.500> of<00:00:48.649> freedom<00:00:48.950> movement<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:49.670> sitting
