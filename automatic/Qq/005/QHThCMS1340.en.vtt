00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
will spin it won't actually launch

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.410 
will spin it won't actually launch
anything<00:02:22.200> out<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.740> just<00:02:23.040> more<00:02:23.280> for<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
anything out it's just more for the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.170 
anything out it's just more for the
looks<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.310> won't<00:02:26.520> shoot<00:02:26.790> out<00:02:26.940> any

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
looks of it so it won't shoot out any

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.330 
looks of it so it won't shoot out any
salt<00:02:27.510> anywhere<00:02:27.900> but<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.860> does<00:02:29.010> spin<00:02:29.190> around

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
salt anywhere but it does spin around

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.690 
salt anywhere but it does spin around
and<00:02:29.640> then<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.150> raise<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.080> up<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:34.290> also<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and then you can raise it up so also the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.540 
and then you can raise it up so also the
bed<00:02:35.850> comes<00:02:36.780> off<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:37.980> take<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.220> off

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
bed comes off so you can take that off

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.100 
bed comes off so you can take that off
and<00:02:38.580> then<00:02:38.940> you've<00:02:38.970> kind<00:02:39.330> of<00:02:39.420> just<00:02:39.600> got<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.959> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
and then you've kind of just got like a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.860 
and then you've kind of just got like a
basic<00:02:40.740> truck<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.270> could<00:02:42.360> actually<00:02:42.540> build

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
basic truck so you could actually build

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.020 
basic truck so you could actually build
something<00:02:43.320> a<00:02:43.440> different<00:02:43.620> maybe<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.490> flatbed<00:02:45.000> or

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
something a different maybe a flatbed or

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.710 
something a different maybe a flatbed or
something<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.530> throw<00:02:46.770> that<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.720> so

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
something and you know throw that on so

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.920 
something and you know throw that on so
we'll<00:02:48.870> put<00:02:49.050> that<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.260> their<00:02:50.510> roof<00:02:51.510> comes<00:02:51.780> off

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
we'll put that on their roof comes off

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.830 
we'll put that on their roof comes off
real<00:02:52.440> easily<00:02:52.700> minifigure<00:02:53.700> inside<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:57.300> there's

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
real easily minifigure inside so there's

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.520 
real easily minifigure inside so there's
a<00:02:57.900> look<00:02:58.080> at<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> front<00:02:58.590> without<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.310> snowplow

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
a look at the front without the snowplow

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.320 
a look at the front without the snowplow
so<00:03:01.530> let<00:03:01.680> me<00:03:02.120> let<00:03:03.120> me<00:03:03.209> get<00:03:03.420> out<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:06.090> white

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
so let me let me get out the white

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.860 
so let me let me get out the white
pieces<00:03:06.660> which<00:03:07.050> are<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.590> snow<00:03:08.510> or<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.720> could

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
pieces which are the snow or you could

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.410 
pieces which are the snow or you could
use<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.020> a<00:03:10.230> salt<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.520> then<00:03:11.970> we'll<00:03:12.090> do<00:03:12.239> some

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
use it a salt and then we'll do some

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.240 
use it a salt and then we'll do some
plow<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.430> ok<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:14.489> let's<00:03:14.820> lower<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:16.100> put<00:03:17.100> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
plow in ok so let's lower that put the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.009 
plow in ok so let's lower that put the
blade<00:03:17.580> back<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:20.090> ok<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.360> I've<00:03:21.480> got<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.810> blade

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
blade back on ok so I've got the blade

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.840 
blade back on ok so I've got the blade
lowered<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.280> could<00:03:23.430> either<00:03:23.610> do<00:03:24.769> pushing

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
lowered so you could either do pushing

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.280 
lowered so you could either do pushing
so<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:26.940> could<00:03:27.120> kind<00:03:27.330> of<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.570> push<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.019> snow

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
so you could kind of just push the snow

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.060 
so you could kind of just push the snow
or<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:30.600> can<00:03:30.780> angle<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.200> blade<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.830> side

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
or you can angle the blade to the side

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.780 
or you can angle the blade to the side
and<00:03:33.080> then<00:03:34.080> what<00:03:34.500> that'll<00:03:34.799> do<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.160> it'll<00:03:35.250> kind

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
and then what that'll do is it'll kind

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.910 
and then what that'll do is it'll kind
of<00:03:35.910> if<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.330> can<00:03:36.510> don't<00:03:36.840> know<00:03:37.530> for<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.769> guys

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
of if you can don't know for you guys

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.580 
of if you can don't know for you guys
can<00:03:38.100> see<00:03:38.250> only<00:03:38.340> see<00:03:38.580> get<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.150> back<00:03:39.420> there<00:03:39.690> using

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
can see only see get it back there using

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.800 
can see only see get it back there using
white<00:03:40.799> on<00:03:40.950> white<00:03:40.980> here<00:03:41.400> it'll<00:03:42.000> push<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.329> snow

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
white on white here it'll push the snow

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.840 
white on white here it'll push the snow
off<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.470> sides<00:03:43.739> there<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.519> go<00:03:44.640> now<00:03:44.820> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
off to the sides there you go now you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.810 
off to the sides there you go now you
can<00:03:45.030> kind<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.299> see<00:03:45.390> it<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:46.799> a<00:03:46.829> real<00:03:47.549> truck

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
can kind of see it so like a real truck

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.340 
can kind of see it so like a real truck
would<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.209> would<00:03:48.299> shovel<00:03:48.780> all<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.110> snow<00:03:49.320> off

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
would it would shovel all the snow off

would it would shovel all the snow off
to<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.769> side<00:03:49.980> so<00:03:50.760> that's<00:03:50.940> pretty<00:03:51.180> cool<00:03:51.530> you<00:03:52.530> do
