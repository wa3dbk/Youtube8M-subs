and goon fuse is actually goon I'm sure
you<00:01:04.140> could<00:01:04.260> probably<00:01:04.290> figure<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.799> out<00:01:05.070> he

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
you could probably figure that out he

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.070 
you could probably figure that out he
actually<00:01:05.850> changed<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.570> gamertag<00:01:06.960> who

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
actually changed that gamertag who

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.080 
actually changed that gamertag who
doesn't<00:01:07.350> own<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> anymore<00:01:08.010> he<00:01:08.790> took<00:01:08.939> off<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
doesn't own that anymore he took off the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.760 
doesn't own that anymore he took off the
D<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.140> see<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.320> I'm<00:01:10.530> running<00:01:10.619> around

that ain't him also you guys see who

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.039

were playing against we're playing

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:22.700 
were playing against we're playing
against<00:01:16.290> WS<00:01:17.210> DP<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:19.560> f<00:01:20.330> king<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.900> play<00:01:22.500> off

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
against WS DP and f king and play off

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.340 
against WS DP and f king and play off
with<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> zero<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.549> believe<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.990> actual

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
with the zero I believe it's not actual

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.190 
with the zero I believe it's not actual
like<00:01:25.590> play<00:01:25.830> off<00:01:26.689> yeah<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.750> guys<00:01:27.900> saw<00:01:28.049> their

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.359 
like play off yeah you guys saw their
stats<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.619> beginning<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> think<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.220> had

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
stats in the beginning I think they had

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.609 
stats in the beginning I think they had
like<00:01:29.400> two<00:01:29.939> katie's<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.140> wasn't<00:01:31.500> anything

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
like two katie's so I wasn't anything

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
like two katie's so I wasn't anything
like<00:01:31.829> too<00:01:32.070> spectacular<00:01:32.369> as<00:01:32.880> far<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.210> stats

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
like too spectacular as far as stats

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.870 
like too spectacular as far as stats
were<00:01:33.689> concerned<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.790> are

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
were concerned but you know we are

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.249 
were concerned but you know we are
playing<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.210> v3<00:01:36.540> so<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:36.960> made<00:01:37.110> this

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
playing to v3 so that's what made this

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.499 
playing to v3 so that's what made this
entertaining<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.970> actually<00:01:39.180> end<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.329> playing

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
entertaining we actually end up playing

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.480 
entertaining we actually end up playing
these<00:01:39.630> dudes<00:01:39.869> twice<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.979> other<00:01:41.130> game<00:01:41.280> was

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
these dudes twice the other game was

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.940 
these dudes twice the other game was
also<00:01:41.790> very<00:01:41.939> close<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.630> wouldn't<00:01:43.439> say<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.680> close

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
also very close I wouldn't say as close

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.910 
also very close I wouldn't say as close
as<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.600> trying<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.649> take<00:01:46.799> we

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
as this one I think trying to take we

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.289 
as this one I think trying to take we
probably<00:01:47.070> went<00:01:47.310> about<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.549> 40<00:01:47.939> points<00:01:48.240> in

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
probably went about like 40 points in

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.980 
probably went about like 40 points in
the<00:01:48.420> other<00:01:48.570> game<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:50.750> this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the other game and then this is the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.170 
the other game and then this is the
second<00:01:52.409> game<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.860> played<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.430> we're

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
second game that we played and we're

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670 
second game that we played and we're
like<00:01:54.299> oh<00:01:54.420> fuck<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.960> won<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> first<00:01:55.320> one<00:01:55.530> let's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
like oh fuck we won the first one let's

like oh fuck we won the first one let's
try<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.890> win<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.189> second<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.640> say<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
try to win the second one we say it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.910 
try to win the second one we say it

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
again but it is to victory so you know

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.560 
again but it is to victory so you know
that<00:01:59.070> always<00:01:59.189> makes<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.579> difficult<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.240> think

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that always makes it difficult I think

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.050 
that always makes it difficult I think
we<00:02:00.780> did<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> fairly<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.259> job<00:02:02.060> also<00:02:03.110> I<00:02:05.060> edited

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
we did a fairly good job also I edited

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.869 
we did a fairly good job also I edited
down<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.780> kind<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.340> say<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.550> edited

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
down like kind of I would say I edited

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.800 
down like kind of I would say I edited
all<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> way<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.300> until<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> last

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
all the way up until like the last

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.530 
all the way up until like the last
minute<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.739> half<00:02:10.890> two<00:02:11.310> minutes<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:12.360> just

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
minute and a half two minutes and I just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.670 
minute and a half two minutes and I just
left<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.050> last<00:02:13.260> like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
left in the last like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.229 
left in the last like
two<00:02:13.769> minutes<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.129> gameplay<00:02:14.459> because

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
two minutes of the gameplay because

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.789 
two minutes of the gameplay because
obviously<00:02:15.510> that's<00:02:15.900> when<00:02:16.079> it's<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.349> most<00:02:16.530> like

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
obviously that's when it's the most like

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.130 
obviously that's when it's the most like
close<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:17.519> I<00:02:17.819> figured<00:02:18.239> that's<00:02:18.659> when<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.049> guys

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
close and I figured that's when you guys

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.209 
close and I figured that's when you guys
would<00:02:19.319> want<00:02:19.409> to<00:02:19.560> see<00:02:19.709> everything<00:02:20.069> that

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
would want to see everything that

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.670 
would want to see everything that
happens<00:02:20.670> other<00:02:21.299> than<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.629> any<00:02:22.170> time<00:02:22.409> I<00:02:22.439> go

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
happens other than that any time I go

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.399 
happens other than that any time I go
like<00:02:22.920> 1<00:02:23.159> 4<00:02:23.430> 1<00:02:23.609> or<00:02:23.909> like<00:02:24.480> maybe<00:02:24.659> even<00:02:24.900> over<00:02:25.230> 1<00:02:25.379> I

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
like 1 4 1 or like maybe even over 1 I

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.470 
like 1 4 1 or like maybe even over 1 I
think<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.709> happened<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> few<00:02:26.010> times<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:27.030> just

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
think that happened a few times I just

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.569 
think that happened a few times I just
edited<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.109> part<00:02:28.349> out<00:02:28.469> I<00:02:28.829> just<00:02:29.340> feel<00:02:29.519> like

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
edited that part out I just feel like

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.280 
edited that part out I just feel like
that's<00:02:29.730> not<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.389> a<00:02:30.510> necessary<00:02:31.019> thing<00:02:31.079> but

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that's not really a necessary thing but

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.379 
that's not really a necessary thing but
what<00:02:31.439> I<00:02:31.500> mean<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:32.459> I<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.879> know<00:02:32.909> if<00:02:33.209> I

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
what I mean like is if I you know if I

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.059 
what I mean like is if I you know if I
spawned<00:02:33.659> in<00:02:33.840> after<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.290> died<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.799> only<00:02:34.950> got

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
spawned in after I died and I only got

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.979 
spawned in after I died and I only got
one<00:02:35.280> kill<00:02:35.459> then<00:02:35.639> I<00:02:35.700> died<00:02:35.879> again<00:02:35.909> I<00:02:36.359> feel<00:02:36.900> like

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
one kill then I died again I feel like

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.050 
one kill then I died again I feel like
that<00:02:37.109> life<00:02:37.379> was<00:02:37.769> kind<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.129> waste<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.700> you

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
that life was kind of a waste and you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.750 
that life was kind of a waste and you
guys<00:02:39.180> don't<00:02:39.450> really<00:02:39.569> need<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:40.079> that<00:02:40.459> or<00:02:41.459> if

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
guys don't really need to see that or if

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.000 
guys don't really need to see that or if
I<00:02:41.909> spawned<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.389> and<00:02:42.599> then<00:02:42.719> died<00:02:43.379> again<00:02:43.739> not

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
I spawned in and then died again not

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.890 
I spawned in and then died again not
even<00:02:44.219> getting<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.459> kill<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:45.480> life<00:02:45.659> isn't

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
even getting a kill that life isn't

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.429 
even getting a kill that life isn't
really<00:02:46.200> worth<00:02:46.349> it<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.919> watch<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.909> I<00:02:48.720> edited<00:02:49.260> all

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
really worth it to watch so I edited all

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.440 
really worth it to watch so I edited all
that<00:02:49.620> out<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.189> also<00:02:50.340> edited<00:02:50.849> out<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.269> I

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
that out and I also edited out if I

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.449 
that out and I also edited out if I
spawned<00:02:51.780> out<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:52.409> you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:53.220> were<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
spawned out like you know we were on the

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.039 
spawned out like you know we were on the
hill<00:02:53.609> then<00:02:53.939> they<00:02:54.030> broke<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.510> and<00:02:54.689> we<00:02:54.810> spun

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
hill then they broke it and we spun

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.080 
hill then they broke it and we spun
across<00:02:55.439> the<00:02:55.620> map<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.069> I<00:02:56.430> had<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:56.700> spend<00:02:56.909> like

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
across the map and I had to spend like

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.330 
across the map and I had to spend like
10<00:02:57.419> 15<00:02:57.870> seconds<00:02:58.230> running<00:02:58.590> across<00:02:58.829> to<00:02:59.189> go<00:02:59.280> to

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
10 15 seconds running across to go to

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.409 
10 15 seconds running across to go to
the<00:02:59.489> new<00:02:59.579> hill

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
the new hill

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.449 
the new hill
so<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.870> edited<00:03:01.169> all<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.530> type<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.769> stuff<00:03:01.859> out<00:03:02.219> I

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
so I edited all that type of stuff out I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:03.589 
so I edited all that type of stuff out I
don't<00:03:02.639> know<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.730> figured<00:03:03.030> it'd<00:03:03.120> just<00:03:03.209> be<00:03:03.359> a<00:03:03.389> more

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
don't know I figured it'd just be a more

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.059 
don't know I figured it'd just be a more
entertaining<00:03:03.840> gameplay<00:03:04.609> and<00:03:05.609> also<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.859> I'm<00:03:07.859> not

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
entertaining gameplay and also I I'm not

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.589 
entertaining gameplay and also I I'm not
really<00:03:08.189> sure<00:03:08.459> what<00:03:08.669> I<00:03:08.700> should<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:09.030> talking

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
really sure what I should be talking

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.300 
really sure what I should be talking
about<00:03:09.689> for<00:03:10.139> these<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.620> this<00:03:10.739> series<00:03:11.069> you<00:03:11.219> know

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
about for these for this series you know

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.509 
about for these for this series you know
I<00:03:11.340> mean<00:03:11.519> because<00:03:11.639> like<00:03:12.169> I<00:03:13.169> don't<00:03:14.099> like<00:03:14.310> it's

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
I mean because like I don't like it's

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.770 
I mean because like I don't like it's
not<00:03:14.639> really<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.909> series<00:03:15.269> where<00:03:15.389> I<00:03:15.450> want<00:03:15.629> to<00:03:15.689> do

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
not really a series where I want to do

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.039 
not really a series where I want to do
like<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:16.019> commentary<00:03:16.650> topic<00:03:17.209> because<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.780> don't

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
like a commentary topic because I don't

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.750 
like a commentary topic because I don't
know<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.139> like<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.349> just<00:03:19.590> do<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.280> know<00:03:20.400> random

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
know I like to just do you know random

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.879 
know I like to just do you know random
gameplay<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.599> this<00:03:22.379> is<00:03:22.500> something<00:03:22.739> where<00:03:22.859> you

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
gameplay and this is something where you

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:23.899 
gameplay and this is something where you
shouldn't<00:03:23.190> have<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.370> look<00:03:23.519> at<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.729> gameplay

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
shouldn't have to look at the gameplay

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.119 
shouldn't have to look at the gameplay
really<00:03:24.419> at<00:03:24.510> all<00:03:24.629> on<00:03:24.900> all<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.470> ones<00:03:25.650> I<00:03:25.799> do<00:03:25.889> come
