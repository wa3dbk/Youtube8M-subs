there's<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> rallying<00:00:58.320> point<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:59.100> can't<00:00:59.340> use<00:00:59.579> X

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
there's a rallying point I can't use X

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.610 
there's a rallying point I can't use X
and<00:01:00.030> sometimes<00:01:00.359> play<00:01:00.570> better<00:01:00.840> lose<00:01:01.469> your

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and sometimes play better lose your

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
and sometimes play better lose your

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
mistakes you make order you got to move

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.310 
mistakes you make order you got to move
on<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:20.750> probably<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.170> bit<00:01:22.259> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
on and I probably see a little bit of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.899 
on and I probably see a little bit of
that<00:01:22.380> especially<00:01:23.220> guys<00:01:23.340> he's<00:01:23.579> been<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that especially guys he's been here a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
that especially guys he's been here a
long<00:01:24.090> time<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:24.930> never<00:01:25.710> had<00:01:25.920> an<00:01:26.070> issue<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
long time and never had an issue and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.330 
long time and never had an issue and
then<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> little<00:01:27.869> bit<00:01:28.189> he<00:01:29.189> said

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
then so I see that a little bit he said

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
then so I see that a little bit he said
yesterday<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.759> high<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.630> felt<00:01:30.899> in<00:01:31.049> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
yesterday that high can be felt in a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.590 
yesterday that high can be felt in a
little<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:31.979> different<00:01:32.310> skill<00:01:32.549> set<00:01:32.789> as<00:01:33.420> that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
little bit different skill set as that

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.139 
little bit different skill set as that
position<00:01:34.020> change<00:01:34.259> behind<00:01:34.649> I<00:01:35.280> always<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:35.850> got

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
position change behind I always also got

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.830 
position change behind I always also got
some<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.799> bigger<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.369> also<00:01:39.360> we're<00:01:39.689> going

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
some is bigger and so also we're going

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.100 
some is bigger and so also we're going
to<00:01:39.899> utilize<00:01:40.670> Demps<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.330> moody<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.929> game

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to utilize Demps and moody in the game

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
would presume help you get more speed on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.199 
would presume help you get more speed on
the<00:02:46.680> field<00:02:46.890> then<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.880> gotta<00:02:48.060> learn<00:02:48.150> to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
the field then I just gotta learn to

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.580 
the field then I just gotta learn to
play<00:02:48.480> at<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:48.720> same<00:02:48.989> speed<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.380> he's

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
play at that same speed that he's

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.770 
play at that same speed that he's
capable<00:02:49.980> planet<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:51.030> what<00:02:51.209> it<00:02:51.239> takes

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
capable planet that's what it takes

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.090 
capable planet that's what it takes
young<00:02:51.989> guys<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.230> minute<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.590> do<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.950> guys

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
young guys a minute to do the guys

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.350 
young guys a minute to do the guys
really<00:02:53.220> coming<00:02:53.520> out<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:53.820> Quentin<00:02:53.970> done<00:02:54.180> long

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
really coming out as Quentin done long

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.690 
really coming out as Quentin done long
as<00:02:54.450> well<00:02:54.709> he's<00:02:55.709> got<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> lot<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.010> speed<00:02:56.310> more

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
as well he's got a lot of speed more

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.930 
as well he's got a lot of speed more
speed<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.180> thought<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.680> featuring<00:02:59.370> real

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
speed and I thought so featuring real

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.449 
speed and I thought so featuring real
too<00:03:00.209> young<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.720> then<00:03:01.019> dunkley<00:03:01.380> tugged<00:03:02.310> his

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
too young and then dunkley tugged his

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.040 
too young and then dunkley tugged his
hamstring<00:03:02.910> again<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.360> he<00:03:03.510> won't<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.810> available

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
hamstring again so he won't be available

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.570 
hamstring again so he won't be available
this<00:03:04.290> weekend<00:03:04.709> but<00:03:04.800> he's<00:03:04.950> getting<00:03:05.070> better<00:03:05.220> so

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
this weekend but he's getting better so

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.600 
this weekend but he's getting better so
our<00:03:05.670> young<00:03:05.820> players<00:03:05.970> would<00:03:06.239> get<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.360> lot<00:03:06.480> better
