distance throwing sure you can go

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.110 
distance throwing sure you can go
straight<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.800> in<00:02:50.310> case<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.640> got<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.850> go<00:02:50.940> more

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
straight but in case you got to go more

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.760
