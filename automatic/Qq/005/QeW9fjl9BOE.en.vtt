00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 gold since ancient times the gold 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.899
 it has always been a source of wealth and 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.519
 power in many civilizations including 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.730
 today he still has great power 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.900
 but that does not happen with minecraft as 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.219
 you know gold is also present 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.410
 inside the game of minecraft without 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.330
 However, it is very limited to the uses that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.220
 it still refers if we want to have 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.660
 a lot of gold how we can do it inside 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.400
 of hell or of sneijder also 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.310
 known we found more creatures very 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.689
 curious half human half pigs the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.910
 school to die release a series of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.099
 objects among which are the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 chips of europe the idea therefore 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.230
 would be to get all these two 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.239
 monsters seemed in the area that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 we would like and when falling or dying 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.719
 not only are you in all the objects that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.040
 we would like and what we want to achieve 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.170
 are the golden balls to give us 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.700
 gold bullion but of course there is a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.770
 problem and is that these monsters what 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.809
 it seems the same area is the neder and you have to 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.219
 look for all the theoretical concepts that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.410
 respond to the appearance of these 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 monsters sneijder is to say build a 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 map is pauner of the tour sneijder he 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.969
 answer everything showed very simple 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 appear of course in the rock ship 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 that this red stone and even also 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 appears in a sauce or even as a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.159
 curious car this is showing 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.210
 not appear on the normal stone and 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.799
 current of him 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.710
 the normal world with this stone and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.500
 worked the stone since it gets 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.450
 in any baked place or even in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.820
 mineral blocks the community be in 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.710
 iron block 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.360
 with this we already know that places although 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.130
 materials are the propitious ones so that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.080
 appear however we are still 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.280
 presents a few things in the first 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.600
 place if we want to build a montage 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.620
 to speak within neder we have to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.380
 keep in mind that we can not use 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.150
 the water as you are seeing if you pressed the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.160
 right button I can not put it so 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.020
 the water is discarded but still not 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.490
 everything is lost since the men 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.340
 pig can also appear or can 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.740
 make the backing on the plates 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.420
 of pressure so we can take advantage of 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.950
 all this advantage to what I want to get 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.720
 we can project 60 way 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.369
 building mechanism so that's how it is 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.410
 very simple now I explain it can 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.930
 appear here the monsters that we want 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.240
 they appear and one appears on top of 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.130
 the pressure plate releases it 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.580
 instantly and it was up to par 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.619
 enough to drop your 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.550
 precious object its cooking is very 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.660
 simple and very intuitive that as 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.940
 having only consists of plates of 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.580
 pressure alternating also then with a 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.080
 rest a repeater rest a repeater and 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.030
 on top you just have to put piston mirrors 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.800
 or then put a block here that push 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.040
 it can be stone or for example a block 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.019
 of gold 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.129
 as you want and by pressing it pushes us 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.719
 of course the height you want 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.890
 This whole machine is 24 blocks per 

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.230
 above the ground on which it was 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.209
 Otherwise, I would not die and other factors 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.859
 should in mind it would be that if possible 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.870
 it would be built on a lava lagoon 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.790
 since this improves performance and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.470
 monster appearance is to say the ones with 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.209
 centers another way to get that 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.579
 these others fall on their own is 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.200
 make small holes and put up posters 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.090
 since these others will think that the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.060
 posters are like blocks but by not 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.190
 have nothing will fall 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.830
 so that they fall if you see that they do not fall 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.410
 you can attack one and all 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.610
 they will automatically come towards the fall 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.620
 however, if they are far enough 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.080
 they will act normally and they will go 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 on its own the only drawback that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.840
 have these constructions that grow 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.160
 the big ones and had to do them 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.019
 super massive for them to work 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.300
 correctly and is not conducive to having it 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.650
 however its construction is done 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.050
 quite difficult but when it has 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.910
 built once and already in a big way 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.040
 and massive the performance they offer is 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.010
 of high quality as additional data 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.630
 you can know that the lighting here is not 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.610
 matter whether it is dark as it is 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.350
 is illuminated does not matter since 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.180
 will appear always and if you want 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.580
 Concentrate the rate of appearance 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.600
 you can catch lava cubes 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.850
 and once caught 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.810
 fill all the abbot since he showed it not 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.810
 they will perish where they cried 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.230
 so in a nutshell it would be 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.250
 basically this do response in the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.680
 rock cne or any material 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.270
 usual from the normal world and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.450
 the lighting does not matter as I can 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.800
 be both dark and illuminated by 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.410
 of course their construction is applied 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.910
 both an advantage and a disadvantage 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.520
 we will get unlimited gold in form 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.110
 continuous and the disadvantage is that you need 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.489
 build with a lot of material and 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.709
 you need a lot of time of dedication 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.750
 but as motivation you can think what 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.090
 next nobody will have as much money as 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.810
 you 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.810
 or if
