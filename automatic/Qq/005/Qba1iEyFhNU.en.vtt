00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.410
 hello friends I'm test drive for 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.389
 the pines with caps and then basically it's 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.220
 give some laps in this circuit that 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.620
 it's called back to the lake it's a race 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.870
 verified by rockstar and we're going 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.240
 to record the times of the vehicles 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.009
 and we will order them from the one you make 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.529
 more time until he does less 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.810
 time and then we started with this in the 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.720
 place number 15 was this pick up a 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.079
 low of lambÃ¡n and then this one has 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.790
 an excessive devilish understeer is very 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.500
 difficult to manage to put it into 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.449
 curves and we have to train too 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.750
 to put the schools I think that 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.030
 is wrong is let's say it is present in 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.710
 all the pickups in this retro here 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.980
 also that we have in place number 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.320
 14 same devilish understeer is very 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.940
 difficult to get fleas and you have 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.370
 that slow down in a very excessive way 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.620
 a long time to get her lose the 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.320
 curves and to not vary we have a 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.079
 company a place a rated this 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.510
 truck has the same problem of 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.920
 the previous trucks do not get into 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.409
 the curves of this is a bad 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.180
 widespread for very bad pickups 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.600
 for curves you have to brake 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.970
 excess to be able to get into the curves 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.650
 the twelfth place we have some of this 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.150
 self I like how it's handled looks like a 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.560
 sandwich if you see it from the back 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.840
 I like how it is handled 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.370
 stability has a lot of control but not 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.460
 has the necessary power to be 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.080
 in a better place I like the weather and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.810
 we are going to place number 11 in the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.750
 place number 11 is this and each car is 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.880
 a half auto half pick up is the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.890
 picador is handled very well also has 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.720
 very good stability I like it in excess 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.880
 how it is handeled 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.240
 we go with the place number 10 in the place 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.780
 number 10 is the light east 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.850
 automobile also let's say you have a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.060
 little bit of nervousness has a 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.710
 very light oversteer but nothing of the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.410
 what can you worry about what can you 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.690
 totally control very well and good 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.440
 this registered a time of 59 seconds 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.940
 62 let's go with the 9th place in this 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.640
 place with them nothing more and nothing less 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.130
 that the buccaneer a car also that 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.510
 It has great power and is handled in 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.330
 curves too 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.280
 let's say it does not cost you so much rabbit 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.530
 control me with a little nervousness 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.900
 I thought that these cars 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.360
 moscote we were going to have bigger problems 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 for control but I did not meet 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.590
 that if they are manageable and have great 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.629
 stability also well let's go now with 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.150
 place number 8 of place 98 we have the 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.890
 this lion and what to say about this car 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.120
 it also has good stability what 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.730
 you can put the tests and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.310
 you can incredibly accelerate during 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.319
 the curve with this car even though it is 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.390
 very turn you have good stability 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.099
 and then it is not in a better place because 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.349
 you need to highlight a 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.510
 much more powerful author is let's go with 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.879
 place number 7 in this place is the 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.340
 surprisingly this car tablet does not 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.620
 is in a better condition and then 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.799
 it does not surprise me too much I would stop them 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.750
 see in a second third place maybe in 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.209
 a bad afternoon in a room but my way 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.659
 is in the ninth place with 59 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:10.790
 seconds with 09 then we have to 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.180
 cable is in the next place in the 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.000
 sixth we have the phoenix the kleenex does 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.520
 an incredible noise has the best sound 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.290
 of all these cars the nets to 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.730
 the curves with a little work without 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.980
 However, it has speed 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.560
 acceleration and then nothing else there is that 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.600
 worry a little about not doing 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.110
 sharp maneuvers because you can 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.570
 to lose 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.380
 you make a somewhat abrupt maneuver and what 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.500
 you can lose 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.110
 let's say that very easily the ruin in 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.940
 I love this car too much how 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.610
 handles I think it 's one of the few 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.370
 muscles that are handled in a way 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.070
 surprising this one has no understeer there 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.540
 you have oversteer you can get it 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.190
 let's say that doing maneuvers a little 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.510
 sharp towards the curves however there 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.700
 to take care of it, you also have to remember 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.280
 that any car can be 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.190
 lead to some curve however this 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.200
 car is one of the most stable and most 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.960
 easy to handle so to speak 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.470
 incredibly the dominator is in the 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:13.170
 fourth place this car is the hardest 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.390
 of driving and the most we take for 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.580
 online competitions is more difficult to 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.080
 handle because you can not demand it in 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.850
 the curves it can not shove 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.100
 aggressively to the curves because you're going 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.380
 to be displacements and you will oversteer 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.260
 why not in the fourth place the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.960
 project surprisingly go on 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.820
 third place we have the saber had the 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.070
 Saber had nothing else but that 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.620
 worry a bit because you have a 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.330
 light nervousness however it is more 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.640
 Stable and it handles better than him 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.290
 dominator this car makes you less 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.000
 strangers that he dominator less 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.280
 lateral displacements when I already 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.370
 you have a curve and that's why 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.710
 is in this place is an easy actor to 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.230
 handle to some extent you can not 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.420
 demand a little more than him dominator in 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.910
 the curves that 's why he 's in this position 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.360
 in the second place surprisingly 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:05.550
 is the imposing dukes and then this one 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.169
 they have tremendous stability for 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.199
 enter the curves you can not demand 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.599
 you can go to a point a little farther 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:14.939
 that the dominator and that's why he's in this 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:18.479
 place has higher acceleration has 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:20.939
 greater stability in curves so I felt it 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.250
 in this test I could not put some 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.500
 food demanding more than the dominator 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.800
 dare comparing it with that car that everyone 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:33.030
 in online and choose very first 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.189
 place if friends is the blade this car 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.960
 it looks like it's going to take off it seems that 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:40.229
 is taking the runway to take off 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.000
 because it is tilted as towards the 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.300
 lower back and the part of 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.520
 front higher surprisingly this 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.439
 first of all it 's a car that has 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.409
 a lot of stability I like how it 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.870
 he handles the English skill he has is 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.150
 incredible is a car that is very heavy 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.819
 but wow has a xeros machine that 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.800
 easily moves the curves 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:03.539
 they get very good to the curves is not the 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.250
 I better get the curves I love them 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.589
 other cars how they get better at 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.330
 curves however this car has the 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:10.159
 combination 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.379
 that they have stability to take 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:14.599
 curves with acceptable speed and over 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:17.509
 all the acceleration you have to get out 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:20.330
 of the curves is incredible why this 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:22.729
 auto is in the first place is the best 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.889
 option that we have for this category 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:29.229
 of cars so now friends this was the 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.229
 test drive for flies goodbye 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.480
 yes 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.960
 if not
