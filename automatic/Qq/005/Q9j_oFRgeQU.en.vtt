 his security letter early video 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.820
 the explanation is a problem to those 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.360
 encountered by users of 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.599
 windows 8 or eight points and in relation 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.039
 with the hard disk that rotates 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.230
 frequently to the 99 to 100% I 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.439
 do not know for what time the 33% he has 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.750
 calm air said good it happens commented 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 really soar 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.219
 finally it's not really a take a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.180
 small option nomine dos is pretty cool 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.190
 it's just for you to boost 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.190
 so-called performance of disks 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:45.640
 it's a problem that would pose winner 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.589
 his ministers not even if if you if that 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.690
 you piss off to see a hard drive 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.629
 turning to 99 for oneself who has no 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.820
 problem of open and where you can 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.600
 disable this option which is so nice 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.280
 finally it's nice but let's say she 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 manages which performance and increase it 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.750
 a little the performance of windows 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.720
 but if you're not interested or you 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.810
 have to offer the cavity account in 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.909

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.750
 the performances will come time 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.009
 when you can see it's a thing that 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.810
 is supposed to boost a little 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:50.320
 performance but not too much pu 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.490

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.280
 how much he will boost the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.109
 performance but froze already activated it 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.009

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:46.640
 that I use only a quarter of an hour 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:48.320
 this king of us to seven hard drives but 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.750
 you will have 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.110
