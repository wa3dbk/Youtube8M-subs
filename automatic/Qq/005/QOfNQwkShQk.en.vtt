00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.820
 a warm affectionate greeting from your e 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.400
 riccarda in this video I want 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.000
 to show you in all its beauty a 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.120
 small red and tasty fruit that is born 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.730
 wild in the shade of higher cries e 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.570
 which is sought after in the spring for the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.910
 its intense fragrance and its goodness 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.030
 I'm talking about the wild strawberry 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.880
 which you can admire here in all his 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:18.180
 humble beauty as you can see here 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 this small plant grows at the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.090
 better half hidden by taller vegetables 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.670
 and even its tasty fruits are not 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.619
 easy to find 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.649
 as you can see they develop 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.890
 consecutively on a stem that can 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.050
 bring not only a mature specimen but 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.960
 also others smaller than yet 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.660
 they must reach maturity 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.660
 the vesting period is short and not 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.890
 exceeds the month and a half and the first warm 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.959
 the strawberry season ends 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.690
 while the cultivated strawberry plant 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:58.580
 if you were flourishing you can produce some 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.580
 strawberry until the bad season 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.929
 here you can see the flower threads of the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:16.019
 cultivated strawberry and some of its fruits 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.019
 that are about to reach maturity 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.760
 as you can see the size of the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.310
 fruits is very small compared to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.799
 cultivated strawberries but the strawberry 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.950
 wild beats all the strawberries 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.230
 cultivated for perfume and goodness and it is done 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.190
 so forgive the difficulty of the 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.079
 half-hidden collection must be found 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.900
 under the leaves and pick it up 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.329
 gently to a dune for later 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.690
 consume it immediately because it is preserved 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.480
 very little so you ca n't find it 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.450
 very rarely in commerce runs 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.480
 just arm yourself with patience and find it 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.500
 in the shady and damp places where he lives and 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.049
 prospers 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.709
 I point out the differences between the 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:12.180
 two plants the wild strawberry 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.180
 edible to the fruit hanging towards 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.239
 the egg-shaped bass and with a good 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.780
 perfume you see the fruit of the false 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.760
 Afragola on your left and round 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.959
 enclosed by a glass of small leaves 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.430
 that they close and keep it erect 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.760
 looks like a small visible 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.150
 red button and this is his 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.980
 feature that makes it easily 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.099
 distinguishable from the real strawberry of 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.099
 wood 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.960
 the wild strawberry spreads with 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.840
 ease if it finds good conditions for 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.410
 its propagation ie seeds 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.050
 shade and humidity you can collect 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.680
 some specimens in spring for 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.780
 plant them in your garden in the garden 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.050
 maybe in a shady spot a little bare 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.190
 where they will spread without needing to 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.850
 excessive care also keep in mind 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.630
 what a more rustic species than its namesake 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.290
 cultivated 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.940
 you can also plant it in large pots 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.190
 in the shade of taller plants than like 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.650
 she with less moisture 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.570
 if you find the rare white variety 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.200
 which was selected for her 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.180
 color you can have white wild strawberries from 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.990
 mix with red ones with a 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.720
 really special effect sought the 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.570
 therefore and plant it to have even in the 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.420

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.419
 spring 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.460
