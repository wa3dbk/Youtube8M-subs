00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
and it's it's not battery-operated it

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.560 
and it's it's not battery-operated it
uses<00:00:29.220> electricity<00:00:29.369> which<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.390> better

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
uses electricity which I like better

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.620 
uses electricity which I like better
because<00:00:30.810> I've<00:00:30.900> tried<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.369> another<00:00:32.369> one

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
because I've tried a another one

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.430 
because I've tried a another one
name-brand<00:00:33.630> when<00:00:33.900> I<00:00:33.930> can't<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
name-brand when I can't think of the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.569 
name-brand when I can't think of the
name<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.740> it<00:00:34.860> right<00:00:34.890> now<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
name of it right now that was a

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.530 
name of it right now that was a
battery-operated

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
battery-operated

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.140 
battery-operated
rechargeable<00:00:37.230> battery<00:00:38.090> but<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:39.150 
rechargeable battery but the

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.080 
rechargeable battery but the
rechargeable<00:00:39.900> battery<00:00:40.020> wore<00:00:40.620> out<00:00:41.090> really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
rechargeable battery wore out really

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.050 
rechargeable battery wore out really
quick<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.110> then<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.130> I<00:00:44.160> went<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> final<00:00:44.850> in

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
quick and then when I went to final in

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.580 
quick and then when I went to final in
to<00:00:45.150> replace<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.720> I<00:00:45.930> couldn't<00:00:46.290> because

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
to replace it with I couldn't because

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
to replace it with I couldn't because
they<00:00:47.520> had<00:00:47.640> changed<00:00:48.860> the<00:00:49.860> design<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.490> that

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
they had changed the design and that

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.250 
they had changed the design and that
actually<00:00:50.970> changed<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.360> battery<00:00:51.690> shape<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
actually changed the battery shape so

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.740 
actually changed the battery shape so
you<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:53.160> wasted<00:00:53.550> 30<00:00:53.730> bucks<00:00:54.060> on<00:00:54.240> that<00:00:54.300> rotary

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you know wasted 30 bucks on that rotary

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.150 
you know wasted 30 bucks on that rotary
tool<00:00:55.490> and<00:00:57.440> wasn't<00:00:58.440> able<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.650> replace<00:00:58.950> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
tool and wasn't able to replace the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.760 
tool and wasn't able to replace the
battery<00:00:59.490> on<00:00:59.610> it<00:00:59.730> when<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.940> went<00:01:00.090> bad<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:01.410> went

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
battery on it when it went bad it went

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.110 
battery on it when it went bad it went
bad<00:01:01.980> in<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.190> way<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.610> wouldn't<00:01:02.820> hold<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
bad in a way that it wouldn't hold the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.170 
bad in a way that it wouldn't hold the
charge<00:01:03.360> for<00:01:03.750> any<00:01:03.930> length<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.350> time<00:01:05.060> you<00:01:06.060> know

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
charge for any length of time you know

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.590 
charge for any length of time you know
and<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:08.340> even<00:01:08.580> came<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.000> batteries<00:01:09.420> too

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
and it even came with two batteries too

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.730 
and it even came with two batteries too
and<00:01:09.720> they're<00:01:09.810> both<00:01:09.960> bad<00:01:10.259> actually

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and they're both bad actually

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
and they're both bad actually
but<00:01:11.369> anyway<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.759> this<00:01:12.000> looks<00:01:12.210> cool<00:01:12.479> it's

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
but anyway this this looks cool it's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.890 
but anyway this this looks cool it's
it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.580> ATP<00:01:14.580> sack<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.299> know<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.720> got<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it's a ATP sack you know so it's got a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.690 
it's a ATP sack you know so it's got a
lot<00:01:16.109> of<00:01:16.289> different<00:01:16.619> bits<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> stuff<00:01:17.429> you<00:01:17.579> know

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
lot of different bits and stuff you know

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.510 
lot of different bits and stuff you know
a<00:01:17.729> lot<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.119> stuff<00:01:18.329> I<00:01:18.509> probably<00:01:18.749> won't<00:01:18.960> use

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
a lot of this stuff I probably won't use

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.279 
a lot of this stuff I probably won't use
but<00:01:20.520> some<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.999> will<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
want to open up a wheel well you can use

want to open up a wheel well you can use
those<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.569> know<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> real<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> nice

those you know to get a real a nice
shape<00:01:29.179> on<00:01:30.179> the<00:01:30.390> wheel<00:01:30.539> openings<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.740> know

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
shape on the wheel openings and you know

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.200 
shape on the wheel openings and you know
there's<00:01:31.979> some<00:01:32.130> other<00:01:32.219> stuff<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.939> I'd<00:01:32.999> use

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
there's some other stuff in here I'd use

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.789 
there's some other stuff in here I'd use
to<00:01:33.359> grind<00:01:33.509> away<00:01:33.780> some<00:01:33.990> styrene<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.530> stuff

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to grind away some styrene and stuff

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.550 
to grind away some styrene and stuff
usually<00:01:35.460> these<00:01:35.819> rotary<00:01:36.149> tools<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.749> dart<00:01:37.229> PM's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
usually these rotary tools the dart PM's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.649 
usually these rotary tools the dart PM's
are<00:01:37.770> too<00:01:38.039> fast<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.390> biggest

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
are too fast that was my biggest

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
are too fast that was my biggest
complaint<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:41.340> find<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:41.969> go

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
complaint I could find one that would go

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
complaint I could find one that would go
down<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.479> six<00:01:42.840> hundred<00:01:42.899> rpms<00:01:43.649> would<00:01:44.340> be

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
down like six hundred rpms would be

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.709 
down like six hundred rpms would be
great<00:01:44.850> but<00:01:44.999> when<00:01:45.149> you're<00:01:45.270> turning<00:01:45.539> this<00:01:45.659> thing

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
great but when you're turning this thing

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.169 
great but when you're turning this thing
at<00:01:46.020> twelve<00:01:46.319> thousand<00:01:46.829> sixteen<00:01:47.219> thousand<00:01:47.729> rpms

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
at twelve thousand sixteen thousand rpms

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.779 
at twelve thousand sixteen thousand rpms
you<00:01:48.960> tend<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.289> just<00:01:49.380> melt<00:01:49.859> the<00:01:50.039> plastic<00:01:50.189> more

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
you tend to just melt the plastic more

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.620 
you tend to just melt the plastic more
than<00:01:50.969> sand<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> away<00:01:51.740> so<00:01:52.740> anyway<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.479> know<00:01:54.569> I

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
than sand it away so anyway you know I

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179

checked<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.200> package<00:01:55.560> over<00:01:55.709> nowhere<00:01:56.039> on<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
checked this package over nowhere on a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.590 
checked this package over nowhere on a
package<00:01:56.520> did<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.789> to<00:01:56.880> tell<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.179> RPM

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
package did is to tell you the RPM

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840 
package did is to tell you the RPM
rating<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.380> hopefully<00:01:59.069> it's<00:01:59.429> not<00:01:59.579> too

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
rating on this so hopefully it's not too

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.449 
rating on this so hopefully it's not too
fast<00:02:00.509> but<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.780> imagine<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:02.039> to<00:02:02.219> be<00:02:02.340> is

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
fast but I imagine it's going to be is

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:04.999 
fast but I imagine it's going to be is
it<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.389> one<00:02:03.509> speed<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.380> it's<00:02:04.709> off

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
it it's just one speed it's on it's off

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.029 
it it's just one speed it's on it's off
but<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.200> $10.50<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.439> think<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.709> could<00:02:07.889> go

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
but for $10.50 and I think I could go

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.309 
but for $10.50 and I think I could go
wrong<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:08.280> now<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:09.539> other<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.780> do<00:02:09.959> have

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
wrong right now my other I do have

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.620 
wrong right now my other I do have
another<00:02:10.560> real<00:02:11.370> nice<00:02:11.610> rotary<00:02:12.030> tool<00:02:12.240> but<00:02:12.420> again

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
another real nice rotary tool but again

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.580 
another real nice rotary tool but again

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
instruction book it does say sixteen

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.010 
instruction book it does say sixteen
thousand<00:03:09.030> rpms<00:03:09.600> which<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:11.150> fast<00:03:12.150> very<00:03:12.660> fast

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
thousand rpms which is fast very fast

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.650 
thousand rpms which is fast very fast
too<00:03:13.560> fast<00:03:13.890> but<00:03:14.250> what<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.300> gonna<00:03:15.390> do<00:03:15.630> I

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
too fast but what are you gonna do I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.300 
too fast but what are you gonna do I
guess<00:03:15.989> so<00:03:16.110> even<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.380> name-brand<00:03:16.590> ones<00:03:17.160> are

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
guess so even the name-brand ones are

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.979 
guess so even the name-brand ones are
like<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.700> too<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.239> let's<00:03:18.420> try<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.690> out<00:03:18.840> and

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
like that too so let's try it out and

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:26.000 
like that too so let's try it out and
see<00:03:19.790> who<00:03:20.790> we<00:03:20.970> got<00:03:21.150> here<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:22.140> ready<00:03:22.739> oh<00:03:25.010> that's

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
see who we got here it's ready oh that's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.970 
see who we got here it's ready oh that's
fast

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.479 

and<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.489> vibrates<00:03:32.060> Wow<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.480> use<00:03:33.599> it<00:03:33.780> for<00:03:34.489> too

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
and it vibrates Wow to use it for too

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.589 
and it vibrates Wow to use it for too
much<00:03:35.730> it's<00:03:35.940> gonna<00:03:36.060> put<00:03:36.330> my<00:03:36.450> hand<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.810> sweep<00:03:39.170> Wow

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
much it's gonna put my hand to sweep Wow

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.360 
much it's gonna put my hand to sweep Wow
yeah<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.379> vibration<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.159> unbelievable<00:03:45.370> let's

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
yeah the vibration is unbelievable let's

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.910 
yeah the vibration is unbelievable let's
try<00:03:46.639> some<00:03:47.049> you<00:03:48.049> know<00:03:48.170> one<00:03:48.319> thing<00:03:48.469> I<00:03:48.590> think<00:03:48.650> it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
try some you know one thing I think it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.069 
try some you know one thing I think it
might<00:03:49.099> be<00:03:49.129> is<00:03:49.430> simply<00:03:49.639> maybe<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.239> drum<00:03:50.569> that<00:03:50.870> I

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
might be is simply maybe the drum that I

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.780 
might be is simply maybe the drum that I
put<00:03:51.349> on<00:03:51.379> there<00:03:51.620> is<00:03:51.709> out<00:03:51.829> of<00:03:51.859> balance<00:03:52.129> because

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
put on there is out of balance because

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.509 
put on there is out of balance because
it<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:54.049> really<00:03:54.349> was<00:03:55.359> not<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:57.349> nicest<00:03:59.170> piece<00:04:00.170> of

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
it it really was not the nicest piece of

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.089 
it it really was not the nicest piece of
equipment<00:04:01.519> there<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.150> let's<00:04:02.299> see<00:04:02.510> if<00:04:02.599> we<00:04:02.629> can

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
equipment there so let's see if we can

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.240 
equipment there so let's see if we can
okay<00:04:04.870> take<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.989> drum<00:04:06.230> out<00:04:06.409> let's<00:04:06.709> see<00:04:06.920> if<00:04:07.010> some

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
okay take the drum out let's see if some

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.459 
okay take the drum out let's see if some
of<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.370> vibration<00:04:07.939> goes<00:04:07.969> away<00:04:08.450> oh<00:04:11.230> yeah<00:04:12.230> oh

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:12.469 
of the vibration goes away oh yeah oh

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.470 
of the vibration goes away oh yeah oh
yeah<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:13.129> vibration<00:04:13.700> was<00:04:13.790> actually<00:04:14.180> coming

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
yeah the vibration was actually coming

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.270 
yeah the vibration was actually coming
from<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.810> drum<00:04:15.379> and<00:04:15.590> stuff<00:04:15.829> so<00:04:16.009> I'll<00:04:16.099> probably

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
from the drum and stuff so I'll probably

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.699 
from the drum and stuff so I'll probably
maybe<00:04:17.120> buy<00:04:17.419> something<00:04:17.840> better<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.440> better

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
maybe buy something better a better

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.199 
maybe buy something better a better
attachment<00:04:19.459> something<00:04:19.910> that's<00:04:20.030> more

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
attachment something that's more

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.680 
attachment something that's more
balanced<00:04:21.039> it<00:04:22.039> still<00:04:22.370> vibrates<00:04:22.880> but<00:04:23.060> not<00:04:23.330> near

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
balanced it still vibrates but not near

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.189 
balanced it still vibrates but not near
as<00:04:23.840> much<00:04:25.030> the<00:04:26.030> way<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.210> was<00:04:26.360> man<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.080> was<00:04:27.169> like

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
as much the way it was man it was like

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.260 
as much the way it was man it was like
right<00:04:27.560> an<00:04:27.710> old<00:04:27.860> Harley<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.460> on<00:04:28.580> vibrate<00:04:29.150> you

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
right an old Harley and on vibrate you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.379 
right an old Harley and on vibrate you
to<00:04:30.310> vibrate<00:04:31.310> your<00:04:31.460> limbs<00:04:31.729> just<00:04:32.060> sleep<00:04:34.389> so

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
to vibrate your limbs just sleep so

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.400 
to vibrate your limbs just sleep so
anyway<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:36.169> know<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:37.400> is<00:04:37.550> what<00:04:37.729> it<00:04:37.849> is<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.410> get

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
anyway you know it is what it is you get

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.580 
anyway you know it is what it is you get
what<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.710> get<00:04:40.900> $10.50<00:04:41.900> I<00:04:42.080> guess<00:04:42.229> I<00:04:42.349> can't

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
what you get $10.50 I guess I can't

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.499 
what you get $10.50 I guess I can't
complain<00:04:42.740> too<00:04:43.099> much<00:04:43.250> but<00:04:43.699> like<00:04:43.789> I<00:04:43.849> said<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> will

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:44.509 
complain too much but like I said I will

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:50.680 
complain too much but like I said I will
replace<00:04:45.070> those<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.280> won't<00:04:46.460> used<00:04:48.190> the<00:04:49.449> bits<00:04:50.449> and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
replace those I won't used the bits and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.029 
replace those I won't used the bits and
stuff<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:50.930> came<00:04:51.229> with<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.470> cuz<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.889> it<00:04:51.949> was

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
stuff that came with it cuz that it was

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.320 
stuff that came with it cuz that it was
horribly<00:04:52.550> out<00:04:52.729> of<00:04:52.849> balance

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
horribly out of balance

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:01.189 
horribly out of balance
oh<00:04:54.669> well<00:04:57.099> until<00:04:58.099> next<00:04:58.250> time

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
like an almost a push-button type thing

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.239 
like an almost a push-button type thing
where<00:05:17.419> you<00:05:18.419> can<00:05:18.599> easily<00:05:18.810> disconnect<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.740> the

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:20.249 
where you can easily disconnect this the

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:21.640 
where you can easily disconnect this the
sanding<00:05:20.669> drum<00:05:20.849> from<00:05:21.180> it

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
sanding drum from it

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.989 
sanding drum from it
which<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.830> going<00:05:23.009> to<00:05:23.069> be<00:05:23.189> a<00:05:23.219> lot<00:05:23.430> easier<00:05:23.639> to

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:23.999 
which is going to be a lot easier to

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.689 
which is going to be a lot easier to
replace<00:05:24.449> them<00:05:24.749> and<00:05:25.249> probably<00:05:26.249> a<00:05:26.279> lot<00:05:26.400> more<00:05:26.430> but

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 
replace them and probably a lot more but

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:27.920 
replace them and probably a lot more but
they<00:05:26.789> honest<00:05:27.090> because<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.479> only<00:05:27.659> ones<00:05:27.840> you

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
they honest because the only ones you

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.969 
they honest because the only ones you
know<00:05:28.020> what<00:05:28.139> they<00:05:28.229> have<00:05:28.349> the<00:05:28.469> screw<00:05:28.800> in<00:05:28.889> the

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
know what they have the screw in the

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.749 
know what they have the screw in the
center<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:30.330> actual<00:05:31.279> washer<00:05:32.279> the<00:05:32.430> hole<00:05:32.580> in<00:05:32.669> the

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
center the actual washer the hole in the

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.129 
center the actual washer the hole in the
wash<00:05:32.939> was<00:05:33.180> originally<00:05:33.509> too<00:05:33.689> large<00:05:33.870> with<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
wash was originally too large with the

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.929 
wash was originally too large with the
screw<00:05:34.439> so<00:05:34.650> it's<00:05:34.770> really<00:05:35.219> easy<00:05:35.580> to<00:05:35.699> get<00:05:35.879> the

00:05:35.929 --> 00:05:35.939 
screw so it's really easy to get the

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.360 
screw so it's really easy to get the
washer<00:05:36.389> off<00:05:36.509> center<00:05:36.900> once<00:05:37.740> you<00:05:37.830> do<00:05:37.949> that<00:05:38.159> of

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
washer off center once you do that of

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.700 
washer off center once you do that of
course<00:05:38.759> you're<00:05:38.909> throwing<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.210> balance<00:05:39.539> off<00:05:39.749> so

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
course you're throwing a balance off so

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.230 
course you're throwing a balance off so
let<00:05:40.830> me<00:05:40.919> get<00:05:41.069> it<00:05:41.159> out<00:05:41.249> of<00:05:41.370> this<00:05:41.460> package<00:05:41.939> and

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
let me get it out of this package and

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.850 
let me get it out of this package and
see<00:05:42.479> if<00:05:42.569> it's<00:05:42.719> made<00:05:42.930> any<00:05:43.110> difference<00:05:43.289> on<00:05:43.740> the

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
see if it's made any difference on the

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.670 
see if it's made any difference on the
tool<00:05:44.270> you<00:05:45.270> know<00:05:45.389> because<00:05:45.629> it's<00:05:45.839> it<00:05:46.319> doesn't

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
tool you know because it's it doesn't

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.559 
tool you know because it's it doesn't
seem<00:05:46.889> too<00:05:47.129> bad<00:05:47.370> right<00:05:47.580> now<00:05:47.639> with<00:05:48.029> nothing<00:05:48.419> in

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
seem too bad right now with nothing in

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.820 
seem too bad right now with nothing in
there<00:05:48.779> so<00:05:49.729> it's<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:51.199> if<00:05:52.199> this<00:05:52.469> is<00:05:52.620> going<00:05:52.770> to

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
there so it's the if this is going to

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.399 
there so it's the if this is going to
help<00:05:52.949> on<00:05:53.129> a<00:05:53.219> vibration<00:05:53.879> anything<00:05:54.270> okay<00:05:55.259> we're
