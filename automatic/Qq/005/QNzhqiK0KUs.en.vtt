00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello scum I left early a 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.069
 this is breaking italy the shock and ve 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.269
 she went on Monday to Friday in which 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.269
 I'll talk about what's happening in the world 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.930
 the first news I wanted 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.640
 speak today the choice because in some 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.860
 way includes a criticism that comes to me 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.840
 move often is that I often find a lot 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.510
 superficial though to give me 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.550
 superficial indeed of the sexist is one 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.440
 a good part of those who criticize apples 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.320
 moves I want to talk about this woman 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.199
 this beautiful woman is called robyn 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.520
 Australian lawley and is a model like 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.540
 you can see from the picture like this 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.059
 apparently this woman does the 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.340
 model since she was 16 but a 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.680
 type of particular model ie one 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.450
 plus size model because according to 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.000
 company standards or we can say 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.820
 I don't really know about the rules of fashion 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.920
 this woman is a big woman and this one 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.190
 I take this thing from me 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.320
 throws into you misunderstanding why 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.250
 I don't know, let's talk about this woman 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.740
 apparently in the fashion world 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.390
 in fact women cannot be like this 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.130
 the model being sought a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.440
 higher different model more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.660
 slender less fortunate personally 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.970
 I also find it a little less sexy though 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.190
 this is the model and for me in that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.729
 meaning there is unless we get to 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.619
 two cases 1 when women in magazines ad 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.770
 example of ralph lauren are portrayed 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.869
 so and when these types of models that 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.340
 they are obviously wrong they become the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.950
 reflection of what is right 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.530
 being in society and the point is 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.569
 everything there is right to be not 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.789
 sexism and the use of the body for me 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.520
 these things are very distinct often 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.479
 I am attacked however criticized for 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.149
 the fact of being apparently 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.550
 obsessed with sex that I am not 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.190
 obsessed with sex is that I am a lot 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.899
 open to talk about it so I think 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.520
 continually to sex exactly like 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.770
 all other human beings on the planet 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.720
 only that I say it more often 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.349
 to make me smile or to make me 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.509
 to smile 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.540
 being so obsessed that the nail is 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.510
 fixed use often related news 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.730
 slash related slash photo slash cosplay 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.770
 slash whatever you find 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.030
 stimulating in this sense on breaking 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.980
 therefore today 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.959
 as open study speaks more than 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.709
 politics and less than boobs 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.840
 no no breaking italy is not the tg of la7 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.270
 is a review of the things you like 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.340
 to me and that I have decided to comment on is 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.110
 coincidentally I like video games 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.830
 i like politics i like la 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.450
 technology 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.310
 I like political science I like it 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.950
 the economy I like discussions 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.230
 ethical I like so many things but me 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.030
 also like things like this and not 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.690
 I feel at all diminished in the eyes 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.450
 of society 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.010
 if I say that this beautiful woman is 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.600
 sexually attractive and I like a 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.610
 sack because many say stein 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.800
 using sexism as a spring for 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.090
 draw attention I'm not 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.280
 using sexism i'm using 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.540
 sex sexism in the eyes of those 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.430
 look for me men are 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.319
 absolutely the same can be understood by everyone 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.610
 the other speeches I make men and 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.769
 women are equal have theirs 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.260
 differences is according to their differences 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.390
 we must protect in a different way 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.860
 so that they can then have the same 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.140
 possibility to the same rights and 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.819
 same duties and neither must 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.340
 be discriminated against for his sex 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.900
 so fine, for me, to welcome him 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.959
 men are also used for commercials 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.880
 like these or like these or like these 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.070
 and oh my god how possible to have a 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.049
 body so yes I know with training it 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.430
 I know that this thing is not the only one 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.530
 it is precisely that for some obscure reason 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.030
 socially these men do not come 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.620
 taken as a model by the overwhelming 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.660
 majority of the rest of the population 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.610
 male because you wouldn't mind 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.269
 have a physique like that but also cares 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.500
 cocks 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.970
 I like it in the world 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.519
 female the problem is much more 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.170
 heard and here the problem is not here 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.090
 it is not in the fact that I show you one 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.310
 photo allusive there is no problem there 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.620
 sexism there is sexism in the moment in the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.070
 which I say is right to be like this 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.900
 to be beautiful and not true it is obvious 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.220
 which is not true indeed as far as it can 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.630
 worth my opinion 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.310
 I reiterate it clearly I like them 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.440
 Every women 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.560
 I like women so I like them 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.019
 I like women so or so 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.459
 all women and personally I find 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.229
 also that there is something sick 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.479
 in the eyes of a society that takes 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.850
 this woman does it with photoshop 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:26.900
 to become so because oh my god now 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.370
 incredibly sexier but what but what 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.030
 it is with this I don't want to say ea 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.440
 let's jump on a couch and go 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.270
 cipster I am the first who 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.280
 constantly informed glasses in 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.830
 so pale on my blogs that 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.660
 despite having little time I try to keep 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.340
 a minimum in form and things of this kind 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.410
 but personally I like it though 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.360
 I don't have the pectorals or the arms of 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.010
 this man therefore for all the girls o 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.080
 even the boys who found the 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.030
 sexism every time in my desire 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.680
 often talk about sex than for how much 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.630
 I'm concerned it's a huge part of the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.250
 but our life cannot be talked about 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.480
 because someone is offended 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.520
 I found this news either 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.990
 interesting to give that interesting from 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520
 analyze to give birth to some 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.770
 discussion in the comments you know that 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.620
 I like both to say that I talk about 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.090
 sex is not equal sexism and it is not 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.980
 talk about boobs should not talk about 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.930
 culi is not talking about cpt not 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.640
 I would talk about abdominal juve 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.550
 also see abdominals and what not 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.560
 there are those who instead feel diminished by the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.580
 fact that it is the taiwan the show that after 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.720
 having talked to you about the economic maneuver 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.710
 who shows photos of a cosplay that 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.630
 he probably didn't understand what 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.850
 breaking italy is and has not grasped the 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.980
 concept of talking about things as if 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.480
 It was in the square and this scum 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.280
 all I had to say to you today 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.340
 I wouldn't want to talk so much about this 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.400
 what is it but then it all came out it 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:43.830
 show no no I do n't write it so much you know 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.530
 so this is all we close the 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.600
 week so I expect several things 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.310
 in the comments I know that some will not be 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.050
 at all agree with me and others will be 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.060
 very much agree with me and this is 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.920
 just the point the italy briefings drink 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.890
 your own idea that it is right or the 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:04.860
 my wrong or your irony 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:07.170
