00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Now we look at the application under 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 the name of the whale camera is 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.830
 so easy and simple to create 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.920
 photoglobes running the application we see 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.470
 absolutely nothing outstanding camera but 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.810
 this is completely wrong program just 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.529
 crammed with a variety of very cool 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.410
 chips 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.650
 on which now and see let's start here 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.710
 from this box in which there are 16 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:36.750
 lenses that add effects like 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 fisheye 3dm tilt-shift kaleidoscope white 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.300
 and many, many others are very cool 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 effects also in this box can 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 choose film 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.260
 There are 51 types of films available here. 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 which make your photos more 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.160
 stylish and unique and last 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.800
 what you can choose in this box so 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.980
 this is the frame for your photo all the frames in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.449
 The applications are very good and everyone will find 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.549
 frame your taste 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.560
 after all, there are as many as 40 of them here and up to the lens 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.860
 films and frames can be used 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.860
 at the same time 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.010
 we go further also in the application you will find 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.250
 such a possibility as control 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.910
 exposure and white balance in real 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.180
 of time 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:33.330
 honestly the chip is very cool and in 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.510
 other similar applications i still have this 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.970
 not seen also in the latest update 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.940
 added autofocus modes such as 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.250
 macro rate of air change modes 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.800
 by clicking on the name but it should be noted 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.619
 what works is all doing only when 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.380
 the fact that the focus is exposure at the same time 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.440
 separate as well as this function you can 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.610
 not found if you have installed 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:02.520
 version from below 7.0 now click here 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 this icon and what we see as we see 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.759
 as many as 11 variations of cameras and now 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.880
 consider each of them the first camera 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.459
 called h razin camera this is new 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.640
 video camera that allows you to save 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.690
 horizon during any bends device 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.880
 I think that with the arrival of this feature, no 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.860
 vertical video with black bars on 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.860
 the parties will no longer 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.020
 next is the video mode with the ability 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.600
 pause the video before 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.410
 You can choose the resolution for shooting video 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.140
 iphone 4s available three resolutions 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.360
 as well as in photo mode and video 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.810
 available to display such 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.530
 indicators like grid information from he 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.380
 exposure and exposure is also histogram and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.710
 and the level at which you can track 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.300
 to horizon in your photo so 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.300
 say did not roll 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.390
 goes on a photo mode where you like in 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.850
 video mode, you can choose the resolution 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.770
 for your photo and also 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.230
 take advantage of two interesting 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.480
 functions the first of which allows 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.880
 very high speed do 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.250
 photos but at the same time quality in themselves 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.950
 photos will not be very and the second 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:37.100
 allow you to shoot continuously 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:39.710
 photo go further we go 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.110
 stabilization section here we choose 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.989
 sensitivity to the triassic device and 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.480
 program when shooting photos will be waiting 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.520
 the moment when the device will be 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.610
 be in more or less condition 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.550
 calm and only then the photo will be 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.250
 done next goes the timer here nothing 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.530
 we set the right time for us to 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.830
 example 5 seconds and after that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.390
 Shooting comes next will be made 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.420
 multiple exposure point 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.640
 where for example three shots are made then 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.220
 they come together and it turns out 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.750
 pretty good effect further 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.600
 there is a multiset point 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.780
 here you can make collages by others 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.120
 words combine several photos in one 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.350
 The next item is quite interesting. 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.810
 it's timelapse 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.930
 With this feature, the program will be 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.390
 you take a photo of yourself 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.300
 interval for example every 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.010
 second and then all the photos taken will be 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.010
 combined in video 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.570
 further point is a long exposure 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.450
 here as it is clear by the name of this 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.870
 Item can take photos with 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.530
 long exposure to flesh to 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.770
 infinity next item 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.260
 White trail will allow a little play with 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.250
 light using this feature if you can 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.460
 put it that way 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.640
 you can draw light on a photo of that 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:23.200
 very cool and in the right hands 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:26.380
 It turns out just a masterpiece and the last 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:29.320
 item here it will start night shooting with 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.540
 Exposure of this second here such here 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.140
 cool what are the main useful features 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.920
 there is now consider the editor 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.440
 of images 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.200
 here are just incredible kits for 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.030
 editing the first thing you can do 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.030

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.810
 flip up or down goes further 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.570
 section where we can choose a lens film 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.870
 and the frame that we looked at 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:10.180
 early video 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.230
 here you can change the exposure as well 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.260
