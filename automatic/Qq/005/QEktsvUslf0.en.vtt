00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
moving the limbs around I can get rid of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.800 
moving the limbs around I can get rid of
the<00:03:43.380> segment<00:03:46.550> I'm<00:03:47.550> going<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.790> add<00:03:47.880> antenna<00:03:48.450> as

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
