00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.429
 Hello topic lesson 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.429
 broken application 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.510
 prepare everything you need 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.660
 Exercises how to make strips for 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.660
 broken application 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.930
 take the paper with both hands the fingers of both 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.820
 hands are very close to each other 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.820
 and start tearing 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.699
 if the fingers of the left hand hold the paper 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.539
 far from the edge of the strip got 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.510
 wide 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.510
 and if close to the edge is narrow 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.820
 in the technique break the application will fill 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.820
 jug drawing 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.820
 tear off the colored paper 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.520
 we put glue close to the contour of the pattern 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.490
 let's start doing the biggest application 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.290
 plot picture 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.470
 We apply a strip with the right hand to the edge 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.930
 applique press and and thumb 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.050
 left hand and cuddle well 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.800
 tear off the strip with the right hand so 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.360
 fill in 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 desired part of the picture 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.379
 it is very important not to go beyond the edges 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.379
 contour line pattern 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.760
 for application we use strips of two 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.760
 colors 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:39.629
 so consistently do all 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.629
 application 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.790
 broken application is very similar 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.790
 mosaic of new meetings
