00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.740

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:20.159
 hello people yes i have just come from the doctor 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.950
 because I hurt myself a bit 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:24.480
 so it's something broken but now 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.709
 half as wild it is a plaster that comes 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.239
 in a week off because I 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.230
 clumsily slipped on the ice 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.400
 But I was still fun 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.750
