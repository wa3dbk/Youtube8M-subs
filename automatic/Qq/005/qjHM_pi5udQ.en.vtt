00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.750
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.920
 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.509
 meet up for an experiment 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.469
 capillaries 

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.610
 in fact I do not know if you go to them 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.309
 mark and in the light of day 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.890
 but I did something to my 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.680
 hair actually I bought some powder 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.060
 rap who collaborated zone I got it 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.370
 is a mask that I left the place 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.500
 cannet therefore believe then that canteen 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.330
 you watch the videos 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.390
 I started making an infusion of 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.390
 chamomile 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.829
 and then weigh 75 g of rap powder 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.829
 we tick 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.440
 I then filtered and add a 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.440
 infusion of chamomile flowers 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.750
 I added a little hot water so 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.750
 to improve the texture 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.480
 I then add three big ones 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.480
 tablespoons of honey 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.550
 Yes 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.350
 toulon 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.450
 I found I did not have enough of 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.130
 preparation to put on the set 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.080
 of my hair and so decided to pour 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.400
 the rest of the story pack hic is 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.280
 so in total I used the 100 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.670
 grams of the package here is the texture to the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.670
 end of the preparation 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.579
 I hope this video will have you 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.349
 more and put you of course a picture 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.480
 before and after for you to have a 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.400
 overview of results 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:40.390
 for my part I find that it gives 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.879
 coppery highlights and a little warm a little 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.739
 Venetian blond and it's pretty I like it 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.739
 this is not a goodbye 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.890
 but
