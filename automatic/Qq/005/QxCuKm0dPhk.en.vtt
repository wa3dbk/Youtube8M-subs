00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.589 
just eyeball it instead of getting
measuring<00:02:45.019> cups<00:02:45.260> all<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.590> time<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.420> if<00:02:47.420> you

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
measuring cups all the time so if you

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.030 
measuring cups all the time so if you
want<00:02:47.780> to<00:02:47.840> follow<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.110> recipe<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.830> follow

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
want to follow the recipe you can follow

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.009 
want to follow the recipe you can follow
it<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.280> see<00:02:49.310> but<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.910> like<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.510> just<00:02:50.569> eyeball<00:02:50.989> it

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
it to see but I like to just eyeball it

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.319 
it to see but I like to just eyeball it
get<00:02:51.950> your<00:02:52.099> pesto<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:52.730> when<00:02:53.000> you're<00:02:53.120> using

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
get your pesto and when you're using

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.240 
get your pesto and when you're using
pesto<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.810> have<00:02:54.110> to<00:02:54.290> stir<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.620> up<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:54.950> well

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
pesto you have to stir it up really well

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.890 
pesto you have to stir it up really well
before<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.670> scoop<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.180> out<00:02:56.299> because<00:02:56.540> there's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
before you scoop it out because there's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:06.400 
before you scoop it out because there's
oils<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.440> separate<00:03:04.720> mix<00:03:05.720> everything<00:03:06.049> up

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
oils that separate mix everything up

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.390 
oils that separate mix everything up
really<00:03:07.160> well<00:03:07.819> I'm<00:03:08.500> mixing<00:03:09.500> everything<00:03:09.709> in

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
really well I'm mixing everything in

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.789 
really well I'm mixing everything in
increments<00:03:11.209> because<00:03:11.390> I<00:03:11.569> find<00:03:11.959> it<00:03:12.109> easier<00:03:12.260> to

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
increments because I find it easier to

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.280 
increments because I find it easier to
get<00:03:13.730> everything<00:03:14.000> incorporated<00:03:14.569> into<00:03:15.049> each

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
get everything incorporated into each

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.229 
get everything incorporated into each
other<00:03:15.470> if<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.769> do<00:03:15.920> it<00:03:16.069> in<00:03:16.190> small<00:03:16.519> sections

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
other if you do it in small sections

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.990 
other if you do it in small sections
make<00:03:18.170> sure<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.410> pound<00:03:19.010> out<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.400> tuna<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:19.730> little

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
make sure to pound out the tuna a little

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.610 
make sure to pound out the tuna a little
bit<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:20.299> that<00:03:20.329> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.750> break<00:03:20.930> up<00:03:21.109> those<00:03:21.260> large

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
bit so that you can break up those large

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.059 
bit so that you can break up those large
chunks<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.190> are<00:03:22.370> in<00:03:22.609> there<00:03:22.850> now<00:03:26.859> I'm<00:03:27.859> also

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
chunks that are in there now I'm also

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.479 
chunks that are in there now I'm also

they're<00:03:31.730> both<00:03:31.850> frozen<00:03:32.389> and<00:03:32.630> I<00:03:32.840> just<00:03:33.109> cooked

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
they're both frozen and I just cooked

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.050 
they're both frozen and I just cooked
them<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.680> microwave<00:03:33.980> real<00:03:34.280> quick<00:03:34.519> put

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
them in the microwave real quick put

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:46.800 
them in the microwave real quick put
them<00:03:35.180> in<00:03:35.299> there<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:36.310> mix<00:03:37.310> them<00:03:37.579> up

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.290 

and<00:03:46.900> don't<00:03:47.470> forget<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:48.069> check<00:03:48.550> on<00:03:48.700> your<00:03:48.849> pasta

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
and keep stirring it so it doesn't stick

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
and keep stirring it so it doesn't stick
to<00:03:51.370> each<00:03:51.489> other<00:03:53.430> when<00:03:54.430> your<00:03:54.520> pasta<00:03:54.849> is<00:03:54.940> done

comes<00:04:12.250> in<00:04:12.400> really<00:04:12.550> handy

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
comes in really handy

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.520

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
and I put a lot of pasta in there

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.640 
and I put a lot of pasta in there
because<00:04:21.880> we<00:04:22.389> like<00:04:22.570> a<00:04:22.720> lot<00:04:22.900> of<00:04:22.930> pasta<00:04:23.350> around

see how it's a lot easier if you mix

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.650 
see how it's a lot easier if you mix
everything<00:04:32.260> individually<00:04:33.010> and<00:04:33.610> then<00:04:33.850> mix<00:04:34.450> it

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
everything individually and then mix it

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
ingredients because if you were to just

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.290 
ingredients because if you were to just
throw<00:04:38.260> everything<00:04:38.620> in<00:04:38.889> a<00:04:38.950> bowl<00:04:39.070> at<00:04:39.340> once<00:04:39.639> you

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
throw everything in a bowl at once you

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.480 
throw everything in a bowl at once you
would<00:04:40.450> have<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.960> hard<00:04:41.169> time<00:04:41.410> mixing<00:04:41.950> all<00:04:42.430> of
