nothing<00:00:23.750> anyways<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.230> read<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> lot<00:00:25.619> about

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
nothing anyways I have read a lot about

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.400 
nothing anyways I have read a lot about
this<00:00:26.519> lately<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.119> apparently<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> daedric

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this lately and apparently the daedric

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.800 
this lately and apparently the daedric
armor<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:29.010> actually<00:00:29.519> stronger<00:00:30.029> before<00:00:30.210> so

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
armor was actually stronger before so

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.299 
armor was actually stronger before so
there<00:00:31.080> must<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.410> been<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.650> patch<00:00:32.040> or

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
there must have been a patch or

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.420 
there must have been a patch or
something<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:33.210> fix<00:00:33.480> this<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.800> see<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> in

something to fix this as I can see it in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
something to fix this as I can see it in
my<00:00:35.460> game<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> dragon<00:00:36.540> plate<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.930> stronger<00:00:37.469> now

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860

this<00:02:07.070> one<00:02:07.250> is<00:02:07.369> really<00:02:07.399> easy<00:02:07.880> and<00:02:08.300> there's<00:02:08.539> no

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
this one is really easy and there's no

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.020 
this one is really easy and there's no
doubt<00:02:08.989> about<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.319> the<00:02:09.950> spell<00:02:10.310> breaker<00:02:10.640> shield

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
doubt about it the spell breaker shield

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.880 
doubt about it the spell breaker shield
actually<00:02:11.239> has<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.720> same<00:02:12.050> amount<00:02:12.380> of<00:02:12.590> armor

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
actually has the same amount of armor

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.580 
actually has the same amount of armor
that<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.340> dragon<00:02:13.760> plate<00:02:14.030> shield<00:02:14.390> has<00:02:14.630> but<00:02:15.380> it

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
that the dragon plate shield has but it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.320 
that the dragon plate shield has but it
still<00:02:15.860> carries<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> special<00:02:16.670> effect<00:02:17.180> of

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
still carries a special effect of

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.180 
still carries a special effect of
protecting<00:02:17.930> you<00:02:18.080> against<00:02:18.290> magical<00:02:18.770> effects

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
protecting you against magical effects

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.280 
protecting you against magical effects
so<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.489> is<00:02:19.640> strictly<00:02:20.000> better<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:20.810> now<00:02:20.989> let's

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
so it is strictly better but now let's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.559 
so it is strictly better but now let's
get<00:02:21.410> into<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.650> weapons<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:23.030> two-handed

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
get into the weapons for the two-handed

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.840 
get into the weapons for the two-handed
weapons<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.170> have<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.530> try<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.860> with<00:02:25.100> trifecta

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
weapons you have to try it with trifecta

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.300 
weapons you have to try it with trifecta
the<00:02:26.239> hammer<00:02:26.510> does<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.110> most<00:02:27.470> damage<00:02:27.680> out<00:02:28.190> of

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
the hammer does the most damage out of

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.059 
the hammer does the most damage out of
any<00:02:28.580> other<00:02:28.910> weapon<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> game<00:02:29.989> but<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.860> is

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
any other weapon in the game but it is

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.400 
any other weapon in the game but it is
very<00:02:31.100> slow<00:02:31.760> on<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.390> other<00:02:32.600> hand<00:02:32.900> this<00:02:33.080> sword

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
very slow on the other hand this sword

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.699 
very slow on the other hand this sword
does<00:02:34.010> less<00:02:34.459> damage<00:02:34.489> than<00:02:35.450> both<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.019> Mays<00:02:36.470> and

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
does less damage than both the Mays and

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.000 
does less damage than both the Mays and
the<00:02:37.250> axe<00:02:37.430> but<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:38.480> much<00:02:38.870> faster<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:39.590> then

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
the axe but it's much faster and then

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.140 
the axe but it's much faster and then
obviously<00:02:40.160> you<00:02:40.489> have<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.730> middle<00:02:40.910> ground

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
obviously you have the middle ground

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.490 
obviously you have the middle ground
which<00:02:41.360> is<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.630> axe<00:02:41.780> which<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.230> an<00:02:42.350> average

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
which is the axe which is an average

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.509 
which is the axe which is an average
between<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.069> two

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
between the two

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.610 
between the two
oh<00:02:43.549> those<00:02:44.060> bodies<00:02:44.630> over<00:02:44.870> there<00:02:44.900> yeah<00:02:45.200> so<00:02:45.260> don't

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
oh those bodies over there yeah so don't

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.900 
oh those bodies over there yeah so don't
worry<00:02:45.830> about<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.190> that's<00:02:46.510> nothing<00:02:48.700> anyways<00:02:49.700> to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
worry about it that's nothing anyways to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.250 
worry about it that's nothing anyways to
actually<00:02:50.269> get<00:02:50.420> those<00:02:50.600> weapons<00:02:50.810> then<00:02:51.140> you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
actually get those weapons then you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.020 
actually get those weapons then you
could<00:02:51.410> simply<00:02:51.769> create<00:02:52.069> them<00:02:52.280> or<00:02:52.459> just<00:02:52.519> simply

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
could simply create them or just simply

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.240 
could simply create them or just simply
kill<00:02:53.269> dies<00:02:53.510> very<00:02:53.660> simple<00:02:54.290> now<00:02:54.560> two<00:02:54.620> weapons

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
kill dies very simple now two weapons

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.770 
kill dies very simple now two weapons
that<00:02:55.340> actually<00:02:55.730> do<00:02:55.910> want<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.150> mention<00:02:56.660> you

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
that actually do want to mention you

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.539 
that actually do want to mention you
have<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.140> button<00:02:57.590> stronger<00:02:58.070> which<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
have the button stronger which is a

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.880 
have the button stronger which is a
little<00:02:59.030> weaker<00:02:59.360> than<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.810> dad<00:03:00.049> remains<00:03:00.530> but

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
little weaker than the dad remains but

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.650 
little weaker than the dad remains but
it<00:03:01.100> does<00:03:01.430> give<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.970> special<00:03:02.329> effect

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
it does give you that a special effect

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.690 
it does give you that a special effect
now<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.049> effect<00:03:03.590> is<00:03:03.739> really<00:03:04.130> not<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.549> useful

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
now the effect is really not that useful

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.460 
now the effect is really not that useful
so<00:03:05.090> I<00:03:05.120> wouldn't<00:03:05.390> even<00:03:05.480> bother<00:03:05.810> trying<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.260> get

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
so I wouldn't even bother trying to get

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.170 
so I wouldn't even bother trying to get
this<00:03:06.680> if<00:03:06.829> you<00:03:06.950> could<00:03:07.070> just<00:03:07.280> simply<00:03:07.579> use<00:03:07.880> the

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
this if you could just simply use the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.849 
this if you could just simply use the
Daedric<00:03:08.570> mace<00:03:08.750> but<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:09.260> thought<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:09.709> worth

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
Daedric mace but I thought it's worth

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.380 
Daedric mace but I thought it's worth
mentioning<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.579> the<00:03:10.700> same<00:03:10.910> thing<00:03:11.180> goes<00:03:11.359> for

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
mentioning and the same thing goes for
