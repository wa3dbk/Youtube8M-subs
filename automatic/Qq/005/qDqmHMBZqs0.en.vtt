 the computer building and

 minecraft is so successful and because 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310

 soundtrack or even worse without having 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.420
 no story you'll clearly think 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.490
 that this game is not for success 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 opinions go to the trash

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.789
 of people 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.549
 the block creation game started 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.530
 extremely weak only with the 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.330
 to survive half the world without 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.370
 no one with animals and 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.190
 terrifying monsters over time 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.950

 the most famous and much more interesting 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.800
 how to explain success then this game 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.180
 with the style of visual so old-fashioned 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.580
 even though he is relatively 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.620
 maine craft addict still difficult 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.140
 explain why it is very relative to each 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.420
 a very important key piece in it 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.520
 for your success is your freedom in the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.160
 you need to explore a new 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.350
 world but a sure goal leaving

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.790
 it is clear that it is always necessary to 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.049
 survival first but 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.940
 You still have a lot of freedom.

 infinite minecraft this key piece 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.569
 also reminiscent of the same key piece 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.280
 the gta franchise where the user has the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.799
 freedom to explore the world the way 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.769

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.820
 important in the game so much that minecraft 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.220
 already deceives this idea as a great 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.080
 material repertoire does not lack items 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.990

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.010
 of minecraft like iron cubes
