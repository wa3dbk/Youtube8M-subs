Minnesota that is a tough pin Langa's is

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.360 
Minnesota that is a tough pin Langa's is
hanging<00:06:23.640> in<00:06:23.760> there<00:06:24.000> I<00:06:24.210> guess<00:06:25.010> the<00:06:26.010> way<00:06:26.160> some

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
hanging in there I guess the way some

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.830 
hanging in there I guess the way some
coaches<00:06:26.760> look<00:06:26.910> at<00:06:27.000> it<00:06:27.120> you<00:06:27.270> can<00:06:27.420> always<00:06:27.540> get

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
coaches look at it you can always get

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.190 
coaches look at it you can always get
him<00:06:29.000> three<00:06:30.000> points<00:06:30.360> near<00:06:30.540> fall<00:06:30.750> he<00:06:30.900> goes<00:06:31.050> out

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:31.200 
him three points near fall he goes out

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.220 
him three points near fall he goes out
front<00:06:31.500> 14<00:06:32.040> to<00:06:32.190> 0<00:06:32.430> you<00:06:32.730> do<00:06:32.940> not<00:06:33.090> add<00:06:33.390> the<00:06:33.780> point

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
front 14 to 0 you do not add the point

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.110 
front 14 to 0 you do not add the point
that<00:06:34.500> he<00:06:34.710> will<00:06:34.920> eventually<00:06:35.520> get<00:06:35.700> for<00:06:35.940> riding

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
that he will eventually get for riding

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.940 
that he will eventually get for riding
time<00:06:36.480> until<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:36.990> end<00:06:37.020> of<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.440> match

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
time until the end of the match

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.810 
time until the end of the match
so<00:06:38.370> it's<00:06:39.210> 14-0<00:06:40.140> one<00:06:40.530> more<00:06:40.830> point<00:06:41.250> needed<00:06:41.700> by

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
so it's 14-0 one more point needed by

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.380 
so it's 14-0 one more point needed by
Mike<00:06:42.060> thorn<00:06:44.510> takedown<00:06:45.510> would<00:06:45.840> end<00:06:46.050> the<00:06:46.290> match

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.390 
Mike thorn takedown would end the match

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.520 
Mike thorn takedown would end the match
with<00:06:48.390> a<00:06:48.420> tech<00:06:48.750> fall<00:06:49.050> for<00:06:49.710> Mike<00:06:49.860> thorn<00:06:51.530> thorn
