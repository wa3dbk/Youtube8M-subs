00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.000
 iii the galera the beauty that gives fame joão 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.070
 All right with you and one more new series 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.330
 on the channel and as you have already seen 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.699
 title will be meeting the characters 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:21.000
 This time I made the colossi 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.970
 so why not now of the characters 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.930
 this series will depend on the ride beck 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.960
 you 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.990
 What do you mean? 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.480
 of the characters of the floor of the colossus 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.660
 and if you like it when you're done 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.239
 these characters, I can put you in the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.059
 truth continues its series with the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.870
 characters of the games in general because 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.190
 I would have understood that you have a fuck character. 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.320
 who does not lack his own rockstar all gt a 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.199
 bulir is dead redemption they all have 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.899
 memorable characters and give a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.250
 excellent series that would be fixed in 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.770
 channel as it is 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 The mysteries of training, but at last 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.110
 ado let's go to the video 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.110
 first episode is obviously the under 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.530
 under or vander whatever 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.330
 a lot of people complains that I speak the under 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.390
 instead of Vander who would be right is the 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.620
 The next time I caught myself talking and 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.270
 I will always talk 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.510
 The important thing is that you know whose 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.369
 I'm talking then the under protagonist. 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.410
 of sherlock and colossus have hair 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.740
 red at shoulder height 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.710
 with a gray band and very blue eyes 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.920
 almost gray also he wears a shirt 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.619
 short sleeve is over it a cloak with 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.860
 symbol similar to points 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.450
 weak of the colossi on his arm he has 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.250
 rolled strips 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.700
 he also wears a pair of shorts until 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.300
 knee and finally wears blue and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.880
 green and with leggings throughout the game 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.670
 only appearance changes every 4 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.460
 defeated colossus your clothes will go 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 getting dirtier your skin paler 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.140
 your hair is growing 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.780
 clarifying and growing pair of 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.690
 horns in your head and it 's not because the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.660
 Mono betrayed him and yes the reason for it all 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.350
 is that the essence of sleep was entering 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.450
 no under every colossus he killed 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.400
 about the past of the under and nor its age 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.400
 are revealed in the game 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.980
 I think it must be between 17 and 20 and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.459
 so many years and he seems to be the same 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.680
 tribe or droid emo group and he from some 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.239
 shape was involved with a girl 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.340
 called monkey 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.580
 the only thing certain is that he loved 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.799
 it does not give much and to know and play 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.030
 does not say whether they are relatives or 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.640
 boyfriends 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.430
 Andrew is an excellent knight and father. 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.769
 riding on difficult terrain and your 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.190
 the familiarity with which he has 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.959
 and use it in agriculture is also one of the 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.840
 your highest qualities 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.890
 however he has some difficulty with the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.570
 sword 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.360
 you can even notice when people 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.780
 beats her without any enemy 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.720
 back the Anderson's blows very slow and 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.930
 clumsy the higher quality of under 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.140
 then would be your ability to 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.599
 it is obvious their courage even because 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.290
 to face in 16 colossus is not for 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.209
 anyone 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.510
 one maybe it is not the best terrain 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.549
 but he is determined to save the monkey 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.189
 at any cost 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.139
 the story of the andré begins when he 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.389
 enters these forbidden lands 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:44.689
 crossing the long bridge of his 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.889
 entrance on your water horse but before 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.349
 go there 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.230
 he had stolen a magic sword that 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.480
 in which it is the only one able to mark all 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.049
 the colossi of these forbidden lands 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.720
 andré is voiced by who genima jima is 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:02.510
 a fucking donor dudu who already dubbed 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.659
 a lot of thing between games and animes 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.389
 and it's the easiest job of the 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.939
 It was his world and in the low and north 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.819
 colossus some curiosities about the 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:17.509
 floor is that in the name of his translation 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.500
 japanese is wanda yes man 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:23.810
 wanda and that name was crudely adopted 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.479
 in the European version of the game 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.990
 unfortunately for our joy in the 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.720
 American version stayed under or vander 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.270
 Another interesting thing is that the team 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.699
 ico first wanted the year I 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.470
 had horns since the beginning of the game 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.479
 because of the rich 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.849
 only that idea was discarded soon in the 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.560
 beginning of the game because the 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:47.659
 producers were thinking that the game 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.000
 had a very direct and very 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:52.690
 with the rich and it is obvious that they 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.150
 they wanted an end to all that mystery 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.780
 and finally a confirmation and a 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.849
 curiosity that few people know 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.710
 following a final time that baby 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:06.680
 if there is anyone who still doubts that 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.770
 that's even under is it yes 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.720
 and you know why on the cat sine end of the game 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.720
 when the monkey goes in the secret garden 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.820
 together with the baby and cohagra when 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.550
 to roll the credits if you stay 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.120
 pressing r1 the child will start to 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.970
 cry face then that is still the under 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.880
 and we would be controlling him who 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.510
 I would tell uh until babe we would go 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.760
 play and then study I hope you 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.160

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.330

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.790
