dollar<00:06:47.160> amount<00:06:47.550> to<00:06:47.910> get<00:06:48.150> the<00:06:48.210> $30.00<00:06:48.990> you<00:06:49.170> know

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
dollar amount to get the $30.00 you know

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.170 
dollar amount to get the $30.00 you know
it'd<00:06:49.440> be<00:06:49.560> different<00:06:49.920> use<00:06:50.040> coupons<00:06:50.550> you<00:06:50.820> know

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
it'd be different use coupons you know

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.990 
it'd be different use coupons you know
because<00:06:51.360> it's<00:06:51.690> mix-and-match<00:06:52.070> but<00:06:53.070> anyways

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
because it's mix-and-match but anyways

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.440 
because it's mix-and-match but anyways
that<00:06:54.240> breaks<00:06:54.450> down<00:06:54.540> to<00:06:54.840> like<00:06:54.990> 319<00:06:55.800> each<00:06:56.190> on<00:06:56.640> the

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
that breaks down to like 319 each on the

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.230 
that breaks down to like 319 each on the
cat<00:06:57.660> litter<00:06:57.900> which<00:06:58.320> i<00:06:58.440> think<00:06:58.500> is<00:06:58.740> a<00:06:58.770> good<00:06:58.950> price

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 
cat litter which i think is a good price

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.960 
cat litter which i think is a good price
you<00:07:00.810> know<00:07:00.870> they<00:07:00.990> hit<00:07:01.080> on<00:07:01.200> sale<00:07:01.470> for<00:07:01.680> $5.99<00:07:02.400> the

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:02.970 
you know they hit on sale for $5.99 the

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.450 
you know they hit on sale for $5.99 the
regular<00:07:03.330> price<00:07:03.540> isn't<00:07:03.870> like<00:07:04.260> $9.99<00:07:05.010> I<00:07:05.040> think

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 
regular price isn't like $9.99 I think

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.230 
regular price isn't like $9.99 I think
or<00:07:05.910> something<00:07:06.530> anyway<00:07:07.530> so<00:07:07.650> the<00:07:08.550> excellent

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
or something anyway so the excellent

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.240 
or something anyway so the excellent
deal<00:07:09.390> on<00:07:09.600> that<00:07:09.630> as<00:07:09.990> well<00:07:10.230> because<00:07:10.770> it's<00:07:11.040> part

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
deal on that as well because it's part

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.720 
deal on that as well because it's part
of<00:07:11.340> the<00:07:11.430> cash<00:07:11.610> card<00:07:11.910> deal<00:07:12.090> so<00:07:12.900> I<00:07:13.320> think<00:07:14.160> that's

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:14.730 
of the cash card deal so I think that's

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.900 
of the cash card deal so I think that's
all<00:07:14.940> I<00:07:14.970> got<00:07:15.240> to<00:07:15.390> tell<00:07:15.630> you<00:07:15.950> I<00:07:16.950> don't<00:07:17.190> think<00:07:17.760> I'm

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:17.910

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.420
