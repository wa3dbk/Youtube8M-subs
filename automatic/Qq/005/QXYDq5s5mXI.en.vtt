00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
it's actually been so so for me it's a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
like using this purple shampoo I use it

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.960 
like using this purple shampoo I use it
after<00:03:40.510> shampooing<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.979> only<00:03:42.489> downside<00:03:42.940> of

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
after shampooing the only downside of

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.750 
after shampooing the only downside of
this<00:03:43.299> is<00:03:43.599> that<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:44.889> doesn't<00:03:45.099> really<00:03:45.310> condition

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
this is that it doesn't really condition

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.119 
this is that it doesn't really condition
my<00:03:45.909> hair<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.389> well<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:47.079> because<00:03:47.829> I<00:03:47.859> have

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
my hair that well and because I have

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.210 
my hair that well and because I have
super<00:03:48.729> dry<00:03:48.760> hair<00:03:49.359> because<00:03:50.260> it's<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.859> purple

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
super dry hair because it's a purple

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.979 
super dry hair because it's a purple
conditioner<00:03:51.849> it<00:03:52.030> really<00:03:52.510> doesn't<00:03:52.870> do<00:03:52.959> a

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
conditioner it really doesn't do a

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.069 
conditioner it really doesn't do a
really<00:03:53.709> good<00:03:53.859> job<00:03:54.599> conditioning<00:03:55.599> my<00:03:55.720> hair<00:03:55.750> so

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.559 
I always have to use a lot of oils or do
some<00:03:59.949> coconut<00:04:00.370> treatments<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.239> things<00:04:01.419> like

some coconut treatments and things like

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.809

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
that put some coconut oil treatments and

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.939 
that put some coconut oil treatments and
things<00:04:03.970> like<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.150> but<00:04:05.109> it's<00:04:05.290> okay<00:04:05.560> if<00:04:05.769> you

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:05.949 
things like that but it's okay if you

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.710 
things like that but it's okay if you
don't<00:04:06.069> have<00:04:06.310> very<00:04:06.609> damaged<00:04:07.060> hair<00:04:07.239> if<00:04:07.419> you<00:04:07.540> want

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
don't have very damaged hair if you want

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.479 
don't have very damaged hair if you want
to<00:04:07.780> give<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.079> try<00:04:08.290> you<00:04:08.379> can<00:04:08.739> it<00:04:08.949> is<00:04:09.310> on<00:04:09.459> a

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
to give this a try you can it is on a

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.610 
to give this a try you can it is on a
pricey<00:04:09.819> side<00:04:10.150> it's<00:04:10.510> about<00:04:10.810> twenty<00:04:11.229> dollars<00:04:11.590> or

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
pricey side it's about twenty dollars or

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.030 
pricey side it's about twenty dollars or
so<00:04:11.979> I<00:04:12.280> think<00:04:12.940> I<00:04:13.150> got<00:04:13.299> this<00:04:13.449> that<00:04:13.629> Ulta<00:04:14.079> when<00:04:14.949> it
