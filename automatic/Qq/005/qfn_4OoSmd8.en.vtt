flying device and Dwight uh a little bit
about<00:00:12.240> yourself<00:00:12.690> how<00:00:12.900> did<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.080> get

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
about yourself how did you get

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.079 
about yourself how did you get
interested<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.679> flying<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.190> then<00:00:14.849> look<00:00:14.969> we'd

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
interested in flying and then look we'd

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.660 
interested in flying and then look we'd
like<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> talk<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.929> little<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.160> very

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
like to talk a little about this very

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.849 
like to talk a little about this very
unusual<00:00:17.820> aircraft<00:00:18.449> how<00:00:19.320> did<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.500> get<00:00:19.619> started

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
unusual aircraft how did you get started

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.340 
unusual aircraft how did you get started
flying<00:00:20.210> far<00:00:21.210> as<00:00:21.330> interest<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.900> went<00:00:22.080> clear

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
flying far as interest that went clear

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.170 
flying far as interest that went clear
back<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.529> reading<00:00:22.949> stories<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.400> Wilbur

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
back to reading stories about Wilbur

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.269 
back to reading stories about Wilbur
Wright<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.570> grade<00:00:25.109> school<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:26.070> far<00:00:26.220> as

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
Wright in grade school and as far as

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.279 
Wright in grade school and as far as
getting<00:00:26.580> started<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.359> waited<00:00:27.750> too<00:00:27.900> long<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
getting started I waited too long I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.570 
getting started I waited too long I
didn't<00:00:28.710> come<00:00:28.830> out<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> airport<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
didn't come out to the airport and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.730 
didn't come out to the airport and
inquire<00:00:30.090> about<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.480> until<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:30.900> probably

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
inquire about it until I was probably

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.799 
inquire about it until I was probably
about<00:00:31.890> 21<00:00:32.489> or<00:00:32.610> 22<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.270> wished<00:00:33.420> I'd<00:00:33.540> done<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
about 21 or 22 but wished I'd done it a

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.139 
about 21 or 22 but wished I'd done it a
lot<00:00:33.899> sooner<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:35.130> I<00:00:35.160> know<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.460> fly<00:00:35.820> fixed-wing

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
lot sooner so I know you fly fixed-wing

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.069 
lot sooner so I know you fly fixed-wing
airplanes<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:38.430> airplane<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.420> or<00:00:39.960> this

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
airplanes but this airplane here or this

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.869 
airplanes but this airplane here or this
is<00:00:40.260> really<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.739> airplane<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.370> it's<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:41.850> a

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is really not an airplane and it's not a

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.720 
is really not an airplane and it's not a
helicopter<00:00:42.120> wait<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.399> what<00:00:44.399> do<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.520> call

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
helicopter wait what what do you call

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.139 
helicopter wait what what do you call
this

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
this

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.959 
this
this<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> gyrocopter<00:00:46.770> actually<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
this is a gyrocopter actually this is a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.170 
this is a gyrocopter actually this is a
Benson<00:00:48.629> gyrocopter<00:00:49.289> now<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.789> something

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
Benson gyrocopter now is this something

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200 
Benson gyrocopter now is this something
you<00:00:51.300> can<00:00:51.510> buy<00:00:51.780> or<00:00:52.079> did<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.410> build<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.210> you

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you can buy or did you build this you

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.459 
you can buy or did you build this you
can<00:00:54.329> get<00:00:54.449> them<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.660> kit<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.199> can<00:00:55.320> build

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
can get them in kit so you can build

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
can get them in kit so you can build
from<00:00:55.620> scratch<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.250> personally<00:00:56.879> bought<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.180> from

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
from scratch I personally bought it from

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.770 
from scratch I personally bought it from
someone<00:00:57.600> else<00:00:57.690> who<00:00:57.899> built<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.170> okay<00:00:59.719> how<00:01:00.719> does

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
someone else who built it okay how does

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.760 
someone else who built it okay how does
it<00:01:01.050> work

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
it work

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.529 
it work
it<00:01:02.070> doesn't<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> wing<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.149> airplane

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it doesn't have a wing like an airplane

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.710 
it doesn't have a wing like an airplane
but<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.290> not<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> helicopter<00:01:04.939> how<00:01:05.939> does<00:01:06.119> how

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
but it's not a helicopter how does how

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.340 
but it's not a helicopter how does how
does<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:07.020> fly<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.540> flies<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.110> Auto

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
does this fly it's what it flies in Auto

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.789 
does this fly it's what it flies in Auto
auto<00:01:11.070> rotation<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.930> helicopter

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
auto rotation which is what a helicopter

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
auto rotation which is what a helicopter
has<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.159> do<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.610> he<00:01:14.700> loses<00:01:15.000> his<00:01:15.090> motor<00:01:15.470> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
has to do when he loses his motor the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
has to do when he loses his motor the
wind<00:01:16.710> blowing<00:01:17.189> through<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.060> rotor<00:01:18.299> of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
wind blowing through the rotor of

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
wind blowing through the rotor of
passing<00:01:18.900> up<00:01:19.080> through<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.439> rotor<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.400> what

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
passing up through the rotor is what

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.460 
passing up through the rotor is what
makes<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> rotor<00:01:21.119> spin<00:01:21.479> there's<00:01:21.720> no<00:01:21.869> drive<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
makes the rotor spin there's no drive to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.649 
makes the rotor spin there's no drive to
the<00:01:22.590> rotor<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:23.490> than<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> started

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the rotor other than to get it started

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.170 
the rotor other than to get it started
spinning<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> then<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.369> wind<00:01:26.640> keeps<00:01:26.970> it

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
spinning and then the wind keeps it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.569 
spinning and then the wind keeps it
going<00:01:27.799> propeller<00:01:28.799> pushes<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> through<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
going propeller pushes you through the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.179 
going propeller pushes you through the
air<00:01:29.729> okay<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:31.170> got<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> pusher<00:01:31.799> propeller

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
air okay so it's got a pusher propeller

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.219 
air okay so it's got a pusher propeller
back<00:01:32.460> here<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.630> you're<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:33.900> forward

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
back here so as you're going forward

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.940 
back here so as you're going forward
this<00:01:35.009> blade<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.670> spins<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:37.290> blade<00:01:37.619> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this blade here spins and this blade is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030 
this blade here spins and this blade is
what<00:01:38.640> causes<00:01:38.909> lift<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> pusher

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
what causes lift so you have a pusher

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.359 
what causes lift so you have a pusher
propeller<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.329> now<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.079> fly<00:01:43.380> control<00:01:44.070> wise

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
propeller so now do you fly control wise

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
propeller so now do you fly control wise
like<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> regular<00:01:45.149> airplane<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.560> your<00:01:46.649> stick

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
like a regular airplane if your stick

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
like a regular airplane if your stick
here<00:01:47.189> which<00:01:47.369> gives<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.850> your<00:01:47.880> up-and-down

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
here which gives you your up-and-down

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.139 
here which gives you your up-and-down
and<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.049> right<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.380> left<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.030> your

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and your right to left and you have your

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.350 
and your right to left and you have your
throttle<00:01:51.570> over<00:01:51.659> here<00:01:52.020> yeah<00:01:52.619> pretty<00:01:53.070> much<00:01:53.360> your

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
throttle over here yeah pretty much your

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.600 
throttle over here yeah pretty much your
rudder<00:01:54.600> pedals<00:01:55.049> just<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.530> an<00:01:55.649> airplane<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
rudder pedals just like an airplane it's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.880 
rudder pedals just like an airplane it's
not<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.149> different<00:01:57.380> well<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:58.649> see

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
not that much different well I don't see

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
not that much different well I don't see
a<00:01:58.920> windshield<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.659> wear<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> helmet

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
a windshield on this you wear a helmet

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.350 
a windshield on this you wear a helmet
this<00:02:01.740> would<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.159> flying<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.640> motorcycle

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
this would be like flying a motorcycle

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.450 
this would be like flying a motorcycle
with<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> yeah<00:02:04.380> just<00:02:04.409> about<00:02:04.799> that's<00:02:05.219> what<00:02:05.369> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
with it yeah just about that's what the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.340 
with it yeah just about that's what the
glasses<00:02:05.700> are<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.299> keep<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> bugs<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
glasses are for keep the bugs out of the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.490 
glasses are for keep the bugs out of the
eyes<00:02:07.500> how<00:02:08.340> fast<00:02:08.670> do<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.879> fly<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.420> usually<00:02:10.410> run

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
eyes how fast do you fly I usually run

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.340 
eyes how fast do you fly I usually run
around<00:02:10.770> 55<00:02:11.569> 55<00:02:12.569> mile<00:02:12.810> an<00:02:12.900> hour

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
around 55 55 mile an hour

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.680 
around 55 55 mile an hour
what<00:02:13.860> kind<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.250> engine<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:14.880> horsepower<00:02:15.420> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
what kind of engine what horsepower and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.540 
what kind of engine what horsepower and
what<00:02:15.870> kind<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.080> engine<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.620> this<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.520> a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
what kind of engine is this this is a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.230 
what kind of engine is this this is a
Subaru<00:02:18.090> car<00:02:18.150> motor<00:02:18.770> 1800<00:02:19.770> CC<00:02:19.980> which<00:02:20.520> nowadays

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
Subaru car motor 1800 CC which nowadays

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.130 
Subaru car motor 1800 CC which nowadays
they<00:02:21.570> call<00:02:21.750> 1.8<00:02:22.350> liters<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:24.660> develops

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
they call 1.8 liters but it develops

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.970 
they call 1.8 liters but it develops
probably<00:02:25.620> around<00:02:25.890> 70<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.730> 72<00:02:27.240> horsepower

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
probably around 70 to 72 horsepower

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.590 
probably around 70 to 72 horsepower
Dwight<00:02:28.980> I've<00:02:29.190> seen<00:02:29.430> you<00:02:29.580> fly<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.480> it's

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
Dwight I've seen you fly this and it's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.270 
Dwight I've seen you fly this and it's
really<00:02:30.840> interesting<00:02:31.350> watching<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.830> fly<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
really interesting watching it fly and

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400 
really interesting watching it fly and
you're<00:02:32.670> gonna<00:02:32.760> demonstrate<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.630> us<00:02:34.260> here

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you're gonna demonstrate it to us here

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.050 
you're gonna demonstrate it to us here
in<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.530> couple<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.770> minutes<00:02:35.040> I<00:02:35.190> got<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> question

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
in a couple of minutes I got a question

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.810 
in a couple of minutes I got a question
how<00:02:36.420> safe<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:38.220> you'd<00:02:38.370> have<00:02:38.490> engine

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
how safe is this if if you'd have engine

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.850 
how safe is this if if you'd have engine
trouble<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.270> mean<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:40.230> don't<00:02:40.350> have<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.590> fixed

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
trouble I mean you don't have a fixed

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.750 
trouble I mean you don't have a fixed
wing<00:02:41.160> it<00:02:42.060> won't<00:02:42.270> glide<00:02:42.570> will<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.460> what<00:02:44.460> happens

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
wing it won't glide will it what happens

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.520 
wing it won't glide will it what happens
if<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.030> engine<00:02:45.270> quits<00:02:45.480> actually<00:02:46.320> it's<00:02:46.470> very

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
if the engine quits actually it's very

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.150 
if the engine quits actually it's very
safe<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:48.720> auto<00:02:48.900> rotation<00:02:49.380> all<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.920> time

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
safe it's in auto rotation all the time

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.890 
safe it's in auto rotation all the time
the<00:02:50.460> air<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:50.940> through<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.360> keeps<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.750> rotor

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
the air going through it keeps the rotor

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.230 
the air going through it keeps the rotor
spinning<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.520> descend<00:02:53.940> when<00:02:54.120> the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
spinning so as you descend when the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.100 
spinning so as you descend when the
motor<00:02:54.420> quits<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.350> blade<00:02:55.650> picks<00:02:55.890> up<00:02:56.070> speed<00:02:56.430> and

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
motor quits the blade picks up speed and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.330 
motor quits the blade picks up speed and
so<00:02:58.110> when<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.350> come<00:02:58.560> down<00:02:58.770> then<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.070> get<00:02:59.190> all

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
so when you come down then you get all

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.340 
so when you come down then you get all
this<00:02:59.520> speed<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.720> cushions<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.170> like

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
this speed and it just cushions you like

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.470 
this speed and it just cushions you like
a<00:03:01.380> wing<00:03:01.680> when<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.340> when<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.760> rotors<00:03:03.240> going

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
a wing when that when that rotors going

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.290 
a wing when that when that rotors going
around<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.170> wingspan<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:05.070> actually<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:06.000> area

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
around the wingspan is actually the area

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.150 
around the wingspan is actually the area
that<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.260> circle<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.770> this<00:03:07.950> thing

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
that of the circle that this thing

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.180 
that of the circle that this thing
swings<00:03:08.600> well<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.930> now<00:03:10.260> when<00:03:10.470> you<00:03:10.590> take<00:03:10.830> off<00:03:11.010> and

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
swings well so now when you take off and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.650 
swings well so now when you take off and
demonstrate<00:03:11.670> this<00:03:11.850> you're<00:03:12.090> gonna<00:03:12.180> take<00:03:12.450> off

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
demonstrate this you're gonna take off

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.660 
demonstrate this you're gonna take off
like<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> regular<00:03:13.110> airplane<00:03:13.650> but<00:03:14.400> when<00:03:14.550> you

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
like a regular airplane but when you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.240 
like a regular airplane but when you
land<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.210> can<00:03:15.420> almost<00:03:15.540> land<00:03:15.960> at<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.620> full<00:03:16.950> stop

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
land you can almost land at a full stop

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
land you can almost land at a full stop
like<00:03:17.490> a<00:03:17.520> helicopter<00:03:18.030> right<00:03:18.210> yeah<00:03:18.750> that's<00:03:18.960> you

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
like a helicopter right yeah that's you

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.320 
like a helicopter right yeah that's you
do<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> vertical<00:03:20.550> descent<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:21.030> can<00:03:21.150> come<00:03:21.300> down

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
do a vertical descent you can come down

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.050 
do a vertical descent you can come down
and<00:03:21.660> slow<00:03:21.810> as<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.990> want<00:03:22.020> with<00:03:22.590> power<00:03:22.830> in<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
and slow as you want with power in and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.120 
and slow as you want with power in and
you'll<00:03:24.240> probably<00:03:24.600> notice<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:25.410> won't<00:03:26.010> even

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
you'll probably notice that I won't even

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.800 
you'll probably notice that I won't even
pull<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.460> power<00:03:26.610> off<00:03:26.850> until<00:03:27.210> I've<00:03:27.300> actually

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
pull the power off until I've actually

00:03:27.810 --> 00:04:27.560 
pull the power off until I've actually
stopped

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.630 

you
