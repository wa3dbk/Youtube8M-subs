00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
little bit harder we can maybe make the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.120 
little bit harder we can maybe make the
challenges<00:05:07.930> like<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.199> little<00:05:08.410> bit<00:05:08.530> more<00:05:08.830> hard

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
challenges like a little bit more hard

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.670 
challenges like a little bit more hard
and<00:05:09.430> as<00:05:09.520> well<00:05:09.699> as<00:05:09.729> make<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.000> bots<00:05:10.389> harder<00:05:10.870> you

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
and as well as make the bots harder you

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.779 
and as well as make the bots harder you
know<00:05:11.740> we<00:05:11.830> can<00:05:11.919> do<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:12.039> lot<00:05:12.280> with<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.580> there's<00:05:12.729> a

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
know we can do a lot with it there's a

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:13.800 
know we can do a lot with it there's a
lot<00:05:12.910> of<00:05:12.970> things<00:05:13.180> you<00:05:13.270> can<00:05:13.419> do<00:05:13.510> with<00:05:13.600> it<00:05:13.660> and

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
lot of things you can do with it and

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.050 
lot of things you can do with it and
that's<00:05:13.930> why<00:05:14.050> I<00:05:14.080> like<00:05:14.199> it<00:05:14.440> there's<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.770> lot<00:05:14.889> of

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
that's why I like it there's a lot of

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.810 
that's why I like it there's a lot of
there's<00:05:16.060> no<00:05:16.210> boundaries<00:05:16.570> really<00:05:16.960> and<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:18.520> think

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
there's no boundaries really and I think

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.390 
there's no boundaries really and I think
that's<00:05:19.180> good<00:05:19.510> for<00:05:20.099> variety<00:05:21.099> of<00:05:21.220> different

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
that's good for variety of different

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.370 
that's good for variety of different
reasons<00:05:21.639> one<00:05:22.120> a<00:05:22.389> lot<00:05:22.630> of<00:05:22.750> people<00:05:22.930> a<00:05:23.139> lot<00:05:23.199> of

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
reasons one a lot of people a lot of

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.080 
reasons one a lot of people a lot of
people<00:05:23.889> of<00:05:23.979> different<00:05:24.009> skill<00:05:24.580> level<00:05:24.820> and<00:05:24.849> call

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
people of different skill level and call

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.839 
people of different skill level and call
duty<00:05:25.270> can<00:05:25.479> do<00:05:25.630> it<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:26.039> so<00:05:27.039> it<00:05:27.160> kind<00:05:27.310> of<00:05:27.370> levels

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
duty can do it and so it kind of levels

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.719 
duty can do it and so it kind of levels
the<00:05:28.090> playing<00:05:28.120> field<00:05:28.419> at<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:29.169> same<00:05:29.349> time<00:05:29.729> it's

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
the playing field at the same time it's

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.820 
the playing field at the same time it's
a<00:05:30.820> lot<00:05:30.940> of<00:05:31.030> fun<00:05:31.240> it<00:05:31.449> really<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.229> fun<00:05:32.590> and

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
a lot of fun it really is it's fun and

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.390 
a lot of fun it really is it's fun and
they<00:05:33.490> put<00:05:33.699> it<00:05:33.789> in<00:05:33.880> here<00:05:34.150> in<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.449> game<00:05:34.630> for<00:05:35.400> not

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
they put it in here in the game for not

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.650 
they put it in here in the game for not
really<00:05:36.580> a<00:05:36.610> reason<00:05:36.820> there's<00:05:37.090> really<00:05:37.240> no<00:05:37.419> reason

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
really a reason there's really no reason

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.089 
really a reason there's really no reason
so<00:05:37.960> we're<00:05:38.050> kind<00:05:38.199> of<00:05:38.229> putting<00:05:38.500> it<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.800> use<00:05:38.830> I
