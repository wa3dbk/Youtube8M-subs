00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.560 

I'm<00:04:33.200> playing<00:04:33.950> at<00:04:34.100> normal<00:04:34.400> difficulty<00:04:34.730> but<00:04:35.390> at

I'm playing at normal difficulty but at
the<00:04:35.690> purist<00:04:35.990> difficulty<00:04:36.380> you<00:04:36.920> have<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.070> few

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
the purist difficulty you have a few

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.220 
the purist difficulty you have a few
more<00:04:37.490> guards<00:04:37.820> patrolling<00:04:38.210> this<00:04:38.420> area<00:04:38.600> so

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
more guards patrolling this area so

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.170 
more guards patrolling this area so
coming<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.710> through<00:04:39.920> the<00:04:40.040> window<00:04:40.340> like<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:41.000> did

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
coming in through the window like I did

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.960 
coming in through the window like I did
is<00:04:41.420> not<00:04:41.870> really<00:04:42.290> an<00:04:42.380> option<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:43.610> keycard

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
is not really an option the keycard

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.600 
is not really an option the keycard
staircase<00:04:44.540> method<00:04:44.960> as<00:04:45.110> shown<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.770> episode<00:04:46.310> 6

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
staircase method as shown in episode 6

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.460 
staircase method as shown in episode 6
is<00:04:46.790> probably<00:04:47.390> a<00:04:47.480> better<00:04:47.660> option<00:04:47.990> for<00:04:48.260> getting

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
is probably a better option for getting

00:04:48.470 --> 00:05:51.100 
is probably a better option for getting
to<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:48.920> 8th<00:04:49.070> floor

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
and this should be kill number 10 but

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.930 
and this should be kill number 10 but
the<00:06:16.930> kill<00:06:17.110> counter<00:06:17.440> is<00:06:17.620> showing<00:06:17.950> 11<00:06:18.370> I'm<00:06:18.520> not
