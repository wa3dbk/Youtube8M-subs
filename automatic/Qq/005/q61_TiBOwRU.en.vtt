00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.790
 the singer of the stones 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.309
 very good to all youtube people 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.620
 subscribers we are here in a boxing 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.119
 the game spirit which we are going to 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.130
 present the cyborg keyboard version 5 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.950
 that of the saitec brand that we have 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.840
 gotten in some great sales and 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.390
 We thought it was worth it that you could 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.220
 see then the first thing we see here at 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.300
 open the box is the manual that comes in 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.540
 different languages 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.390
 how to use is the typical keys 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.970
 etcetera etcetera then comes a little bit 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.579
 of aitex ads that visit your website 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.280
 and in case we have any doubt a page 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.199
 complete with all distributors and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.560
 the repair places that there are then 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.590
 in europe in the world and so on 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.460
 The first thing we see when we open the box 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.170
 well it's here we find a 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.259
 rowing paddle is not a paddle rowing 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.070
 then we will see what it is for and then 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:12.409
 when opening underneath all the cardboard there what 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.689
 we have there is the keyboard 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.600
 process the in your freshly plastic 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.579
 bought good now we're going to move on to 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.729
 analyze more thoroughly the keyboard here what 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.729
 we see 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.960
 and this the shovel 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.159
 now we are going to explain to you that it is there 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.600
 You see that it has some small tiles that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.009
 they fit in 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.420
 and that are directly embedded in this 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.030
 part of the keyboard 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.500
 that is, when we have fitted it 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.430
 it would be such that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.620
 and it's a wrist rest 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.570
 for the long hours of play so that 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.940
 in the end we have no problem nor 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.940
 the fatigue here we see all the keys 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.360
 and we have a small problem that there is to 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.900
 side of the l on the Spanish keyboard yes 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.830
 Sir 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:12.680
 Do not worry if you press that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.450
 same key will come out one Ã± and then 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.450
 small faults like parentheses 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.220
 good and now we focus on the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.350
 buttons in the upper right corner 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.960
 there we have one that completely removes 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.330
 volume one to upload it and one to 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.820
 lower it and a fourth button on the right 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.130
 of all that is that little bulb and 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.490
 no it is not an idea now we will see what 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.490
 make 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.900
 there are three levels of lighting 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.709
 later on 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.709
 there we see it 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.920
 I was turned on 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.450
 loses intensity and turned off in case 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.290
 what we want is to save energy there 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.290
 there are three levels 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.769
 and then good as in any 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.219
 keyboard a key to go directly 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.219
 to the 'all star' of windows there we have it 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.910
 the biggest block key that also 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.240
 turn on a pilot each time the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.240
 we press 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.950
 there is 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.780
 and as last data because there we see the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.240
 two brands site and work 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.800
 well, here we see on the keyboard one 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.600
 basic dell which is what we have 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.550
 used to make this comparison what 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:45.290
 While fat is certainly the beginning 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:48.290
 and this one is completely smooth thanks to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 wrist rest 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.200
 and up to here the unboxing of this keyboard 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.760
