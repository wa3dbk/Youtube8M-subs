enhancing<00:00:43.559> combat<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.160> mod<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.399> compatible

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
enhancing combat the mod is compatible

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.430

with<00:00:44.879> almost<00:00:45.149> every<00:00:45.539> other<00:00:45.690> popular<00:00:46.110> combat

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
with almost every other popular combat

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
with almost every other popular combat
mod<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.370> while<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> use<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.270> alone<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

experience<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.090> think<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.390> will<00:00:51.480> work<00:00:51.600> better

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
experience we think it will work better

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360 
experience we think it will work better
alongside<00:00:52.079> some<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> more<00:00:52.800> heavy<00:00:53.010> combat
