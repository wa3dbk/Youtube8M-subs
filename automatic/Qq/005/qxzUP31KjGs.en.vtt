00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.520 

recently<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:08.880> read<00:00:09.240> an<00:00:09.420> article<00:00:09.450> where<00:00:10.019> Ben

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
recently I read an article where Ben

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.749 
recently I read an article where Ben
Bernanke<00:00:11.010> expressed<00:00:11.880> an<00:00:12.090> opinion<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:13.759> it's

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
Bernanke expressed an opinion that it's

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.720 
Bernanke expressed an opinion that it's
not<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> problem<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.900> yes<00:00:16.430> spends<00:00:17.430> too<00:00:17.699> much

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
not the problem that yes spends too much

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.390 
not the problem that yes spends too much
is<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.449> problem<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.840> China<00:00:19.500> saves<00:00:19.949> too<00:00:20.220> much

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
is the problem that China saves too much

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.990 
is the problem that China saves too much
which<00:00:21.000> contributed<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.590> low<00:00:23.189> interest<00:00:23.760> rate

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
which contributed to a low interest rate

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.300 
which contributed to a low interest rate
and<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.600> would<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.529> comment<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:26.130> that

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and I would like you to comment on that

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.670 
and I would like you to comment on that
yeah<00:00:26.939> well<00:00:27.269> Ben<00:00:27.689> Bernanke<00:00:28.170> has<00:00:28.199> never<00:00:28.529> gotten

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
yeah well Ben Bernanke has never gotten

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.560 
yeah well Ben Bernanke has never gotten
anything<00:00:29.039> right<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.880> guess<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.359> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
anything right and I guess that that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.590 
anything right and I guess that that
common<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.289> no<00:00:31.439> exception<00:00:32.660> but<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:35.190> know<00:00:35.600> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
common is no exception but you know that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.049 
common is no exception but you know that
we're<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.739> only<00:00:37.860> reason<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.370> we're<00:00:38.640> able<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
we're the only reason that we're able to

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.459 
we're the only reason that we're able to
spend<00:00:39.329> all<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.660> money<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.110> because

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
spend all this money is because

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
spend all this money is because
countries<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.219> China<00:00:41.550> loan<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.030> us<00:00:42.210> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
countries like China loan it to us I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.790 
countries like China loan it to us I
mean<00:00:42.570> obviously<00:00:42.690> if<00:00:43.140> they<00:00:43.170> didn't<00:00:43.530> loan<00:00:43.680> us

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
mean obviously if they didn't loan us

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.250 
mean obviously if they didn't loan us
the<00:00:43.950> money<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.280> couldn't<00:00:44.610> spend<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.809> but

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the money we couldn't spend it but but

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
the money we couldn't spend it but but
ultimately<00:00:46.820> you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
ultimately you know what what the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.060 
ultimately you know what what the
Chinese<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:48.960> doing<00:00:49.230> by<00:00:49.350> saving<00:00:49.680> their<00:00:49.920> money

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
Chinese are doing by saving their money

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.310 
Chinese are doing by saving their money
as<00:00:50.309> they<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:51.059> know<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.390> theoretical<00:00:52.050> II

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
as they are you know in theoretical II

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.220 
as they are you know in theoretical II
you<00:00:53.070> know<00:00:53.100> investing<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:54.140> building<00:00:55.140> an

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you know investing in building an

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.020 
you know investing in building an
economy<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:55.949> that<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.280> future<00:00:56.370> they'll<00:00:56.910> be

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
economy so that in the future they'll be

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
economy so that in the future they'll be
able<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.270> spend<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> lot<00:00:57.870> more<00:00:57.899> we're<00:00:58.559> indulging

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
able to spend a lot more we're indulging

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.590 
able to spend a lot more we're indulging
ourselves<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> present<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
ourselves at the present so in the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.939 
ourselves at the present so in the
future<00:01:00.780> working<00:01:01.230> out<00:01:01.350> we're<00:01:01.590> not<00:01:01.739> gonna<00:01:01.859> be

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
future working out we're not gonna be

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
future working out we're not gonna be
able<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.129> spend<00:01:02.309> very<00:01:02.430> much<00:01:02.550> at<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.320> but<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
able to spend very much at all but I

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.550 
able to spend very much at all but I
think<00:01:05.250> what's<00:01:05.610> happening<00:01:06.119> is<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
think what's happening is is it's the

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.770 
think what's happening is is it's the
Chinese<00:01:08.010> government's<00:01:08.729> monetary<00:01:09.240> policy

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
Chinese government's monetary policy

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
Chinese government's monetary policy
obviously<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.220> central<00:01:11.610> bank<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.090> China<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
obviously the central bank and China is

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.320 
obviously the central bank and China is
enabling<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:14.040> situation<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.150> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
enabling this situation because if the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.620 
enabling this situation because if the
the<00:01:15.780> Chinese<00:01:16.500> central<00:01:16.860> bank<00:01:17.630> simply

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
the Chinese central bank simply

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.140 
the Chinese central bank simply
refrained<00:01:19.080> from<00:01:19.490> pegging<00:01:20.490> its<00:01:20.640> currency<00:01:20.939> if

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
refrained from pegging its currency if

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.590 
refrained from pegging its currency if
they<00:01:21.299> let<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> RMB<00:01:22.110> rise<00:01:23.060> then<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> exchange

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
they let the RMB rise then the exchange

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.420 
they let the RMB rise then the exchange
rates<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> army<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.340> be

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
rates in it for the army would be

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.460 
rates in it for the army would be
significantly<00:01:27.060> higher<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:28.110> would<00:01:28.290> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
significantly higher and that would that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.560 
significantly higher and that would that
would<00:01:28.530> cut<00:01:28.890> off<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.670> source<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> our<00:01:30.240> spending

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
would cut off the source of our spending

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.690 
would cut off the source of our spending
the<00:01:30.930> reason<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.320> we're<00:01:31.439> able<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.340> buy<00:01:32.520> all

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the reason that we're able to to buy all

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
the reason that we're able to to buy all
these<00:01:32.850> products<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> because<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> government

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
these products is because the government

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.719 
these products is because the government
is<00:01:34.470> transferring<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> purchasing<00:01:35.579> power

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is transferring the purchasing power

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.330 
is transferring the purchasing power
from<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.360> Chinese<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.930> Americans<00:01:37.439> by<00:01:37.860> keeping

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
from the Chinese to Americans by keeping

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.179 
from the Chinese to Americans by keeping
the<00:01:39.000> exchange<00:01:39.420> rate<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> RMB<00:01:40.619> low<00:01:40.860> and

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the exchange rate of the RMB low and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.609 
the exchange rate of the RMB low and
also<00:01:41.939> their<00:01:42.090> lending<00:01:42.689> Americans<00:01:43.170> money<00:01:43.439> by

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
also their lending Americans money by

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
also their lending Americans money by
tapping<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> savings<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.149> their<00:01:45.540> people

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
tapping into the savings of their people

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
tapping into the savings of their people
and<00:01:46.020> transferring<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> United<00:01:47.310> States

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and transferring it to the United States

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
and transferring it to the United States
so<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> think<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.329> once<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.530> Chinese

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
so I think that once the Chinese

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.710 
so I think that once the Chinese
government<00:01:50.460> simply<00:01:50.670> stops<00:01:51.090> doing<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.570> and

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
government simply stops doing that and

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.840 
government simply stops doing that and
they<00:01:51.780> will<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.680> Chinese<00:01:53.220> currency<00:01:53.430> gains

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
they will and the Chinese currency gains

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
they will and the Chinese currency gains
value<00:01:54.119> significantly<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.470> you're<00:01:55.560> then

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
value significantly I think you're then

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.639 
value significantly I think you're then
going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.040> start<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.430> see<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:57.270> greater<00:01:58.110> spending

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
going to start to see a greater spending

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.469 
going to start to see a greater spending
on<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.250> part<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> Chinese<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.240> of

more affordable for the Chinese and the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
two minor Corrections one is that what

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.300 
two minor Corrections one is that what
Ben<00:02:25.350> Bernanke<00:02:25.980> said<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.680> 2003<00:02:28.680> for<00:02:29.100> I'm

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
Ben Bernanke said this is 2003 for I'm

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.949 
Ben Bernanke said this is 2003 for I'm
not<00:02:29.459> quite<00:02:29.910> sure<00:02:29.940> I<00:02:30.120> got<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.480> year<00:02:30.630> right<00:02:30.750> but

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
not quite sure I got the year right but

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.940 
not quite sure I got the year right but
some<00:02:31.440> years<00:02:31.709> back<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:34.080> principal

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
some years back was that a principal

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.320 
some years back was that a principal
reason<00:02:35.670> for<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> low<00:02:36.810> global<00:02:38.090> interest<00:02:39.090> rates

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
reason for the low global interest rates

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.420 
reason for the low global interest rates
which<00:02:40.080> were<00:02:40.230> very<00:02:40.470> low<00:02:40.650> then<00:02:40.680> was<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.100> high

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
which were very low then was the high

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.699 
which were very low then was the high
rate<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> savings<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.480> China<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:43.380> doesn't

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
rate of savings in China that doesn't

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:44.900 
rate of savings in China that doesn't
mean<00:02:43.800> they<00:02:43.920> were<00:02:44.010> saving<00:02:44.220> too<00:02:44.459> much<00:02:44.640> too

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
mean they were saving too much too

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.000 
mean they were saving too much too
little<00:02:44.940> from<00:02:45.480> their<00:02:45.630> own<00:02:45.780> point<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.739> view<00:02:46.800> they

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
little from their own point of view they

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.030 
little from their own point of view they
were<00:02:47.100> saving<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.459> lot<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.739> it's<00:02:49.739> sort<00:02:49.920> of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
were saving a lot and it's sort of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.620 
were saving a lot and it's sort of
axiomatic<00:02:50.580> if<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.000> have<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.330> savings

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
axiomatic if you have a lot of savings

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.120 
axiomatic if you have a lot of savings
in<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.019> world<00:02:52.230> interest<00:02:52.620> rates<00:02:52.830> come<00:02:53.100> down

real<00:02:53.670> interest<00:02:54.120> rates<00:02:54.330> come<00:02:55.050> down<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.470> that

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
real interest rates come down and that

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.949 
real interest rates come down and that
was<00:02:55.739> his<00:02:55.890> point<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:57.090> second<00:02:57.450> minor

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
was his point the second minor

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.570 
was his point the second minor
correction<00:02:58.440> I'd<00:02:58.590> like<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.920> make<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.340> Ben

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
correction I'd like to make is that Ben

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.650 
correction I'd like to make is that Ben
Bernanke<00:02:59.970> got<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> lot<00:03:00.330> of<00:03:00.360> things<00:03:00.600> right<00:03:01.430> what

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
Bernanke got a lot of things right what
