00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.070 

the<00:01:57.670> way<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:58.030> auction<00:01:58.480> house<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:58.780> set<00:01:58.960> up

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
the way this auction house is set up

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.410 
the way this auction house is set up
this<00:01:59.230> year<00:01:59.470> I'm<00:01:59.710> sure<00:02:00.040> there<00:02:00.310> are<00:02:00.340> 99<00:02:00.880> sharps

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
this year I'm sure there are 99 sharps

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.900 
this year I'm sure there are 99 sharps
up<00:02:01.630> but<00:02:02.470> none<00:02:03.040> of<00:02:03.070> them<00:02:03.280> are<00:02:03.460> showing<00:02:03.490> up

up but none of them are showing up

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.410 
up but none of them are showing up
because<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.950> way<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.160> can't<00:02:06.730> search<00:02:06.970> by<00:02:07.180> team

because the way you can't search by team

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.270 
because the way you can't search by team
because<00:02:07.810> they<00:02:07.960> have<00:02:08.110> every<00:02:08.500> team<00:02:08.710> as<00:02:08.860> legends

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
with a little boost on it to my

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.770 
with a little boost on it to my
knowledge<00:03:56.739> all<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.400> stats<00:03:58.000> are<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.300> same<00:03:58.510> on

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
knowledge all the stats are the same on

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.960 
knowledge all the stats are the same on
that<00:03:58.930> card<00:03:59.200> it's<00:03:59.440> just<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.800> the<00:04:00.489> boost<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.940> i
