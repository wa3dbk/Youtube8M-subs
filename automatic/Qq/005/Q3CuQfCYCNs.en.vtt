 hello and welcome to all 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.180
 on casserole had today a 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.529
 new introductory video that carries 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.760
 on a diet the brand new 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 700 gt by aerocool a model is 80 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.109
 more gold than we received in his 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.739
 version 1 700 be a diet that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.719
 will very quickly come to France with 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.910
 a three-year warranty of cables 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.809
 modular and a fan that this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.840
 quiet 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.550
 in 139 mm of course we will check 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.320
 all this in a very comprehensive test 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.789
 soon on cowcotland.com and in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.890
 waiting we invite you to watch 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.710
 this video to discover this all 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.059
 new model 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.879
 we start to turn this gt with 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.649
 the bundle that includes a cable 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.329
 feeding a the screws and we have 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.100
 also to both scratches who know 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.809
 first of all to maintain the cables 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.210
 precisely in the box and the cables 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.070
 modular power supply level 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.540
 cable we have the right to cables from 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.960
 type there rather classic so with two 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.240
 cables for PCI Express with 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.240
 6 8 pin connector 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:29.280
 we then find a cable that offers 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.070
 a flop a molex two sata on 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.869
 found another cable with 2 sata a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.130
 taking molex again 2 sata a molex 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.439
 of satin pardon molex and finally of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.299
 new molex and this aerocool has 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.740
 made the choice to always mixed the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.009
 molex plug and sata sockets 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.509
 immediately we discover the block 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.040
 this new block is rather very 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.540
 friendly at the level of the look in 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 particular with this little rounded and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.310
 so the unibody design of the plate 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.159
 which goes around the diet under 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.619
 the plate has a 140 mm fan 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.020
 who wants to be silent the logo lgt a 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.750
 grid design honeycomb type the 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.760
 painting 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 and she type hammered and it is rather 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.890
 very nice if we continue a little more to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.690
 the front we had a little sticker not 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.700
 necessarily the most beautiful and 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.950
 connectors for cables 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.480
 peripherals and pci express cables 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.770
 we see we have a number of 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.640
 cables that remain attached to 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.020
 supply 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.860
 we will find a cable a pin cpu a 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.440
 second cable 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:44.290
 what did you pin cpu to 1 24 pin and tx1 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.170
 pci express 6 + 8 pin and a second cable 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.790
 pci express 6 + sleeping here we see 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.709
 we are entitled to a water jacket 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.239
 classic dark enough since we see 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.370
 not the color of the cables through will do 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.140
 not too much and we have a term sheath at most 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.209
 a collar at the finish 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.120
 both sides classic and white backgrounds 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.730
 we have here the inscription with the name of 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.440
 model it's pretty well done finally in 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.250
 below are the features 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.530
 from the block and throw 700 sg in gold we 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.830
 proposes to 3 volts 3 of 24 years loses to 5 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.160
 24-year-old father's volts and two rails 12 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.320
 volts of 40 years each lose 3,684 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.750
 box we give you appointment very 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.239
 soon on cowcotland.com for the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.209
 complete test of this new block know 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.570
 if I succeed is good or not on this to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.570
