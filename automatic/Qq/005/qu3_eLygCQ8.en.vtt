hello welcome to simply scoober calm in
this<00:00:07.680> session<00:00:07.859> we're<00:00:08.099> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.309> look<00:00:08.370> at<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
this session we're going to look at the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.549 
this session we're going to look at the
echo<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:08.940> Chronos<00:00:09.420> regulators<00:00:10.019> let's<00:00:10.380> take<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
echo and Chronos regulators let's take a

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.689 
echo and Chronos regulators let's take a
closer<00:00:10.769> look<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.990> course<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.830> cultivated

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
closer look the course is a cultivated

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.720 
closer look the course is a cultivated
regulator<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.930> means<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.860> use<00:00:20.010> below

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
regulator so it means it's for use below

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
down on to the cylinder it just pushes

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.869 
down on to the cylinder it just pushes
it<00:00:39.420> back<00:00:39.710> opening<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.769> valve<00:00:40.979> obviously<00:00:41.760> when

it back opening the valve obviously when

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.969 
it back opening the valve obviously when
it's<00:00:41.999> taken<00:00:42.300> off<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.659> releases<00:00:43.409> back<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
it's taken off that releases back and

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.770 
it's taken off that releases back and
closes<00:00:44.339> about<00:00:46.579> the<00:00:47.579> design<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:48.210> layout<00:00:48.659> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
closes about the design and layout of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.860 
closes about the design and layout of
the<00:00:49.079> ports<00:00:49.589> is<00:00:49.799> slightly<00:00:50.190> unique<00:00:50.339> in<00:00:51.269> that<00:00:51.299> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the ports is slightly unique in that the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.709 
the ports is slightly unique in that the
high-pressure<00:00:52.469> ports<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:52.979> spaced<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.719> he

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
high-pressure ports are spaced out he

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.459 
high-pressure ports are spaced out he
got<00:00:54.959> to<00:00:55.829> low<00:00:55.979> pressure<00:00:56.129> on<00:00:56.969> both<00:00:57.299> sides<00:00:57.569> and<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
got to low pressure on both sides and a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.680 
got to low pressure on both sides and a
high<00:00:58.589> pressure<00:00:58.799> on<00:00:59.789> each<00:00:59.940> side<00:01:00.179> giving<00:01:00.569> you<00:01:00.659> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
high pressure on each side giving you a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.449 
high pressure on each side giving you a
total<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.289> four<00:01:01.589> low<00:01:01.739> pressure<00:01:01.979> and<00:01:02.280> two

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:02.459 
total of four low pressure and two

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.750 
total of four low pressure and two
high-pressure<00:01:02.819> ports<00:01:04.489> moving<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
high-pressure ports moving on to the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.230 
high-pressure ports moving on to the
second<00:01:06.030> stage<00:01:07.190> again<00:01:08.190> this<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> unique<00:01:08.880> design

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
second stage again this is unique design

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.440 
second stage again this is unique design
in<00:01:09.480> that<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.680> exhaust<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.730> actually<00:01:12.180> passed

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
in that the exhaust is actually passed

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.470 
in that the exhaust is actually passed
back<00:01:12.750> over<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> inlet<00:01:13.440> valve<00:01:13.650> helping<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
back over the inlet valve helping to

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.110 
back over the inlet valve helping to
heat<00:01:15.480> the<00:01:15.630> valve<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:17.640> prevent<00:01:17.880> any

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
heat the valve up and to prevent any

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.900 
heat the valve up and to prevent any
free-flowing

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
free-flowing

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.690 
free-flowing
again<00:01:20.910> it's<00:01:21.120> cold<00:01:21.330> water<00:01:21.480> balance<00:01:21.990> system

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
again it's cold water balance system

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.250 
again it's cold water balance system
says<00:01:23.700> obviously<00:01:23.970> great<00:01:24.420> for<00:01:24.450> Kabul<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> use

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
says obviously great for Kabul to use

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.630 
says obviously great for Kabul to use
and<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> give<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.520> great

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and it's going to give you great

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.930 
and it's going to give you great
performance<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.510> any<00:01:27.690> depth<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.790> number<00:01:29.790> of

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
performance in any depth a number of

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.450 
performance in any depth a number of
controls<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.050> the<00:01:31.860> side<00:01:32.040> we've<00:01:32.520> got<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.970> venturi

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
controls on the side we've got a venturi

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.000 
controls on the side we've got a venturi
adjuster<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:36.300> basically<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.770> adjust<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
adjuster it's basically just adjust the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.610 
adjuster it's basically just adjust the
flow<00:01:38.370> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.670> air<00:01:38.850> inside<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.480> regulator<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
flow of the air inside the regulator and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.610 
flow of the air inside the regulator and
it's<00:01:40.980> pre<00:01:41.190> dive<00:01:41.370> mode<00:01:41.580> or<00:01:41.850> -<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:43.080> forcing<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
it's pre dive mode or - it's forcing the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.800 
it's pre dive mode or - it's forcing the
air<00:01:43.740> back<00:01:43.980> to<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.160> diaphragm<00:01:44.810> helping

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
air back to the diaphragm helping

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.160 
air back to the diaphragm helping
prevent<00:01:46.050> any<00:01:46.260> free<00:01:46.409> flying<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.580> its<00:01:47.820> dive<00:01:48.810> or

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
prevent any free flying in its dive or

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.460 
prevent any free flying in its dive or
positive<00:01:49.890> mode<00:01:50.300> it's<00:01:51.300> basically<00:01:51.630> maximizing

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
positive mode it's basically maximizing

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.620 
positive mode it's basically maximizing
the<00:01:52.560> flow<00:01:52.800> to<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.850> mouthpiece<00:01:54.030> giving<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the flow to the mouthpiece giving you

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.980 
the flow to the mouthpiece giving you
great<00:01:54.840> performance<00:01:55.490> now<00:01:56.490> cooling<00:01:56.760> also<00:01:57.030> have

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
great performance now cooling also have

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.070 
great performance now cooling also have
a<00:01:58.110> lip<00:01:58.350> gars<00:01:58.620> on<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.220> regulator

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
a lip gars on this regulator

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.290 
a lip gars on this regulator
it's<00:02:01.080> basically<00:02:01.470> prevents<00:02:01.860> any<00:02:02.010> water

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
it's basically prevents any water

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.550 
it's basically prevents any water
swishing<00:02:03.300> around<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.780> lips<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.229> give<00:02:04.409> me

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
swishing around your lips and give me

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920 
swishing around your lips and give me
you<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.860> extra<00:02:05.159> comfort<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:06.630> give<00:02:06.780> me<00:02:06.870> a

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you that extra comfort just give me a

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050 
you that extra comfort just give me a
bit<00:02:07.110> more<00:02:07.140> warmth<00:02:07.590> but<00:02:08.310> if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.819> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
bit more warmth but if you don't like it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.460 
bit more warmth but if you don't like it
you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.479> actually<00:02:09.629> take<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.050> piece<00:02:10.289> off

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
you can actually take this piece off

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.179 
you can actually take this piece off
just<00:02:10.920> by<00:02:11.039> lifting<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.459> over<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> mouthpiece

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189 
just by lifting it over the mouthpiece
