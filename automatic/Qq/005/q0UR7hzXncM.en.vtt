both the slates start at $499 right now
although<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.510> do<00:03:30.720> get<00:03:30.870> extra<00:03:31.320> storage<00:03:31.620> space

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
although you do get extra storage space

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.070 
although you do get extra storage space
on<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.340> Aces<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.060> same<00:03:33.270> amount<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.750> money

but<00:03:34.620> at<00:03:34.770> least<00:03:34.950> prices<00:03:35.520> are<00:03:35.730> not<00:03:35.850> another

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
but at least prices are not another

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.180 
but at least prices are not another
criteria<00:03:36.900> we<00:03:37.140> have<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.470> consider<00:03:37.890> when

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
criteria we have to consider when

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.910 
criteria we have to consider when
comparing<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.850> iPad<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.930> Asus<00:03:40.350> vivo<00:03:40.710> tab

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
comparing the iPad and the Asus vivo tab

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.370 
comparing the iPad and the Asus vivo tab
all<00:03:41.700> this<00:03:42.000> being<00:03:42.210> said<00:03:42.360> it<00:03:42.780> might<00:03:43.110> look<00:03:43.320> like

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
all this being said it might look like

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.650 
all this being said it might look like
the<00:03:43.710> Asus<00:03:44.160> tab<00:03:44.400> can<00:03:44.670> do<00:03:44.790> what<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> iPad<00:03:45.480> does

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
the Asus tab can do what the iPad does

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.570 
the Asus tab can do what the iPad does
and<00:03:45.900> something<00:03:46.410> on<00:03:46.530> top<00:03:46.770> which<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.310> true

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
and something on top which is true

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.940 
and something on top which is true
theoretically<00:03:48.360> it's<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.320> as<00:03:49.530> good<00:03:49.770> as

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
theoretically it's just not as good as

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.350 
theoretically it's just not as good as
doing<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.400> things<00:03:50.640> most<00:03:50.820> people<00:03:50.970> do<00:03:51.330> on

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
doing the things most people do on

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.600 
doing the things most people do on
tablets<00:03:51.900> as<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:52.230> iPad<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.890> that's<00:03:53.430> why<00:03:53.580> I

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
tablets as the iPad is that's why I

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.640 
tablets as the iPad is that's why I
still<00:03:54.090> think<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.480> Apple<00:03:54.690> slate<00:03:55.110> is<00:03:55.290> going<00:03:55.530> to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
still think that Apple slate is going to

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.260 
still think that Apple slate is going to
be<00:03:55.770> a<00:03:55.800> more<00:03:56.070> suitable<00:03:56.460> pick<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.120> average

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
be a more suitable pick for the average

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.160 
be a more suitable pick for the average
consumer

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
consumer

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.530 
consumer
but<00:03:58.980> if<00:03:59.100> you<00:03:59.220> do<00:03:59.370> need<00:03:59.520> a<00:03:59.580> tablet<00:03:59.850> for<00:04:00.270> work

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
but if you do need a tablet for work

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.870 
but if you do need a tablet for work
need<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.350> productivity<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.310> those<00:04:02.490> pieces

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
need the productivity and those pieces

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.760 
need the productivity and those pieces
of<00:04:03.000> software<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.570> only<00:04:03.840> run<00:04:04.140> on<00:04:04.320> Windows

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
of software that only run on Windows
