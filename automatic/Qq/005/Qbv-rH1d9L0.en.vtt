00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 they are going to look for the quick goal and those 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.020
 are the first minutes where yes 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.900
 Honduras has the patience and stops 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.690
 It may be difficult for them that the 30 in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.139
 the first 30 minutes are the key to 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.139
 that match 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.200
 mentally everything was talked about work 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.790
 the mental part that the most important thing 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.730
 for a game that is believing nothing 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.740
 more hernÃ¡n is true that is that phrase 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.810
 they say they planted the legs there in 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.879
 the Aztec feels like I'm today the 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.770
 footballer is the following something is 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.949
 feel because he is not saying a hundred years ago 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.850
 thousand people for more than it is that it is a 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:46.059
 thing is to be scared and another thing is to feel 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.680
 get scared but feel the atmosphere if that 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.550
 it feels and that is not to be ignored for more 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.129
 that you are used to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.350
 that in the end they are human beings and it is a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.260
 pressure but it 's a pressure that you do not 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.930
 can play poorly and also well 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.600
 play well because when there are so many people 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.559
 Well, I speak on my behalf and part 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.570
 that they even get used to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 boys rather that has to motivate 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.859
 and Honduras as to play 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.979
 a team that go to press mexico to 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:17.399
 your court and wait for the 3 fourth from 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.479
 back to wait for a point I do not speak 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.789
 how he should play I speak like me 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:30.090
 I would play true because I do not want to get 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:32.250
 on roads but I'm telling you 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.319
 I speak like a simple amateur 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.659
 here we have our opinion five 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.399
 minutes to give them a sentence of encouragement 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.289
 or motivation to the catrachos players 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.880
 to tell them more I tell him that they will believe 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.860
 that will be to believe that the best are created 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.259
 and that I show you inside the court that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.369
 believe it nothing else that is a very phrase 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.869
 important that with that phrase if they what 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.869
 assimilate they could do a good job
