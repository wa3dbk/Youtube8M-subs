 which we ourselves constantly 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.289
 show the main question here 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 why do people act anyway 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.680

 hands on leaving the subway and don't let on 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.980
 second imagine the situation when 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.500

 suddenly in front of 5000 in fact we 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.680
 we can even predict his thoughts and 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.680
 the first bill from where we have here 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.539
 try not so who could be here 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 was here 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.540
 they are it I will substitute 3 is it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 you could have been mine 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.520
 the wallet does not have enough money and that's just 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.930
 when the customer is making sure everything is normal 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.700
 know what he will do he will raise 5,000 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.210
 we can guarantee it practically 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.830
 90 8 percent of 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.550
 I have you then you know amazing 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.510
 the secret is the conditions under which 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.009

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.170
 written on it. 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.180
 this piece of paper is actually from the point 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.860
 view of its composition is nothing 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.830
 different from the one that doesn't

 work out when you exit the subway at all 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.380
 the difference is why man period is these 1000 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.229
 bills guineas and a rose and it became very simple 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.110
