00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello girls how are you here I have everything 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.240
 prepared to make one of the recipes 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.800
 of fish that the family likes best 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.200
 this recipe is for people who 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.070
 he does not even like fish because 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.990
 they taste very rich and it's very very simple and 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.090
 it saves you a lot of time because what 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.460
 you can do it 's a matter of mixing 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.129
 put it in today that will show them 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.030
 now and put it in your rice cooker or 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.379
 your locker or in the oven so I'm going 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.350
 to show here the few ingredients 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.019
 what are needed and how to do it well 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.850
 I started and here I am my my six lemons 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:52.309
 what I have just done 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.190
 chopped 600 garlic I have here my cheese 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.909
 parmesan we're going to use media 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.979
 cup and I have my mayonnaise that we should 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:06.289
 use a cup I also have next 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.210
 salt and pepper and optional but I think that 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:09.799
 I encourage this time to do so 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.520
 use a cup of mozzarella cheese 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.070
 grated 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.820
 what we are going to do is very simple is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.310
 mix all your implements in a bowl 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.450
 - pepper salt and fish so 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.450
 I already have minimum there is no 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.820
 is to put sacks 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.170
 d 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.170
 my half cup of parmesan cheese 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.830
 and it does not matter if you spend a little bit if 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.380
 they want to put more for this the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.370
 graphic is more and maybe I'll put more 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.370
 because I love it 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.330
 a little over half a cup 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.540
 and a cup of mayonnaise that I do well 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.130
 super practical 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.130
 I do not have problems 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 s 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.120
 until it's done 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:40.340
 and then this is fine 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.939
 mixed they 're going to take out their fish that they do not 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.599
 they have to be completely 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:48.159
 defrosted may need 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.159
 simply that they can be separated 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.120
 and they will put them 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.450
 in the middle is paper and now what 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.370
 Let's do is create some little packages 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.819
 well we think we're going to put in the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.310
 oven or in the rice cooker 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.319
 it's very easy to do what they have to 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.319
 to do is grab your fish fillets 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.189
 and pour the mixture on both sides not 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.909
 be afraid to throw enough on the 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.909
 richest part 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.260
 and as I told you do not worry that the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.750
 fish is not completely 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.400
 thawed even that helps 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.400
 manipulate them and that I prefer that 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.570
 and there you can take a little bit of 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.570
 pepper to taste and with salt 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:57.040
 Y 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.040
 and then what he's going to do is extreme 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.390
 at the ends bending 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:09.489
 and create as a package according to this 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:12.489
 It's well sealed and I seem to like it 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.730
 what is this double of being part of 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.730
 above 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:22.850
 what they do is connect their rice 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.850
 aloft 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:37.800
 and they put it for two hours 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:37.800
 and I can simply put the packages 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.470
 A) Yes 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.660
 if you do me time to make them so that 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.960
 opening this up and you do not 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.960
 dripping 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:57.599
 we plug and wait two hours and two 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.180
 hours let's check that the fish 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.539
 be done too if you want to do this 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.819
 recipe from the oven can do it to 425 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:08.909
 degrees fahrenheit by about 20 in 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:11.460
 25 minutes if I'm not wrong 425 degrees 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:13.909
 fahrenheit is roughly 200 degrees 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.289
 centigrade I think it's 200 and 220 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.639
 can change is a bit but the 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.650
 question is what can you do and 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.720
 when they want and check their fish yes 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.710
 It's hard to lose what you lose 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.150
 I do is leave my today here two hours a 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.150
 a little rice a little salad
