00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.080
 we must say for the record that he has 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.509
 won rai with him because it certainly is 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.940
 true that I need to issue e 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.230
 it is not a question of rhetoric and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.059
 just the truth 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.639
 today according to me and raikkonen alonso e 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.890
 vettel showed the best 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.869
 remember, however, forget to give 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 an opinion on the mass maneuver is 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.600
 made a new full reason or not 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.810
 we give america to not forget you 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.150
 raikkonen now for me dear antonio that is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.120
 I haven't lost a second of usa gran 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.120
 reward for me the phrase from a certain point 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 dear fabio raikkonen with those of the team 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.410
 radio that said careful attentive search 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 to warm the tires he sent them to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.079
 that country 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 let me stay I think we do 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.950
 us when they tell us in headphones 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 exact close I know what to do if you want 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 being for kimi raikkonen is not the 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.110
 return to success with the lotus and make me 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.120
 obviously the last one comes to mind 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.050
 success of the lotus a certain 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.370
 ayrton senna 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 this is also a small story from 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.199
 tell yes because a team that has 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.760
 had several vicissitudes in reality it is 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.360
 the renault that it has become is 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.729
 become lotus but it is a young team 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.170
 with a truly great designer e 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 allison in my opinion is really 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.000
 promising with a car a lot 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.790
 competitive and then we talk about kimi 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 pilot raikkonen that just three years 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 that he had not won a grand prize had been 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.729
 away from the slopes two years and it is 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.100
 fantastic because he and then reiterated 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.380
 He said at a press conference and fair 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 that they tell me things and that they can 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.259
 be advice but can't tell me the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.299
 same thing 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.729
 twice in the same minute because me 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.409
 bothers and then also on the podium 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.570
 interviewee said I know you 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 you would like me to smile a little more 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.130
 but I am like that but that's okay 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.649
 cold we know it not even by chance the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.200
 nome sue su pronoun proper huysmans 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.490
 I'm here it melted with alonso between 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.500
 the other is pretty this thing of the past 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.210
 and the present that intersect and the 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.280
 ferrari on the podium and in any case I repeat 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.770
 I think I give everyone a 10 report card 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.969
 and three to rai with why he believed us 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.630
 was lucky 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.270
 if we want for the throw of m 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.040
 but he led to the great second alonso 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.690
 place started from the sixth position has 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.660
 made an amazing race and then 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.340
 sebastian vettel twice thoroughly 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.860
 deployment has since succeeded 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.140
 conquer the third position on cd 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.790
 now alonso's tweet also arrives 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.340
 but certainly it was a good advertisement 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.180
 spot for sonata no this no 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.560
 Grand Prix 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 really beautiful thanks thanks to 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:37.390
 evening antonio boselli or di lia scalda 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.810
 the tires tell me that the more because me 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.930
 I wanted to be read, fabio, leave me alone 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.910
 I know what I have to do so many crazy has 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.569
 won raikkonen is certainly not you 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.000
 the aspects 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.560
 let's say he lost hamilton alonso is 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.510
 arrived on the podium and you had that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.390
 expected here that fettel arrived fin 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.769
 I think it was hardly expected six 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.170
 very difficult I take you a moment 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.730
 counter-attack that is that otherwise passes into 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.099
 second floor what in my opinion is 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.959
 a huge company that is 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.180
 victory of chimera and yes it is right 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.340
 left out two seasons in the business 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.519
 rally has returned this year has won the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.959
 his first season of return 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.590
 something that failed even to 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.750
 schumacher who won seven titles 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.120
 11 and the mercedes has won a great deal 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.670
 prize but with nico rosberg 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.950
 I would like to underline it because raikkonen e 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.790
 to his victory as we see the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.519
 images of the race 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.950
 wins with the third different team reports 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.049
 the lotus to win an 80th grand prize 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.340
 victory for the lotus 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.290
 twenty-five years after the last great one 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.659
 Ayrton Senna's victory at the helm of 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.989
 that the car in detroit 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.000
 so if we go we must see how it goes 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.920
 the scary bang with karthikeyan that 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.150
 had broken the engine at that stage e 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.150
 rosberg 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.180
 must be given to raikkonen beyond then 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.099
 of the withdrawal of lewis hamilton to have 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.829
 made a great race to have made a 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.000
 great world because it wins on the day 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.739
 in which excluded from the struggle 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.700
 arithmetically for the conquest of 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:09.459
 title but with a lotus that certainly not 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.230
 was among the favorites for the conquest of 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.639
 title was said great machine but of 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.069
 certainly not among the favorites for the title 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.400
 is third in the world in front of 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.829
 two mclaren and before the red bull of 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.259
 weber said that in short it seemed to me 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.120
 right and proper to give the rai with 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.160
 in that which of raikkonen by the way 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.860
 then we also heard her teen 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.240
 radio when he said look at that 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.740
 suffer they told him to the tires 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.409
 She said the control look how 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.000
 I know what to do , I 'm here too combing 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:41.830
 dolls or remove ipad dark circles 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.479
 good so great great security no 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:48.250
 great feeling but zeru tituli 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.380
 what can you leave us only 16 then 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.449
 let it go that makes us know 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.960
 what we have to do if we want 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:05:01.120
 to criticize dynamics from mirai krhin 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.990
 and absolutely the man of the birthday boy 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.270
 in flip flops at the end of the race he is unlucky 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.370
 because back to win the only fact 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.650
 one of the competitions joining the others not 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.919
 where there is no sparkling wine on the podium is 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.060
 true but he works if he had it he had it 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.699
 Valentino Rossi said I would like to 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:22.690
 celebrate all night with rules of 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:25.650
 this choice is thanks to cats carlo c 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.650
 finished but we don't stop
