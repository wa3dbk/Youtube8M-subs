00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.550
 who 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.669
 05/04/11 for a new file 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.800
 you know it's often said that games 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 video render two years but that's 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 totally wrong no but it's a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.300
 exception no but they are not all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.770
 like that 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.180
 ok ok go on these good all gamers and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.710
 fucking psychopath for a day 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.690
 marathon 4 short all that to say that 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.379
 video games have a slight tendency to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.820
 to annoy us 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.589
 and yes who has never farted a cable in 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.269
 bursting on mega man demon's souls or 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.710
 still counter strike the video games 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.489
 can a big top barge and that's 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.809
 not that the war games they 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.339
 can do that even games all 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.020
 cute were banjo and kazooie can 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.360
 to make us fart cables for example 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.860
 of grundy who is the naughty of the game and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.140
 face our backups are so to do 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.270
 code one code it goes two codes that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 pass and 3 codes been more backup 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.910
 there are also some games that have 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.770
 been specially made to make you 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.420
 fart cables for example in limbo 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.160
 super meat boy makes us die of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.810
 suddenly we accumulate frustration 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.490
 then dump on our best friends 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.899
 the finding is clear video game we 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.310
 accustomed to violence that fortunately 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.840
 there are pegi that prevent all 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.399
 minors to play games classified less 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.899
 18 years besides peace it will take 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.610
 explain to me why black ops 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.099
 to decommission less than 18 and battlefield 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.869
 3 is downgraded -16 we do not know we do not 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:44.130
 know nothing in sambre in short all this for 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.360
 to say that 8-year-olds are 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 found to break for hours 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.369
 communist terrorists is it 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.170
 finally it's pretty cool 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.660
 and yes video games are an outlet 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.789
 a way to let off steam your colleague from 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.319
 work is relou do not get upset and 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.819
 dig on a game of zombies you 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.950
 sense anger goes up in you when you 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.509
 see the new dante's head no 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.149
 problem of you crazy about a simulation 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.349
 of surgeon then if one decompresses in 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.670
 playing video games why the 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.539
 media keeps banging on it as soon 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.069
 that there is a news item 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.540
 simply because these big con 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.400
 pretentious journalists do not have 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.230
 grown up with video games are not 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.180
 of their generation for them in a fps 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.989
 we're just beating up the terrorist and 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.270
 in a mmorpg 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.830
 we only play mmorpg they do not 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.780
 do not see the strategic side and still 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.099
 less the community side of the video game 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.480
 if we kill ourselves with logic say that the 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.040
 video games make violence and make the 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.170
 reasoning following all the cats have 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.020
 orgeat hairs that has hairs so 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.640
 Jacky is a cat and we can do 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.510
 the same with the gameurs of psychopaths 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.730
 play violent games 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.590
 gold gamers you too at the games 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.810
 violent so the psychopaths are 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.530
 psychopaths not the psychopaths play 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.719
 to violent games 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.250
 gold the gamer also plays the violent game 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.120
 so the gamers are psychopaths 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.049
 today almost everyone is playing 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.430
 to video games at the sea dogs on 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.379
 tablet smartphones obviously 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.340
 consoles and pc and even your grandmother 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.870
 play video games 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.250
 then obviously in the heap are 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.900
 crazy people who will do bullshit but 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.859
 it's not the fault of video games that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.269
 I find it strange that I'm typing 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.069
 quite often without the video game but 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.999
 finally rarely on the cinema it's 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.129
 weird yet there are scenes 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.540
 violent is the fight the bad 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.999
 faith on the part of journalists 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.950
 never forget to remember that the game 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.120
 video is above all a hobby of course 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.069
 more and more popular but that makes 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.299
 also office of scapegoat ben lo 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.680
 that's all for today I hope that 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.689
 it will please you I tell you hi everything 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.959
 the world carry you well and at the 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:23.959
 next
