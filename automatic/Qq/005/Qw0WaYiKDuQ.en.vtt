00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.920
 good i am give these blocked 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.660
 forgive me the bad joke 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.119
 I'm going to show you a little trick that 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.189
 allows minecraft 1.6 and versions 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.960
 later thanks to the inclusion of 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:25.090
 what is this called the carpet 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.640
 basically it's a very thin block in the 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.619
 that although we stomp we're going to hit 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.269
 with the block above 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:36.010
 however it hides what is below and 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:39.810
 allows us to step on firm ground that 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.290
 together that there are blocks that 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.870
 depending on where we're going it has more than 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.250
 a block but they have the physical height 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.650
 when they paint it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.750
 allows us to do things like this trick 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.740
 a door that we do not see but that we 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.740
 close the way 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.660
 some of you have imagined if they are 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.280
 the trapdoors really have metro and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.199
 medium height just like the fences 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 because they are meant to be put 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.360
 together they were given meter and a half to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.850
 the sheep the cows can not explode 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.869
 above but they are painted to a single 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.869
 meter high then 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.420
 combined with the carpet so you do not 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.770
 see and with a little bit of beef with 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.850
 activate it 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.979
 there as you can see I carry the signal from 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.650
 the left from a little reston that 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.090
 there's under the lever when you give it 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.340
 electric with the lever where it was 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.650
 up will energize the block of the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.979
 left of the whole the repeater takes the 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.869
 signal and then to the middle block and the 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.990
 block of the medium as the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.090
 high level by electricity the signal 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.090
 of rest to lay the next block 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.260
 and that little block of Reston opens 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.230
 the hatches on the right 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.179
 and in the rest and just below the lever 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.740
 open the hatch on the left 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.080
 disadvantages of this trick you can only 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.180
 make a door is two meters 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:17.150
 height advantages of this trick 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.700
 It depends on where you put it in 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.049
 players are not expected to be there in 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.049
 an adventure map in addition 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.180
 you could configure it so that the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.709
 player can not break it therefore 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.420
 you could do things like a maze 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:35.050
 invisible or other tricks like that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.430
 the truth is that I did not expect it came out 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.910
 to leave a thing that curious of the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.160
 carpets as usual there are favorites 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.269
 subscribe if you liked this if 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.510
 You want me to let you know when they are 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.580
 dislike things comments if you have not 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.450
 liked and because we see each other in the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.200
 next video see you later 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.370
