00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
like the diamond camo and you have to do

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.819 
like the diamond camo and you have to do

packs in the future we don't know yet
now<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:13.950> think<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> few<00:01:15.240> good

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
now I do think there are a few good

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.690 
now I do think there are a few good
camos<00:01:15.990> we<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.560> kamo<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.520> always

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
