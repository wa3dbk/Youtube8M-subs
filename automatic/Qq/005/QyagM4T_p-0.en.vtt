00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.190
 is not really cooking for me 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.509
 yesterday today tomorrow ago 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.070
 kitchens are modes of expression in 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.270
 the plate that make that one indulges 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.950
 in a plate but our 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.869
 personality our ip our all our 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.279
 love in a plate and I think that 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.169
 the only food she did the right 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.520
 10 yards today the passion 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.720
 motivation is the essential words 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.189
 every morning when I get up there is no 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.079
 not a single day I do not come with 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.390
 the smile with the same desire to come 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.960
 demont remaining a colder vocation 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.310
 is that good it is a vocation that goes 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.400
 not going in and maintenance but good 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:46.050
 let 's move on to want a lot of 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.050
 fun data and try to exist 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.710
 I think very frankly it's the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.910
 greed that guided me and then after 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.229
 from the height of his 11 years my relative 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.060
 offered paul market cuisine 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.390
 bocuse and there it was the element 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.420
 definitive trigger and passion 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.369
 had become a vocation and therefore of 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.740
 coup I embraced this career at these 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.360
 young since at 13 and a half I am 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.240
 already arrived in the first kitchen 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 who welcomed me at joseph delteil 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.360
 with the years we are forged and we 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.330
 cooking everything we've learned 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.930
 before and see for after integrating it and 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.960
 then go out their way but we do not 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.140
 can not become a leader 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.619
 inspired by people the people who we 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.450
 have trained 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.950
 that's obvious then very inspired by 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.899
 the products by the influences of 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.160
 journey after there are obviously great 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.410
 leaders who made me want to do this 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.149
 profession I have no real inspiration 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.710
 inspiration people supported to 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.899
 my children and my family finally I 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.020
 find my inspiration in those 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.960
 I love my mother taught me a lot 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.750
 because she was very handsome it was 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.540
 everything she could touch on the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.100
 rank of the sublime of a very product 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.660
 simple she was able to give a 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.250
 dimension that was really it was 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.630
 very good age built I think that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.040
 it's all the moms he needed 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.019
 7.75 is a marc so the ars 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.099
 motion those feelings it's this 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:24.079
 excesses are all that at once so 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.730
 today we make a dish the first 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.709
 question in any case that I ask myself 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.560
 it's not whether the club joly 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.439
 it's not about whether the mosses and 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.290
 to know if he will please 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.650
 to know if our real emotions to 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.650
 customers 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.950
 would like me to give to a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.390
 young who are in the kitchen that's 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.340
 especially not to throw in the kitchen 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.810
 without it burns my guts we go 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.240
 see what we have with this kit created 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.450
 the expression of the fact that this profession is 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:09.040
 wonderful and sharp because the contract 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.070
 generix zuccoli minaj was under the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.070
 waters 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.810
 okay so here it's still going 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.180
 as my nationality at least 10 minutes 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.410
 and a singer meets the world 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.490
 listen well the vosges had gone from 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.520
 words to barter the world of nemo cause 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.290
 you have to put the kids in this 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.940
 today's kitchen in the world where 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.590
 they city and that's not easy because 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.750
 that the requirements today are 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.490
 maybe even higher spoon and 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.140
 so you really have to go with them 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.850
 so that they can be tomorrow the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.620
 trainers who will progress in 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.390
 time I cook but what I want 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.390
 that they keep that cnla the act 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.940
