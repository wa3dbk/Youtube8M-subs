bead right down the ultra wire from one
side<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.439> other<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.119> then<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> take<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
side to the other and then I take the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.219 
side to the other and then I take the
back<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.380> spoon<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.780> simply<00:01:42.780> make<00:01:42.990> sure

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
that I go right down that wire and now

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.940 
that I go right down that wire and now
it<00:01:45.479> has<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> coat<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:47.180> fabric<00:01:48.180> paint<00:01:48.479> or

we're<00:02:20.820> simply<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.570> just<00:02:22.050> pull<00:02:22.980> out

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
we're simply going to just pull out

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.220 
we're simply going to just pull out
about<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.720> much<00:02:24.990> as<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.530> want<00:02:26.960> which<00:02:27.960> would<00:02:28.110> be

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
about as much as we want which would be

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.200 
about as much as we want which would be
about<00:02:28.350> maybe<00:02:28.890> an<00:02:29.100> inch<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.610> half<00:02:29.640> out<00:02:30.150> of

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
about maybe an inch and a half out of

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.300 
about maybe an inch and a half out of
the<00:02:30.450> package<00:02:30.960> just<00:02:30.990> like<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.560> was<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> popsicle

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
the package just like it was a popsicle

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.650 
the package just like it was a popsicle
and<00:02:32.760> we're<00:02:33.060> going<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.390> cut<00:02:34.550> those<00:02:35.660> fibers

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and we're going to cut those fibers

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.330 
and we're going to cut those fibers
straight<00:02:37.500> across<00:02:38.010> very<00:02:39.000> simple<00:02:39.450> process<00:02:40.340> that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
straight across very simple process that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.320 
straight across very simple process that
is<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> make<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.930> one<00:02:43.700> brush<00:02:44.700> right

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
is going to make about one brush right

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.010 
is going to make about one brush right
there<00:02:45.660> put<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.350> extra<00:02:46.620> aside<00:02:47.040> now<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
there put the extra aside now the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.110 
there put the extra aside now the
important<00:02:49.020> part<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.380> getting<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:50.120> spread

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
important part is getting this spread

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.570 
important part is getting this spread
out<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:54.780> let's<00:02:55.110> let's<00:02:55.560> make<00:02:55.770> sure<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:56.400> we

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
out so let's let's make sure that as we

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.040 
out so let's let's make sure that as we
lay<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.910> with<00:02:57.030> lay<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.450> middle<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:57.840> we

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
lay it with lay it in the middle and we

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.710 
lay it with lay it in the middle and we
start<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:59.100> feather<00:02:59.640> these<00:03:00.120> fibers<00:03:00.870> out<00:03:01.430> across

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
start to feather these fibers out across

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.380 
start to feather these fibers out across
the<00:03:03.720> entire<00:03:04.170> top<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.810> they're<00:03:07.050> even<00:03:08.390> we

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the entire top so that they're even we

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.390 
the entire top so that they're even we
don't<00:03:09.510> want<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.810> big<00:03:09.990> clump<00:03:10.350> because<00:03:10.890> then<00:03:11.190> that

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
don't want a big clump because then that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.350 
don't want a big clump because then that
the<00:03:12.180> wire<00:03:12.420> tends<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:13.050> bind<00:03:13.650> around<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.430> doesn't

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
the wire tends to bind around it doesn't

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.290 
the wire tends to bind around it doesn't
do<00:03:15.480> its<00:03:15.690> job<00:03:16.020> right<00:03:16.380> and<00:03:16.680> they<00:03:17.400> will<00:03:17.730> pull<00:03:18.060> out

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
do its job right and they will pull out

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.020 
do its job right and they will pull out
and<00:03:18.570> then<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.990> doesn't<00:03:19.200> do<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> brush<00:03:20.030> any

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
and then that doesn't do the brush any

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.810 
and then that doesn't do the brush any
good<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.720> we're<00:03:21.900> going<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.200> continue<00:03:22.610> to<00:03:23.610> lay

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
good so we're going to continue to lay

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.530 
good so we're going to continue to lay
these<00:03:24.030> out<00:03:24.270> on<00:03:24.690> here<00:03:25.020> as<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.380> can<00:03:25.410> see<00:03:26.540> trying

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
these out on here as you can see trying

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.630 
these out on here as you can see trying
to<00:03:27.660> make<00:03:27.810> sure<00:03:27.990> they're<00:03:28.260> pretty<00:03:28.530> even<00:03:28.830> right

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
to make sure they're pretty even right

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.350 
to make sure they're pretty even right
in<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.940> middle<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> looks<00:03:33.090> pretty<00:03:33.150> good

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
in the middle and that looks pretty good

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.100 
in the middle and that looks pretty good
now<00:03:33.960> we're<00:03:34.260> going<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.410> take<00:03:34.620> our<00:03:34.830> wire<00:03:35.990> run<00:03:36.990> it

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
now we're going to take our wire run it

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.180 
now we're going to take our wire run it
back<00:03:37.260> over<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.740> top

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.280 

attach<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:41.460> back<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.300> other<00:03:42.480> side<00:03:43.020> of<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
attach it back to the other side of the

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.089 
attach it back to the other side of the
machine<00:03:46.740> here

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
machine here

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.800 
machine here
and<00:03:48.939> start<00:03:49.810> put<00:03:50.499> a<00:03:50.530> twist<00:03:50.859> on<00:03:51.189> it<00:03:51.749> at<00:03:52.749> that

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
and start put a twist on it at that

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.129 
and start put a twist on it at that
point<00:03:53.409> I'm<00:03:53.769> going<00:03:54.310> to<00:03:54.400> drop<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.879> table<00:03:55.299> and

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
point I'm going to drop the table and

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.229 
point I'm going to drop the table and
there's<00:03:56.469> what<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.340> beginning<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.909> the<00:03:57.999> brush

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
there's what the beginning of the brush

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.929 
there's what the beginning of the brush
will<00:03:58.510> look<00:03:58.689> like<00:03:58.900> mine<00:03:59.499> is<00:03:59.680> done<00:03:59.889> by<00:04:00.129> hand<00:04:00.489> so

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:00.939 
will look like mine is done by hand so

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.629 
will look like mine is done by hand so
this<00:04:01.689> is<00:04:01.870> going<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.170> take<00:04:02.349> just<00:04:02.650> a<00:04:02.769> minute<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
this is going to take just a minute to

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.899 
this is going to take just a minute to
do<00:04:03.879> but<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.750> can<00:04:04.930> kind<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.260> see<00:04:05.500> now<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:06.069> it's

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
do but you can kind of see now that it's

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.349 
do but you can kind of see now that it's
doing<00:04:07.299> a<00:04:07.389> good<00:04:07.599> job<00:04:07.659> of<00:04:09.180> twisting<00:04:10.180> those

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
doing a good job of twisting those

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.729 
doing a good job of twisting those
fibers<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:12.719> locking<00:04:13.719> them<00:04:13.959> in<00:04:14.409> place<00:04:15.189> and

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
fibers and locking them in place and

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.310 
fibers and locking them in place and
they<00:04:17.739> make<00:04:18.009> these<00:04:18.220> in<00:04:18.519> a<00:04:18.699> lot<00:04:18.910> of<00:04:18.940> different

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
they make these in a lot of different

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.589 
they make these in a lot of different
formats<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:21.009> couple<00:04:21.759> have<00:04:21.910> big<00:04:22.090> pneumatic

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
formats a couple have big pneumatic

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:27.390 
formats a couple have big pneumatic
wheels<00:04:22.630> others<00:04:23.500> use<00:04:23.800> a<00:04:24.250> drill<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:26.160> hurry<00:04:27.160> this

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
wheels others use a drill to hurry this

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.200 
wheels others use a drill to hurry this
process<00:04:28.060> along<00:04:29.280> really<00:04:30.280> hasn't<00:04:30.729> bothered<00:04:30.880> me

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
process along really hasn't bothered me

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.770 
process along really hasn't bothered me
any<00:04:31.419> at<00:04:31.570> all<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:33.460> do<00:04:33.639> it<00:04:33.789> this<00:04:33.970> way<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.240> takes

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
any at all to do it this way just takes

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.430 
any at all to do it this way just takes
a<00:04:34.960> few<00:04:35.259> extra<00:04:36.009> turns<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:36.910> wrist

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
a few extra turns of the wrist

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.310 
a few extra turns of the wrist
now<00:04:38.550> I've<00:04:39.550> watched<00:04:40.360> a<00:04:40.599> lot<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:41.080> taught

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
now I've watched a lot of this taught

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.290 
now I've watched a lot of this taught
myself<00:04:41.500> how<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.949> do<00:04:42.190> it<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.430> just<00:04:42.460> keep<00:04:42.849> going

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
myself how to do it I just keep going

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.430 
myself how to do it I just keep going
until<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.800> wire<00:04:45.039> itself<00:04:45.550> breaks<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:47.050> it<00:04:47.289> is

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
until the wire itself breaks and it is

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.939 
until the wire itself breaks and it is
my<00:04:47.680> hope<00:04:47.710> in<00:04:48.250> fact<00:04:48.520> that<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.990> wire<00:04:50.320> will<00:04:50.650> break

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
my hope in fact that the wire will break

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.779 
my hope in fact that the wire will break
right<00:04:51.220> over<00:04:51.520> here<00:04:51.789> on<00:04:52.800> this<00:04:53.800> side<00:04:53.860> somewhere

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
grapefruit spoon with a piece of velcro

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.330 
grapefruit spoon with a piece of velcro
over<00:05:41.949> the<00:05:42.430> brush<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:43.060> basically<00:05:44.070> scruff<00:05:45.070> out

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
over the brush and basically scruff out

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.310 
over the brush and basically scruff out
any<00:05:45.639> of<00:05:45.849> those<00:05:45.969> fibers<00:05:46.509> that<00:05:46.659> are<00:05:46.719> wrapped<00:05:47.110> up

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
any of those fibers that are wrapped up

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.820 
any of those fibers that are wrapped up
around<00:05:47.830> there<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:48.930> from<00:05:49.930> that<00:05:49.990> point<00:05:50.409> time

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
around there and from that point time

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.149 
around there and from that point time
then<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:52.240> can<00:05:52.419> make<00:05:52.630> probably<00:05:53.080> depending<00:05:54.039> on

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
then you can make probably depending on

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.850 
then you can make probably depending on
how<00:05:54.340> big<00:05:54.580> your<00:05:54.699> fly<00:05:55.000> is<00:05:55.060> but<00:05:55.690> at<00:05:56.320> least<00:05:56.560> two

maybe three out of that brush right

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.230 
maybe three out of that brush right
there<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.409> you<00:06:00.340> can<00:06:00.490> follow<00:06:00.729> though

the<00:06:45.280> waters<00:06:45.639> right<00:06:45.880> now<00:06:46.060> so<00:06:46.360> there<00:06:46.900> you<00:06:47.080> go<00:06:47.259> I

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.500 
the waters right now so there you go I

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.999 
the waters right now so there you go I
think<00:06:47.949> that's<00:06:48.220> a<00:06:48.310> simple<00:06:48.639> concept<00:06:49.889> find<00:06:50.889> a

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009 
think that's a simple concept find a

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.430 
think that's a simple concept find a
machine<00:06:51.159> by<00:06:51.550> the<00:06:51.610> Machine<00:06:52.060> make<00:06:52.960> the<00:06:53.080> Machine

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
machine by the Machine make the Machine

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.800 
machine by the Machine make the Machine
have<00:06:54.280> your<00:06:54.430> buddy<00:06:54.639> Frank<00:06:54.940> make<00:06:55.210> one<00:06:55.389> for<00:06:55.659> you

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
have your buddy Frank make one for you

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.840 
have your buddy Frank make one for you
anyway<00:06:56.620> I<00:06:57.370> think<00:06:57.909> you'll<00:06:58.030> like<00:06:58.240> this<00:06:58.419> pattern
