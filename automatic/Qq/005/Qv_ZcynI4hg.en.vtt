00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.670
 Y 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.020
 good kids, well, we're here 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.090
 in another chapter, this time it's about 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.670
 new design of villages this time we are going to 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.290
 City Hall see a design level 9 and 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.689
 Well, this time it's going to be 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.450
 design of villages for war but it is a 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.759
 different new design and I good 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.960
 I think we may like it, I think 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.110
 It's going to look interesting and good as 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.649
 we already know war design is for the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.940
 war logically and well then what 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:42.559
 first you already know town hall in the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.480
 center and then around all the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.129
 defenses so well then I'll leave 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.339
 with the video and I hope that you go that you 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.050
 like it and well at the end of the 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.160
 creation of the village already the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.059
 we will comment on good 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.059
 we start with the video 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.970
 to me 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.420
 ah 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.880
 note 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.000
 ah 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.530
 why 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.110
 Y 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.100
 you guys, this is the village that I've 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.390
 thought for this for this video I 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.440
 Well, I think it 's a village 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.450
 balanced more or less symmetrical I have not 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.090
 done all the symmetric that I could 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.560
 the truth I think that the stampa are 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.040
 well placed thinking about the attacks 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.120
 aerial in the terrestrial ones and good therefore 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.470
 logically to this day there are very people 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.160
 good attacking and that surely if 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.890
 they want you to do 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:57.140
 one hundred percent and even but good the 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:07:00.920
 case is difficulty as much as possible 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.170
 have difficult or rare villages to see in 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.670
 in a good war, well, we make the rival 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.260
 you have to think the best another way 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.300
 how to attack because in many villages 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.160
 guys where rivals already know how 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.930
 attack them and well that's why I 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.310
 interesting is to make different areas and 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.260
 it's good that people are not 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.000
 used to see so that if they want 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.790
 attack have to try and have to 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.110
 good to spend war attacks and 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.970
 so I hope you liked it that way 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.320
 that one expects a little finger up I hope 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:28.150
 comments and good kids 

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.150
 see you in the next goodbye 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.940
 ah
