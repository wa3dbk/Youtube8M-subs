there<00:01:40.480> to<00:01:40.840> sort<00:01:41.050> of<00:01:41.170> add<00:01:41.890> resistance<00:01:42.490> at

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
there to sort of add resistance at

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.270 
there to sort of add resistance at
difficulty<00:01:43.510> again<00:01:43.930> focusing<00:01:44.410> on<00:01:44.530> like<00:01:44.770> for
