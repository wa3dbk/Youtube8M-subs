00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.820
 every beginning of the year couples who have 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.639
 school kids already know it's time 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.680
 to buy the material has huge lists 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.949
 procon released a price list 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.100
 some items reach more than 380 per 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.800
 between a stationery store and 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.480
 price difference when it comes to saving 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.780
 some tips are basic but the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.780
 main one is still searching 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.360
 were searched 117 item 5 stationery 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.850
 the survey indicated a variation of more than 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.210
 of 300% in the prices of some products 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.540
 among them the simple plastic ruler of 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.700
 30cm gift wrap 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.370
 small white rubber simple pen 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.140
 ball-point pen and paper as 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.630
 all our research indicates that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.670
 that consumer who seeks to 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.190
 search the end of purchases generates a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.560
 very important economy in this case and 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.979
 several items exceed a variation of 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.780
 300% is worth remembering that this in products 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:13.179
 similar in them the same ones 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.799
 specifications is like being a 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.109
 comparison parameter 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.969
 then the father be attentive, yes, the price 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.649
 but also in other moments the 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.460
 product quality 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.100
 the superintendent of procon ms 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.990
 and that there was a 6% reduction in prices 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.990
 calculated last year 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.330
 but this without taking into account 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.460
 products launched now but do not 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.409
 part of this group are products that 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.259
 it is not only if we compare the 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.820
 releases of 2014 the previous year 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.610
 there really is the increase that can 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.770
 up to 10% of the price variation 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.210
 between products alone is already a 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.550
 research incentive 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.440
 but there are other ways of saving 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.600
 the purchase of school supplies one 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.390
 alternative to avoid products with 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.450
 characters in this stationery a 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.450
 single 200 sheet notebook costs 12 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.979
 and 50 cents a notebook with the 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.929
 same characteristics 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.450
 only of a famous brand among 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.649
 teenagers leave for almost thirty 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.480
 four reais 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.040
 the Czech also in Brazil the kits for 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.070
 you buy everything for them they did not stay 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.050
 tempted by the child if I have 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.730
 And I know that well, you're the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.360
 father and mother arriving home in the material 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.220
 school 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.680
 they will be happy to see that 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.720
 new couple stuff if he comes here 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.850
 and saw the character see that my 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.579
 character is to learn and if he stays 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.500
 more upset then bring a tip to 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.860
 You got to choose those that go 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.500
 really know is to solve the situation there is 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.260
 of the child he can study 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.250
 adequately but without affecting the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.530
 pocket 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.590
 Another tip is to reuse materials such as 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.260
 scissors pointing ruler that can be 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.049
 used for more than one year also 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.450
 negotiate with the school a way to delay 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.370
 the delivery of some items from the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.750
 materials or products that you use 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.880
 all year long 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.430
 so if dad can talk to a 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.950
 with the school in the sense of negotiating looks 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.989
 which will be the most urgent to use 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.070
 early this year this title now 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.209
 in February 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.400
 but these others that I will not be 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.409
 Used now I'm going to buy and bring 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.920
 in April May June something like this 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:22.500
 It's good for him because he can 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.439
 we will call your analyst 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.599
 materials but it also gets better and is 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.060
 good for school because you will receive 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.280
 everything although fractioned but receive 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.200
 all the student will be harmed 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.189
 So this talk and negotiation is 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.069
 always important 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:39.810
 Juliana has three daughters clear of 5 years 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.569
 and alice of three are in education 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.299
 for them to pay a 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.220
 about R $ 500 for school 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.790
 which is in charge of buying the material 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.950
 necessary she only counted the backpacks but 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.440
 no character prints 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.519
 the girls only opined in color 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.099
 I always try to buy in advance 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.590
 but at the end of the year between November and 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.889
 December 1st that the battery also mazinha 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.420
 you already have is materials you can 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.709
 choose more peacefully 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.829
 a price survey with more 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.689
 tranquility and enjoy a bit 13th 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.790
 then that part of the 13th that you already 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.709
 purchase you also have a 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.160
 discount then you have all these advantages 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.039
 for the 8 year old Mariana there was no way 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.970
 textbooks that will be almost 11 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.340
 one thousand reais 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.270
 Julian, and a little corner to 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.460
 save money 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.870
 I consider that investment but not 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.300
 can not say that they really are 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.500
 then the advantage of deduction from the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.990
 income tax is something that I always 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.210
 I do not even every year I put it on too 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.280
 I already help myself but I also try to 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.539
 pay cash is to join to make a reservation 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.139
 I already know that I will have to spend 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.639
 that 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.060
 so this ends up being more 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.060
 advantageous
