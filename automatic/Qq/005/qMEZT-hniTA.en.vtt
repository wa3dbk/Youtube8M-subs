00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 Spon of 

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.420
 That's Belgium 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.590
 There is Berry chan on the homepage , but have you ever seen it 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.130
 Oh dear 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.020
 I have seen a bit 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.340
 It's a little bit of that bird There 's also Facebook, but how about that? 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.849
 Is it 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.410
 There is facebook is and never yet seen 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:30.240
 I know my sitter is still twitter 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.940
 twitter has been done by myself, but how often that side is doing 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.450
 Is it 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:40.330
 ー ー ー well to a friend 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:43.170
 So much you can do with the reply I can without hesitation Well the Tteyuu my tweet 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.410
 About that I updated my blog 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.489
 I'm not going 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.370
 Do blogs go for quite a while? Blogs have already been six years 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.870
 Hmm 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.870
 What kind of image is a blog 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.559
 Let's get women's soccer 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.340
 Italy etc 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.570
 To know the laser at 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.260
 Let many people know 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.640
 It is an opportunity to have started 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.480
 It is considered to be a coach now and that high 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.630
 Do you feel that you are including people to see 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.740
 How are you 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 I think that there are also difficult things 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.740
 Toka It's right that must be communicated or rather still very thing 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.890
 Kowatsu 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.040
 is there 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 It's very hard to say there is a choice of words 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.890
 While enjoying 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.730
 I'm doing 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.480
 That twitter who is really in many follower 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.380
 There are about 3000 people 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.880
 It is Suzaku 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.840
 Zhu also in Naa did Come has increased from about time 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.259
 Another words cup 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.300
 There other institutions I meeting also increased the bond during the period 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.300
 In that period 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.140
 You yourself there and if you do that side barely surprised this 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.100
 W 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.580
 Well turned up and down 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.960
 Not kill me 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.810
 There was an excuse for something like that 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.739
 7- 2 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:24.830
 Well then, let 's go back to that football story, but also the laser 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:29.380
 This season also but the rest it's a about half in Marnie 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.090
 What kind of feelings are you going to face for this game ? 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.450
 After all victory 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.930
 with everyone 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.510
 To the goal 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 I'll do my best, but there 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:49.010
 A good match can be better than putting out a word as a big goal 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.670
 Now that the speaking technique is important 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.660
 In the next game 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.660
 I want to win first 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.360
 I understand it hurts Thank you Thank you very much
