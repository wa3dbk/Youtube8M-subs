00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.119
 Cecilia get drid for those who 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.340
 know better under pseudo and 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.110
 today we are here for that I 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.419
 presents you with a mode called 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.700
 spotlight mode of finally anything 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.190
 so a spotlight mode rather here are two 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.000
 dead player model is so dead player 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.350
 mendes is a mode of who adds 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.360
 how to say the fact that you can 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.620
 turn you into something 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.210
 other because simple basic humans 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.710
 basically you're tired of being a 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.480
 human you can be one of some 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.370
 something else so anything 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.809
 really anything this mode adds 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.270
 another fifteen or so 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.370
 transformation in total then so he 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.750
 add the menu and 6 which is based 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.699
 precisely its transformation as well as 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 some animations that you will present 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.479
 thereafter so finally the few 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.330
 animations are mostly 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.070
 already present in forgiveness game but we 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.340
 can not use them anywhere 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.640
 how like the addition of week then 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.170
 so to start the f6 menu so for 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.600
 that I can present you everything we are going 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.280
 start with select skins so here is 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.979
 you have all the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.909
 transformations available so then we 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.780
 will start with loeb man then did 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.590
 the little dwarf wheels i'm going to say stupid 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.240
 but there are dwarves who do not keep 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.130
 so then when we are transformed into a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.930
 we see the camera they have gone down 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.520
 I'm not sure if it's noticeable 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.950
 does finally here so look at efs here at 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.140
 camera and bc we have peru and annabelle 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.829
 had beautiful parents of nabeul help 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.630
 here and so if we disable it 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.159
 we do our normal size finally the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.570
 camera is at its normal size but if 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.399
 we activate and have an impact example 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.420
 the camera will be smaller refocused on 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.060
 the character's view 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.509
 so here I said I'm pretty clear 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.509
 like this 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.590
 so had got back to our menu so 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.350
 he adds the naru that I said the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.190
 little black or another has a bad so 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.690
 by brown mount a dwarf female finally 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.940
 so a week in the week 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.050
 this is a helper who does not have a beard 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.470
 contrary to what people can 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.210
 tell 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.980
 he also adds embodying 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.990
 a human but besides two which one 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.180
 third of children he also has a 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.850
 elf so unlike the camera 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.830
 more at vik are bigger aof 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.050
 even if he has not much difference so on 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.620
 a little bigger 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.520
 an orca than a female orca to a 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.800
 orca so the big thing guen other 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.810
 arm that also changed yeah there on 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.720
 is a big thing when still brief 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.370
 so for the rest you have under chemical 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.140
 is a small dormant spreading 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 red and blue particles behind him 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.060
 to open as early as our era is well one 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.570
 of a classic dorman so called 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.950
 red berries particles but that's brief 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.200
 take me thunder chibi so it's huge 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.590
 chip walls to bunny females that is 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.640
 a little rabbit finally a little rabbit 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.560
 a black wolf the shadow to luri finally dragon 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.480
 dragon and who has wings and a 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.000
 who by the way I look and I'm going 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:42.860
 show in these particles agree 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.860
 so here's help it's not it 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.670
 the leopard finally blues by little 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.590
 Bunny so little rabbit we embody a 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.060
 little map a wolf that is bigger than 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.930
 the sticks would apparently and 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.370
 less sad people laugh but patrice 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.380
 succubes for the most naughty 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.940
 of you female zombies and hurt her 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.860
 cleuson can lived knowing us very 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.080
 well the skeleton also that we 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.180
 know the reaper at the ds spectrum 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.410
 which is put personally I like 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.480
 pretty good what did I do 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.430
 this is good so look we have not 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.850
 of arms we have weird species 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.829
 our hood 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:26.210
 in short, it's nice what I see 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.780
 the female lagahe cobra that perso 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.120
 I 'm doing a good job 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.560
 especially sorry we are watching 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.300
 our little tail that moves when we 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.669
 walk we really have a cobra head 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:42.259
 with the language that goes beyond but it does not 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:46.610
 must not be too much and that's it for 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:48.110
 the skins so then prove to the naive 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.120
 bender in namibia 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.150
 I already told you about it so it's the 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.560
 camera that moves according to your size so 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.840
 in cobourne is the same size as 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.850
 normal human all the tips wright then 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.260
 that's the fact of sustainability of the item 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.400
 the more the number of themes that appears 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.090
 lower right 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.460
 sorry on the bottom right of the screen so 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.620
 if there is opportunity to put up to 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.949
 left and off it of course 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.580
 that's it I let off no I'm going 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.930
 make sure you see a text here 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.460
 local hated is server as command is 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.000
 a feature that does not really 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.030
 important 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.979
 so we will use a palace in camera 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.039

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.740
 skin at 0 finally your skin base but 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.970
 this mode since 1.417 know 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.070
 unfortunately some bugs 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.099
 I do not know if it works for you 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.180

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.180
 do not work I would look stupid 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.020
 in short, they should correct it 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.789
 soon as he is regularly 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.930
