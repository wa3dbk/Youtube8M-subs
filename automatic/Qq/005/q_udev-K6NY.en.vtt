haven't seen it in action based off the
name<00:00:36.510> out<00:00:36.630> assume<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.530> sort<00:00:37.920> of

score streak that like flies around and

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
score streak that like flies around and
you<00:00:40.950> tagged<00:00:41.250> people<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.149> know<00:00:42.239> it's

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you tagged people with it you know it's

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.209 
you tagged people with it you know it's
like<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.719> recon<00:00:43.200> drone<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.710> salaciously

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
like a recon drone and salaciously

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
like a recon drone and salaciously
you<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.489> highlight<00:00:44.879> enemies<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.079> map

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
you know highlight enemies on the map

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.080 
you know highlight enemies on the map
for<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.070> teammates<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.579> things<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.879> that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
for your teammates and things like that

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
for your teammates and things like that
and<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.329> probably<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.660> assists<00:00:48.989> for<00:00:49.530> for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and you probably get assists for for

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.590 
and you probably get assists for for
when<00:00:49.890> they<00:00:49.980> kill<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.390> just

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
when they kill them but but that's just

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.090 
when they kill them but but that's just
a<00:00:51.719> guess

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
a guess

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.130 
a guess
next<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.280> at<00:00:53.460> four<00:00:53.730> kills<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.239> 400<00:00:54.750> points<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
next up at four kills are 400 points is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.680 
next up at four kills are 400 points is
the<00:00:55.320> UAV<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.340> obviously<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the UAV we obviously know what that is a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.660 
the UAV we obviously know what that is a
next<00:00:58.170> step<00:00:58.379> we've<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.800> aerial<00:00:59.219> assault

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
next step we've got the aerial assault

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.660 
next step we've got the aerial assault
drone<00:01:00.000> for<00:01:00.510> 450<00:01:01.469> scores<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.160> not<00:01:02.370> exactly

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
drone for 450 scores so I'm not exactly

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.609 
drone for 450 scores so I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:03.120> what<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
sure what this is but I think this is

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590 
sure what this is but I think this is
kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> quadrotor<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:06.210> might<00:01:06.450> have

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
kind of like a quadrotor we might have

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000 
kind of like a quadrotor we might have
seen<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.020> yesterday's<00:01:07.590> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> like

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
seen it in yesterday's kind of like

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.039 
seen it in yesterday's kind of like
preview<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> Atlas<00:01:09.119> scourge<00:01:09.420> multiplayer

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
preview of the Atlas scourge multiplayer

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.140 
preview of the Atlas scourge multiplayer
maps<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.610> does<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.030> can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
maps but I think what it does is you can

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.030 
maps but I think what it does is you can
flat<00:01:12.479> around<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.930> shoot<00:01:13.140> enemies<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.890> it's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
flat around and shoot enemies but it's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.200 
flat around and shoot enemies but it's
probably<00:01:14.220> pretty<00:01:14.460> weak<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.909> probably

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
probably pretty weak it's probably

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.539 
probably pretty weak it's probably
really<00:01:15.390> easy<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.720> take<00:01:15.900> out<00:01:16.080> next<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:17.009> 500

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
really easy to take out next up at 500

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
really easy to take out next up at 500
score<00:01:17.820> you've<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> orbital<00:01:19.110> care

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
package obviously we all know what a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.880 
package obviously we all know what a
care<00:01:21.150> package<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.600> next<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.380> you've<00:01:22.560> got<00:01:22.740> the

care package is next up you've got the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
care package is next up you've got the
remote<00:01:23.250> turret<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> kind<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.600> like

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
remote turret so this is kind of like

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.570 
remote turret so this is kind of like
the<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:24.960> sentry<00:01:25.740> gun<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.189> game<00:01:26.400> although

it won't be a cincher gun unless you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.130 
it won't be a cincher gun unless you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.260 
attach the century module to it and know
as<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.100> place<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.579> down<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.790> then<00:01:33.180> you

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
as it is you place it down and then you

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.060 
as it is you place it down and then you
have<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> control<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:34.920> like

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
have to control it with this little like

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.770 
have to control it with this little like
I<00:01:35.250> pad<00:01:35.520> thing<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> pull<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.509> it's<00:01:36.630> not

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I pad thing that you pull up so it's not

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.090 
I pad thing that you pull up so it's not
something<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.560> place<00:01:37.740> down<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
something that you can place down and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800 
something that you can place down and
run<00:01:38.250> away<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.030> gonna<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.420> destroyed

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
run away it's just gonna get destroyed

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.690 
run away it's just gonna get destroyed
right<00:01:40.020> away<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.400> kind<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
right away so I think it's kind of

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.940 
right away so I think it's kind of
useless<00:01:42.030> unless<00:01:42.570> you're<00:01:43.470> gonna<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
useless unless you're gonna put the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.620 
useless unless you're gonna put the
Centrino<00:01:44.369> system<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.299> now

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
Centrino system on it now

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.139 
Centrino system on it now
next<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.259> at<00:01:46.380> 600<00:01:46.979> points<00:01:47.159> you've<00:01:47.490> got<00:01:47.670> system

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
next up at 600 points you've got system

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
next up at 600 points you've got system
hack<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.780> again<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> ones

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
hack so again this is one of the ones

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.280 
hack so again this is one of the ones
that<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.920> don't<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.899> if<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.259> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that I don't know what it is if I was to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.170 
that I don't know what it is if I was to
guess<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.890> might<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.520> something<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.149> takes

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
guess it might be something that takes

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.139 
guess it might be something that takes
out<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.140> know<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.070> enemy<00:01:56.520> team<00:01:56.729> score

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
out you know all of the enemy team score

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.749 
out you know all of the enemy team score
streaks<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.890> system<00:01:58.890> act<00:01:59.040> kind<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.430> sounds

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
streaks or system act kind of sounds

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.999 
streaks or system act kind of sounds
like<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.060> maybe<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:01.020> an<00:02:01.170> EMP<00:02:01.710> type

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
like like maybe it's like an EMP type

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.469 
like like maybe it's like an EMP type
deal<00:02:02.280> like<00:02:02.430> maybe<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.820> messes<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
deal like maybe it messes with the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.389 
deal like maybe it messes with the
exosuits<00:02:04.229> or<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.500> mini<00:02:04.680> maps<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.130> know<00:02:05.219> I'm

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
exosuits or the mini maps you know I'm

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.950 
exosuits or the mini maps you know I'm
not<00:02:05.579> sure<00:02:05.790> what<00:02:06.000> its<00:02:06.119> gonna<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.479> I'm<00:02:06.899> sure

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
not sure what its gonna do I'm sure

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
not sure what its gonna do I'm sure
we'll<00:02:07.290> find<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.710> soon<00:02:07.950> enough<00:02:08.039> but<00:02:08.610> yeah

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
we'll find out soon enough but yeah

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.999 
we'll find out soon enough but yeah
that's<00:02:09.479> check<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:09.959> 600<00:02:10.379> points<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
that's check it for 600 points now a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.490 
that's check it for 600 points now a
next<00:02:11.520> up<00:02:11.610> you've<00:02:11.760> got<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> X<00:02:12.180> s1<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.870> Vulcan<00:02:13.379> at

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
next up you've got the X s1 a Vulcan at

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.820 
next up you've got the X s1 a Vulcan at
six

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
six

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
six
points<00:02:14.160> I've<00:02:14.250> actually<00:02:14.400> used<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:15.060> one<00:02:15.330> when

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
points I've actually used this one when

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.690 
points I've actually used this one when
I<00:02:15.840> played<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.290> game<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.800> lot<00:02:17.070> of<00:02:17.100> fun<00:02:17.460> so

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
I played the game it's a lot of fun so

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.030 
I played the game it's a lot of fun so
it's<00:02:17.820> essentially<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:19.050> an<00:02:19.200> airstrike<00:02:19.800> that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
it's essentially like an airstrike that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.920 
it's essentially like an airstrike that
you<00:02:20.190> control<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.940> sends<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.240> up<00:02:21.390> into<00:02:21.630> like

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
you control so it sends you up into like

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.900 
you control so it sends you up into like
this<00:02:22.110> satellite<00:02:22.620> thing<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.430> shoot<00:02:23.700> down

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
this satellite thing and you shoot down

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.850 
this satellite thing and you shoot down
a<00:02:23.970> giant<00:02:24.330> laser<00:02:24.720> beam<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.380> then<00:02:25.500> you<00:02:25.560> can<00:02:25.710> move

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
a giant laser beam and then you can move

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.170 
a giant laser beam and then you can move
that<00:02:26.070> beam<00:02:26.310> around<00:02:26.460> on<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> map<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.090> then

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that beam around on the map and then

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.210 
that beam around on the map and then
only<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.660> once<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.320> choose<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.830> fire<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
only like once you choose to fire the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.740 
only like once you choose to fire the
beam<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.430> only<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:29.910> like<00:02:29.940> four<00:02:30.480> or<00:02:30.690> five

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
beam you only have like four or five

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.780 
beam you only have like four or five
seconds<00:02:31.560> before<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.980> beam<00:02:32.130> stops<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.730> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
seconds before the beam stops so it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.430 
seconds before the beam stops so it
really<00:02:32.970> doesn't<00:02:33.180> take<00:02:33.420> very<00:02:33.480> long<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.380> you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
really doesn't take very long but if you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.260 
really doesn't take very long but if you
can<00:02:34.590> find<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.070> group<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.610> enemies<00:02:35.940> on<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.240> map

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
can find a group of enemies on the map

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.670 
can find a group of enemies on the map
you're<00:02:36.840> gonna<00:02:36.960> be<00:02:37.050> able<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> take<00:02:37.440> them<00:02:37.560> out

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
you're gonna be able to take them out

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.350 
you're gonna be able to take them out
you<00:02:37.830> know<00:02:37.950> pretty<00:02:38.160> much<00:02:38.340> instantly<00:02:38.820> it<00:02:39.120> kills

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
you know pretty much instantly it kills

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.760 
you know pretty much instantly it kills
very<00:02:39.630> very<00:02:39.840> quickly<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.290> thing's<00:02:40.620> pretty

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
very very quickly so that thing's pretty

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.640 
very very quickly so that thing's pretty
good<00:02:41.060> next<00:02:42.060> up<00:02:42.180> at<00:02:42.300> 6:50<00:02:42.840> we've<00:02:43.260> got<00:02:43.470> the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
good next up at 6:50 we've got the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.710 
good next up at 6:50 we've got the
missile<00:02:44.070> strike<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.580> don't<00:02:45.240> know<00:02:45.420> if<00:02:45.540> we've

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
missile strike I don't know if we've

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.450 
missile strike I don't know if we've
seen<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.410> makes<00:02:46.650> me<00:02:46.800> think<00:02:46.830> of<00:02:47.190> maybe

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
seen this this makes me think of maybe

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.550 
seen this this makes me think of maybe
you<00:02:47.670> know<00:02:47.790> some<00:02:48.060> sort<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.480> plane<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.230> comes

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you know some sort of plane that comes

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.870 
you know some sort of plane that comes
in<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:49.860> fires<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.130> missile<00:02:50.190> or<00:02:50.460> maybe<00:02:50.700> it's

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
in and fires a missile or maybe it's

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.220 
in and fires a missile or maybe it's
like<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.060> predator<00:02:51.450> missile<00:02:51.870> or<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:51.990> know<00:02:52.080> I'm

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
like a predator missile or you know I'm

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.500 
like a predator missile or you know I'm

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.530 
Gorge game place that's where the a-10
warthogs<00:03:01.980> come<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.640> drop<00:03:02.820> down<00:03:03.000> all<00:03:03.270> sorts

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.720 
warthogs come in and drop down all sorts
of<00:03:03.600> bombs<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.170> map<00:03:04.470> which<00:03:05.010> sounds<00:03:05.610> like<00:03:05.670> a

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
of bombs on the map which sounds like a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.830 
of bombs on the map which sounds like a
lot<00:03:05.790> of<00:03:05.970> fun<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.390> looks<00:03:06.570> like<00:03:06.660> it'd<00:03:06.780> be

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
lot of fun that looks like it'd be

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.000 
lot of fun that looks like it'd be
pretty<00:03:06.990> powerful<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.620> based<00:03:07.830> off<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
pretty powerful just based off the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.160 
pretty powerful just based off the
gameplay<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.520> saw<00:03:08.670> yesterday<00:03:08.880> I'm<00:03:09.540> next<00:03:09.870> up<00:03:10.050> at

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
gameplay we saw yesterday I'm next up at

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.160 
gameplay we saw yesterday I'm next up at
775<00:03:10.860> we've<00:03:11.310> got<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.580> X<00:03:11.790> s1<00:03:12.360> Goliath<00:03:12.990> I've

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
775 we've got the X s1 Goliath I've

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.750 
775 we've got the X s1 Goliath I've
actually<00:03:13.350> played<00:03:13.740> with<00:03:13.770> this<00:03:14.070> one<00:03:14.220> as<00:03:14.310> well<00:03:14.490> so

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
actually played with this one as well so

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.970 
actually played with this one as well so
this<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.780> big<00:03:15.930> mech<00:03:16.140> suit<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.530> get<00:03:16.680> into

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
this is the big mech suit you get into

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.100 
this is the big mech suit you get into
it<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.880> can<00:03:17.940> fire<00:03:18.239> your<00:03:18.269> turrets<00:03:18.870> and

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
it and you can fire your turrets and

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.479 
it and you can fire your turrets and
then<00:03:19.440> you've<00:03:19.560> also<00:03:19.950> you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.130> if<00:03:20.220> you<00:03:20.340> put

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
then you've also you know if you put

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.949 
then you've also you know if you put
four<00:03:20.670> certain<00:03:20.910> modules<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.660> can<00:03:21.810> have

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
four certain modules on you can have

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.900 
four certain modules on you can have
like<00:03:22.470> your<00:03:22.620> homing<00:03:23.040> rockets<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:23.610> things<00:03:23.790> like

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
like your homing rockets and things like

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.250 
like your homing rockets and things like
that<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.300> really<00:03:24.600> really<00:03:24.840> good

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
that it's really really good

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.140 
that it's really really good
and<00:03:25.560> then<00:03:26.010> also<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.489> have<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.760> option<00:03:26.910> to

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and then also you have the option to

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.460 
and then also you have the option to
blow<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.570> up<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:27.720> like<00:03:27.989> when<00:03:28.200> you're<00:03:28.290> running

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
blow it up so like when you're running

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.270 
blow it up so like when you're running
low<00:03:28.769> on<00:03:28.920> health

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
low on health

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.250 
low on health
you<00:03:29.640> can<00:03:29.820> self-destruct<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.810> potentially

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
you can self-destruct it and potentially

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.560 
you can self-destruct it and potentially
take<00:03:31.440> out<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> few<00:03:31.860> enemies<00:03:32.010> with<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:33.090> the

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
take out a few enemies with that but the

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.880 
take out a few enemies with that but the
only<00:03:33.690> thing<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.320> when<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.560> call<00:03:34.769> this

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
only thing is is when you call this

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.729 
only thing is is when you call this
thing<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.480> it<00:03:36.480> has<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.690> shoot<00:03:37.080> down<00:03:37.350> from<00:03:37.620> the

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
thing in it has to shoot down from the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.440 
thing in it has to shoot down from the
sky<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.220> pod<00:03:38.459> and<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:38.820> have<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.060> run<00:03:39.239> up<00:03:39.360> to

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
sky and a pod and you have to run up to

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.080 
sky and a pod and you have to run up to
the<00:03:39.540> pod<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.140> hold<00:03:40.260> X<00:03:40.560> or<00:03:40.739> square

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
the pod and you have to hold X or square

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.759 
the pod and you have to hold X or square
two<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.540> be<00:03:42.660> able<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.959> know<00:03:43.050> get<00:03:43.260> into<00:03:43.470> it

scorestreak<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.190> it's<00:03:50.459> something<00:03:50.640> that

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
scorestreak you know it's something that

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.729 
scorestreak you know it's something that
if<00:03:50.940> you<00:03:51.090> worked<00:03:51.300> that<00:03:51.480> hard<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:52.110> essentially

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
if you worked that hard you essentially

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.410 
if you worked that hard you essentially
get<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.220> know<00:03:53.310> nearly<00:03:53.519> eight<00:03:53.820> kills<00:03:54.090> in<00:03:54.209> a<00:03:54.300> row

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
get you know nearly eight kills in a row

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.600 
get you know nearly eight kills in a row
without<00:03:54.570> dying<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.320> then<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.860> can<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.070> stolen

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
without dying and then it can be stolen

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.310 
without dying and then it can be stolen
from<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.150> easily<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:57.870> really<00:03:58.170> really

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
from you that easily is really really

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.810 
from you that easily is really really
sad<00:03:58.560> because<00:03:58.680> anybody<00:03:59.010> can<00:03:59.280> run<00:03:59.400> up<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.580> it<00:03:59.730> and

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
sad because anybody can run up to it and

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.460 
sad because anybody can run up to it and
take<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.209> if<00:04:00.300> an<00:04:00.390> enemy<00:04:00.480> kills<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.930> they

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
take it so if an enemy kills you they

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.810 
take it so if an enemy kills you they
can<00:04:01.680> take<00:04:01.860> it<00:04:02.040> and<00:04:02.310> that<00:04:02.489> would<00:04:02.610> just<00:04:02.640> be

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
can take it and that would just be

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.580 
can take it and that would just be
heartbreaking<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.840> don't<00:04:04.200> know<00:04:04.260> how<00:04:04.440> much

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
heartbreaking so I don't know how much

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.290 
heartbreaking so I don't know how much
I'm<00:04:04.739> gonna<00:04:04.830> use<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.040> one<00:04:05.220> but<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.880> is<00:04:05.970> fun<00:04:06.180> to

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
I'm gonna use that one but it is fun to

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.360 
I'm gonna use that one but it is fun to
use<00:04:06.330> and<00:04:06.690> then<00:04:07.230> finally<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.739> last<00:04:07.769> two<00:04:08.250> we

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
use and then finally the last two we

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.699 
use and then finally the last two we
have<00:04:08.550> are<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.970> warbird<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.780> 850<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:10.620> the

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
have are the warbird and 850 and the

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.979 
have are the warbird and 850 and the
Paladin<00:04:11.280> at<00:04:11.430> 950<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.390> haven't<00:04:12.630> had<00:04:12.810> any

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
Paladin at 950 so I haven't had any

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.600 
Paladin at 950 so I haven't had any
experience<00:04:13.080> with<00:04:13.590> either<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:13.950> these<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.400> think

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
experience with either of these I think

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.060 
experience with either of these I think
they're<00:04:15.180> both<00:04:15.330> like<00:04:15.660> giant<00:04:16.200> gunships<00:04:16.859> that

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
they're both like giant gunships that

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.009 
they're both like giant gunships that
are<00:04:17.160> up<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.489> sky<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.630> think<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:18.930> know

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
are up in the sky and I think you know

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.870 
are up in the sky and I think you know
obviously<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.560> warbird<00:04:20.010> since<00:04:20.310> it's<00:04:20.459> cheaper

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
obviously the warbird since it's cheaper

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.370 
obviously the warbird since it's cheaper
it's<00:04:21.299> probably<00:04:21.660> gonna<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:21.900> one<00:04:22.049> where<00:04:22.260> it's

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
it's probably gonna be one where it's

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.050 
it's probably gonna be one where it's
just<00:04:22.560> got<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:22.860> know<00:04:22.919> like<00:04:23.010> Gatling<00:04:23.669> guns<00:04:23.850> and

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
just got you know like Gatling guns and

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.310 
just got you know like Gatling guns and
stuff

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
stuff

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.450 
stuff
you<00:04:24.440> can<00:04:24.530> shoot<00:04:24.770> down<00:04:24.800> kind<00:04:25.250> of<00:04:25.310> like<00:04:25.430> a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
you can shoot down kind of like a

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.650 
you can shoot down kind of like a
chopper<00:04:25.850> gunner<00:04:26.030> and<00:04:26.180> then<00:04:26.300> maybe<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
chopper gunner and then maybe the

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.750 
chopper gunner and then maybe the
Paladin<00:04:27.170> is<00:04:27.320> something<00:04:28.040> more<00:04:28.220> of<00:04:28.370> like<00:04:28.580> the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
Paladin is something more of like the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.220 
Paladin is something more of like the
Loki<00:04:29.210> where<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:29.540> have<00:04:29.720> like<00:04:29.960> you<00:04:30.080> know<00:04:30.170> you

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
Loki where you have like you know you

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.500 
Loki where you have like you know you
can<00:04:30.590> shoot<00:04:30.800> bullets<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.310> can<00:04:31.340> shoot<00:04:31.670> rockets

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
can shoot bullets you can shoot rockets

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.000 
can shoot bullets you can shoot rockets
you<00:04:32.660> can<00:04:32.810> shoot<00:04:32.990> explosives<00:04:33.620> you<00:04:33.680> know<00:04:33.770> things

you can shoot explosives you know things

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.740 
you can shoot explosives you know things
like<00:04:34.100> that<00:04:34.160> I'm<00:04:34.430> not<00:04:34.580> exactly<00:04:34.850> sure<00:04:35.030> that's

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
like that I'm not exactly sure that's

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.110 
like that I'm not exactly sure that's
just<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:36.170> guess<00:04:36.350> but<00:04:36.740> yeah<00:04:37.040> those<00:04:37.250> two<00:04:37.550> like<00:04:38.000> I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
just a guess but yeah those two like I

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.480 
just a guess but yeah those two like I
said<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.420> at<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.570> very<00:04:38.720> end<00:04:38.840> 850<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.740> 950

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
said it at the very end 850 and 950

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.430 
said it at the very end 850 and 950
points<00:04:40.790> respectively<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.660> those<00:04:42.170> are<00:04:42.290> all<00:04:42.380> the

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
points respectively so those are all the

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.930 
points respectively so those are all the
score<00:04:42.650> streaks<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:43.010> can<00:04:43.160> select<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.760> game

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940
