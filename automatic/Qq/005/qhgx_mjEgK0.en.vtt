00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.310
 but I 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.580
 oh how about youtube friends xl and good 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.050
 we are growing videos and good 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.900
 what investment are we in what would be 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:20.140
 Well then more than a whole tutorial 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.849
 how to render the kings in 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.250
 android are not professional renders 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.009
 as what would be how it would come out in the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.099
 cinema 4d or in some other program that 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.660
 serve to make renders but even if 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.210
 is something basic for what it would be 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.120
 the thumbnails on youtube not so good 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.430
 let's start to make this tutorial 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.899
 good to do the pictures of Kim 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.850
 earning what they will need because it will be 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.320
 have some items if you want 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.340
 with the sites you want for example 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.719
 if they want to do it with a sword of 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.060
 Iron, then, have an iron sword 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.290
 at hand and 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.750
 just be good, put on the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.190
 items that they want in the inventory and if 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.710
 they want to make mature clothes too 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.510
 put an armor here or whatever you want 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.750
 do it myself in this case I will do so 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.340
 simple and then to take a this for 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.140
 take first we will need to take a 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.060
 description we will take a display of 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.310
 the part of the armor and we're going to take 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.190
 the perfect hour 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.660
 now we will take with the arm and 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.790
 movement how this is done 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.980
 they will just have to start breaking 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.890
 a block and they 're just breaking down 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.750
 they give him the three little dots and they give the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.390
 part of the armor and there they take a 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.280
 perfect description but I want to do it 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.380
 with the movement of the perfect case very 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.760
 well now we will have to do the same 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.229
 with the systems that we want to take the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.920
 written for example I will do it with the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.220
 wooden sword very well and also with 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:46.760
 the peak is perfect I will also do it with 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:49.400
 a block because not and with the stick 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.750
 well now since we're done with this 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.060
 we simply have to go to the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.070
 application called background race 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.910
 and if this tutorial is much easier to 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.380
 do a 0.11 since we have the offices 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.720
 implemented in the same application and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.400
 does not need to show locks so a 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.860
 cut and I go back when the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.200
 application background and grace jones and 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.090
 so good if this part of tutorials 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.040
 vertically since this application is 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.620
 you can not put it horizontally so 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.510
 to continue with this tutorial what 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.530
 We need to do is give it to load photo 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.660
 since we are inside the application 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.190
 Bagua use we give a load photo 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.910
 we select any capture of 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.190
 screen 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.190
 I'm going to censor some parts and I'm going to 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.180
 destroy the parts we select 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.560
 any screenshot that 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.090
 I want for example I will love her 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.850
 this wooden sword so let's go to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.270
 shrink them until we only have 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.160
 that purple background and the and the image of the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 skiing I think you are already thinking what 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.519
 what shall I do 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.000
 or we just give it to automatic and it 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.000
 We give 50 no no no no no back back 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.150
 back we give to 50 and just 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.099
 we would do so and as they see magic magic by 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.099
 god the background disappears and 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.500
 the transparent skin was simply 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.569
 Now what's left, I put it in 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.780
 zero because in one like that it skirts 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.120
 too much is eaten away by 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.870
 edges of what would be the image I would 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.090
 I go to zero and we give six and as you see 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.920
 is already perfect we give to finish now 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.160
 if they want then we give others a load 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.220
 photo to gallery we give to then what 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.730
 would be the peak we are going to hit him with the peak 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.800
 we go with the peak here perfect 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.049
 I think that miniature I'll put a ski a 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.000
 skin that is made in a render of 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.680
 cinema 4d her that with these renders 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.560
 the thumbnails are getting a little ugly 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.190
 but I used them before to eliminate 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.930
 hard which is fine to start 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.400
 before they were perfect but now not 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.160
 I know how I like the most 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.330
 corners like that of cinema 4d and it's obvious 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.650
 so for good it was all for 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.170
 students the I hope you have them 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.319
 already served I will bring another option to do 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.000
 some skin renders a little more 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.379
 customized so nothing was 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.959
 everything for this video did not forget the 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.049
 comments subscribe to my channel and 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.569
 that would be very good help for me not 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.069
 forget that free so nothing was 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.840
 all for this video I love you very much 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.699
 first they take care of me and we see the 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.699
 next video until next time
