00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.620
ELEANOR HALL: US researchers say they've found
the oldest animal fossils ever discovered

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.210
and they uncovered them in the Flinders Ranges
in South Australia.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.820
The findings challenge the theory of when
animal life began on earth.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.080
Princeton University's assistant professor
of geology Adam Maloof told Timothy McDonald

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.490
that scientists had previously assumed that
life did not exist before a catastrophic ice

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.490
age.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.140
ADAM MALOOF: They're younger than 659 million
years old and older than 635 million years

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100
old. So I frequently will say they're about
650 or 640 million years old.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.600
TIMOTHY MCDONALD: And these animals are a
kind of sponge. I mean what would it look

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.980
like if you were to see it today?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.380
ADAM MALOOF: Well it's pretty important to
be careful here and say that they're sponge-like.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.270
So I wouldn't want to say for sure that they're
a direct ancestor of the sponges living today.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090
But they do seem to share a few characterises.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.090
These are centimetre-sized objects and they
have an internal network of canals, about

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.960
a millimetre in diameter. And we think if
they are a sponge-like organism that these

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.570
canals were used to filter water - in other
words to get carbon out of water to eat - and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.850
then exhale that water out of their body.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.830
TIMOTHY MCDONALD: So the real discovery here
you're suggesting is that it's I guess a fairly

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.869
complicated animal for how old it is.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.720
ADAM MALOOF: Yeah, exactly. It's very surprising
to find them in rocks or soil.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.150
Now one of the reasons it's surprisingly - this
is another important thing to note - is that

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.350
it's not only the absolute age. It's also
that they are older than the Marinoan ice

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.270
age, this event in Earth's history that many
people consider catastrophic to life.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.560
And yet our evidence and other people's work
suggests that maybe even animals could have

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.700
survived this kind of ice house catastrophe.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.619
TIMOTHY MCDONALD: But is there any suggestion
that these creatures might have survived the

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.619
ice age?

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.870
ADAM MALOOF: Well that's a really good question.
If our interpretation is correct that these

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.070
are sponge-grade animals I think many people
would argue that animals did not evolve twice.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.649
So what it doesn't mean that our critters
themselves survived the snowball, but what

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.239
it means is that animals evolved before the
snowball and some form of animal likely survived

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.920
the snowball. So I think that the take home
message is simply that the kingdom animalia

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.980
likely evolved before the snowball.
