00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.639
 Hello everyone, I will be with you today 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.429
 skipped school to lower your percentage 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.120
 wins and we start today we talk 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.460
 about the legend 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.530
 legend not only in the tank world well and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.250
 on perfectly real battlefields 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.180
 heavy tank is-2 or out of 122 it became 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.010
 the result of the modernization of the tank is-1 of 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.360
 1944 got more simple in 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.400
 making cast frontal part 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.500
 120 millimeters thick 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.210
 individual guards heavy 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.010
 tank regiments of 2 active 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.560
 used to storm fortified 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.260
 cities such as budapest breslau 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.240
 Berlin for mutual identification on such 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.480
 wore special tactical vehicles 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.010
 marks are white stripes but after historical 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.230
 minutes you can go into the game 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.430
 characteristics and we will probably begin with 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.500
 tool d-25t on this my review could 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.960
 end so how to list all of her 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.570
 characteristics will be pointless psychos 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.909
 so they know what I know there sometimes 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.640
 even I remember the multiplication table but 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.490
 forgotten toha guns d-25t is a shame for 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.070
 player but as an overview and do not all 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.240
 still have to list it tth damage 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.159
 390 when penetrating 175 armor-piercing and 217 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.200
 podalyberom enough for any purpose 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.120
 seventh level to most goals 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 level eight and a couple of tanks 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.590
 level nine but implement this 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.990
 the gun will turn out fully only 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.890
 when the enemy is close so much as the spread 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.340
 046 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.080
 and sitting time 3-4 seconds by the way about 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.450
 implement tools and we'll talk 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.150
 we all know well to be on 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.790
 advanced need no armor husband to someone on 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.799
 and do not need but it just does not hurt so 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.380
 here is the armor of this tank in one word 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:53.260
 excellent 100 millimeters forehead at an angle 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.170
 50 degrees gives reduced armor 40 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.210
 millimeters which is enough as well 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.430
 like we have no pike nose we can 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.310
 put the tank rhombus aided 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.409
 100 millimeters of armor and get up to 170 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.119
 millimeters of reduced armor that 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.549
 punching classmate will be very 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.539
 hard brow tower also has 100 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.730
 millimeters of armor 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.569
 that with proper tanking gives a chance 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.120
 not even beat back 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.879
 terry nines unless of course you are bred 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.129
 together something 90 millimeter board you 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.730
 will not save well, and even talk about karma 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.099
 not worth it but for the two of me to develop 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.599
 need to take a favorable position on this 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.989
 mobility of this 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:34.150
 unit with a mass of 47 percent and I wanted 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.370
 say tons he has engine power 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.889
 600 horsepower which gives us a specific 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.049
 power is 13 horsepower per ton this 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.299
 certainly less than usual iso but not 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.249
 so much so that in battle it is especially strong for you 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.069
 does not hurt the maximum speed that 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:50.590
 forward that back they have the same 34 and 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.299
 14 kilometers an hour respectively 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.989
 wrap at 38 degrees per second 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:57.340
 is a good indicator for heavy duty 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.439
 the combat effectiveness of this tank 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.599
 but what do they say if you ever 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.299
 went to the steering wheel of the tank with this weapon 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.879
 You already know everything. Choose a position where 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.909
 you can go shoot and roll 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.739
 and more and more you need nothing 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.159
 super tactics for stuffing a colossal 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.469
 no damage you just go out 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.150
 shoot and roll sometimes change 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.939
 position to art does not hurt 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.840
 and all so that you can implement such 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.699
 challenging gameplay 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.849
 you need the following equipment and 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.849
 equipment 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.230
 and finally, advantages and disadvantages 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.360
 the advantages of this tank are so good 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.320
 one-time damage rational angle of inclination 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.750
 frontal armor 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.360
 good dynamics for heavy tank and 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.280
 from lack of low accuracy long 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.680
 information time guns small b 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.080
 set in 28 charges mediocre 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.380
 communication range of 440 meters as well 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.450
 weak survey of 350 meters and now to me 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.980
 a description of the long essay and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.260
 Lesley your stats 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.980
 but as far as I remember deuce diary she 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.540
 does not put 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.540
 so see you in random
