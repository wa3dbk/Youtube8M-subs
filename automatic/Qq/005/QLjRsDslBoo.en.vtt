00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.910 
greet us if you will and every fawk is
different<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:47.870> you<00:00:47.930> bond<00:00:48.260> with<00:00:48.380> each<00:00:48.500> flock

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
different so you bond with each flock

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.100

you<00:00:56.600> do<00:00:56.809> bond<00:00:57.050> but<00:00:57.350> differently<00:00:57.800> with<00:00:58.010> each

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
you do bond but differently with each

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.209 
you do bond but differently with each
group<00:00:59.170> we<00:01:00.170> do<00:01:00.320> derive<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.649> lot<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.040> satisfaction
