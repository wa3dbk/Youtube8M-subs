00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
one in five to do it yeah i think this

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.199 
one in five to do it yeah i think this
chance<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:57.709> looking<00:02:57.830> smart<00:02:58.280> that's<00:02:58.670> extra

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
chance of looking smart that's extra

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.850 
chance of looking smart that's extra
which<00:02:59.390> is<00:02:59.600> more<00:02:59.959> than<00:02:59.990> most<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.500> us<00:03:00.560> can<00:03:00.740> have

which is more than most of us can have

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.850 
which is more than most of us can have
usually<00:03:01.040> generate<00:03:01.730> all<00:03:02.030> right<00:03:02.330> now<00:03:02.930> we've<00:03:03.830> got

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
usually generate all right now we've got

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.730 
usually generate all right now we've got
so<00:03:04.250> many<00:03:04.370> players<00:03:04.640> here<00:03:04.850> we<00:03:04.940> had<00:03:05.410> 483<00:03:06.410> players

I think he's going to be a bit
disappointed<00:03:41.930> because<00:03:42.019> he's<00:03:42.260> sitting<00:03:42.500> at

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
disappointed because he's sitting at

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.979 
disappointed because he's sitting at
five<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.010> three<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:43.880> suspect<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.690> he

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
five and three and I suspect that he

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.780 
five and three and I suspect that he
felt<00:03:45.380> he<00:03:45.590> was<00:03:45.739> in<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.920> better<00:03:46.100> position<00:03:46.280> in

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
felt he was in a better position in

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.509 
felt he was in a better position in
better<00:03:47.330> shape<00:03:47.530> physically<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.830> mentally<00:03:49.130> for

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
better shape physically and mentally for

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.070 
better shape physically and mentally for
one<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.180> european<00:03:50.570> trips<00:03:50.780> because<00:03:50.900> he's

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
one of the european trips because he's

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.320 
one of the european trips because he's
had<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.260> couple<00:03:51.470> of<00:03:51.739> issues<00:03:51.860> in<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.730> long

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
had a couple of issues in in long
