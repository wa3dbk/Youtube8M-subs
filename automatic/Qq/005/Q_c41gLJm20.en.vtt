stem<00:01:55.990> cells<00:01:56.320> have<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.620> ability<00:01:56.980> of<00:01:57.370> becoming

stem cells have the ability of becoming

stem cells have the ability of becoming

virtually any kind of cells in the body

virtually any kind of cells in the body
for<00:02:00.460> example<00:02:00.910> if<00:02:01.360> we<00:02:01.540> put<00:02:01.750> a<00:02:01.780> stem<00:02:02.050> cell<00:02:02.260> in<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
for example if we put a stem cell in the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.950 
for example if we put a stem cell in the
brain<00:02:02.620> and<00:02:03.010> becomes<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.610> brain<00:02:03.790> cell<00:02:04.090> if<00:02:04.600> we<00:02:04.780> put

brain and becomes a brain cell if we put
it<00:02:05.050> in<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.230> liver<00:02:05.410> becomes<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.160> liver<00:02:06.340> cell<00:02:06.610> if

it in the liver becomes a liver cell if

it in the liver becomes a liver cell if
you<00:02:07.360> put<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.870> pancreas<00:02:08.050> it<00:02:08.800> becomes<00:02:09.220> a

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
you put it in the pancreas it becomes a

you put it in the pancreas it becomes a

pancreatic cell and so on and so forth

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.830 
pancreatic cell and so on and so forth
we<00:02:12.310> thought<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.610> if<00:02:12.940> stem<00:02:13.240> cells<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.810> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
we thought that if stem cells have the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.110 
we thought that if stem cells have the
ability<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.590> becoming<00:02:15.010> other<00:02:15.310> types<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:15.820> cells

then<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.960> had<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.410> be<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.560> natural<00:02:17.770> process<00:02:18.220> with

then it had to be a natural process with

then it had to be a natural process with
a<00:02:18.700> purpose<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:20.350> we<00:02:20.470> propose<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.100> stem<00:02:21.400> cells

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
we had a possible explanation so we went

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.679 
we had a possible explanation so we went
in<00:04:10.919> the<00:04:11.040> lab<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.250> studied<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.909> effect<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.299> AFA

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
in the lab and studied the effect of AFA

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.050

that our hypothesis was right consuming

that our hypothesis was right consuming
AFA<00:04:18.810> led<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.320> an<00:04:19.410> increase<00:04:19.500> in<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.250> number<00:04:20.609> of
