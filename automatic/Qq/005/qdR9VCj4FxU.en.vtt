00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.620

 mi It was black. It was rice piece Nakayama that was in 3 clothes . 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:43.010
 It will be a little behind the Proquion Stakes Corps at Hanshin Racecourse. 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:47.030
 I guess I was chasing Tempe direct 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:53.240
 I won by showing a strong growth leg 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:57.580
 When the march Stakes has been noted that this time only was a yellowtail is not so good 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:02.200
 But if the is a record time one minute 22 seconds 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.790
 It is a front run that did not have 4 straight wins, but still it is fun that this horse should run

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:17.569
 I just ran away until now, but it seems like this is because there is a limit

 Nori Yokoyama jockey in that I only Baa that go easy down in the form 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:27.129
