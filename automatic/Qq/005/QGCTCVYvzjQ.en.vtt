 my job is to compose songs and songwriter 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.630
 an exercise that 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.710
 cultivated a few years ago I believe that at 20 years 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.010
 when I was 15 years old 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.280

 of much responsibility you become a 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.690
 communicated to a certain extent 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.179

 new so to speak no no 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.009
 the truth is that composers always talk about all the topics 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:54.469

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.879
 forever 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:41.909
 putting creativity first 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.429
 putting this 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:46.709
 what we say that then the human being 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.089
 and especially the operation because the human being who lives in this city said 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.009
 zacatecas links no, and we have 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.689

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.799
 they are experiences

 very nourished 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.539
 first because you find in the musical language musicians that also this

 town is in 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.049

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.079
 to talk about communicating the experiments with that excellent musicians 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:19.199
 from other places 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.199
 percent eagerly expect what you have not 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.830
 the other good experience is to meet friends people 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.509
 from many parts of the world that I think this is 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.879
 one of the possibilities that music has not language 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:33.800

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.369
 among other school councils meet people the 13 with 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.629

 the 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.629
 that's why it feels 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.930
 finally the world knows

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.940
 I'm a fool and I think that 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.190
 that has a lot to do when you think you're from the beginning 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.499
 you want to make a life and want to be a musician and want to be a composer and 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:16.939
