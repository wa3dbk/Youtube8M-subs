00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.360
 hello to all so in this video I 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.330
 will you talk about my hair 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.699
 I was asked a lot how 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.770
 I was keeping my wick 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.369
 so I kick him about every 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
 four months 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.340
 at the hairdresser so I go to the 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.380
 barber of guide in the second and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
 in the meantime before going to the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.910
 barber before thumbs super fast 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.700
 I cut it and at least I think all 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.540
 the months so that's so I was asked 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.399
 in fact as stakes the cut and the most 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.500
 simple is to do it on video 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.800
 so I leave you with this little tutorial 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.050
 I hope I talk to him about fishing so 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.600
 so here you go go she is 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.059
 well long marie monnier and is this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.010
 what I prefer is when to go down 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.050
 as for parts about the oven ci and 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.570
 who went down like that so I 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.680
 leave you with small cars 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 so since I'm in my living room 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.600
 I took a towel 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.430
 why put hair everywhere so 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.510
 I'll put it on my lap you 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.409
 will need good scissors and then a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.159
 comb so I'm going to start with 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.759
 select the fringe 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.200
 so for me the frank rety that 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.060
 I do not like it too much when we do France 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.189
 I beat him too much on the side is 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.659
 not that very pretty 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.729
 there I take a little I can do and 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.090
 this is the water side 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.479
 so here I am having my bangs so 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.590
 at first I will cut the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.590
 better all right 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.690
 here I pay you about a centimeter 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.430
 progressively givet for failed boss 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.700
 I do not do a bang everything will have a sky 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.670
 a little zigzag it's not very serious 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:05.140
 So that's where I look about it 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.760
 is goodbye it's pretty good I 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.440
 will leave it like this and now 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.490
 I'm going to cut and some other way 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.570
 in fact I marl or else 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.790
 I'll put it in the air like that 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.730
 hung I would move the device otherwise 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.310
 to a bridge here you are well worth 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.530
 so I told you so I'm going 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:32.440
 take my bangs that I'm going to put 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 really in the air like that I'm going 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.900
 leave a margin of about in step 3 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.280
 cm 2 3 cm and I will cut but 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.280
 really I'm going to make assets in 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:52.680
 does right the left on the pits 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:52.680
 magic do that like that 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.150
 it's going to actually actually tapered 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.090
 hop 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:18.040
 and from there that's what it gives that gives 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:19.330
 a little cascades effect so there by 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.100
 example I find a little too long 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.320
 still so I'm still going to cut 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.320
 I will always cut it up 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:40.860
 so here I take about 1 cm so 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.860
 like that and i'm going to cut the ab group 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.840
 that's it and it's true it's not really 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.819
 regular I will not cut all to the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.819
 same height 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.819
 here 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.840
 it's not too bad 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.750
 there I like how with 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.860
 sense now actually I'm going to cut 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:18.730
 a little bit more in the middle so 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.870
 stole this wick the request so I'm going 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.930
 learn what to really take read middle 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:29.400
 and I will repeat the same operation is 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.400
 she will be a little shorter 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.110
 So here is the result no one 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.700
 huge change but I could have 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.260
 fringe really in the eyes 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.580
 so that's really what I wanted 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.680
 something that go off a little bit 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.660
 cascade 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.010
 having it cut in the air with 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.870
 small with scissors like that 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.750
 in fact it makes it to be 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.640
 you very heavy dad actually on their 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.290
 graves and that she really is and spin 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.090
 on the points of difference falls 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.090
 naturally and that she really 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.390
 flexible by cutting it like that you 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.580
 can of course the right m 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.730
 if you have it very short you can 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.210
 to make a ray in the middle closed ray at 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.840
 middle 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.730
 and that's as you saw there 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.410
 nothing very complicated I advise you 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.630
 really and go step by step 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:33.080
 I am cutting I am looking hard at the cuts 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.640
 I'm watching I'm trying game finally here I am 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.950
 be really careful i'm really going 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.540
 not there not for not too cut can 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.540
 they will not be able to see a bang 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.210
 like that so I hope this little tutorial 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.940
 will have pleased you and which will serve you for 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.660
 your next cuts 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.660
 so here I am doing you
