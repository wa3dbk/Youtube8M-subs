have to do is touch that level and then
arrow<00:06:56.960> up<00:06:57.229> or<00:06:57.500> down<00:06:57.770> you<00:06:58.759> see<00:06:58.940> how<00:06:59.060> the

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
arrow up or down you see how the

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.420 
arrow up or down you see how the
percentage<00:06:59.659> changes<00:07:00.139> each<00:07:00.440> time<00:07:00.469> I<00:07:00.800> touch<00:07:01.190> the
