 authorizations of this application the 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
 errors that give 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.870
 repaired and for which iphone versions 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.210
 firm but if the for these functions or 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.210

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.900
 neutral application that will open us what 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.430

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.270
 that tells us that we can have 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.270
 memory 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.090

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:33.860
 about this here in ot and it tells us what 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:37.330
