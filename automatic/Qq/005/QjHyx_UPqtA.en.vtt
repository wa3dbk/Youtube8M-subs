the low key yes that's right the highest

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
the low key yes that's right the highest
killstreak<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> game<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.520> has<00:01:08.760> been

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
killstreak in the game this has been

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.480 
killstreak in the game this has been
needed<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.260> long<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:11.340> they've

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
needed for so so so long so what they've

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609 
needed for so so so long so what they've
changed<00:01:11.790> here<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.299> now<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> large<00:01:12.990> rod<00:01:13.350> which

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
changed here is now the large rod which

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.960 
changed here is now the large rod which
is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> biggest<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.280> know<00:01:14.400> missile<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.820> can

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
is the biggest you know missile you can

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.270 
is the biggest you know missile you can
fire<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.840> fired<00:01:16.049> every<00:01:16.439> four<00:01:16.770> seconds

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
fire can be fired every four seconds

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
fire can be fired every four seconds
instead<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.790> every<00:01:18.000> seven<00:01:18.360> seconds<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.900> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
instead of every seven seconds and it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.289 
instead of every seven seconds and it
fires<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> half<00:01:20.100> seconds<00:01:20.790> after<00:01:21.180> your

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
fires one and a half seconds after your

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.240 
fires one and a half seconds after your
trigger<00:01:21.540> pull<00:01:21.780> rather<00:01:22.350> than<00:01:22.560> two<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.070> there's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
trigger pull rather than two so there's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.710 
trigger pull rather than two so there's
less<00:01:23.369> for<00:01:23.610> delay<00:01:23.850> time<00:01:24.119> there<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.570> can

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
less for delay time there so you can

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.870 
less for delay time there so you can
fire<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.560> them<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.979> they<00:01:26.400> aren't<00:01:26.670> as

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
fire more of them and they aren't as

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.310 
fire more of them and they aren't as
delayed<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
delayed so you know you don't have to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.960 
delayed so you know you don't have to
lead<00:01:28.500> people<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.860> much<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.340> very<00:01:29.670> very

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
lead people as much that's very very

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.730 
lead people as much that's very very
good<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> know<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> low<00:01:30.900> key<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.380> good

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
good you know the low key can be good

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.920 
good you know the low key can be good
but<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:32.939> feel<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.329> it's<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.780> know

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
but I just don't feel like it's you know

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.350 
but I just don't feel like it's you know
as<00:01:34.290> dominant<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.340> needs<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.790> be<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
as dominant as it needs to be as the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
as dominant as it needs to be as the
highest<00:01:36.570> killstreak<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> call<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.710> duty

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
highest killstreak in a call of duty

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
highest killstreak in a call of duty
game<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.430> also<00:01:38.610> there's<00:01:39.240> another<00:01:39.329> buff

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
game and then also there's another buff

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
game and then also there's another buff
to<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> thing<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> small<00:01:40.650> rods<00:01:40.920> now<00:01:41.189> fire<00:01:41.490> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
to this thing the small rods now fire a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700 
to this thing the small rods now fire a
point<00:01:42.329> three<00:01:42.630> seconds<00:01:43.079> after<00:01:43.409> your<00:01:43.500> trigger

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
point three seconds after your trigger

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.039 
point three seconds after your trigger
pull<00:01:43.979> instead<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.759> point<00:01:45.090> five<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
pull instead of point five so that the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.109 
pull instead of point five so that the
kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.409> lag<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.250> is<00:01:47.430> almost<00:01:47.670> halved

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
kind of lag time there is almost halved

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.179 
kind of lag time there is almost halved
so<00:01:48.479> yeah<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> low<00:01:49.320> key<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.619> lot<00:01:49.799> better<00:01:50.009> now

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
so yeah the low key is a lot better now

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.679 
so yeah the low key is a lot better now
you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.430> fire<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> lot<00:01:50.880> faster<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.450> don't<00:01:51.600> have

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
you can fire a lot faster you don't have

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.450 
you can fire a lot faster you don't have
to<00:01:51.810> lead<00:01:51.960> people<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.320> much<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.369> that's

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
to lead people as much and and that's

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.580 
to lead people as much and and that's
pretty<00:01:53.729> good<00:01:53.880> now<00:01:54.090> there's<00:01:54.570> also<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:55.200> some

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
happened in system link that we saw in a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.389 
happened in system link that we saw in a
couple<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.439> tournaments<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.979> thing<00:02:02.250> was
