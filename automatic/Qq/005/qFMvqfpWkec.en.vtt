band in government mule I want a thicker

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.630 
band in government mule I want a thicker
richer<00:03:19.640> sound<00:03:20.290> because<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.890> smaller<00:03:22.310> band

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
richer sound because it's a smaller band

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.970 
richer sound because it's a smaller band
and<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.090> takes<00:03:23.570> up<00:03:23.750> more<00:03:23.900> space<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.709> that's

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and it takes up more space and that's

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.770 
and it takes up more space and that's
just<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.549> sound<00:03:25.790> that<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.000> really<00:03:26.239> gravitate

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
just a sound that I really gravitate

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.140 
just a sound that I really gravitate

sound<00:04:01.569> not<00:04:02.569> quite<00:04:02.900> as<00:04:03.050> high<00:04:03.230> gain<00:04:04.390> but<00:04:05.390> I've

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
sound not quite as high gain but I've

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.290 
sound not quite as high gain but I've
also<00:04:05.660> experimented<00:04:06.500> with<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:06.739> 50s<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.760> on

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
also experimented with the 50s so on

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.509 
also experimented with the 50s so on
some<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.840> larger<00:04:09.200> stages<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.800> may<00:04:09.980> go<00:04:10.190> there

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
some of the larger stages I may go there

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.620 
some of the larger stages I may go there
as<00:04:10.700> well<00:04:11.510> but<00:04:11.870> the<00:04:12.860> sound<00:04:13.160> for<00:04:13.910> this<00:04:14.120> band<00:04:14.360> is<00:04:14.600> a

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
as well but the sound for this band is a

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.170 
as well but the sound for this band is a
little<00:04:15.230> bit<00:04:15.350> more<00:04:15.560> traditional<00:04:15.860> bluesy<00:04:16.850> I'm

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
little bit more traditional bluesy I'm

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.990 
little bit more traditional bluesy I'm
playing<00:04:17.799> hollow<00:04:18.799> bodies<00:04:19.220> instead<00:04:19.639> of<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.820> Les

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
playing hollow bodies instead of a Les

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.950 
playing hollow bodies instead of a Les
Paul<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:21.040> it's<00:04:22.360> intentionally<00:04:23.360> I<00:04:23.600> want<00:04:23.900> a

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
Paul and it's intentionally I want a

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.010 
Paul and it's intentionally I want a
different<00:04:24.350> sound<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.100> think<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:26.810> first

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
different sound so I think the the first

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.520 
different sound so I think the the first
place<00:04:27.229> to<00:04:27.380> start<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.800> different<00:04:28.190> amps
