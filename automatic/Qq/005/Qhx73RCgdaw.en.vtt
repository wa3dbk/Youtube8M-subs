00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
side of this hill that's a hole we like

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
side of this hill that's a hole we like
to<00:01:17.189> call<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.840> sweet<00:01:18.840> sounding<00:01:19.229> little

target<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.600> don't<00:01:21.600> think<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.840> very<00:01:21.900> very

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
target I don't think it's very very

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
target I don't think it's very very
large<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.590> there's<00:01:25.770> no<00:01:25.920> harshness<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.700> no

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
large but there's no harshness to it no

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.960 
large but there's no harshness to it no
crackle<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.930> I've<00:01:28.140> got<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> double<00:01:28.829> D<00:01:29.009> set<00:01:29.729> at

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
crackle and I've got the double D set at

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.950 
crackle and I've got the double D set at
about<00:01:30.979> 8<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> discrimination<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.420> GPX

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
about 8 on the discrimination of a GPX

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.630 
about 8 on the discrimination of a GPX
5,000

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.970 

so<00:01:39.640> with<00:01:39.880> these<00:01:40.030> uh<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:43.960> bedrock<00:01:46.980> you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
so with these uh with this bedrock you

00:01:47.980 --> 00:02:01.760 
so with these uh with this bedrock you
can<00:01:48.130> usually<00:01:48.310> just<00:01:49.380> pull<00:01:50.380> away<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:53.110> stuff<00:01:53.410> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.680 

know<00:02:02.770> how<00:02:03.040> good<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.700> seeing<00:02:04.030> its<00:02:04.240> but<00:02:04.540> I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
know how good this is seeing its but I

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.560 
know how good this is seeing its but I
think<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.050> can<00:02:05.229> see<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.470> little<00:02:05.680> glint<00:02:05.950> of<00:02:06.100> gold

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
think I can see a little glint of gold

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.050 
think I can see a little glint of gold
right<00:02:07.570> there

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
right there

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.750 
right there
what<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.090> normally<00:02:10.479> use<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:11.520> screwdriver<00:02:12.520> to

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
what I normally use is a screwdriver to

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:23.310 
what I normally use is a screwdriver to
one<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.850> these<00:02:15.970> cracks<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.020> get<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
one of these cracks with if I get the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.920 
one of these cracks with if I get the
detector<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.739> little<00:02:23.800> closer<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.730> hole<00:02:24.940> and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
detector a little closer to the hole and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.210 
detector a little closer to the hole and
if<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.320> see<00:02:26.470> right<00:02:26.680> on<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.920> end<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
if you can see right on the end of the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.720 
if you can see right on the end of the
scoot<00:02:27.489> over

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:42.930 

right<00:02:30.730> there<00:02:31.150> is<00:02:32.459> little<00:02:33.459> gold<00:02:33.610> nugget<00:02:41.940> that's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
right there is little gold nugget that's

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.750 
right there is little gold nugget that's
probably<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.269> grammar<00:02:43.540> or<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:44.170> nice<00:02:45.100> coarse<00:02:45.519> got

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
probably a grammar or so nice coarse got

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.800 
probably a grammar or so nice coarse got
some<00:02:45.940> red<00:02:46.150> oxide<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:49.480> sitting<00:02:49.780> right

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
some red oxide on it just sitting right

another target right there and that one
sounds<00:03:11.660> harsh<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:13.160> blinked<00:03:13.490> out<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.640> little

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
sounds harsh and it blinked out a little

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:43.030 
sounds harsh and it blinked out a little
bit<00:03:14.060> so<00:03:15.100> that's<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:17.200> iron<00:03:18.200> target<00:03:41.890> here<00:03:42.890> the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
bit so that's a iron target here the

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.400 
bit so that's a iron target here the
difference<00:03:43.340> between<00:03:43.370> those<00:03:43.700> two<00:03:43.760> targets<00:03:44.410> and

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
difference between those two targets and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.760 
difference between those two targets and
using<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.100> little<00:03:46.190> TT<00:03:46.670> coil<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:47.770> bedrock

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
using a little TT coil in this bedrock

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.830 
using a little TT coil in this bedrock
you<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.390> get<00:03:50.390> in<00:03:50.510> between<00:03:50.630> these<00:03:52.480> really<00:03:53.480> good

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
you can get in between these really good

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.100 
you can get in between these really good
