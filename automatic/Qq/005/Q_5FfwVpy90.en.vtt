00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.879
 good antique markets are characterized by this 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.220
 that they do not happen so often 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.309
 in fact these are the once-in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.670
 Month just take place and the course 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.250
 no new goods offer no 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.130
 Arts and crafts some markets like this one 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.100
 in wetzlar even find in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.920
 summer from march to october 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.460
 we have it here this morning at 38 4 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.780
 a bit cold but you can see 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 already from hundreds of dealers 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.970
 actually here are their antiques 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.500
 to offer 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:42.210
 when we the car which of course in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.960
 First line around restored parts and 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.280
 It should be furniture that you can work up 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 and here too cheap 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.710
 We can then buy prices for bidders 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.390
 a blender for example, a so 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.270
 The cabinet looks like a secretary 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.729
 but actually a wardrobe is 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:08.190
 to a bialas and as you can see 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.909
 cat foot but one is missing so general 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.860
 he is still in good condition 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.920
 These mother- of-pearls are still there 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.140
 Closed keys are there and then 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.630
 interesting up here on the head is one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.130
 secret drawer this can be through 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
 a button pressure in there 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.100
 then she jumps out of her head 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.119
 meant is of course okay and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.810
 the price of 195 Euros could be because 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.810
 not to beat 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.850
 Here it is a coffer made with well 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.220
 even on 1862 original fogging and 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.060
 key in any case color original 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.420
 get softwood all over and to 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 asked a price of 120 euros here 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.280
 it is really acceptable 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.420
 In Wetzlar there are also very old ones 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.860
 To buy cabinets here we have that 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.050
 was my parents I saw here 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.819
 a mountain cabinet on dari a side 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:26.430
 receive 17 7 80 original reminder also 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.110
 here from behind looks with stuck sims 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.300
 from the back to see that everything is original 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.330
 is still very rough boards and one 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.600
 price of 900 euro is also quite 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.690
 acceptable 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.819
 then here's a secretary in softwood 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.040
 with a great mood because billa will 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.320
 something 18 30 48 are also here 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.140
 nabila on it and on the 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.730
 Interior is a microphone her 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.680
 Good conditions dealers are natural 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.410
 if you can leave the car on 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.530
 And there is a stand fee which are here 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.829
 in the dark at four meters and 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.730
 interview car at 35 euros as different 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.570
 it looks like here in wiesbaden on art 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.880
 center on the appelallee da costa 30 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.769
 euro with a minimum size of three 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.060
 so you have to at least 90 meters 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.190
 pay euro as a dealer 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.010
 There are also a few for that 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.739
 Restrictions namely you may from 7 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.900
 build clock and the sale of the top 8 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.280
 start going 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.549
 This high quality likes to boot 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.190
 There are antiques for over 20 years 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.410
 but that around here with the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.329
 parking lot atmosphere and yet right 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.329
 dark here is not so ideal 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.379
 There are of course restored furniture 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.170
 also to buy here 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.920
 then here would be a console table with 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.510
 drawer cherry tree kept the whole 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.519
 the saw from me 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:11.799
 around 1820 but at 1000 euro 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:16.930
 Not exactly a bargain here 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:20.530
 a shelf of oak and then with nut 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.229
 composed from the historicism so um 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.960
 1880 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:32.919
 there is 90 euros for asked here are 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.460
 Two pretty walnut chairs must 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:39.430
 massive to a very nice grain I 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.389
 I looked at it more closely and on 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:46.449
 the wood was quite well preserved was the 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.130
 color already and were former 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.810
 really impeccable after the election 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.360
 only that the seat is no longer original 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:56.229
 was a bit thoughtful now 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:05:03.820
 been opened up because there are 300 together 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:11.710
 euro was even the price here 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:15.550
 two beautiful vitrine marconi veneered like that 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.580
 Something about 1850 were major damage 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.909
 not to be seen at all by her so 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.360
 actually only new surfaces on it 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:29.789
 To make countries really good 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.840
 since the borrower ever asked 850 euros for 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.699
 but not sold here because of me 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.050
 on 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:37.210
 at another market again this 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.500
 furniture so often you can 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.500
 Yes, act accordingly 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:50.860
 an ethical wood and state really 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:54.570
 very well received when formed there 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.680
 the saleswoman asked 130 euros for 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.080
 let's get to the brands of 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.650
 thus lead to the weser located 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.840
 These are the former Panzerhalle 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.090
 that of course provide that one too 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.790
 in adverse circumstances this market 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.050
 not only one can perform there 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.419
 in the outdoor area can stand but also 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.759
 unfortunately, these are here under these halls 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:17.850
 more and more is always more new goods 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:20.720
 to see here and the market is not 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.940
 more beautiful than ever 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.830
 this louis philippe dresser in esche 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.220
 from here I actually found quite 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.870
 acceptable for a price of 300 euros 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:34.940
 not too much to do around then 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:41.449
 to make these sensible again 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:43.440
 would be a tower dresser with the glaze 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.650
 you could get really well 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.740
 Almost in the apartment put the old 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.669
 color like 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:55.560
 otherwise you would have at most the 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:07:01.050
 Replace fittings of the chest below 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:05.270
 which were not quite fitting should be 250 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.270
 Of course, Euro costs are spruce wood 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.330
 Here a miss of each dresser also with 

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:14.880
 original fittings and also from the tournament 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.070
 So you really have to be pretty good about her 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.320
 receive 

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.810
 only one was the top of the area 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.490
 Something hot confessed what was there 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.010
 Do not be that strong in it 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.389
 been pulled affected is the 

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:31.320
 from me so that certainly 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:34.500
 Again, here's an arm out 

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.370
 armchair no thonet but at least one 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:41.820
 good book wood furniture still really top 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:44.340
 also get only new surface of the 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:49.849
 Dealer asked 130 euros for this 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:54.860
 chairs so here is a nice little 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:57.810
 model dresser solid cherry tree 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:00.349
 certainly an ideal object for the 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:02.659
 first time a blow polish 

00:08:00.349 --> 00:08:05.820
 reasonable to apply 

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:08.430
 unfortunately a totally inflated price of 

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:10.699
 Dealer actually asked 450 euros 

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.699
 therefor
