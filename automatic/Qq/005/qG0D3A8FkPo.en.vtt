00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
liberties and privacy and I was a critic

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.790

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279 
of the previous administration for those
occasions<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.580> which<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:27.090> felt<00:00:27.990> they<00:00:28.199> had

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
occasions in which I felt they had

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.659 
occasions in which I felt they had
violated<00:00:28.439> our<00:00:28.949> values<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.670> came<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.470> a

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
violated our values and I came in with a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.280 
violated our values and I came in with a
healthy<00:00:32.669> skepticism<00:00:33.770> about<00:00:35.450> how<00:00:36.450> our<00:00:36.870> various

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
healthy skepticism about how our various

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.520 
healthy skepticism about how our various
programs<00:00:37.530> were<00:00:37.980> structured<00:00:39.500> but<00:00:42.260> what<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.290> have

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
programs were structured but what I have

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.420 
programs were structured but what I have
been<00:00:43.680> able<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> examine<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.710> scrub<00:00:46.710> how

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
been able to do is examine and scrub how

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.310 
been able to do is examine and scrub how
our<00:00:47.700> intelligence<00:00:48.300> services<00:00:48.690> are<00:00:48.809> operating

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
our intelligence services are operating

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.060 
our intelligence services are operating
and<00:00:49.469> I'm<00:00:50.039> confident<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.719> point<00:00:52.070> we

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and I'm confident that at this point we

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.569 
and I'm confident that at this point we
have<00:00:53.399> struck<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.329> appropriate<00:00:54.930> balance<00:00:55.579> now

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
have struck the appropriate balance now

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.790 
have struck the appropriate balance now
let<00:00:56.820> me<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.059> specific<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.930> terms<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
let me be very specific in terms of and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.229 
let me be very specific in terms of and
this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.039> what<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> described<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.820> Chancellor

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
this is what I described a Chancellor

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.020 
this is what I described a Chancellor
Merkel<00:01:00.590> what<00:01:01.590> these<00:01:01.980> programs<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.760> have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
Merkel what these programs are that have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.990 
Merkel what these programs are that have
caused<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:03.570> controversy<00:01:05.000> essentially

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
caused so much controversy essentially

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
caused so much controversy essentially
one<00:01:06.210> program<00:01:06.689> allows<00:01:07.290> us<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> phone

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
one program allows us to take a phone

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.179 
one program allows us to take a phone
number<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.180> has<00:01:09.990> been<00:01:10.350> discovered

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
number that has been discovered

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.960 
number that has been discovered
separately<00:01:11.970> from<00:01:13.729> through<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:15.150> lead<00:01:15.810> that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
separately from through some lead that

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.200 
separately from through some lead that
is<00:01:19.340> typical<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.520> what<00:01:20.580> our<00:01:20.939> intelligence

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
is typical of what our intelligence

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
is typical of what our intelligence
services<00:01:21.840> do<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.770> get<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> phone<00:01:23.189> number

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
services do but we get a phone number

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.929 
services do but we get a phone number
and<00:01:24.590> what<00:01:25.590> we<00:01:25.680> try<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> discover<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.549> has

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
and what we try to discover is has

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
and what we try to discover is has
anybody<00:01:28.579> else<00:01:29.579> been<00:01:30.090> called<00:01:30.869> from<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.350> phone

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
anybody else been called from that phone

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.990 
anybody else been called from that phone
and<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.880> both<00:01:33.479> data<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:34.560> allows<00:01:34.860> us<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and we have both data that allows us to

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
and we have both data that allows us to
just<00:01:36.299> check<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.049> phone<00:01:37.409> numbers<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.920> nothing

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
just check on phone numbers and nothing

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.600 
just check on phone numbers and nothing
else<00:01:38.250> no<00:01:38.520> content<00:01:39.890> nobody's<00:01:40.890> listening<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
else no content nobody's listening in on

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
else no content nobody's listening in on
a<00:01:41.640> conversation<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.509> point<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.560> just

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
a conversation at that point is just

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
a conversation at that point is just
determining<00:01:44.640> whether<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:45.810> for

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
determining whether or not if for

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.910 
determining whether or not if for
example<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.680> found<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.869> phone<00:01:48.869> number<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.380> Osama

not<00:05:28.210> being<00:05:28.390> abused<00:05:29.310> but<00:05:30.310> I<00:05:30.340> think<00:05:30.610> one<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.790> the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
not being abused but I think one of the

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.340 
not being abused but I think one of the
things<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.270> separates<00:05:31.660> us<00:05:32.520> from<00:05:34.170> some<00:05:35.170> other

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
things that separates us from some other

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.080 
things that separates us from some other
governments<00:05:35.890> is<00:05:36.040> is<00:05:36.190> that<00:05:36.370> we<00:05:36.550> welcome<00:05:36.790> these

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
governments is is that we welcome these

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.730 
governments is is that we welcome these
debates<00:05:37.450> that's<00:05:37.660> what<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.900> democracy<00:05:38.110> is<00:05:38.590> about

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
debates that's what a democracy is about

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
debates that's what a democracy is about
and<00:05:39.720> I'm<00:05:40.720> confident<00:05:41.410> that<00:05:41.500> we<00:05:41.980> can<00:05:42.430> strike

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
and I'm confident that we can strike

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.330 
and I'm confident that we can strike
this<00:05:42.910> right<00:05:43.120> balance<00:05:43.510> keep<00:05:43.750> our<00:05:43.900> people<00:05:44.050> safe

with<00:07:02.860> this<00:07:03.010> way<00:07:03.190> and<00:07:03.910> I<00:07:04.000> think<00:07:04.210> today<00:07:04.480> was<00:07:04.690> an

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:04.870 
with this way and I think today was an

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.510 
with this way and I think today was an
important<00:07:05.320> first<00:07:05.500> step<00:07:05.740> in<00:07:06.160> the<00:07:06.370> right

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
important first step in the right

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.010 
important first step in the right
direction<00:07:06.550> and<00:07:07.090> I<00:07:07.150> think<00:07:07.180> it<00:07:07.420> has<00:07:07.570> brought<00:07:07.780> us

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
direction and I think it has brought us

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.500 
direction and I think it has brought us
forward
