00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello people and welcome 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.649
 back to minecraft and another one 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.990
 redstone video is not possible today 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.790
 because I explain something so 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.230
 that here is not a tutorial but 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.330
 Here I just want something for you 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.529
 Show what I've been doing in the last few weeks 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.500
 have built and that is it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.660
 but not a color printer 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.849
 any color printer no there for it 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.080
 yes, there are enough color printers for that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.390
 already enough here on youtube 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 actually come up with something very special 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.219
 leave and this color printer has one 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.579
 few particularities on the one he 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.680
 works in vanilla minecraft 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.559
 that means you do not need no mods 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.200
 but and you also do not need ems 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.410
 she ends up with some kind of spinner 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.530
 or how to insert such as looks annecys 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.360
 she did that 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.899
 you do not even need theoretical 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.350
 command blogs for it so theoretically 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.699
 could you use this color printer in 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.559
 rebuild survival mode 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.340
 if, of course, they are not absolutely weak 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.810
 Nobody has that much resources left 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.549
 but theoretically you could do it 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 is just like I said without mods without anything 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.270
 just vanilla minecraft man lived 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.110
 through down and can start immediately 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.580
 to build 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.020
 on the other hand, it has more plans 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.890
 These prints give me even more benefits 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.360
 I 'll show you again soon 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.140
 but works first to the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.810
 advantages and that is so we see here 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 we can print pictures here in format 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.200
 8x8 pixels 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 I've just miss a picture 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.869
 that was about then 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.520
 look and the master so here the 88 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.890
 they are infinitely expandable that is 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.360
 Moments in the width go very much 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.799
 and could say for example 64 in the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 width but you could also in the height 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.979
 then you could say for example 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.880
 I would like 64 64 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.570
 a picture that could be 464 big with it 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.280
 also build 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 that is the whole thing 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.430
 Modular so that you can do it all 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.780
 can easily expand 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.910
 and on the other hand means for each 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.310
 single pixel what you see here so 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.870
 for every single blog you have 16 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.380
 different colors just now 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.070
 here 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.660
 the 16 different colors of wool 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.340
 They want to take full blocks 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.080
 But I could also be here for example 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.180
 which, for example, only take eight 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.959
 or just four or you could take 32 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.700
 or 64 he only needs one 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.470
 only blocks that as logically logical 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.980
 So you could have any color 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.209
 Now, for example, what do I know what gives 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.489
 there still someone could have such a 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.630
 Melons make as some green tone 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.310
 or so or gold blog or else 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.750
 is something important now that 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.520
 it can move with slopes 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.440
 and otherwise you can get here 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.989
 really do everything together to make something 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.120
 would like more or less to the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.000
 different and whatever you like 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.480
 I would say I show you 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.800
 just how the whole thing works 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.970
 and for that i would say test who that 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.360
 Just let me have it now 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.830
 times quickly cleared the issue so 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.500
 that we here our own image clean 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.989
 and we can go now 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.239
 here at this wall panel I say 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.769
 We start by starting the 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.480
 single pixel one after the other 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.390
 that means we start in the left corner 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.769
 then go put a first pixel then 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.820
 is second third fourth fifth 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.950
 sixth seventh eighth 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.450
 and that's the top row and then 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.660
 then the second row comes second 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.730
 supreme and so on I have now 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.739
 Just prepared from time to time 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.110
 we have seen here now too 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.660
 already very great it will be spent 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.489
 which colors choose and it will be afterwards 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.440
 one more okay from government this ok 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.130
 So now you can do the next 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.510
 press button 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.730
 now that's what you saved 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.810
 fits and I am ready for 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.010
 The next one I can do here now 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.549
 enter orange again 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.900
 and again and again that's me 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.820
 knows that in the first line 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.890
 bit boring but will be the same 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.750
 see how the whole then in the end 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.510
 will look as well as company for now 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.970
 already not counted here 1 2 3 4 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.489
 5 6 7 4 another one 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.110
 man so and now let's have a look 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.910
 right there is printing now 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.950
 very nicely that's what he means 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.200
 he did everything correctly 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.820
 everything now becomes the pallet by itself 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.530
 now quasi put together now 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.060
 the ink filled up the straight 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.680
 is consumed by this through the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.510
 pressure we see and there we see 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.010
 now an orange series 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.660
 I 'm not sitting spectacular yet 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.910
 will be right now in the next one too 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.710
 Do not row much more spectacular if you are 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.980
 is orange then we do now 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:51.380
 must have six times with it 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.220
 so I thought about what I'm doing and 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.570
 that in the first two rows 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.740
 admitted a bit boring so 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.720
 now you have to come back to print 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.840
 past started exactly or 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.490
 initiated so and then we see too 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:07.350
 Already the next series but the 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.419
 ink first refilled very much 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.470
 beautiful 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.580
 zack there comes the next trip now 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.010
 it gets a bit more varied 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.060
 now we have here 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:24.360
 orange then I would like black and 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:28.020
 then I like to know twice and beige 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:33.750
 the whole then a backward knows and 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:37.560
 black and orange something there 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.979
 rauskommt printing process initiated very 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.630
 beautiful 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.419
 By the way, the weather will be again 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.910
 Almost always is always set 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.040
 good are filled up everything does that 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.210
 paletti everything works very well there 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.860
 Let's come first we can 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.990
 already guessing what maybe there 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.120
 time will come out 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.560
 and yes I would say the trace that 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.030
 whole now a little bit and we 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.169
 See you again when the whole 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.169
 is completed 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:33.289
 so now I am in the 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:38.330
 last row I have four pieces now 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:40.459
 already 56 now seven again and 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.869
 also an eighth time orange and me 

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:44.719
 think you all know already long ago 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:46.699
 what should come out of course the 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:50.509
 pressure is now one last time 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:55.369
 initiated and comes out of course 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:57.610
 a happy pink sharp there it is too 

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:59.629
 very nice 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.319
 ok, very nice, everything is wonderful 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.180
 is working 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:03.349
 've Also seen a video on the 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.919
 all the time it just a little bit 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:08.240
 more quickly 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:10.279
 and yes, you can all here too 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.629
 you like to use other colors 

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:13.249
 I would not have it all colors 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:15.860
 shown but what you see what 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:17.240
 color would come out of it and you 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.839
 then you can theoretically after 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.240
 pleasure 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:22.879
 which also change the size and then 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.399
 can you times for example also 16 06 16 

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:28.099
 Build 16 pixel big pictures 

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:30.740
 Excuse me , for example 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:33.550
 emulate original textures or what 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:37.339
 I do not know yet do everything with it 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.680
 and yes, I would say if that's you 

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:41.719
 liked here and you like to see 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.819
 I want it to work like that 

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:45.050
 I once pointer writes to me 

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:46.639
 again in the comments 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.949
 that you liked that and that he did 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:51.529
 that would like to see and I wanted 

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:53.180
 I look forward to a good review and 

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:56.229
 then I would say 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.229
 until next time people
