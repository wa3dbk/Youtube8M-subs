00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
moisturized when I take it out and I

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.690 
moisturized when I take it out and I
know<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.719> when<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.320> put<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.830> in<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.370> made<00:00:14.580> sure

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
know that when I put it in I made sure

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.450 
know that when I put it in I made sure
my<00:00:14.940> hair<00:00:15.150> was<00:00:15.269> moisturized<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.020> also<00:00:16.470> having

my hair was moisturized and also having

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.540 
my hair was moisturized and also having
washed<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:18.230> during<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.800> time<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.279> added

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
washed it during the time that I added

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.910 
washed it during the time that I added
in<00:00:20.939> probably<00:00:21.900> helped<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> keep<00:00:22.619> moisture

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
in probably helped it to keep moisture

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.620 
in probably helped it to keep moisture
to<00:00:23.340> which<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> good<00:00:23.939> thing<00:00:24.000> because<00:00:24.390> you

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to which is a good thing because you

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.820 
to which is a good thing because you
never<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.760> just<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.420> was<00:00:27.990> really<00:00:28.289> important<00:00:28.769> for

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
never I just it was really important for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.250 
never I just it was really important for
me<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> have<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> protective<00:00:30.960> style

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
me to have this be a protective style

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.530 
me to have this be a protective style
not<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> style<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> dry<00:00:33.329> out<00:00:33.360> my

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540

hair<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.200> caused<00:00:34.440> more<00:00:34.739> breakage<00:00:35.239> you<00:00:36.239> can

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
hair and caused more breakage you can

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.650 
hair and caused more breakage you can
see<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.020> hair<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.350> kind<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.710> separating<00:00:38.460> them

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.229 

separating<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> Marley<00:00:43.440> twist<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
separating from the Marley twist that I

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:55.400 
separating from the Marley twist that I
did<00:00:45.239> before<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.780> wrap<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.800> hair<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:54.260> find<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
did before I wrap the hair I find that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.310 
did before I wrap the hair I find that
the<00:00:55.739> roots<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.899> quite<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> bit<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the roots have like quite a bit of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.460 
the roots have like quite a bit of
buildup<00:00:58.649> and<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.609> I've<00:01:02.760> been<00:01:02.789> doing<00:01:03.470> not
