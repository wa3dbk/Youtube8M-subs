00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 all superhero team must have 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.870
 a villain who does not leave them or rest 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.000
 some are quite powerful others do not 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 it's not even on his heels that's why today 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.279
 I bring you the 10 best villains of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 the avengers' number 10 tag master is 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
 true that this character has not caused 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.310
 many problems to the group but if 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.410
 we put under the microscope let's 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.529
 discover that it could possibly be your 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.810
 greater threat based on that then on that 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.180
 all agents of hydra soldiers 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.020
 of aim of hellfire club and many more 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.559
 have been trained by the tag master 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.840
 number 9 by bach this programmer 's 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.700
 computers transformed into a side 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.469
 board for the alien brotherhood of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 badoo could have been the enemy more 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.300
 powerful that the avengers had to 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.219
 face especially when exposed 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 the cosmic energy that made him 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.230
 an omnipotent being capable of modifying the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 actually his story is not only 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.579
 relate to the avengers too 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.110
 involves the guardians of the galaxy 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.480
 number 8 scarlett tweets 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.090
 although he began his career as a villain 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.370
 in the pages of number 4 of x-men has 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.470
 spent most of these 50 years 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.110
 as a member of abencia if it does not seem 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.520
 deserve a position on this list but if 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.920
 we remember the saga the avengers 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.690
 disassembler and its responsibility in 10a 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.620
 It is clear to which side 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.770
 tips the scale number 7 norman 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.630
 osborn it's true that norman osborn like 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.240
 the green goblin was exclusively 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.070
 enemy of spider-man but in the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.290
 recent years the writers have known 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.660
 explore the motivations of the character 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.520
 finding new facets and taking it 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.610
 to grow as a threat to the rest 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.770
 of the marvel universe so after repelling the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.509
 scroll invasion we find ourselves with 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.369
 an osbourne that manages the dissolution of 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.490
 so only to form his own 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.090
 organization number 6 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.159
 danos obsessed with death we give 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.890
 by itself a threat of proportions 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.960
 cosmic to that let's add the power of 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.060
 infinity gauntlet capable of 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.130
 give your carrier control over the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.410
 reality and we have an insane who could 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.420
 have destroyed the entire universe if not 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.900
 out of arrogance a weakness 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.230
 quite common among the most powerful 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.090
 number five pups cross 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.489
 each of these alien races already 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.500
 is by itself a great threat to the 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.720
 land and justifies its inclusion in the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.670
 list although the real reason for 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.530
 be among the best enemies of 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.660
 the avengers is the war they maintain 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.760
 which amplifies its danger as 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.310
 has been proven in the sagas cri 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.130
 it is cold war operation galactic storm or 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.390
 the most recent secret in version number 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.019
 4 barón cimo and the masters of evil for 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.180
 start 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.980
 terry we see the myth created by hollywood 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.080
 was the twelfth Baron Cimo the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.970
 responsible for the long lethargy he suffered 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.580
 steve rogers in the icy waters of 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.260
 arctic and not red scroll when rogers 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.360
 reappeared thanks to the avengers he founded 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.819
 masters of evil as counterpart of the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.620
 group of powers but it was his successor the 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.200
 who achieved the long-awaited defeat of the 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.030
 avengers during the saga under switch and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.950
 not to mention the great deception brought to 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.180
 during the absence of the group of 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.769
 heroes when creating the thunder bots 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.769
 number 3 what there is not much to say 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:25.450
 of the prince of lies does not exist 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.340
 comic reader who does not know the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.959
 relationship between what and the creation of 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.150
 group when he pretended that hulk 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:35.170
 will face his hated brother the god 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.390
 of thunder number 2 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.239
 how to definitely defeat a 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.980
 villain able to travel in time 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.920
 say that it is the oldest enemy of 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.390
 the avengers is not a play on words 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.120
 had his moment of glory in the arch 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.860
 plot called kan dynasty in that 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.390
 saga kan is the first villain in 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.580
 get what many craved 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.770
 conquer planet number 1 the throne 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.500
 the throne is undoubtedly an enemy 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.989
 formidable that stands out from the rest for 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.940
 place it first because the throne 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.700
 represents the biggest failures of the 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.380
 avengers to start was created by 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.870
 jiang qing one of the members 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.090
 founders in turn the tron ​​is the 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.280
 creator of the homeless and known as 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.280
 vision who thought to destroy them 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.400
 ended up joining them the throne 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.889
 it always becomes more powerful more violent 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.660
 his last defeat was in the saga he has 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.760
 made full throne that not by chance 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.520
 is the name that will lead to the second 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.260
 movie of the avengers surely what 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.200
 we will see again in the comics for the 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.300
 moment of its release I am planning a 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.070
 video about throne information not 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.730
 I know when I will upload it but an enemy 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.740
 so powerful you need your own video 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.290
 information taken from batanga com 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.730
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.100
 comment if for you it is another enemy 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.260
 who deserves the first place 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.400
 up share it and see you the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.400
