bringing you guys my best class setup
video<00:00:04.859> for<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.540> xpr-50<00:00:07.040> sadly<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.160> say<00:00:08.220> I

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
video for the xpr-50 sadly to say I

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.770 
video for the xpr-50 sadly to say I
don't<00:00:08.460> have<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.760> class<00:00:09.000> setup<00:00:09.269> for<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.690> on

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
don't have the class setup for you on

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.770 
don't have the class setup for you on
the<00:00:09.900> screen<00:00:10.219> I<00:00:11.219> didn't<00:00:11.700> record<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.480> while<00:00:12.719> I

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
the screen I didn't record it while I

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.120 
the screen I didn't record it while I
was<00:00:13.049> getting<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.500> game<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.920> actually

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
was getting this game so I actually

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.890 
was getting this game so I actually
didn't<00:00:14.730> even<00:00:14.910> know<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.210> was<00:00:15.330> gonna<00:00:15.420> get<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.690> game

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
didn't even know I was gonna get a game

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.560 
didn't even know I was gonna get a game
play<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:17.010> know<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.640> wasn't<00:00:17.789> really<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.270> for

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
play you know I wasn't really going for

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.960 
play you know I wasn't really going for
it<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> class<00:00:20.310> setup<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.699> use

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
it but this is a class setup that I use

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.160 
it but this is a class setup that I use
on<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> xpr-50<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.800> would<00:00:23.580> say<00:00:23.789> around<00:00:23.939> 80<00:00:24.420> to

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
on the xpr-50 I would say around 80 to

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.080 
on the xpr-50 I would say around 80 to
85<00:00:25.890> percent<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> time<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.519> play<00:00:26.789> with<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
85 percent of the time I play with it

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.179 
85 percent of the time I play with it
and<00:00:27.660> I'll<00:00:28.170> tell<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> class<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
and I'll tell you what the class is and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.269 
and I'll tell you what the class is and
why<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> use<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.570> first<00:00:30.900> I

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
why I use you know what I use so first I

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
why I use you know what I use so first I
use<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.579> ballistic<00:00:33.450> CPU<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.260> with

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
use the ballistic CPU on it with

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.860 
use the ballistic CPU on it with
extended<00:00:35.190> mags<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:36.420> I've<00:00:36.540> said<00:00:36.719> before

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
extended mags and like I've said before

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.650 
extended mags and like I've said before
I<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.350> ballistic<00:00:38.040> CPU<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.210> good<00:00:39.450> on

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
I think ballistic CPU is really good on

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780 
I think ballistic CPU is really good on
guns<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.320> semi-automatic<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:41.309> you

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
guns that are semi-automatic that you

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.779 
guns that are semi-automatic that you
would<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.870> able<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.680> multiple<00:00:44.550> kills

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
would be able to get multiple kills

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.729 
would be able to get multiple kills
while<00:00:45.149> you're<00:00:45.420> aiming<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.170> sight<00:00:46.500> that's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
while you're aiming down sight that's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.500 
while you're aiming down sight that's
the<00:00:46.860> whole<00:00:46.950> point<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> ballistic<00:00:48.000> CPU<00:00:48.149> it

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the whole point of the ballistic CPU it

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.020 
the whole point of the ballistic CPU it
takes<00:00:48.690> away<00:00:48.899> sway<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.340> aim<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.700> sight

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
takes away sway when your aim down sight

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.569 
takes away sway when your aim down sight
doesn't<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.079> help<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.039> opinion<00:00:53.399> with

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
doesn't really help in my opinion with

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.750 
doesn't really help in my opinion with
the<00:00:53.760> ballista<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.930> dsr-50<00:00:55.920> cuz<00:00:56.340> most<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
the ballista or the dsr-50 cuz most of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.920 
the ballista or the dsr-50 cuz most of
the<00:00:56.820> time<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.360> probably<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the time you're probably gonna be a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.020 
the time you're probably gonna be a
quickscoping<00:00:58.559> drag<00:00:59.190> scoping<00:00:59.609> stuff<00:00:59.879> like

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
quickscoping drag scoping stuff like

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.529 
quickscoping drag scoping stuff like
that<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> xpr-50<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that you know but what the xpr-50 you

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420 
that you know but what the xpr-50 you
can<00:01:03.719> look<00:01:03.840> down<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> spawn<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.739> let's<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.220> say

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
can look down a spawn and let's just say

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160 
can look down a spawn and let's just say
if<00:01:05.820> you're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.150> for<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.360> quadrat<00:01:06.659> shot<00:01:06.900> feed

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
if you're going for a quadrat shot feed

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
if you're going for a quadrat shot feed
it<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:07.979> help<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.580> check

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
it would really really help and check

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.820 
it would really really help and check
