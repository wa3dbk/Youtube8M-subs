land<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.040> one<00:01:05.280> move<00:01:06.030> aside<00:01:06.119> move<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
land in this one move aside move it on a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.530 
land in this one move aside move it on a
bit<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> an<00:01:07.170> angle<00:01:07.729> it's<00:01:08.729> not<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.390> make

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
bit of an angle it's not going to make

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.420 
bit of an angle it's not going to make
you<00:01:09.600> land<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:11.930> got<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> 59<00:01:13.430> I'll

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you land in this one I got a 59 I'll

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.920 
you land in this one I got a 59 I'll
have<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.880> back<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.240> complete<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> all

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
have with the back and complete this all

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.760 
have with the back and complete this all
the<00:01:16.080> way<00:01:18.650> I<00:01:20.750> think<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.840> problem<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.530> didn't

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the way I think my problem was I didn't

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.359 
the way I think my problem was I didn't
have<00:01:22.920> fuel<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.430> something<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.600> but

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
have fuel or something I don't know but

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.310 
have fuel or something I don't know but
then<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.490> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.729> yeah<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
then you're going to yeah so that's the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.319 
then you're going to yeah so that's the
first<00:01:28.799> mission<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.520> training<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.329> jet<00:01:30.630> pack

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
first mission of training on jet pack

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.660 
first mission of training on jet pack
now<00:01:33.329> we're<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
now we're going to go to and that's the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.460 
now we're going to go to and that's the
perfect<00:01:35.909> landing<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:37.140> they're<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.409> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
perfect landing now they're going to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
perfect landing now they're going to
make<00:01:37.590> us<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.860> some<00:01:38.040> landing<00:01:38.460> landing<00:01:39.299> I'm

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
make us do some landing landing I'm

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
make us do some landing landing I'm
jetpacks<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.170> too<00:01:40.350> hard<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
jetpacks not too hard I think the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.889 
jetpacks not too hard I think the
hardest<00:01:41.729> landing<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:44.630> think<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.720> make

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
hardest landing is on I think they make

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.940 
hardest landing is on I think they make
you<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:47.340> spoil<00:01:47.549> anything<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.950> probably

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
you I don't spoil anything but probably

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.789 
you I don't spoil anything but probably
one<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> hardest<00:01:50.549> landing<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
one of the hardest landing is on the

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.460 
one of the hardest landing is on the
glider<00:01:53.450> flash<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.659> distance<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> land<00:01:55.320> on

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
glider flash or distance the land on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.600 
glider flash or distance the land on
landing<00:01:55.799> pad<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.950> exactly<00:01:59.250> what<00:01:59.490> we're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
landing pad so that's exactly what we're

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
landing pad so that's exactly what we're
going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> do

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.830 

it<00:02:03.030> shows<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:04.159> cutscene<00:02:05.570> it<00:02:06.570> shows

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
it shows you a little cutscene it shows

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.240 
it shows you a little cutscene it shows
