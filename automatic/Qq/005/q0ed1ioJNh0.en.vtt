00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello to all friends 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.260
 a panic greeting and welcome back to 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.090
 this new daily video on 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.580
 destiny today as usual for i 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.949
 Tuesday we return with the guide to the la la 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.109
 weekly night for the occasion 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.850
 will be set on venus and in 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.340
 particular will be the assault that will see us 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.500
 kill the nexus as the final boss 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660
 but before going to analyze in 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.760
 specific the modifiers of this 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 week and the equipment I have 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 adopted to address it two small 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.160
 the first is that I will not do it 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.290
 see the drops at the end of the assault 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.899
 I tell you because it's the last time 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.340
 I ventured or rather I ventured 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.500
 to not make veils see you have me on 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.110
 covered with insults in the comments of the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.280
 video but it's no problem 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.260
 you are justified because I did not have you 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.989
 alerted this week, I warn you 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
 only strange coins dropped 11 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.360
 strange coins so I don't do it 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.829
 see the drops 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.600
 forgive me but it's already gnawing 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.340
 anyway history for stealing lemon e 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 for stealing the coins we just miss 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.580
 that at least I can show you you can 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.070
 beautifully laugh you can of mind 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.479
 laugh at me apart from the crap there 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.369
 I show the drops for this reason 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.250
 here the second premise that I must do to you 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.840
 is that I promised you a new format 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.390
 regarding the Tuesday of the cove 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
 at night I couldn't bring it 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.240
 this week because it is a form of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.619
 video that takes me more time to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.659
 regarding the assembly part 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.860
 so as soon as I get Tuesday 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.900
 totally free and totally 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.340
 quiet or I'll bring but enough to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.170
 chat let's go to the point 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.939
 the modifiers we are interested in 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.530
 this week they are arms of emptiness 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.700
 or damage of these so empty 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.079
 nature have increased considerably and 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.479
 anger the monsters of darkness remain 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.490
 impassive even after suffering damage 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.710
 huge and juggling that one thing a lot 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 very boring or not enemies 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.579
 drop ammunition for the weapon that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.320
 is equipped we take into account all 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 these things here is mine to see 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.729
 equipment that consists in word 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.469
 of Croatian fd launch and truth this 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.210
 I think it is the best set up that is 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.189
 can use to address the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.829
 mission condemn you condemn empty 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.880
 increased by 300 percent 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.500
 let us remember regarding the class 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
 cantonal use of the sun because it gives me 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.069
 the possibility of using radiance 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.220
 although it would probably be more 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.660
 convenient to use 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.580
 minute of emptiness but these cocks I myself 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.350
 I find myself well with cantone del sole therefore 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.940
 I use this if you don't have these weapons 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.380
 what use I arrange with that 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.330
 that you have enough that it has an empty nest 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.300
 but whatever it is if you have these three 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.490
 these three weapons here use these that 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.220
 they really break bad but that's enough 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.930
 chat just get lost in shit 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.640
 let's go straight to the action with the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.260
 driving at night this night 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.240
 week 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.220
 we start as usual from area a 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.840
 limited return then we start with 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.330
 say that this jump is not 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.580
 however particularly difficult given the 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.310
 bonus and in any case the small ones 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.830
 pitfalls that characterize it 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.870
 let's say the most important difficulty 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.240
 will try to commit the less 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.180
 possible errors because especially in 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.740
 this area is in one of those 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.810
 subsequent the minimum error of 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.250
 compromising all the progress of the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.690
 mission we begin by saying that this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.200
 first part will see us committed to 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.480
 destroy three fallen servants then 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.760
 those huge purple balls that have life 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.709
 yellow have enough bullshit from by 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.570
 pull down but try to be more 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.640
 prudent also because how 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.910
 see inside the dungeon are 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.800
 present captains of level 5 and fallen 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.900
 let's say they will do you a lot of damage 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.700
 with that attack you can see 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.519
 easily with these small balls 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.660
 blue that will chase up even not there 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.670
 they will have hit so I recommend 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.440
 be careful you are repaired in this 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.190
 initial zone together with your companions 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.170
 alone 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.970
 if you are alone as you prefer e 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.610
 kills three servants 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.410
 once this first part is completed 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.870
 go up these stairs and you'll find yourself 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.190
 in front of this room be careful 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.560
 because it is full of enemies above all 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.930
 of these annoying and stilettos and of 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.310
 those fallen lilies at the top which is vice 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.230
 they will always bend with this 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.019
 attack of these annoying blue balls 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.700
 that will follow you if you are alone vi 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.170
 I recommend staying very long 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.180
 back how easy my companions are 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.220
 six goals you are in three you can see 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.600
 very well let one of you do 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.060
 come off as I'm doing in this 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.680
 moment the enemies act and kill them 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.370
 quite easily while yours 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 comrades will be busy keeping them 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.919
 engaged 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.770
 we continue for the other one 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.169
 more challenging area or this part 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.479
 here where you will be attacked by the many 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.000
 enemies becks goblin of bob itself 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.740
 handcuff minotaurs be careful 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.570
 try to eliminate the hogs first 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.979
 goblin like I'm doing in this 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.330
 moment because their attacks 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.520
 precision will put you in serious 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.200
 difficulties if combined with the charge of 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.930
 minotaurs and once killed new goblin 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.150
 you can focus on are minotaurs 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.770
 careful on the door to your right 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.840
 our right this is this one 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.030
 in which I am entering because I arbi 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.650
 enemies will come from the shoulders if not 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.030
 be careful so if you are in I am 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.220
 be very very careful if instead 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.419
 you are three staggered inside 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.760
 of the map you see how we did it 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.160
 us at this moment and maybe attracted 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.250
 the enemies inside this door here 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.419
 been much easier to kill them 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.860
 be careful because if you forget 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.990
 look after you exactly as I said 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.820
 minotaurs will come to your 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.250
 Shoulders continue to enter this 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.169
 big bow and your right 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.539
 a lot of goblins will come pull yourself up 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.560
 a garnet more simply 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.780
 destroy them with the weapons you have a 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.690
 we continue we continue 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.120
 we are almost at the end of the dungeon you see 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.220
 once arrived in this area that 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.780
 that anticipates the nexus you will come up 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.880
 in a very large amount of goblins 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.470
 the rule applies to the previous ones 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.810
 or pull them all over and 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.220
 they will die quite easily 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.770
 once you get to the nexus area 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.419
 that I kill standing over the ravine 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.370
 sniper you all the minotaurs that 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.650
 found below to kick off 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.539
 to the assault only difficulty but 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.760
 obviously very well of note is a 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:51.280
 praetorian that lively black with cadence 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.140
 adjust behind you all turn around and 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.669
 three simultaneously to kill one 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.830
 once done that you can safely 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.750
 return to kill minotaurs or 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.000
 shoot the nexus once this 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.450
 here it will be smeared like I'm doing 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.909
 focus on you from above the ravine e 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.950
 thanks to vacuum damage bonus will die 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:12.390
 quite easily 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.530
 I recommend only recommendation 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.849
 keep in mind the minotaur that 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.830
 answer behind you try not to 

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:19.510
 make you surprise and lexus spins away 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.370
 smooth thanks for following this 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.390
 video leave a like as usual a 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.890
 comment
