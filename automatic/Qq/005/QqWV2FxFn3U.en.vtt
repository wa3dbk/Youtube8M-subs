00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
that'll apartment doesn't really have

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.430 
that'll apartment doesn't really have
any<00:00:58.100> mascara<00:00:58.520> on<00:00:58.850> hardly<00:00:59.600> it's<00:01:00.050> kind<00:01:00.350> of

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
any mascara on hardly it's kind of

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.500 
any mascara on hardly it's kind of
really<00:01:00.740> subtle<00:01:01.310> the<00:01:01.490> mascara<00:01:02.120> even<00:01:02.240> though

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
really subtle the mascara even though

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.540

some<00:06:08.050> black<00:06:08.199> eye<00:06:08.380> shadow<00:06:08.409> on<00:06:08.800> it<00:06:08.979> and<00:06:09.220> then

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
some black eye shadow on it and then

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.520 
some black eye shadow on it and then
just<00:06:09.699> put<00:06:09.880> it<00:06:09.909> on<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.240> ends<00:06:10.570> of<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:10.900> edges<00:06:11.409> of

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
just put it on the ends of the edges of

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.189 
just put it on the ends of the edges of
my<00:06:11.620> lips<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.039> then<00:06:12.099> run<00:06:13.030> it<00:06:13.180> into<00:06:13.840> the<00:06:13.960> inner

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
my lips and then run it into the inner

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.990 
my lips and then run it into the inner
corners<00:06:14.650> a<00:06:14.680> little<00:06:14.889> bit<00:06:15.130> of<00:06:15.220> no<00:06:15.370> extra<00:06:15.669> product

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
corners a little bit of no extra product

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.170 
corners a little bit of no extra product
on<00:06:16.150> just<00:06:16.419> so<00:06:16.539> it<00:06:16.630> looks<00:06:16.780> dark<00:06:17.110> and<00:06:17.880> deep<00:06:18.880> but

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
on just so it looks dark and deep but

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.330 
on just so it looks dark and deep but
the<00:06:19.630> middle<00:06:19.779> bit<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:20.080> kind<00:06:20.320> of<00:06:20.380> left<00:06:20.650> so<00:06:21.279> you

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
the middle bit is kind of left so you

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.490 
the middle bit is kind of left so you
can<00:06:21.490> leave<00:06:21.669> it<00:06:21.849> like<00:06:21.880> that<00:06:22.240> or<00:06:22.510> you<00:06:23.260> can<00:06:23.349> do

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500
