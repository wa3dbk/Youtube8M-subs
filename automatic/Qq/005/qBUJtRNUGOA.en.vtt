now take your tissue paper and iron it

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.310 
now take your tissue paper and iron it
on<00:01:36.549> until<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.180> see<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.479> full<00:01:37.750> shape<00:01:38.049> of<00:01:38.229> the

then cut the excess tissue paper off it

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.260 
then cut the excess tissue paper off it
doesn't<00:01:48.799> have<00:01:48.950> to<00:01:49.070> be<00:01:49.159> cut<00:01:49.369> perfectly<00:01:49.400> because

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
doesn't have to be cut perfectly because

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.210 
doesn't have to be cut perfectly because
the<00:01:50.600> border<00:01:50.960> will<00:01:51.170> eventually<00:01:51.710> be<00:01:51.860> cut<00:01:52.070> off

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
the border will eventually be cut off

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.859 
the border will eventually be cut off

when you use it to make a book cover
I've<00:01:55.240> tried<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.270> few<00:01:56.600> methods<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.259> making<00:01:57.619> book

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
I've tried a few methods on making book

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.039 
I've tried a few methods on making book
cloth<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:58.520> have<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:58.880> say<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.450> one<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.750> by

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
cloth and I have to say this one is by

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.469 
cloth and I have to say this one is by
far<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.500> easiest<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.310> has<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.729> best<00:02:01.940> results

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
far the easiest and has the best results

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.690 
far the easiest and has the best results
now<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.259> you<00:02:03.350> can<00:02:03.530> prepare<00:02:03.680> fabric<00:02:04.340> for<00:02:04.549> book

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
now that you can prepare fabric for book

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.310 
now that you can prepare fabric for book
binding<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.240> make<00:02:05.479> your<00:02:05.659> own<00:02:05.780> book<00:02:06.049> cloth
