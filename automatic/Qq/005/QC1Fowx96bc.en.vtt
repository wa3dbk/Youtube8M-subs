00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.429

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 tell me what i like 7 my 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.780
 top 10 features that i love i already 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.670
 shared with you the fact that I hate as well, 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.230
 now I will show that I love me in general 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.359
 like the pace that took a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.609
 Apple company probably already decorate 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.380
 nowhere else but there is still something to improve and 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.519
 every update brings something new 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.410
 interesting 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.720
 Correction including generally ask 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.210
 iphone is the one who doesnâ€™t like it 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.200
 I think there is a little rs7 time 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.200
 go 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.910
 here 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.829
 colorful apple discounts to all 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.199
 subscribers from partner and apple store 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.329
 just.ru past video top 10 things 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.890
 which are furious at seven I asked 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.410
 leave comments that don't like 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.430
 you and you actively responded more than 4 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.199
 thousand comments 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.420
 mostly certainly not like animation 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.890
 to the general group of the system 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.020
 that's straight design without strength almost 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.060
 there were no such messages 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.430
 more interesting for the time while I 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.619
 did the second video here this apple 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.479
 managed to release update 703 already 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.759
 prepare for exit 7 and 1 in which 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.030
 many problems that we have seen 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:25.240
 in ios 7, the release starts to eliminate and 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.220
 speaking about the frantic because of ios 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.229
 7 users practically does not remain 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.119
 brought to mind all that we see on the iPhone 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.979
 add new whale on ipad 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.960
 interesting features and in general all 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.820
 it became great let's do so if 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.520
 you all like avis like 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.710
 this video if you like ios 6 more 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.860
 respectively dizlayki and know whom 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.659
 more on the tenth place of my top 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.550
 is an audio call on and set 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.899
 I will explain why in my surroundings a lot 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.599
 number of people with iPhones and iPads 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.030
 I'm not the people I can talk to 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.550
 this technology and it is much more interesting 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.229
 In this case, than skype vatsap Vaybery 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.030
 everything else because i don't need 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.830
 thinking man running application 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.929
 or not i just call him do it 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.520
 I find free Wi- Fi networks and 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:14.890
 enjoy sound quality 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:16.870
 airdrop and stream video core function 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.250
 allowing to create between two ios 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.319
 devices direct vayfay connection 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.780
 transfer media files in read 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.730
 seconds more dropbox version 3 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.739
 supports ir drop also so by 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.110
 In fact, you can transfer any files and 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.879
 my personal favorite is this video in stream 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.310
 Now I can send any video from 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.930
 Share your ios device stream with 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.879
 other friends or 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.099
 relatives and also to open access to 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.740
 internet who do not have as well, from the device 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.690
 mega cool 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.460
 in eighth place comfortably housed 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.780
 aytyuns radio function with a small 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.610
 reservations available only under 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.200
 american account but 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.060
 raise your hand those in our time 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.890
 there is no american and gender idea how 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.470
 at least not convenient I advise you to have 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.120
 and even with the advent of google play music in 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.950
 appstore in my opinion aytyuns radio is not 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.410
 lost its relevance because 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.630
 implemented all float convenient easy 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.030
 and beautifully you can create stations by 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.620
 genres by performer by song is 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.810
 crowds and find out with this for 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.010
 discovers a large number 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.350
 artists about whom I've never before 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.870
 not heard and probably by then with radio and 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.280
 I would not know what is most remarkable 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.380
 function works fine over cellular 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.120
 networking for me is also a big plus so 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.450
 that in every sense big respect apple 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.430
 I'm waiting for this function in Russia despite 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.470
 modest seventh place is absolutely mine 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.780
 favorite function gesture back or svayp 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.970
 back swiping from the left edge 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.800
 screen you return one item 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.690
 menu back and due to the fact that 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.910
 the functions are saturated with the whole system she 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.920
 supported in third-party applications 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.260
 and in general, wherever possible it is completely 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.880
 changes the interaction with al with you more 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.220
 no need to reach the top left corner 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.980
 which is inconvenient even on 4 inch 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.320
 smartphone now all johnaton thanks 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.850
 in sixth place auto-update programs 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.800
 backup and in general all automatic 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.390
 features new ls in this place 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.430
 android users can hanging on 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.500
 have the right to smile but as always 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.840
 apple turned out to make nice to eat 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.580
 one place where i can see how 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.350
 my programs in android have changed 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.600
 this information will not work 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.860
 and of course backup 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
 likelihood when my device 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.100
 connected to wifi is on 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.520
 charging auto content update 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.530
 programs all this together is like ours 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.359
 the fifth place is the control center in which 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.950
 main functions with which you are collected 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.960
 interact during the day 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.090
 the only thing i would ask apple 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.280
 opportunity to customize the future 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.170
 top row of icons that gives access to 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.210
 The basic functions of the phone are quick 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.340
 settings for example i would donate 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.550
 Bluetooth or airplane mode in favor 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.010
 switching 3g 4g internet in our 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.470
 edges from much would be more popular and 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.240
 more interesting in fourth place photo and 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.700
 camera and I'm not talking about the possibilities 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.830
 iphone 5s by serial shooting or recording 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.540
 120 frames on the contrary I like that on 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.700
 iphone and ipad interface stayed 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.950
 as simple and concise as possible 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.420
 came in did a photo came out more from me 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.310
 apps don't need anything 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.100
 I like the photo now 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.500
 geotagging organization for collections 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.720
 For years, the moment is very convenient, but with 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.970
 this left and the good old film 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.790
 where everything is in one heap I don't know there 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.160
 very comfortable and in third place with us 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.630
 ios 7 in general, I will now explain how 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.250
 stupid it looked at first glance 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.380
 the system has many small 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.140
 innovations beautiful fintiflyushek 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.450
 which are not separately distinguished but all 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.970
 together they create this most recent 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.500
 flow in relation to the operating room 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.020
 the system because you spend with the phone 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.150
 huge amount of time and this is important 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.950
 for example, siri still does not know Russian 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.710
 but already congratulate me on Hanukkah 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.840
 and so on and it seems to me the absence 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.460
 animation when enabled decrease 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.570
 movements that will be all one 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.940
 beautiful allows faster 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.860
 interaction with the phone is much more than 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.800
 from was on skip 6 and so on so on on 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.680
 in fact guys work to 71 before nags 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.510
 already to the final one 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.630
 quite well that is you know none 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.670
 function from transition from design from 6 to ios 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.220
 7 did not suffer but this one after all 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.750
 fresh flow he needed today 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.960
 when you look at the old skill 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.220
 Orphic icons in the community for a long time 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.470
 I thought what to put in second place 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.240
 flashlight or blacklist and Toby personally 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.860
 for me to block 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.530
 subscribers and deny them access to 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.510
 facer msr and phone has become a salvation 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.430
 as you understand, periodically annoying 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.810
 fans break through they can turn off 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.420
 at the touch of a button 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.250
 and I suggest choosing first place again 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:28.560
 yourself simply because personally 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.780
 for me the opinion of the audience is the most 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.610
 important i read your comments you 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.800
 write sometimes very interesting things 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.870
 so leave them to share what you need 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.390
 like at 7 for what you love this 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.850
 system which functions do you like 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:45.180
 how often would you use and vote 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.580
 Like for rs7 dislike for rs6 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.490
 let's see which of us is more i like my 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.620
 already left and recall that with those 1 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.690
 beta 1 is already in developer i 

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.190
 I expect release sometime in December there 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.560
 fixed almost all annoying 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.810
 glitches and bugs that were in release so 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.730
 that the system will be exactly what it is 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.470
 was supposed to be September 18th but 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.270
 a little bit and opal did not have time 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.580
 did we simplify the first such cant for 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.110
 Much time and with you was vilsack
