00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
about material on the back but if it's

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
about material on the back but if it's
aluminum<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> pretty<00:00:44.160> nice<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.610> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059

on a TI x smartphone that you can't
expand<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.810> memory<00:02:47.959> so<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.739> little<00:02:49.069> bit<00:02:49.190> boring

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
expand the memory so a little bit boring

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.759

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
going to be as good as the flagship

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.390 
going to be as good as the flagship
device<00:03:16.900> but<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.500> things<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.769> do<00:03:18.829> like<00:03:19.100> is<00:03:19.370> that

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
device but the things I do like is that

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.430 
device but the things I do like is that
we<00:03:19.880> haven't<00:03:20.299> seen<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.540> price<00:03:20.720> yet<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.380> looks

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
we haven't seen the price yet it looks

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.229 
we haven't seen the price yet it looks
pretty<00:03:21.739> sexy<00:03:22.190> on<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> back<00:03:22.579> with<00:03:22.910> with<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
camera design and everything and I think

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.890 
camera design and everything and I think
it<00:03:25.070> really<00:03:25.310> looks<00:03:25.579> nice<00:03:25.760> here<00:03:26.060> in<00:03:26.209> both<00:03:26.420> colors

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900

it really looks nice here in both colors
and<00:03:27.170> especially<00:03:27.470> if<00:03:27.920> it's<00:03:28.310> aluminum<00:03:28.820> as<00:03:28.970> well

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
and especially if it's aluminum as well

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.060 
and especially if it's aluminum as well
it<00:03:29.660> looks<00:03:29.810> pretty<00:03:29.959> cool<00:03:30.109> here<00:03:30.530> for<00:03:30.859> mid-range

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
it looks pretty cool here for mid-range

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.550 
it looks pretty cool here for mid-range
device<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:32.120> we'll<00:03:32.299> see<00:03:32.720> when<00:03:33.170> there's<00:03:33.410> going

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
device so we'll see when there's going

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.400 
device so we'll see when there's going
to<00:03:33.620> come<00:03:33.650> out<00:03:34.359> if<00:03:35.359> it<00:03:35.540> comes<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:35.959> a<00:03:36.019> good<00:03:36.170> price

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
to come out if it comes in a good price

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.979 
to come out if it comes in a good price
then<00:03:36.859> I<00:03:37.070> might<00:03:37.310> be<00:03:37.459> able<00:03:37.519> to<00:03:37.700> pick<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:37.880> up<00:03:38.060> i'm
