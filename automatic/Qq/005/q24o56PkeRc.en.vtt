00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.590
 So simon was here very early 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.820
 In the morning, empty out of the james 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.619
 so I can walk around here nicely 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.200
 so I can tell you how you are right 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.300
 trained so I tell you today 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.320
 how can you build a big arm? 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.910
 now just these biceps are not made 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.320
 and I really have to say the mistake 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.600
 many make the big poor the mistake 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.150
 just want to concentrate 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.879
 way too strong on the biceps always thinks 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:43.120
 the triceps is just the bigger one 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:45.960
 part of the big upper arm makes circa 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.059
 two-thirds of the upper arm for that reason 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.650
 Do not do too much biceps or 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.080
 neglected in any case not the 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.360
 Triceps has many disadvantages for one 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.250
 It may be that the biceps are up 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.110
 that means shortened if you really want to 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.570
 he trains a lot of biceps and gets shorter 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.430
 and this one if he does not train 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.839
 stay simple and you can do the evening 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.490
 not really stretch anymore 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.720
 always a bit angled that 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.369
 first point but the second one 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.020
 more important for you is probably 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.170
 that you just do not have a big name 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.280
 builds up only with biceps exercises you 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.990
 that's right and so early tomorrow 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.140
 Triceps exercise very important 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.789
 bringfried himself and avoids it 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.740
 make this mistake quite a lot 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.060
 I've noticed a lot, especially at 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.670
 For beginners, I do not know why also in 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.460
 most of the gym is explained that way 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.640
 you at the triceps when we are for example 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.439
 a cable since only that one only 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.780
 practically to 90 degrees high go 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.819
 and then down again actually 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.380
 complete nonsense 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.920
 many say that the joint is more beautiful 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.990
 and so on 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.670
 you would not bicep either 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.429
 Only half of the movement is done when 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.469
 think about it if you only go so far 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.479
 not trained the whole way 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.859
 that's why it's so important 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.060
 right now I should warm up well that is 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.189
 In any case, what today show it 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.960
 really if you do not warm up 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.710
 harmful to the joint or may 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.659
 be harmful 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.399
 why do very well true one to 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.050
 two sets of 30 repetitions this one 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.119
 nice elbows wait this is the one 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.040
 all bender nice madness 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.410
 but then you can really without 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.530
 problems train the whole movement 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.570
 that means with which salt goes if you 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.700
 go up with the elbow slightly 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.950
 back 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.019
 so that up here all the time 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.519
 tension on the triceps have until 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.790
 above bite in the arm just not anymore 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:32.760
 can bend and presses completely 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:38.370
 only then you really have the full 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.170
 move street sets you can do the same 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.970
 their movement does not weigh that much 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.950
 take as really is not so good 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.530
 for the joint forces show you now 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.450
 a short a small variation of the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.799
 all the whole movement in her 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.459
 you still have a lot of weight 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.980
 can take as I said the hand 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.150
 is a lot of weight 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.150
 grab the slightly curved rod 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.530
 put your head through is not quite 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:11.569
 high and pushes with very much 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.569
 you can not do much weight anymore 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:18.150
 after that you put a little weight on happy ending 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.730
 and as I did she just 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.730
 showed very clean 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:32.370
 is he really had to fail that 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.330
 Now properly trained exercises 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.110
 that's really very good of me 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.240
 is working 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.100
 think of it the whole body 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.470
 train and me with the triceps 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.819
 at the beginning of august , if that's so often 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.630
 Much fueled with the big ones 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.310
 muscle groups 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.470
 You already have a lot of triceps 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.560
 with disconnect afterwards one to two exercises 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.790
 two to three sentences are enough 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.380
 train hard to train intensively 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.750
 you know that's actually the one 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.200
 key subscribes to the channel and up 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.200
 next time
