further ado I'm going to go and get this

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.570 
further ado I'm going to go and get this
thing<00:01:12.420> cranked<00:01:12.780> up<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.110> bit<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.580> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
thing cranked up a little bit here you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.920 
thing cranked up a little bit here you
can<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:14.880> our<00:01:15.030> clamp<00:01:15.330> meter<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.780> our

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
can see our clamp meter in our

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.560 
can see our clamp meter in our
multimeter<00:01:16.820> these<00:01:17.820> numbers<00:01:18.150> multiplied

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
multimeter these numbers multiplied

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.539 
multimeter these numbers multiplied
together<00:01:18.630> will<00:01:18.990> give<00:01:19.229> us<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.619> Armas<00:01:20.340> power

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
together will give us the Armas power

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.190 
together will give us the Armas power
that<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> subah<00:01:21.030> seen

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.230 

so<00:01:24.620> here<00:01:24.740> we<00:01:24.830> go<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.010> can<00:01:25.190> turn<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:25.490> up<00:01:25.580> now

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so here we go I can turn it up now

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.300 
so here we go I can turn it up now
so<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.930> far<00:01:28.200> we're<00:01:28.409> about<00:01:28.590> five<00:01:28.830> amps<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so so far we're about five amps and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.969 
so so far we're about five amps and
twenty<00:01:29.729> volts<00:01:29.940> that's<00:01:30.360> 100<00:01:30.750> watts
