00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
sometimes on particular fly patterns and

sometimes on particular fly patterns and
that's<00:00:49.650> all<00:00:49.830> to<00:00:50.100> keep<00:00:51.059> from<00:00:51.390> crowding<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.290> eye

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
that's all to keep from crowding the eye

that's all to keep from crowding the eye
of<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.650> hook<00:00:52.860> when<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.100> finish<00:00:53.520> our<00:00:53.670> fly<00:00:54.560> so

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
of that hook when we finish our fly so

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.930 
of that hook when we finish our fly so
now<00:00:55.740> we're<00:00:55.950> attaching<00:00:56.370> our<00:00:56.640> tail<00:00:57.710> or<00:00:58.940> chenille

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
now we're attaching our tail or chenille

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.219 
now we're attaching our tail or chenille
rather<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.940> our<00:01:02.940> tail<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.480> roughly

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
rather and our tail is roughly

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.230 
rather and our tail is roughly
one-and-a-half<00:01:04.589> times<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.339> length<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
one-and-a-half times the length of the

one-and-a-half times the length of the
hook<00:01:06.509> shank<00:01:09.080> whereas<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.380> head<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.009> our<00:01:11.100> fly

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
hook shank whereas the head of our fly

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.440 
hook shank whereas the head of our fly
is<00:01:11.399> about<00:01:13.399> one<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.759> and<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.940> half<00:01:14.970> times<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
is about one to one and a half times the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.060 
is about one to one and a half times the
length<00:01:15.660> let's<00:01:16.649> say<00:01:16.830> closer<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.310> one

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.980 

and<00:01:21.580> now<00:01:21.909> we're<00:01:22.060> just<00:01:22.090> going<00:01:22.390> to<00:01:22.450> build<00:01:22.690> up<00:01:22.840> a

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
and now we're just going to build up a

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.580 
and now we're just going to build up a
thread<00:01:23.670> base<00:01:24.670> here<00:01:25.090> at<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.840> head<00:01:26.020> of<00:01:26.050> the<00:01:26.200> fly

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.320 

we're<00:01:29.590> using<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.979> fluorescent<00:01:30.550> fire<00:01:30.970> orange

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
we're using a fluorescent fire orange

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.940 
we're using a fluorescent fire orange

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
thread with the warm brown chenille I

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.620 
thread with the warm brown chenille I
mean<00:01:35.950> that<00:01:36.159> that<00:01:36.369> thread<00:01:36.610> base<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:37.030> all<00:01:37.210> to

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
mean that that thread base is all to

imitate the sex band that you see on
annelids<00:01:45.780> now<00:01:46.780> we've<00:01:46.930> put<00:01:47.170> some<00:01:47.320> head<00:01:47.440> cement

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
annelids now we've put some head cement

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.350 
annelids now we've put some head cement
on<00:01:47.920> our<00:01:48.070> thread<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.670> we're<00:01:48.850> going<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.119> do<00:01:49.330> a

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
on our thread and we're going to do a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:02:00.110 
on our thread and we're going to do a
simple<00:01:49.930> whip<00:01:50.200> finish<00:01:50.560> not

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.760 

and<00:02:00.240> then<00:02:00.810> we're<00:02:00.900> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.050> cut<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and then we're going to cut the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.730 
and then we're going to cut the
underbody<00:02:03.260> with<00:02:04.260> the<00:02:05.480> headsman<00:02:06.480> also<00:02:06.900> just

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
underbody with the headsman also just

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
underbody with the headsman also just
protect<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> exposed<00:02:08.760> thread<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.570> then

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
protect that exposed thread and then

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.950 
protect that exposed thread and then
singe<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.000> ends<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.710> seal<00:02:13.710> off<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.070> fly<00:02:14.960> and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
singe the ends to seal off the fly and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.800 
singe the ends to seal off the fly and
there<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.770> it
