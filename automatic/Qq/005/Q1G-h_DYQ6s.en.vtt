00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
the couple should go in the short line

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.520 
the couple should go in the short line
like<00:05:43.870> creating<00:05:44.560> a<00:05:44.680> curve<00:05:44.949> in<00:05:45.849> in<00:05:46.419> this<00:05:46.660> way<00:05:46.930> for

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
like creating a curve in in this way for

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.740 
like creating a curve in in this way for
the<00:05:47.650> same<00:05:47.800> reason<00:05:48.220> they<00:05:48.669> will<00:05:48.849> not<00:05:49.060> stop<00:05:49.570> the

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
the same reason they will not stop the

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.200 
the same reason they will not stop the
movement<00:05:50.139> they<00:05:50.349> will<00:05:50.530> not<00:05:50.880> decorate<00:05:51.880> their

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
movement they will not decorate their

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.270 
movement they will not decorate their
speed<00:05:52.570> and<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.080> length<00:05:53.260> of<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.590> step<00:05:53.800> will<00:05:54.099> be

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
speed and the length of the step will be

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.300 
speed and the length of the step will be
the<00:05:54.849> same<00:05:55.090> so<00:05:55.960> I<00:05:56.260> ask<00:05:56.470> now<00:05:56.680> Benedictine

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
the same so I ask now Benedictine

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:05.720 
the same so I ask now Benedictine
Claudia<00:05:57.789> thank<00:05:58.240> you<00:05:58.360> very<00:05:58.510> much

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.300 

so<00:06:06.730> when<00:06:06.970> I<00:06:07.000> get<00:06:07.150> to<00:06:07.210> start<00:06:07.630> of<00:06:07.810> course<00:06:07.840> in<00:06:08.680> a

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
so when I get to start of course in a

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.110 
so when I get to start of course in a
only<00:06:09.910> rebus<00:06:10.210> okay<00:06:10.510> line<00:06:10.720> up<00:06:10.750> dance<00:06:11.110> and<00:06:12.120> he

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
only rebus okay line up dance and he

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.680 
only rebus okay line up dance and he
will<00:06:13.300> dance<00:06:13.510> the<00:06:13.660> first<00:06:13.960> long<00:06:14.260> side<00:06:14.560> and<00:06:15.690> one

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
will dance the first long side and one

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.200 
will dance the first long side and one
two<00:06:17.050> three<00:06:17.440> two<00:06:17.800> two<00:06:17.830> three<00:06:18.400> one<00:06:18.880> two<00:06:18.910> three

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
two three two two three one two three

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.650 
two three two two three one two three
one<00:06:19.780> can<00:06:20.260> start<00:06:20.590> to<00:06:20.770> curve<00:06:21.090> to<00:06:22.090> maintain<00:06:22.480> the

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
one can start to curve to maintain the

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.420 
one can start to curve to maintain the
same<00:06:22.900> movement<00:06:23.350> the<00:06:23.500> same<00:06:23.680> speed<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.250> same

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
same movement the same speed the same

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
same movement the same speed the same
amount<00:06:24.820> of<00:06:26.400> movement<00:06:27.400> around<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:28.030> floor<00:06:28.270> of

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
amount of movement around the floor of

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.540 
amount of movement around the floor of
holes<00:06:28.690> in<00:06:28.960> the<00:06:29.050> second<00:06:29.500> corner<00:06:29.800> in<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.340> third

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
holes in the second corner in the third

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.720 
holes in the second corner in the third
corner<00:06:30.940> and<00:06:31.270> so<00:06:31.810> on<00:06:31.900> so<00:06:32.170> on<00:06:32.200> so<00:06:32.320> on<00:06:32.560> so<00:06:32.860> this<00:06:33.670> is

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
corner and so on so on so on so this is

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.810 
corner and so on so on so on so this is
actually<00:06:34.330> what<00:06:34.540> until<00:06:34.990> now<00:06:35.050> which<00:06:35.980> we<00:06:36.400> used<00:06:36.640> to

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
actually what until now which we used to

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.290 
actually what until now which we used to
see<00:06:37.060> when<00:06:37.330> couple<00:06:37.930> bands<00:06:38.940> naturally<00:06:39.940> and<00:06:40.180> the

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
see when couple bands naturally and the

00:06:40.300 --> 00:07:00.370 
see when couple bands naturally and the
reverse

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:07.699 

maybe<00:07:01.639> I<00:07:02.639> would<00:07:03.510> always<00:07:03.690> be<00:07:04.199> I<00:07:04.860> will<00:07:05.490> always
