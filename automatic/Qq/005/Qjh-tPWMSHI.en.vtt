comparable to the Bobby box ocean wave
on<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.590> wave<00:01:54.010> pattern<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.790> if<00:01:55.330> it's<00:01:55.750> really

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
on the wave pattern of it if it's really

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.170 
on the wave pattern of it if it's really
nice<00:01:56.230> in<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:57.220> think<00:01:57.640> I<00:01:57.850> think<00:01:58.090> I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
nice in it and I think I think I

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.560 
nice in it and I think I think I
realized<00:01:58.510> that<00:01:58.690> uh<00:01:59.370> cheaper<00:02:00.370> hair<00:02:00.640> come<00:02:01.120> seems

realized that uh cheaper hair come seems

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.980 
realized that uh cheaper hair come seems
to<00:02:01.690> be<00:02:01.750> longer<00:02:02.110> like<00:02:02.440> this<00:02:02.470> is<00:02:02.890> 16<00:02:03.310> inches<00:02:03.340> and

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to be longer like this is 16 inches and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.600 
to be longer like this is 16 inches and
this<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.140> curled<00:02:05.740> right<00:02:05.920> now<00:02:06.040> if<00:02:06.250> it<00:02:06.430> was

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
this is curled right now if it was

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.060 
this is curled right now if it was
uncrowned<00:02:07.240> this<00:02:07.840> would<00:02:08.050> be<00:02:08.170> about<00:02:08.289> a<00:02:08.440> 20<00:02:08.860> inch

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
uncrowned this would be about a 20 inch

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.550 
uncrowned this would be about a 20 inch
like<00:02:09.490> come<00:02:09.820> on<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.899> gotta<00:02:11.080> let<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.410> know
