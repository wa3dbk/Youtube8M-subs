00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
stuff like that sort of like the one

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.730 
stuff like that sort of like the one
that's<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> Eddie<00:01:35.759> zeros<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.590> see

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that's on the Eddie zeros you can see

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.289 
that's on the Eddie zeros you can see
that<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:38.189> coach<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.610> well<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.000> these<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.270> my

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
that my coach as well so these are my

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.840 
that my coach as well so these are my
coach<00:01:39.630> compatible<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.729> has<00:01:41.820> that

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
coach compatible it just has that

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.510 
coach compatible it just has that
glitter<00:01:42.299> effect<00:01:42.950> overall<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
glitter effect overall I think it's a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
glitter effect overall I think it's a
pretty<00:01:44.700> good<00:01:44.880> boot<00:01:45.090> should<00:01:45.840> be<00:01:45.960> interesting

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
pretty good boot should be interesting

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.230 
pretty good boot should be interesting
when<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> comes<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.070> trying<00:01:47.759> them<00:01:47.939> out<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
when it comes to trying them out and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
when it comes to trying them out and
testing<00:01:48.630> them<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.979> don't<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.130> I'll

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
testing them I don't think I'll

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.219 
testing them I don't think I'll
encounter<00:01:50.670> any<00:01:50.880> issues<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.810> only<00:01:51.990> issues

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
encounter any issues the only issues

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.840

I've<00:01:52.380> had<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:52.740> Eddie<00:01:52.920> Eddie<00:01:53.280> zeros<00:01:53.640> is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I've had with Eddie Eddie zeros is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.060 
I've had with Eddie Eddie zeros is
basically<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> stud<00:01:54.630> falling<00:01:54.990> off<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
basically a stud falling off and the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.830 
basically a stud falling off and the
soleplate<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.939> kind<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.450> ripping

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
soleplate you know like kind of ripping

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.630 
soleplate you know like kind of ripping
apart<00:01:57.930> from<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.439> but<00:01:59.310> other<00:01:59.430> than<00:01:59.549> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
apart from here but other than that
