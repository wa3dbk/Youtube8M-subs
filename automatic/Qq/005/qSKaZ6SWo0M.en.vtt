 and the environment for the producer, besides adding value to the product, the seal is the 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.990
 result of investment in production systems 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470
 more profitable 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.630
 I think it's the integrated production 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.439
 is a program of the Ministry of Agriculture that 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.400
 product following environmental sustainability requirements

 these customers of the production system all still losses and evil 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.240
 product utilization in addition to minimizing the risks of 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.610

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 lasts longer and tastier 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.430
 it's a safe product 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.480
