00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi friends from youtube today I come with a 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.150
 video where I will comment on some bad 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.269
 news that I found out about the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 season 25 of the simpsons good will see 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.440
 I'm really bothered by this news 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.080
 but it is my duty to inform myself 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.970
 youtubers good let's start first 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.510
 a news that maybe they have already 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.730
 heard if I talk about the death of the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.949
 teacher in accra vapor will see in a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.109
 principle this news was given to 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.090
 meet by the creator of the series matt 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.099
 groening but without specifying who 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.320
 it would be the person who would die little 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.540
 after starting this season it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.730
 presents a chapter that I think is called 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.040
 four laments and a funeral in which 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.230
 a character dies that never before 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 had seen and believed that this would be the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.700
 supposed character who would die without 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.250
 However, some time later it was announced that the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.739
 character that would die would be the teacher 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.570
 etna because of pneumonia, although the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.730
 The real reason for his death is the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.770
 death of marcia water since the person 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.989
 that gave voice to this character by 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.180
 blame for a cancer that killed her 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.040
 for this it was decided to kill the character 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.130
 instead of putting another person who 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.590
 make your voice who knows 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.539
 maybe a tribute to marcia guay makes or 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.610
 maybe the fact of not wanting to pay 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.590
 another actor or they may also want 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.689
 give some plot to the series something 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.390
 curious is that the one would be the second 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.909
 person and second wife of flanders who 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.250
 die in series of good here x 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.619
 the bad news does not end it turns out that 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.920
 season 25 will be the last season 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.530
 The Simpsons explained Matt Groening 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.810
 after 24 seasons he realized 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.390
 that his work was increasingly taking 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.340
 less thanks as he said he should finish 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.679
 simpson with them even now 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.259
 there was something good before it 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.810
 come back bored he decided that the best 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.090
 would be to do a final season to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.640
 end the series let's be fair 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.380
 after all this time you can 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.240
 notice how bad they have become the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.819
 simpson unlike what they were 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.009
 sometime as it says macro and now only 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.049
 It has become boring but I do not know 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.060
 discourage because between these bad 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.649
 news there is a good one and that is that matt 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.440
 Groening also said the following 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.630
 I'll leave the simpsons until I've passed 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.220
 some time and so see if the program 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.620
 retakes its value 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.840
 of everything then it is possible that the series 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.480
 come back sometime what you do not know if 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.520
 It will take a long time to get back well here 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.430
 all with these bad news but 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.840
 tell me you would like more bad news 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.660
 I guess not so do not say anything 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.970
 but I leave you with a curiosity they knew 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.520
 that the age of flanders despite being 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.220
 muscular and look pretty young is of 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.650
 63 years since Asia is hopefully 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.200
 liked the video do not forget to subscribe 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.780
 I like it in the end postscript I'm going to 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.110
 upload season 24 and if you do not give me 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.110
 laziness the 25 subtitled chau chau
