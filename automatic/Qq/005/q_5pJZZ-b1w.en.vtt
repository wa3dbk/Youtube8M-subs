00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.340
 this movie should help you recognize 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.349
 a sensitive drill of workshops and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.349
 identify the main elements 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:33.120
 you have seen or even use a 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:36.120
 hand drill look bewitch us 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.120
 stops 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.960
 hold a hand drill 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.620
 perpendicular to the piece to be drilled 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.620
 is not easy 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.070
 here the perpendicular it and is insured 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.070
 by the machine 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.230
 penetration and transmitted ports 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.590
 directly by the push of the hand and 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.590
 from the body 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.040
 and here by the capstan 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:36.710
 the base and the column on the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:44.330
 geometry of the whole the table she 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:53.720
 can go up or down and turn 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:57.190
 around the column the engine transmits 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.190
 its rotation on the spit 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.929
 by means of pulleys and belt but 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.440
 it is also necessary that this pin can 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:18.020
 lowering the capstan allows this 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:29.120
 movement the walking commands and 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:30.980
 aaron on this drill the button 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.950
 stop is also the stop button 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.739
 emergency you may already have 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.430
 preview when we lifted the crankcase 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.069
 protection 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.069
 this small element is a circuit breaker 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.280
 look at this drill does not work 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.680
 6 but the circuit breaker played its role 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.850
 you must be able now to 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.970
 locate among the machines in the workshop 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.960
 the sensitive drills and to designate them 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.960
 the main elements
