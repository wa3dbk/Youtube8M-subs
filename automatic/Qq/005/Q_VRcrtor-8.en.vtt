quick tip video to help you improve even

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.120 
quick tip video to help you improve even
more<00:00:06.299> so<00:00:06.540> than<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.140> already<00:00:07.350> are<00:00:07.560> what<00:00:08.010> we're

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
more so than you already are what we're

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.650 
more so than you already are what we're
going<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.370> looking<00:00:08.639> at<00:00:08.760> today<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
going to be looking at today is the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.070 
going to be looking at today is the
correct<00:00:09.929> method<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:11.190> jump<00:00:11.849> between<00:00:11.969> bases<00:00:12.780> at

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
correct method to jump between bases at

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.250 
correct method to jump between bases at
a<00:00:13.139> rapid<00:00:14.070> speed<00:00:14.099> here<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.150> for<00:00:15.690> example<00:00:16.109> right

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
a rapid speed here so for example right

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.010 
a rapid speed here so for example right
now<00:00:16.440> we<00:00:16.500> have<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.130> big<00:00:17.789> long<00:00:18.270> drawn-out<00:00:18.750> game

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
now we have a big long drawn-out game

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
now we have a big long drawn-out game
just<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.410> replay<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:19.949> I've<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.279> loaded<00:00:20.580> up

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
just a replay that I've just loaded up

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
just a replay that I've just loaded up
to<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> look<00:00:21.420> at<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> example<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.140> have

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
to have a look at the example we have

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.620 
to have a look at the example we have
bases<00:00:22.769> across<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.340> map<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> main<00:00:24.420> base

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
bases across the map we have a main base

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.140 
bases across the map we have a main base
here<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.529> have<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> natural<00:00:25.980> set<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.640> third

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
here we have a natural set up a third

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.419 
here we have a natural set up a third
and<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.840> course<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.289> fourth<00:00:28.590> base<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.400> I

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and of course a fourth base and what I

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.099 
and of course a fourth base and what I
want<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.060> jump<00:00:30.269> between<00:00:30.420> them<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.840> fast

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
want to do is jump between them as fast

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.110 
want to do is jump between them as fast
as<00:00:31.289> possible<00:00:31.460> let's<00:00:32.460> have<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> look<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.090> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
as possible let's have a look at some of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
as possible let's have a look at some of
the<00:00:33.239> methods<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.690> may<00:00:33.899> already<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.350> using<00:00:34.710> for

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
the methods you may already be using for

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130 
the methods you may already be using for
example<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.000> may<00:00:36.210> want<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.780> automate

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
example you may want to just automate

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.690 
example you may want to just automate
you<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.350> may<00:00:37.590> want<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.160> maybe<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.489> do

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
you know may want to but maybe you do

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.580 
you know may want to but maybe you do
just<00:00:39.239> drag<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> mouse<00:00:39.899> as<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.350> see<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
just drag the mouse as you can see the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.740 
just drag the mouse as you can see the
cursor<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:41.430> green<00:00:41.640> box<00:00:41.820> drag<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
cursor in this green box drag it to the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
cursor in this green box drag it to the
left<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.770> go<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> your<00:00:44.489> second<00:00:44.969> base

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
left and you go to your second base

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.940 
left and you go to your second base
maybe<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.590> follow<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
maybe some of you if you follow the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
maybe some of you if you follow the
cursor<00:00:47.100> again<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.789> go<00:00:48.000> down<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.600> click<00:00:49.289> on

cursor again just go down and click on
the<00:00:49.710> mini-map<00:00:50.059> maybe<00:00:51.059> some<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> hit<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the mini-map maybe some of you hit the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.340 
the mini-map maybe some of you hit the

this<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> waste<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.710> time<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.159> you're<00:01:38.310> doing

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
this is a waste of time if you're doing

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.060 
this is a waste of time if you're doing
this<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.140> if<00:01:40.140> you're<00:01:40.259> trying<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.770> around

between<00:01:44.369> these<00:01:44.670> bases<00:01:45.030> it's<00:01:45.390> much<00:01:45.780> much

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
between these bases it's much much

better<00:01:46.200> for<00:01:46.409> your<00:01:46.500> game<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> how<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
better for your game and this is how to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.850 
better for your game and this is how to
do<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.390> if<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:48.780> ahead<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.140> press<00:01:49.229> f10

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
do it so if you go ahead and press f10

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.350 
do it so if you go ahead and press f10
which<00:01:50.159> will<00:01:50.310> bring<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> menu<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.060> go<00:01:51.329> to

hotkeys<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.640> change<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.939> from<00:01:57.030> my

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119

hotkeys I'm just gonna change it from my
selected<00:01:57.570> profile<00:01:57.960> which<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.380> I

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
selected profile which is the one I

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.139 
selected profile which is the one I
already<00:01:58.799> play<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.310> go<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.820> normal

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
already play on and go to just a normal

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.850 
already play on and go to just a normal
standard<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.689> which<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.259> where<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.560> usually

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
standard one which is where you usually

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
standard one which is where you usually
will<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:03.090> let's<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:03.450> ahead<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.840> go<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
will be so let's go ahead and go to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.380 
will be so let's go ahead and go to
global<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.740> then<00:02:05.369> camera<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.329> a

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
global and then camera because it's a

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.730 
global and then camera because it's a
camera<00:02:06.780> thing<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.140> we're<00:02:07.259> changing<00:02:07.290> here

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
camera thing that we're changing here

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.550 
camera thing that we're changing here
today<00:02:07.979> we<00:02:08.580> don't<00:02:08.789> want<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.300> ctrl<00:02:09.840> +<00:02:10.289> f5

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
today we don't want to have ctrl + f5

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.309 
today we don't want to have ctrl + f5
it's<00:02:11.099> much<00:02:11.340> easier<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.330> go<00:02:12.989> over<00:02:13.200> to

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
it's much easier to just go over to

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.790 
it's much easier to just go over to
shift

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
shift

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.110 
shift
because<00:02:13.920> shift<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> actually<00:02:14.610> fine<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.970> do

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
because shift is actually fine to do

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.760 
because shift is actually fine to do
so--here<00:02:15.360> shift<00:02:16.220> f-150<00:02:17.220> f-250<00:02:18.030> f-350<00:02:18.720> f<00:02:19.440> for

so--here shift f-150 f-250 f-350 f for

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.620 
so--here shift f-150 f-250 f-350 f for
the<00:02:20.160> something<00:02:20.760> which<00:02:20.940> was<00:02:21.150> used<00:02:21.450> for

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
the something which was used for

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.960 
the something which was used for
broodwar<00:02:22.440> pro-gamers<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> long<00:02:23.460> long<00:02:23.670> time<00:02:23.910> ago

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.360 
broodwar pro-gamers a long long time ago
and<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.870> being<00:02:25.080> able<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.380> shift<00:02:25.770> control

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
and just being able to shift control

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.250 
and just being able to shift control
different<00:02:27.180> locations<00:02:27.660> on<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.870> map<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.140> it

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
different locations on the map and it

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.290 
different locations on the map and it
doesn't<00:02:28.500> actually<00:02:28.590> need<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.160> be<00:02:29.310> bases<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:29.940> you

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
doesn't actually need to be bases if you

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.180 
doesn't actually need to be bases if you
want<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.600> get<00:02:30.750> creative<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.380> can<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.590> specific

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
want to get creative it can be specific

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.460 
want to get creative it can be specific
strategical<00:02:33.120> positions<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> map<00:02:33.810> but<00:02:34.290> for

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
strategical positions on the map but for

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.900 
strategical positions on the map but for
now<00:02:34.560> we'll<00:02:34.710> keep<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:35.010> simple<00:02:35.190> just<00:02:35.670> for<00:02:35.820> these

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
now we'll keep it simple just for these

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.760 
now we'll keep it simple just for these
four<00:02:36.150> bases<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:37.290> jump<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.650> that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
four bases and they jump to that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.300 
four bases and they jump to that
location<00:02:38.160> we<00:02:38.700> want<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.060> pressing<00:02:39.420> f1<00:02:39.900> f2<00:02:40.350> f3

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.120 
location we want to be pressing f1 f2 f3
f4<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:44.520> reason<00:02:44.910> why<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.330> we've<00:02:45.450> got

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
f4 and the reason why that we've got

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.650 
f4 and the reason why that we've got
them<00:02:47.130> set<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:47.460> like<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:48.030> very<00:02:48.330> simple

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
them set up like this it's very simple

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.540 
them set up like this it's very simple
to<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:48.960> so<00:02:49.170> because<00:02:49.560> if<00:02:49.920> you're<00:02:50.100> for<00:02:50.520> example

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
to do so because if you're for example

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.400 
to do so because if you're for example
controlling<00:02:51.390> your<00:02:51.510> hotkey<00:02:51.930> groups<00:02:52.230> with

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
you just jump up a little bit with your

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.460 
you just jump up a little bit with your
hand<00:02:56.910> you're<00:02:57.420> able<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.020> these<00:02:58.170> keys

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
very easily and get to the bases you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.970 
very easily and get to the bases you

this<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.810> something<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.230> simply<00:03:40.290> ignore<00:03:41.130> if

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
this is a function that you use I would

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.590 
this is a function that you use I would
suggest<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.520> looking<00:03:45.000> for<00:03:45.180> somewhere<00:03:45.450> where

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
suggest just looking for somewhere where

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.390 
suggest just looking for somewhere where
it<00:03:45.660> fits<00:03:45.989> in<00:03:46.230> where<00:03:46.620> it's<00:03:46.770> comfortable<00:03:47.010> for

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
it fits in where it's comfortable for

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.010 
it fits in where it's comfortable for
you<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.580> get<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.209> then<00:03:48.540> it's<00:03:48.690> not<00:03:48.840> gonna

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
you to get to and then it's not gonna

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.630 
you to get to and then it's not gonna
distract<00:03:49.410> you<00:03:49.650> or<00:03:49.680> be<00:03:49.980> awkward<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.550> to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
distract you or be awkward for you to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.030 
distract you or be awkward for you to
use<00:03:50.850> but<00:03:51.540> for<00:03:51.720> me<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.959> simply<00:03:52.530> just<00:03:52.680> ignore<00:03:53.010> it

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
use but for me I simply just ignore it

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.190 
use but for me I simply just ignore it
and<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.430> accept<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.090> I'm<00:03:54.480> happy<00:03:54.900> with<00:03:55.020> having

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
and it accept and I'm happy with having

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.320 
and it accept and I'm happy with having
this<00:03:55.380> unbound<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.070> press<00:03:56.280> yes<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.970> then<00:03:57.180> we

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
this unbound and press yes and then we

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.780 
this unbound and press yes and then we
just<00:03:57.510> save<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:58.050> can<00:03:58.230> call<00:03:58.410> it<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.590> polo<00:03:58.860> video

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
just save it we can call it a polo video

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.990 
just save it we can call it a polo video
and<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.810> one<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.560> then<00:04:02.010> it<00:04:02.220> saves<00:04:02.550> it's<00:04:02.790> done

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and just one and then it saves it's done

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.400 
and just one and then it saves it's done
and<00:04:03.150> then<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.360> can<00:04:03.480> load<00:04:03.630> that<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:03.810> every<00:04:04.170> time

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
and then you can load that up every time

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.290 
and then you can load that up every time
and<00:04:04.739> what<00:04:04.920> that<00:04:05.160> will<00:04:05.250> enable<00:04:05.640> us<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:05.880> do<00:04:06.120> now

across<00:04:33.070> all<00:04:33.250> four<00:04:33.490> bases<00:04:33.910> so<00:04:34.330> what<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.660> did<00:04:34.900> in

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
across all four bases so what I did in

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.860 
across all four bases so what I did in
slow<00:04:35.260> motion<00:04:35.470> was<00:04:36.100> go<00:04:36.640> press<00:04:36.970> f1<00:04:37.480> to<00:04:37.510> my<00:04:37.720> main

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
slow motion was go press f1 to my main

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.000 
slow motion was go press f1 to my main
base<00:04:38.080> grab<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.530> Queen

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010

inject and then over here the center

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.600 
inject and then over here the center
again<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.140> this<00:04:50.350> is<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.560> really<00:04:50.980> fast<00:04:51.190> method<00:04:51.520> to

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
again so this is a really fast method to

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:52.890 
again so this is a really fast method to
love<00:04:51.790> eject<00:04:52.060> to<00:04:52.120> move<00:04:52.300> between<00:04:52.450> your<00:04:52.660> bases

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
love eject to move between your bases

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.810 
love eject to move between your bases
but<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.110> doesn't<00:04:53.410> just<00:04:53.590> apply<00:04:53.680> to<00:04:53.860> Zerg<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.640> can

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
but it doesn't just apply to Zerg it can

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.580 
but it doesn't just apply to Zerg it can
apply<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.090> Protestant<00:04:55.600> Terran<00:04:55.870> as<00:04:55.990> well<00:04:56.170> for

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
apply to Protestant Terran as well for

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.500 
apply to Protestant Terran as well for
example<00:04:56.680> a<00:04:57.160> Protoss<00:04:57.730> player<00:04:57.970> at<00:04:58.330> the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
example a Protoss player at the

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.110 
example a Protoss player at the
10-minute<00:04:58.720> mark<00:04:58.960> is<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.410> know<00:04:59.620> gets<00:05:00.310> really

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
10-minute mark is you know gets really

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.430 
10-minute mark is you know gets really
really<00:05:01.390> messy<00:05:01.570> when<00:05:01.840> it<00:05:01.930> comes<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.230> dealing

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
really messy when it comes to dealing

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.020 
really messy when it comes to dealing
with<00:05:02.530> drops<00:05:02.890> if<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.430> want<00:05:03.640> to<00:05:03.760> be<00:05:03.880> able<00:05:03.940> to

jump<00:05:04.240> between<00:05:04.360> bases<00:05:04.840> really<00:05:05.170> fast<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.800> be

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
jump between bases really fast to be

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.710 
jump between bases really fast to be
able<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.100> deal<00:05:06.280> with<00:05:06.490> attacks<00:05:07.150> King<00:05:07.420> coming

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
you're able to get there fast if you

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.950 
you're able to get there fast if you
don't<00:05:09.490> have<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.090> best<00:05:10.240> reactions<00:05:10.750> when

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
don't have the best reactions when

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.660 
don't have the best reactions when
something<00:05:11.560> gets<00:05:11.620> dropped<00:05:11.920> into<00:05:12.160> your<00:05:12.370> mineral

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
know we're moving our Queen with

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.340 
know we're moving our Queen with
defending<00:05:19.210> oh<00:05:19.390> no<00:05:19.690> there's<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.960> drop<00:05:20.110> on<00:05:20.230> our

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:20.350 
defending oh no there's a drop on our

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.870 
defending oh no there's a drop on our
fourth<00:05:20.530> base<00:05:20.740> BAM<00:05:21.010> we're<00:05:21.220> already<00:05:21.400> there<00:05:21.700> and

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
fourth base BAM we're already there and

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.520 
fourth base BAM we're already there and
you<00:05:21.940> move<00:05:22.360> your<00:05:22.510> drones<00:05:22.720> out<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:22.990> way<00:05:23.110> oh<00:05:23.260> no

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
you move your drones out the way oh no

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.410 
you move your drones out the way oh no
something<00:05:23.890> on<00:05:24.010> our<00:05:24.130> natural<00:05:24.250> BAM<00:05:24.910> we<00:05:25.090> move<00:05:25.270> our

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
something on our natural BAM we move our

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.010 
something on our natural BAM we move our
stuff<00:05:25.600> out<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:25.780> the<00:05:25.870> way

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
stuff out of the way

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.140 
stuff out of the way
so<00:05:26.410> by<00:05:26.620> hitting<00:05:26.860> these<00:05:27.040> Keys<00:05:27.340> you're<00:05:27.790> able<00:05:28.060> to

so by hitting these Keys you're able to

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.300 
so by hitting these Keys you're able to
just<00:05:28.360> play<00:05:28.540> a<00:05:28.570> bit<00:05:28.630> faster<00:05:29.200> and<00:05:29.380> I<00:05:29.920> think<00:05:30.190> it

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
just play a bit faster and I think it

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.880 
just play a bit faster and I think it
will<00:05:30.400> help<00:05:30.610> you<00:05:30.760> improve<00:05:30.850> quite<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.330> bit<00:05:31.540> so<00:05:32.230> if
