00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.250
 hi everyone new and very short video 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.980
 creations in which it shows you precisely 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.110
 what I did these days and 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.300
 some things I did even a little 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.980
 long ago 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.410
 let's start with the earrings more 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:34.820
 old people who are these here now 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.760
 you all know and are mine 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.250
 autumn star earrings of which I have 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.629
 also made a tutorial are 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.549
 six-pointed stars and for all 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.299
 details regarding this processing 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:55.040
 I will report the tutorial below this 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:59.890
 video I show them to you because I actually have 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:03.229
 made a small variation to the tutorial 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.690
 that I have already shown you and from this 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.960
 variation have gone these earrings 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:14.329
 here that are just the stars a 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.539
 five points made with b cones in 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:20.180
 6 mm reality but I recommend you 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.030
 always use washers because 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.229
 this type of processing is more stable 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.289
 with washers or with b cones 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.500
 slightly smaller 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:37.840
 then I used that precious letwin 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.259
 he had sent me for their competition e 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:47.200
 of the 80 very simple rails and the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.200
 precisely color is black mat 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.590
 so it's a simple idea to have 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.840
 just a five-pointed star 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.539
 then the only variation I have 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.920
 done to get this effect is 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.420
 simply starting with 5 twin's 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.240
 basis 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.410
 then the first twin round 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:16.760
 which is done in the tutorial instead of 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.300
 enter 6 then enter 5to onwards 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.730
 otherwise the processing is 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.700
 absolutely identical by changing precisely 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:29.660
 the starting twin number will be obtained 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.720
 these five stars have a different shape 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.720
 tips 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.290
 then we continue with this other 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.880
 processing and this time it is 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:46.040
 earrings and meridians taken from 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:48.530
 tutorial of of big it but on youtube vi 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 I will leave the link to the tutorial always in 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:56.750
 information box and I think they are 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.390
 really really beautiful earrings the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.630
 processing of the various modules is very 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:09.260
 simple very fast to do must 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:13.700
 use 60 in this case 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.800
 I luckily had these these 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.300
 60 rails that sent me the precious one 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.700
 otherwise it would have been difficult and 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.240
 replace them with something because 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.250
 precisely to the rails are slightly more 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:35.530
 flat compared to a 4 mm pearl 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.700
 or to a b cone and so I have 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.480
 made these earrings in this one 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.680
 coloring using rails 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:50.840
 silver of the black rails and the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:56.810
 then used blue color rails 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:04:02.720
 11 0 80 and 60 in the center then I entered 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:07.450
 this 6 mm onyx ball and how 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.760
 see I used a form 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.090
 of the earring itself to insert 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:18.520
 inside the pin with which 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.520
 precisely the earring is attached 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:31.000
 so this is one and this is the other e 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:34.400
 finally I show you my ball 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.150
 then this sphere has been realized 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.520
 with your bit in this color 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.240
 very beautiful 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:52.160
 then rails 15 0 of the is used 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:56.870
 11 0 rails and 3 mm b cones ho 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.390
 used various colors of di 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:04.669
 rail because I didn't have many 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:08.240
 rockery available and precisely I have 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:13.280
 used both the gold coloring and the 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:18.500
 crist coloration to b 11 0 that 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:24.290
 would call some food with I don't know if yes 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:28.040
 can see well but trust me 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:33.350
 the color crist to b must say 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:35.090
 that despite the many difficulties that 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.900
 had during this process 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.080
 because creating a sphere from scratch is not 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.400
 not at all simple 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.650
 in the end my result was satisfied 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.220
 although not fully and here someone 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.220
 will have to say 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:58.380
 however I must say that 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.810
 surely the second one will be better and if 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.060
 I ca n't promise I will because 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.270
 it really was a birth for me 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:09.690
 achieve this this sphere was 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:13.010
 very very complicated 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:19.310
 I will make a tutorial if I can 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:22.980
 if it does not last a full day then 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.290
 nothing I simply hope you do 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:30.780
 like that my creations can 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:32.880
 to be of help in some way and for 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.960
 today is everything and I refer you to the next 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.080
 video 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.080
 Hello
