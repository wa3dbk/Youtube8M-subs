Queen's<00:01:07.899> Hospital<00:01:08.140> met<00:01:08.770> their<00:01:08.979> weekly<00:01:09.220> target

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
Queen's Hospital met their weekly target

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.710 
Queen's Hospital met their weekly target
just<00:01:10.360> twice<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:12.430> patient<00:01:12.940> population<00:01:13.060> is

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
just twice the patient population is

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.719 
just twice the patient population is
pretty<00:01:14.080> huge<00:01:14.470> actually<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:15.130> think<00:01:15.369> this<00:01:15.520> just

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
pretty huge actually I think this just

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.760 
pretty huge actually I think this just
was<00:01:15.940> built<00:01:16.149> for<00:01:16.270> around<00:01:16.540> 90,000<00:01:17.320> nothing<00:01:17.590> was

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
was built for around 90,000 nothing was

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.590 
was built for around 90,000 nothing was
serving<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.220> Lisa<00:01:18.399> hundred<00:01:18.729> twenty<00:01:19.119> to<00:01:19.240> forty

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
serving a Lisa hundred twenty to forty

serving a Lisa hundred twenty to forty
thousand<00:01:20.050> at<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.830> moment<00:01:21.190> and<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.369> think<00:01:21.550> the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
thousand at the moment and I think the

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.070 
thousand at the moment and I think the
population<00:01:21.970> is<00:01:22.179> rising<00:01:22.330> all<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:22.690> time

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
population is rising all the time

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.290 
population is rising all the time
basically<00:01:24.069> the<00:01:24.310> hospital's<00:01:25.000> full<00:01:25.179> to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
basically the hospital's full to

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.350 
basically the hospital's full to
capacity<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:26.500> not<00:01:26.709> a<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:26.860> these<00:01:27.700> are<00:01:27.880> patients
