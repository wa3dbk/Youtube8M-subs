the<00:00:07.690> world<00:00:07.870> is<00:00:08.110> filled<00:00:08.530> with<00:00:08.710> chemicals

one of the most remarkable things about
this<00:01:07.840> series<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.829> lectures<00:01:09.280> was<00:01:09.970> that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
this series of lectures was that

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.360 
this series of lectures was that
everybody<00:01:10.630> knew<00:01:10.780> what<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> candle<00:01:11.409> was<00:01:11.620> but

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.370 
everybody knew what a candle was but

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.670 
everybody knew what a candle was but
almost<00:01:12.790> nobody<00:01:13.240> really<00:01:13.840> understood<00:01:14.440> what

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
almost nobody really understood what

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
almost nobody really understood what
they<00:01:14.830> saw

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
they saw

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.380 
they saw
for<00:01:16.330> example<00:01:16.930> they<00:01:17.530> saw<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:17.860> flame<00:01:18.430> which<00:01:19.180> was

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
for example they saw a flame which was

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.600 
for example they saw a flame which was
not<00:01:19.600> uniformly<00:01:20.380> bright<00:01:20.799> there<00:01:21.040> was<00:01:21.159> a<00:01:21.190> dark

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
not uniformly bright there was a dark

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.550 
not uniformly bright there was a dark
spot<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.299> the<00:01:22.420> flame<00:01:22.720> there<00:01:23.110> were<00:01:23.200> bright

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
spot in the flame there were bright

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.430 
spot in the flame there were bright
spots<00:01:23.979> of<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.310> flame<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.360> in<00:01:25.510> fact<00:01:25.750> Faraday

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
spots of the flame and in fact Faraday

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.950 
spots of the flame and in fact Faraday
was<00:01:26.560> able<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:26.979> show<00:01:27.310> that<00:01:27.909> there<00:01:28.119> were<00:01:28.299> very

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
was able to show that there were very

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.680 
was able to show that there were very
interesting<00:01:29.770> flow<00:01:30.159> patterns<00:01:30.790> of<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.450> air

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
interesting flow patterns of the air

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.800 
interesting flow patterns of the air
around<00:01:32.170> the<00:01:32.619> flame<00:01:32.890> for<00:01:33.549> without<00:01:33.820> air<00:01:34.150> candles

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
around the flame for without air candles

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.920 
around the flame for without air candles
immediately<00:01:35.350> go<00:01:35.530> out<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:37.030> he<00:01:37.299> was<00:01:37.450> able<00:01:37.630> to

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
immediately go out and so he was able to

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.719 
immediately go out and so he was able to
demonstrate<00:01:38.170> for<00:01:38.830> his<00:01:39.010> audience

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
demonstrate for his audience

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.990 
demonstrate for his audience
for<00:01:40.299> example<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:41.439> flow<00:01:42.250> pattern<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.909> an

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
for example this flow pattern of an

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.700 
for example this flow pattern of an
actual<00:01:43.450> candle<00:01:44.170> farad<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.680> was<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.799> master<00:01:45.549> of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
actual candle farad it was a master of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.219 
actual candle farad it was a master of
demonstrating<00:01:47.710> actual<00:01:48.670> things<00:01:49.060> some<00:01:50.020> of<00:01:50.049> the

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
demonstrating actual things some of the

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.920 
demonstrating actual things some of the
other<00:01:50.439> things<00:01:50.799> that<00:01:50.979> Faraday<00:01:51.790> did<00:01:52.060> he's<00:01:52.689> the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
other things that Faraday did he's the

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.539 
other things that Faraday did he's the
person<00:01:53.170> who<00:01:53.530> discovered<00:01:54.130> electromagnetic

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
person who discovered electromagnetic

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.789

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.170 
fact that we have metals like aluminum
are<00:02:11.620> due<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.310> fact<00:02:12.549> that<00:02:12.640> Faraday

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
are due to the fact that Faraday

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.630 
are due to the fact that Faraday
discovered<00:02:13.329> that<00:02:13.810> they<00:02:13.930> could<00:02:14.140> be<00:02:14.640> produced

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
discovered that they could be produced

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.760 
discovered that they could be produced
by<00:02:16.150> electricity<00:02:16.720> under<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.590> right

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
by electricity under the right

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.930 
by electricity under the right
circumstances

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
circumstances

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.460 
circumstances
so<00:02:19.209> we

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
so we

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.370 
so we
one<00:02:19.620> of<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.800> great<00:02:20.210> scientists<00:02:21.210> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.900> 19th

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
one of the great scientists of the 19th

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.980 
one of the great scientists of the 19th
century<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.460> even<00:02:23.850> more<00:02:24.150> he<00:02:24.450> was<00:02:24.600> one<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
century but even more he was one of the

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.340 
century but even more he was one of the
great<00:02:25.380> explainers<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.600> chemistry<00:02:27.600> in<00:02:27.780> terms

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
great explainers of chemistry in terms

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.040 
great explainers of chemistry in terms
that<00:02:28.530> everyone<00:02:29.310> could<00:02:29.550> understand<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.480> who

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
that everyone could understand and who

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.470 
that everyone could understand and who
could<00:02:31.260> open<00:02:31.590> their<00:02:32.040> eyes<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.030> chemistry

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
could open their eyes to the chemistry

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.170 
could open their eyes to the chemistry
around<00:02:33.870> them<00:02:34.170> when<00:02:34.830> fair<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.340> explain<00:02:35.880> things

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
around them when fair to explain things

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.200 
around them when fair to explain things
people<00:02:36.690> saw<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.050> world<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.800> same<00:02:38.070> world<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.790> a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
people saw the world the same world in a

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.450 
people saw the world the same world in a
very<00:02:39.600> different<00:02:40.110> way<00:02:40.290> because<00:02:41.070> their<00:02:41.250> eyes

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
very different way because their eyes

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.060 
very different way because their eyes
were<00:02:41.760> chemically<00:02:42.360> opened<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.620> beauty

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
were chemically opened to the beauty

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.040 
were chemically opened to the beauty
around<00:02:44.220> them

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050
