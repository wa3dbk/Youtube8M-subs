valve you put their pliers inside on the
red<00:02:38.480> here<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.900> can<00:02:39.050> dial<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.700> or<00:02:40.700> you

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
red here and you can dial it in or you

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.160 
red here and you can dial it in or you
can<00:02:40.940> dial<00:02:41.150> back<00:02:41.360> out

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
can dial back out

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.710 
can dial back out
there's<00:02:42.950> indentations<00:02:43.850> on<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.060> dial<00:02:44.360> so<00:02:44.600> you

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
there's indentations on the dial so you

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.060 
there's indentations on the dial so you
can<00:02:44.840> feel<00:02:45.110> a<00:02:45.140> click<00:02:45.560> in<00:02:45.860> each<00:02:46.670> position<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.980> you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
can feel a click in each position so you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.920 
can feel a click in each position so you
can<00:02:49.190> tell<00:02:49.370> them<00:02:49.550> he<00:02:49.670> turns<00:02:49.970> in<00:02:50.270> or<00:02:50.450> turns<00:02:50.660> out

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
can tell them he turns in or turns out

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.580 
can tell them he turns in or turns out
you<00:02:51.080> take<00:02:51.320> it<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:53.450> more<00:02:53.630> turns<00:02:53.900> you<00:02:54.080> turn<00:02:54.320> in

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
you take it the more turns you turn in

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.260 
you take it the more turns you turn in
obviously<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.130> more<00:02:55.310> spring<00:02:55.640> pressure<00:02:55.850> puts

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
obviously the more spring pressure puts

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.170 
obviously the more spring pressure puts
on<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.570> spring<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.460> the<00:02:58.460> more<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.760> back<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
on the spring and the more you back the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.180 
on the spring and the more you back the
red<00:02:59.360> piece<00:02:59.600> out<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.140> less<00:03:00.650> bring<00:03:00.950> attention

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
red piece out the less bring attention

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.280 
red piece out the less bring attention
if<00:03:02.120> fouled<00:03:02.480> off<00:03:02.570> should<00:03:02.810> be<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.960> little<00:03:03.170> bit

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
if fouled off should be a little bit

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.630 
if fouled off should be a little bit
more<00:03:03.470> snappy<00:03:03.890> or<00:03:04.010> should<00:03:04.190> open<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.520> little

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
more snappy or should open a little

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.020 
more snappy or should open a little
faster<00:03:06.340> let's<00:03:07.340> take<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.760> apart<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:10.610> spring

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
faster let's take it apart this spring

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.500 
faster let's take it apart this spring
just<00:03:11.300> sits<00:03:11.480> inside<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.900> red<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:15.290> red<00:03:15.470> cap

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
just sits inside the red the red cap

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.240 
just sits inside the red the red cap
this<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.750> diaphragm<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.590> moves<00:03:18.800> up<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.160> down

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
this is a diaphragm it moves up and down

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:32.350 
this is a diaphragm it moves up and down
with<00:03:19.700> exhaust<00:03:20.210> pressure<00:03:23.140> let's<00:03:24.140> look<00:03:24.350> inside

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.570 

okay<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.110> can<00:03:33.440> see<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.620> exhaust<00:03:34.220> port<00:03:36.580> shout

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
okay you can see the exhaust port shout

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:47.320 
okay you can see the exhaust port shout
it<00:03:37.730> out<00:03:43.480> that's<00:03:44.480> the<00:03:44.600> exhaust<00:03:44.990> port<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
it out that's the exhaust port and the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.420 
it out that's the exhaust port and the
vial<00:03:47.570> opens<00:03:48.280> it<00:03:49.280> raises<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.790> exhaust<00:03:50.120> port

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
vial opens it raises the exhaust port

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.420 
vial opens it raises the exhaust port
that's<00:03:52.430> fully<00:03:52.790> open<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:55.160> back<00:03:56.030> down<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:58.370> I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
that's fully open and back down and I

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.030 
that's fully open and back down and I
can<00:03:58.970> move<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.360> just<00:03:59.930> by<00:04:00.140> raising<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.680> lowering

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
can move that just by raising a lowering

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.350 
can move that just by raising a lowering
diaphragm<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:06.459> that's<00:04:07.459> how<00:04:07.670> a<00:04:07.700> power<00:04:07.970> valve

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
diaphragm and that's how a power valve

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:18.500 
diaphragm and that's how a power valve
works<00:04:12.250> nothing<00:04:13.250> to<00:04:13.430> it

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.140 

it's<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.900> boysson<00:04:19.320> rad<00:04:19.530> valve<00:04:19.880> read<00:04:20.880> valve

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
it's a boysson rad valve read valve

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.490 
it's a boysson rad valve read valve
assembly<00:04:22.370> there's<00:04:23.900> their<00:04:24.900> carbon-fiber

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
assembly there's their carbon-fiber

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:47.500 
assembly there's their carbon-fiber
reads<00:04:25.800> in<00:04:26.010> there<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:29.490> jug<00:04:29.790> was<00:04:29.940> poured<00:04:30.360> by<00:04:30.690> LRD

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:05:11.280 

down<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:48.660> top<00:04:48.870> here

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:17.620 

okay<00:05:12.970> let's<00:05:13.970> take<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.300> power<00:05:14.510> valve<00:05:14.810> out<00:05:16.630> and

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
okay let's take the power valve out and

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:23.050 
okay let's take the power valve out and
show<00:05:17.900> you<00:05:17.960> what<00:05:18.140> it<00:05:18.230> looks<00:05:18.410> like<00:05:21.790> there's<00:05:22.790> two

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
show you what it looks like there's two

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.850 
show you what it looks like there's two
of<00:05:23.180> these<00:05:23.300> bolts<00:05:23.690> in<00:05:23.840> on<00:05:23.990> either<00:05:24.140> side<00:05:24.470> but<00:05:24.770> I

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
of these bolts in on either side but I

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.960 
of these bolts in on either side but I
only<00:05:25.010> have<00:05:25.190> the<00:05:25.310> one<00:05:25.490> in<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:28.430> it<00:05:28.520> just<00:05:28.730> slides

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
only have the one in and it just slides
