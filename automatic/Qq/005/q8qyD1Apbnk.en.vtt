of an inch thick as with all musical
instruments<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.650> really<00:01:08.040> better<00:01:08.250> if<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
instruments it's really better if you

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.550 
instruments it's really better if you
could<00:01:08.790> use<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> hardwood<00:01:09.750> you'll<00:01:10.020> probably<00:01:10.229> get

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
could use a hardwood you'll probably get

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
could use a hardwood you'll probably get
a<00:01:10.590> better<00:01:10.799> tone<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.640> it

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a better tone out of it

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
a better tone out of it
but<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> red<00:01:13.979> cedar<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
but I really like the red cedar it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.969 
but I really like the red cedar it
smells<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:14.820> nice<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.320> it<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.500> free<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
pieces of that cedar and I've sandwiched

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.050 
pieces of that cedar and I've sandwiched
them<00:01:25.860> together<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.520> stuck<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:26.939> together

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
them together and stuck them together

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.480 
them together and stuck them together
with<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.360> carpet<00:01:27.960> tape<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.470> I've<00:01:29.040> drawn<00:01:29.280> out

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
with some carpet tape and I've drawn out

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.569 
with some carpet tape and I've drawn out
a<00:01:29.520> grid<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.979> bottom

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
a grid here I want to have this bottom

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.270 
a grid here I want to have this bottom
section<00:01:32.820> 6<00:01:33.570> inches<00:01:33.930> wide<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.100> I'm

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
section 6 inches wide and then I'm

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.210 
section 6 inches wide and then I'm
coming<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.140> three-quarter<00:01:37.140> inches<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.680> on

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
coming up to three-quarter inches in on

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.670 
coming up to three-quarter inches in on
the<00:01:38.850> top<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.079> angled<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
the top so it's going to be angled a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.039 
the top so it's going to be angled a
little<00:01:40.710> bit<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.479> feels<00:01:42.869> about

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
little bit and I think that feels about

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.910 
little bit and I think that feels about
right

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.710 

now<00:01:48.920> I've<00:01:49.040> got<00:01:49.220> both<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.490> those<00:01:49.820> cut<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.480> that

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
now I've got both of those cut to that

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.610 
now I've got both of those cut to that
wedge<00:01:51.200> shape<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.250> I<00:01:52.430> can<00:01:52.670> peel<00:01:53.630> them<00:01:54.140> apart

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
wedge shape and I can peel them apart

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.210 
wedge shape and I can peel them apart
and<00:01:55.220> I've<00:01:55.850> cut<00:01:56.150> some<00:01:56.260> strips<00:01:57.260> that<00:01:57.890> I'll<00:01:58.010> need

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
and I've cut some strips that I'll need

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.550 
and I've cut some strips that I'll need
to<00:01:58.250> cut<00:01:58.490> down<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.910> size<00:01:59.270> but<00:01:59.960> they'll<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.530> know

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
to cut down to size but they'll you know

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.700 
to cut down to size but they'll you know
go<00:02:00.860> on<00:02:00.890> like<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:01.910> the<00:02:02.210> top<00:02:02.450> will<00:02:02.660> fit<00:02:02.870> on<00:02:03.050> now

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
go on like that the top will fit on now

where this strip sits on this panel
there's<00:02:08.899> an<00:02:09.080> angle<00:02:09.560> that<00:02:09.890> needs<00:02:10.100> to<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.280> cut

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
there's an angle that needs to be cut

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.980 
there's an angle that needs to be cut
there<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.120> let<00:02:11.210> me<00:02:11.270> show<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.510> how<00:02:11.690> I'm<00:02:11.810> going

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
to handle cutting this angle I'm going

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.490 
to handle cutting this angle I'm going
to<00:02:15.800> use<00:02:16.340> my<00:02:16.580> miter<00:02:16.880> saw<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.420> set<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.170> piece

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
to use my miter saw and set this piece

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.670 
to use my miter saw and set this piece
in<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:20.000> where<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:20.900> see<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.200> angles<00:02:21.560> going

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
in to where you can see the angles going

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.230 
in to where you can see the angles going
that<00:02:21.950> way<00:02:22.130> then<00:02:22.640> what<00:02:22.760> I'll<00:02:22.820> do<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:22.970> I'll<00:02:23.209> just

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
that way then what I'll do is I'll just

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.390 
that way then what I'll do is I'll just
bring<00:02:23.510> my<00:02:23.690> blade<00:02:23.990> down<00:02:24.290> I'm<00:02:24.740> going<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> lock<00:02:25.190> it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
bring my blade down I'm going to lock it

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:34.120 
bring my blade down I'm going to lock it
in<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.080> I'm<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.650> going<00:02:27.950> to<00:02:29.140> move<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.350> over<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
in and I'm just going to move it over to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.310 
in and I'm just going to move it over to
that<00:02:34.310> angle<00:02:34.640> right<00:02:34.850> there<00:02:35.630> now<00:02:37.840> I'll<00:02:38.840> be<00:02:39.110> able

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
that angle right there now I'll be able

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.260 
that angle right there now I'll be able
to<00:02:39.880> take<00:02:40.880> my<00:02:41.540> strip<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.770> I<00:02:43.220> can<00:02:43.430> cut<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.090> at

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
to take my strip in and I can cut it at

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.770 
to take my strip in and I can cut it at
the<00:02:44.330> proper<00:02:44.720> angle

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.550 

there<00:02:48.680> are<00:02:49.130> all<00:02:49.760> four<00:02:50.150> pieces<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:51.110> side<00:02:51.320> piece

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
there are all four pieces the side piece

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.890 
there are all four pieces the side piece
is<00:02:51.740> cut<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.760> can<00:02:52.910> see<00:02:53.060> those<00:02:53.240> angles

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
is cut and you can see those angles

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.440 
is cut and you can see those angles
there<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:54.680> other<00:02:54.830> words<00:02:55.040> why<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.670> bottom<00:02:56.030> goes

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
there in other words why the bottom goes

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.950 
there in other words why the bottom goes
this<00:02:56.720> way<00:02:57.020> so<00:02:57.710> this<00:02:58.160> angle<00:02:58.460> has<00:02:59.240> to<00:02:59.270> be<00:02:59.450> that

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
this way so this angle has to be that

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.830 
this way so this angle has to be that
way<00:03:00.230> on<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.710> board<00:03:01.100> and<00:03:01.550> this<00:03:02.270> board<00:03:02.330> well

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
way on this board and this board well

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.310 
way on this board and this board well
all<00:03:03.050> of<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.290> boards<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:04.900> yeah<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.170> would

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
all of the boards and yeah it would

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.440 
all of the boards and yeah it would
probably<00:03:06.530> be<00:03:06.890> nice<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.520> actually<00:03:07.730> just<00:03:08.090> cut

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
probably be nice to actually just cut

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.710 
probably be nice to actually just cut
miters<00:03:09.440> here<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.459> that<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.240> know<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.390> wouldn't

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
miters here so that you know I wouldn't

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.680 
miters here so that you know I wouldn't
have<00:03:11.780> end<00:03:12.200> grain<00:03:12.770> showing<00:03:14.440> but<00:03:16.540> well<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.570> just

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
have end grain showing but well I just

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.370 
have end grain showing but well I just
suck<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.260> making<00:03:18.590> my<00:03:18.740> oh<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:20.690> I'm<00:03:21.020> gonna<00:03:21.170> have<00:03:21.350> a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
suck it making my oh it I'm gonna have a

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.620 
suck it making my oh it I'm gonna have a
little<00:03:21.470> bit<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.680> engraving<00:03:22.310> showing<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.850> now

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
little bit of engraving showing and now

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.460 
little bit of engraving showing and now
I<00:03:23.930> need<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.530> make<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.370> sound<00:03:25.880> hole<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.870> I've

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
I need to make the sound hole and I've

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.010 
I need to make the sound hole and I've
got<00:03:27.650> a<00:03:27.860> Forstner<00:03:28.400> bit<00:03:28.670> here<00:03:29.000> I<00:03:29.180> really<00:03:29.840> don't

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
got a Forstner bit here I really don't

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.590 
got a Forstner bit here I really don't
know<00:03:30.140> how<00:03:30.260> big<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.709> it's<00:03:31.070> that<00:03:31.459> big<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.360> I

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
know how big it is it's that big and I

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.990 
know how big it is it's that big and I
think<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.900> should<00:03:33.170> go<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.709> don't<00:03:34.489> know<00:03:34.700> right

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
think it should go I don't know right

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.930 
think it should go I don't know right
about<00:03:35.180> here<00:03:35.320> now<00:03:36.320> I've<00:03:36.470> got<00:03:36.650> my<00:03:36.830> hole<00:03:37.160> cut<00:03:37.640> and

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
about here now I've got my hole cut and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.210 
about here now I've got my hole cut and
I<00:03:38.270> cut<00:03:38.300> a<00:03:38.630> couple<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:39.170> quarter<00:03:39.590> inch<00:03:39.620> dowels

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
I cut a couple of quarter inch dowels

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.570 
I cut a couple of quarter inch dowels
and<00:03:40.959> one<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.230> a<00:03:42.260> little<00:03:42.560> bit<00:03:42.680> longer<00:03:43.130> than<00:03:43.520> the

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
and one is a little bit longer than the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.970 
and one is a little bit longer than the
other<00:03:43.700> one<00:03:44.030> I've<00:03:44.630> glued<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:44.989> one<00:03:45.410> down<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.890> I

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
other one I've glued that one down and I

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.400 
other one I've glued that one down and I
put<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.280> little<00:03:46.430> glue<00:03:46.640> on<00:03:46.670> this<00:03:47.150> one<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.750> I'm

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
put a little glue on this one and I'm

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.110 
put a little glue on this one and I'm
just<00:03:48.590> going<00:03:48.830> to<00:03:48.950> place<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.370> just<00:03:49.820> kind<00:03:50.090> of

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
just going to place it just kind of

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.500 
just going to place it just kind of
eyeball<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:51.050> know<00:03:51.560> right<00:03:51.830> around<00:03:51.950> in<00:03:52.220> here

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
eyeball it you know right around in here

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.509 
eyeball it you know right around in here
I'm<00:03:53.510> just<00:03:53.750> drilling<00:03:54.019> a<00:03:54.200> couple<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.680> holes<00:03:55.010> into

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
I'm just drilling a couple of holes into

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.450 
I'm just drilling a couple of holes into
a<00:03:55.970> thicker<00:03:56.930> dowel

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.910 

so<00:04:01.460> here's<00:04:01.640> my<00:04:01.790> box<00:04:02.090> with<00:04:02.600> these<00:04:03.080> two<00:04:03.500> smaller

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
so here's my box with these two smaller

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.270 
so here's my box with these two smaller
dowels<00:04:04.550> glued<00:04:04.910> on<00:04:05.120> I've<00:04:05.450> glued<00:04:06.080> up<00:04:06.350> the<00:04:06.800> bottom

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
dowels glued on I've glued up the bottom

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.730 
dowels glued on I've glued up the bottom
part<00:04:07.460> haven't<00:04:08.060> glued<00:04:08.210> this<00:04:08.420> on<00:04:08.720> yet<00:04:09.080> so<00:04:09.620> it's

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
part haven't glued this on yet so it's

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.200 
part haven't glued this on yet so it's
going<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:09.890> go<00:04:10.070> like<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.550> now<00:04:10.760> I've<00:04:10.850> got<00:04:11.030> my

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
going to go like that now I've got my

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.710 
going to go like that now I've got my
dowel<00:04:11.720> cut<00:04:12.260> with<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.860> holes<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.550> it

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
dowel cut with the holes in it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.290 
dowel cut with the holes in it
you<00:04:15.350> know<00:04:15.440> these<00:04:15.620> screws<00:04:15.950> will<00:04:16.190> fit<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:16.670> like

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 
you know these screws will fit in like

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.690 
you know these screws will fit in like
that<00:04:17.720> well<00:04:18.380> coming<00:04:18.830> through<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.250> other<00:04:19.280> side

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
that well coming through the other side

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.610 
that well coming through the other side
so<00:04:20.209> now<00:04:20.270> I<00:04:20.300> just<00:04:20.390> need<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.750> drill<00:04:20.989> holes<00:04:21.200> right

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
so now I just need to drill holes right

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.280 
so now I just need to drill holes right
here<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:22.250> here<00:04:22.850> so<00:04:23.450> I've<00:04:23.630> got<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.870> screws

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.790 
the larger dowel with wing nuts on them
and<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.940> way<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:32.540> can<00:04:33.040> tune<00:04:34.720> these<00:04:35.720> arms<00:04:36.350> now<00:04:36.740> I

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
and that way I can tune these arms now I

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.920 
and that way I can tune these arms now I
experimented<00:04:37.490> with<00:04:37.670> a<00:04:38.060> number<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.630> different

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
experimented with a number of different

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.040 
experimented with a number of different
materials<00:04:39.500> for<00:04:39.710> these<00:04:40.190> arms<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:40.970> I<00:04:41.600> had<00:04:41.840> some

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
materials for these arms and I had some

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.290 
materials for these arms and I had some
brass<00:04:42.290> pieces<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.010> some<00:04:43.130> steel<00:04:43.430> pieces<00:04:43.790> and

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
brass pieces and some steel pieces and

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.760 
brass pieces and some steel pieces and
none<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:44.840> them<00:04:44.990> were<00:04:45.140> working<00:04:45.350> very<00:04:45.680> well

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
none of them were working very well

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.350 
none of them were working very well
because<00:04:46.010> they<00:04:46.520> well<00:04:46.790> they<00:04:46.940> would<00:04:47.060> just<00:04:47.210> simply

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
because they well they would just simply

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.860 
because they well they would just simply
Bend<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.500> what<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.680> have<00:04:48.950> discovered<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.870> to

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
Bend but what I have discovered is to

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.990 
Bend but what I have discovered is to
use<00:04:51.050> coping<00:04:51.530> saw<00:04:51.740> blades<00:04:52.100> because<00:04:52.850> it's

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
use coping saw blades because it's

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.510 
use coping saw blades because it's
spring<00:04:53.360> steel<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.200> it<00:04:54.350> well<00:04:54.890> it<00:04:54.920> springs<00:04:55.400> back

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
spring steel and it well it springs back

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.750 
spring steel and it well it springs back
and<00:04:55.880> it<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.810> won't<00:04:57.200> Bend<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:57.980> stay<00:04:58.190> into<00:04:58.610> that

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
and it it won't Bend and stay into that

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.210 
and it it won't Bend and stay into that
shape<00:04:59.060> and<00:04:59.270> that<00:04:59.870> way<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.560> know<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.920> can<00:05:01.190> change

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
shape and that way you know I can change

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.870 
shape and that way you know I can change
the<00:05:02.000> tone<00:05:02.270> of<00:05:02.540> you<00:05:03.530> know<00:05:03.620> any<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:03.920> these<00:05:04.160> by

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
the tone of you know any of these by

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.750 
the tone of you know any of these by
LinkedIn<00:05:05.600> ting<00:05:05.870> them<00:05:06.400> tightening<00:05:07.400> it<00:05:07.550> back

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
LinkedIn ting them tightening it back

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.830 
LinkedIn ting them tightening it back
down<00:05:09.310> getting<00:05:10.310> a<00:05:10.430> different<00:05:10.580> tone<00:05:10.940> so<00:05:11.600> what

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
down getting a different tone so what

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.710 
down getting a different tone so what
I'm<00:05:11.930> doing<00:05:11.960> now<00:05:12.290> is<00:05:12.740> taking<00:05:13.130> these<00:05:13.790> coping<00:05:14.300> saw

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
I'm doing now is taking these coping saw

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.530 
I'm doing now is taking these coping saw
blades<00:05:15.110> you<00:05:15.830> know<00:05:15.980> and<00:05:16.310> snipping<00:05:16.970> off<00:05:17.120> this

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
blades you know and snipping off this

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.100 
blades you know and snipping off this
little<00:05:18.820> pin<00:05:19.820> here<00:05:20.180> that<00:05:20.360> holds<00:05:20.630> it<00:05:20.720> in<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.960> this

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
little pin here that holds it in to this

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.760 
little pin here that holds it in to this
saw<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.650> then<00:05:22.250> I'll<00:05:22.460> just<00:05:22.640> cut<00:05:22.910> these<00:05:23.090> in<00:05:23.360> half

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
saw and then I'll just cut these in half

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.430 
saw and then I'll just cut these in half
and<00:05:24.770> there<00:05:24.950> it<00:05:25.040> is<00:05:25.100> all<00:05:25.340> glued<00:05:25.730> up<00:05:26.060> I've<00:05:26.480> just

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
and there it is all glued up I've just

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.130 
and there it is all glued up I've just
with<00:05:27.800> sandpaper<00:05:28.220> rounded<00:05:29.090> over<00:05:29.480> all<00:05:29.750> of<00:05:29.930> the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
with sandpaper rounded over all of the

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.590 
with sandpaper rounded over all of the
edges<00:05:30.470> makes<00:05:31.220> it<00:05:31.370> feel<00:05:31.700> a<00:05:31.730> little<00:05:31.880> bit<00:05:32.120> nicer<00:05:32.540> I

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
edges makes it feel a little bit nicer I

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.330 
edges makes it feel a little bit nicer I
couldn't<00:05:32.960> use<00:05:33.140> my<00:05:33.170> round<00:05:33.680> over<00:05:33.950> bit<00:05:33.980> on<00:05:34.220> my

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
couldn't use my round over bit on my

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.670 
couldn't use my round over bit on my
router<00:05:34.610> because<00:05:34.910> I'd<00:05:35.300> already<00:05:35.570> stuck<00:05:36.170> these

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
router because I'd already stuck these

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.670 
router because I'd already stuck these
on<00:05:36.860> there<00:05:37.100> but<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.120> works<00:05:38.270> out<00:05:38.450> fine<00:05:39.050> that<00:05:39.440> way

tones I have eight of them on here I'd
like<00:06:15.360> to<00:06:15.540> have<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.720> full<00:06:16.020> scale<00:06:16.410> if<00:06:16.680> I<00:06:16.800> could<00:06:17.100> but

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
like to have a full scale if I could but

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.370 
like to have a full scale if I could but
this<00:06:18.060> will<00:06:18.180> just<00:06:18.270> take<00:06:18.450> a<00:06:18.480> lot<00:06:18.690> of<00:06:18.810> trial<00:06:19.260> and

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
this will just take a lot of trial and

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.650 
this will just take a lot of trial and
error<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.360> fooling<00:06:21.360> around<00:06:21.570> with<00:06:21.690> it<00:06:23.480> and<00:06:24.480> I'm

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 
error and fooling around with it and I'm

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.120 
error and fooling around with it and I'm
sure<00:06:24.840> you<00:06:24.960> probably<00:06:25.110> can't<00:06:25.560> hear<00:06:25.710> that<00:06:25.920> very

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
sure you probably can't hear that very

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.320 
sure you probably can't hear that very
well<00:06:26.520> on<00:06:27.450> my<00:06:27.690> camera<00:06:28.020> but<00:06:28.830> it<00:06:29.580> actually<00:06:30.180> makes

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
well on my camera but it actually makes

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.800 
well on my camera but it actually makes
a<00:06:30.420> pretty<00:06:30.600> decent<00:06:30.960> sound<00:06:31.200> and<00:06:31.970> I<00:06:32.970> never<00:06:33.450> did

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
a pretty decent sound and I never did

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.290 
a pretty decent sound and I never did
tune<00:06:34.410> these<00:06:34.820> probably<00:06:35.820> the<00:06:35.970> way<00:06:36.090> they<00:06:36.240> should

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
tune these probably the way they should

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.490 
tune these probably the way they should
be

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
be

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.080 
be
maybe<00:06:37.980> I'll<00:06:38.130> fool<00:06:38.280> around<00:06:38.430> with<00:06:38.640> that<00:06:38.850> a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
maybe I'll fool around with that a

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.050 
maybe I'll fool around with that a
little<00:06:39.780> bit<00:06:39.900> longer<00:06:40.260> one<00:06:40.860> thing<00:06:41.130> that<00:06:41.280> I<00:06:41.310> have

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
little bit longer one thing that I have

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.790 
little bit longer one thing that I have
learned<00:06:42.360> is<00:06:42.600> to<00:06:42.810> make<00:06:43.110> sure<00:06:43.260> that<00:06:43.410> this<00:06:43.590> is

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
learned is to make sure that this is

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.980 
learned is to make sure that this is
tightened<00:06:44.220> down<00:06:44.280> really<00:06:45.030> well<00:06:45.180> and<00:06:45.690> that<00:06:45.870> will

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
tightened down really well and that will

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:56.240 
tightened down really well and that will
help<00:06:46.170> them<00:06:46.440> resonate<00:06:47.310> a<00:06:47.460> lot<00:06:47.730> better<00:06:55.250> well

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
help them resonate a lot better well

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.090 
help them resonate a lot better well
there<00:06:56.550> you<00:06:56.640> have<00:06:56.700> it<00:06:56.880> there<00:06:57.720> is<00:06:58.020> the<00:06:58.410> thumb

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 
there you have it there is the thumb

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.120 
there you have it there is the thumb
piano<00:07:00.140> not<00:07:01.140> really<00:07:01.320> sure<00:07:01.440> if<00:07:01.530> it's<00:07:01.560> music<00:07:01.980> or

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
piano not really sure if it's music or

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.310 
piano not really sure if it's music or
not<00:07:02.250> at<00:07:02.400> least<00:07:02.430> the<00:07:02.730> way<00:07:02.820> I'm<00:07:03.030> playing<00:07:03.320> but

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
not at least the way I'm playing but

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.710 
not at least the way I'm playing but
it's<00:07:04.860> a<00:07:04.980> great<00:07:05.280> fun<00:07:05.700> little<00:07:05.910> project<00:07:06.510> you<00:07:06.600> can

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
it's a great fun little project you can

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.510 
it's a great fun little project you can
easily<00:07:06.870> make<00:07:07.110> it<00:07:07.170> an<00:07:07.350> afternoon<00:07:07.800> using<00:07:08.160> just

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
easily make it an afternoon using just

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.390 
easily make it an afternoon using just
scrap<00:07:09.060> lumber<00:07:09.540> and<00:07:09.990> I'm<00:07:10.740> sure<00:07:11.130> you<00:07:11.280> can

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
scrap lumber and I'm sure you can

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.040 
scrap lumber and I'm sure you can
improve<00:07:11.700> upon<00:07:11.820> this<00:07:12.180> there's<00:07:12.420> probably<00:07:12.690> a<00:07:12.780> lot

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
improve upon this there's probably a lot

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:14.450 
improve upon this there's probably a lot
of<00:07:13.110> different<00:07:13.290> ways<00:07:13.560> you<00:07:13.620> could<00:07:13.950> build<00:07:14.190> this

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
of different ways you could build this

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.610 
of different ways you could build this
thing<00:07:14.520> you<00:07:15.420> know<00:07:15.450> maybe<00:07:15.720> set<00:07:15.990> the<00:07:16.110> hole<00:07:16.320> down<00:07:16.590> a

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
thing you know maybe set the hole down a

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.080 
thing you know maybe set the hole down a
little<00:07:16.980> further<00:07:17.220> you'd<00:07:17.520> probably<00:07:17.760> get<00:07:18.060> a

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
little further you'd probably get a

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.310 
little further you'd probably get a
different<00:07:18.420> tone<00:07:18.600> might<00:07:18.870> make<00:07:19.020> it<00:07:19.110> a<00:07:19.140> little

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.320 
different tone might make it a little

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.850 
different tone might make it a little
bigger<00:07:19.590> use<00:07:20.280> different<00:07:20.760> size<00:07:21.440> metal<00:07:22.440> strips

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 
bigger use different size metal strips

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.280 
bigger use different size metal strips
here<00:07:23.340> but<00:07:24.090> I'll<00:07:24.240> spend<00:07:24.600> some<00:07:24.750> time<00:07:24.930> tuning

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:25.290 
here but I'll spend some time tuning

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.060 
here but I'll spend some time tuning
this<00:07:25.680> and<00:07:26.040> kind<00:07:26.310> of<00:07:26.400> tweaking<00:07:26.880> it<00:07:27.180> a<00:07:27.360> bit<00:07:27.750> uh

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
this and kind of tweaking it a bit uh

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.560 
this and kind of tweaking it a bit uh
