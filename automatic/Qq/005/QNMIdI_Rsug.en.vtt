Hi guys and welcome back to my channel! :)

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.120
My name is Hannah and today I'll have an "Emo/ Scene" Makeup for you! 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.300
Don't worry I did not turn into an emo but I really like this kind of style and I also wear it sometimes :)

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.040
Let's go!

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.800
I'll start with applying an eye base 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.420
Today, I'll only use black and white eyeshadow 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.476
First, I'll pick up the black eyeshadow 

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:40.576
drawing a line just as the wing of an eyeliner 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.220
Actually this is will replace the eyeliner this time!

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.640
The next line I'm drawing is for orientation only: 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.020
Underneath the line I'll apply black eyeshadow 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.380
while above that line I'll blend

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.440
Sadly, the clear and pretty cut gets lost while blending

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.740
That's why I'll create another clear cut by taking a concealer and concealing a new cut

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.280
To perfect the blending and to highlight my brow bone I'll apply white eyeshadow right below my eyebrow 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.520
As I was not satisfied with the darkness of my eyelid I have added some more black eyeshadow to it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.780
Let's move on to my lower lash line!

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.580
I'll take a cut brush and get the black eyeshadow down

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.800
To smoke it out even more I'll take a blending brush and blend all over

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.720
Of course, my waterline hast to be just as black as the rest of the look! :)

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Last but not least I'll apply mascara 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.520
and add falsies :)

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.000
Here is the finished eye makeup :)

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.760
Let's move on with my face :P

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.360
I won't apply that much makeup on my face this time 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.600
I'll apply a really light concealer on my under eye area, the bridge of my nose, my forehead and my chin

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.240
Once I'm done I'll blend it all together with my foundation 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.360
I just love it to be really pale and have really dark hair and makeup on :P

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.340
How about you? 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.340
Some people have told me I do look like an anime 0:

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.820
Anyways, I'll set my foundation with light powder 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.400
Also, I'll apply transparent lipgloss to my lips just to have something on my lips 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.160
So!! 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.660
Bandana!

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.100
Fring!

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.200
Fake lip piercing! 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.880
And here goes Hannah the emo haha
