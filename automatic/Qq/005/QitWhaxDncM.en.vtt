00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.460
 Hi all 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.190
 for now I just reached me just as 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.010
 at home an order from the boy dotcom 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.550
 dot com 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.720
 He arrived here in Colombia as we can 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.320
 observe here is all the information 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.720
 It's in your bag and what I have here 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.619
 it is a machine like a cutter 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.390
 for male hair obviously and therefore 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.780
 let's proceed to see what is in the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.780
 inside 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.710
 we need to open it well has already taken out 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.500
 open before and here we will observe 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.390
 that comes in its box here is the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.820
 box let's take it out is very good 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.370
 packaged so that there is no 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.900
 problem in my transport the truth is 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.310
 that came very quickly came in less than 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.660
 two days in fact and here's the box 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.380
 here are the specifications is a 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.810
 Water 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.520
 although basic and they are all therefore the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.910
 characteristics as we can observe 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.500
 this machine then comes with 10 pieces 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.260
 so well, well, we're going to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.300
 see what's inside 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.940
 inside the machine we can see that 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.900
 So the machine itself is the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.910
 most important part here we are going to 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.820
 open it is also taken out so that it does not 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.100
 is going to be damaged and that's how it is 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.980
 appears in the image that we had 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.690
 promised we see here is the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.460
 blade also very important then 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.180
 comes your cable and here inside it was left 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.430
 also a piecita let's see what is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.590
 it looks like it's to protect the blade 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.740
 so here is 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.440
 in fact think what it says here 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.440
 white steve nielsen which means that 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.310
 you have to put oil to the blades 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.259
 before using it 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.060
 Now let's see what else appears in the 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.190
 box 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.660
 in the box we can see also 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.460
 other pieces like the combs 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.340
 certain and also here is a liquid 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.230
 which is for the oil for the blades 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.120
 which is the one that said earlier that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.760
 had to be put as you can see by 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.760
 here and finally we have 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.010
 excellent scissors can serve us 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.860
 very much if we want to suddenly do 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.440
 that the cut is a little more effective and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.030
 with many better results more 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.620
 professional 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.450
 we also have here then 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.000
 what are the manual that comes in several 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.660
 manual languages how this is used 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.720
 machine here is 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.420
 and we also have the certificate of 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.900
 guarantee then apparently it came then 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.790
 completely perfect in perfect 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.430
 been then let's hope that also 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.610
 work the same and I will be commenting 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.610
 Well, how was this machine in which 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.980
 it looks super good in the hand is not very 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.710
 heavy is heavy but not so much and it is 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.380
 feel quite comfortable I do not think there 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.960
 no problem with her equal always 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.060
 is a brand that is recognized in 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.220
 machines we also see that in the bag 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.760
 line, returns appear 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.519
 in seven simple steps and here then 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.090
 each one of those so very good then 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.230
 of all 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.120
 indications are the instructions for 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.230
 make the returns in case you do not 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.000
 we are satisfied with the package that 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.640
 comes to us I hope you liked it 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.129
 much this video and that it has served them 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.200
 to be able to decide on the cutter 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.690
 that they are going to use I thought it was quite 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.959
 good so let's hope so 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.610
 work if I see something bad or suddenly 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.830
 something that has not worked with the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.290
 machine I will let you know in a comment 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.020
 or if you have any other questions too 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.670
 at the table come and 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:13.650
 yes and I see that it has some something 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.150
 interesting to share power to do 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.750
 another video to see how 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.750
 see you later
