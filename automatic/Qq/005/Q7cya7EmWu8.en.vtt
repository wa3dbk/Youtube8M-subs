00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and the iPhone then is used to send it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.550 
and the iPhone then is used to send it
to<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> printer<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.780> print<00:01:22.650> quality<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.070> great

SLR and you're using CF cards and so one
the<00:02:16.570> very<00:02:16.720> odd<00:02:16.900> things<00:02:17.230> that<00:02:17.410> canon<00:02:17.740> did<00:02:17.950> is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the very odd things that canon did is

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.330 
the very odd things that canon did is
with<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> newest<00:02:19.390> selfie<00:02:19.780> they<00:02:20.530> only<00:02:20.980> give

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
with the newest selfie they only give

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.720 
with the newest selfie they only give
you<00:02:21.490> an<00:02:21.820> SD<00:02:22.390> card<00:02:22.420> slot<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.620> no<00:02:23.890> CF<00:02:24.220> card<00:02:24.490> slot

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
you an SD card slot so no CF card slot

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.460 
you an SD card slot so no CF card slot
so<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:24.940> can't<00:02:25.270> just<00:02:25.420> take<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.810> card<00:02:26.080> out<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.260> my

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
so I can't just take the card out of my

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.310 
so I can't just take the card out of my
camera<00:02:26.980> and<00:02:27.270> plug<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.420> into<00:02:28.570> the<00:02:28.720> printer<00:02:28.990> and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320

print<00:02:30.040> away<00:02:30.250> which<00:02:30.520> was<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.700> something<00:02:31.300> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
print away which was a something I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.140 
print away which was a something I
really<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.080> do<00:02:32.230> with<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.500> previous

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
really like to do with the previous

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.680 
really like to do with the previous
selfies<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.360> that's<00:02:35.020> problem<00:02:35.920> number<00:02:35.950> one

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
selfies so that's problem number one

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.140 
selfies so that's problem number one
problem<00:02:37.690> number<00:02:37.840> two<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:39.520> back<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.900> cp910

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
problem number two the back of the cp910

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.900 
problem number two the back of the cp910
slot<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.230> Canon<00:02:44.980> battery<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.580> lithium

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
slot so the Canon battery the lithium

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.540 
slot so the Canon battery the lithium
battery<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.360> used<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.690> use<00:02:46.870> on<00:02:47.020> my<00:02:47.260> CP<00:02:47.830> 750

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
battery that I used to use on my CP 750

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.270 
battery that I used to use on my CP 750
and<00:02:48.640> CP<00:02:48.940> 800<00:02:49.390> isn't<00:02:50.200> transferable<00:02:50.650> so<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.100> have

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
and CP 800 isn't transferable so I have

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.330 
and CP 800 isn't transferable so I have
to<00:02:51.400> buy<00:02:51.580> a<00:02:51.940> special<00:02:52.660> adapter<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.920> charges

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
to buy a special adapter that charges

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.950 
to buy a special adapter that charges
the<00:02:54.400> battery<00:02:54.700> externally<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.300> plugs<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:55.780> I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
the battery externally and plugs in I

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.600 
the battery externally and plugs in I
think<00:02:56.200> they<00:02:56.320> did<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.770> so<00:02:56.920> they<00:02:57.070> could<00:02:57.220> have<00:02:57.400> a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
think they did this so they could have a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.880 
think they did this so they could have a
dust<00:02:57.880> cover<00:02:58.110> that<00:02:59.110> plugs<00:02:59.380> into<00:02:59.530> these<00:02:59.710> two

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
dust cover that plugs into these two

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.500 
dust cover that plugs into these two
slots<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.340> protects<00:03:00.700> dust<00:03:00.970> from<00:03:01.120> getting<00:03:01.420> in

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
slots and protects dust from getting in

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.030 
slots and protects dust from getting in
here<00:03:01.690> because<00:03:01.960> dust<00:03:02.260> is<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.470> real<00:03:02.680> enemy<00:03:03.010> of

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
here because dust is a real enemy of

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.060 
here because dust is a real enemy of
