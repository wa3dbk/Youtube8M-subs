don't get to watch too much for him over

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.510 
don't get to watch too much for him over
in<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.329> La<00:01:35.539> Liga<00:01:35.750> but<00:01:36.680> when<00:01:36.799> I<00:01:36.890> played<00:01:37.369> was

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
in the La Liga but when I played was

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.279 
in the La Liga but when I played was
first<00:01:37.789> he<00:01:37.909> was<00:01:38.030> a<00:01:38.090> great<00:01:38.359> talent<00:01:38.600> and<00:01:38.960> whenever

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
first he was a great talent and whenever

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.830 
first he was a great talent and whenever
I<00:01:39.500> see<00:01:39.710> him<00:01:39.890> play<00:01:40.189> for<00:01:40.880> Real<00:01:41.090> Madrid<00:01:41.420> he<00:01:41.570> tends

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
I see him play for Real Madrid he tends

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.510 
I see him play for Real Madrid he tends
to<00:01:41.960> have<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.229> great<00:01:42.649> game<00:01:42.890> maybe<00:01:43.130> not<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
to have the great game maybe not in the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.999 
to have the great game maybe not in the
Champions<00:01:43.939> League<00:01:44.149> finals<00:01:44.600> so<00:01:44.719> much<00:01:44.960> but<00:01:45.530> he

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
Champions League finals so much but he

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.429 
Champions League finals so much but he
generally<00:01:46.579> plays<00:01:46.939> pretty<00:01:47.420> decently<00:01:47.810> for<00:01:48.170> Real

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
generally plays pretty decently for Real

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.200 
generally plays pretty decently for Real
Madrid<00:01:48.829> and<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.219> think<00:01:49.909> he<00:01:50.060> definitely

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
Madrid and I think he definitely

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.649 
Madrid and I think he definitely
deserves<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.960> +1<00:01:51.560> upgrade<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.130> an<00:01:52.250> 88<00:01:52.759> rated

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
deserves the +1 upgrade to an 88 rated

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.510 
deserves the +1 upgrade to an 88 rated

upgrade to an A and 94 80 cotton he

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.490 
upgrade to an A and 94 80 cotton he
didn't<00:04:43.060> win<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.240> Ballon<00:04:43.780> d'Or<00:04:44.050> which<00:04:44.320> is

didn't win the Ballon d'Or which is

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.250 
didn't win the Ballon d'Or which is
absolutely<00:04:45.340> nuts<00:04:45.669> and<00:04:46.419> Messi<00:04:46.780> won<00:04:47.050> the<00:04:47.140> Ballon

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
absolutely nuts and Messi won the Ballon

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.620 
absolutely nuts and Messi won the Ballon
