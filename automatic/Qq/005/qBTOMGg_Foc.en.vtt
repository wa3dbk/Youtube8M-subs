00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 hey people who gave the last days 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.660
 There are some reports from a young guy 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.290
 from the video on the internet bypassed yes 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.020
 probably somehow make up and 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.510
 a young dog has tormented that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.800
 running camera and has beaten 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.029
 I really do not come at all 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.430
 you have to look honest 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.430
 Expectations extremely disturbing 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.470
 Of course this is a big deal and 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.960
 I also understand some of them 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.230
 how many react to it so I know 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.200
 not what's there in the head of this guy 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.340
 It's just that he does something like that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.760
 really a bough and disturbed behavior 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 the other side I have now 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 especially observed at 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.110
 facebook and so much i have on many 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.329
 these reports respond or to it 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.640
 That 's it 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.809
 not without me where I mean 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.149
 to give opinion 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.960
 So I can clearly understand if 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:10.770
 someone extremely angry at this disturbed 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.439
 person is but it is not synonymous that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.900
 you then somehow the death or something 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.030
 calls for the hospital to mature 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.040
 is beaten so that's easy 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.689
 you want that you can not against the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.210
 fight fire with fire that is 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.350
 black investment from the killer fight back 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.330
 child abuser 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.829
 the nastiest things are the worst 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.579
 thing these planets so there is still 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:38.159
 not our right to demand that goes 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.590
 just not over there people please 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.600
 notice that it is an offense so you 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.170
 you can follow the death of theirs and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.610
 You are so easily persecuted on the internet 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 was especially if he at facebook 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.439
 even a room name will occur as well 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.970
 many people I saw then has the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.680
 including any contributions then 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.159
 really the death or something else from him 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.079
 demand 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.799
 you also have that you can not 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.840
 so do morally first anyway 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.759
 totally inappropriate it works at all 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.990
 not clear but it is also legal 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.479
 get hit with it 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.330
 it is not so please let that be 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.940
 think your part about it clearly the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:19.560
 Type is punished is completely 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.170
 mentally disturbed that's just me 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.069
 stunned i dont know why i am 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.470
 do not know why but we have to 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.910
 on the other side too 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.080
 take out a bit of rushing here 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.060
 are not in the middle ages anymore 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.730
 we will not cross people anymore 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.459
 nailed and burned or stoned 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.569
 or so the times are over and we 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.340
 are happy that these times are over 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.340
 are 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.120
 So that's definitely the case 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.310
 not either 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.019
 that's it was not that bad 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.590
 or so it's not about worrying what 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.530
 to rate 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.810
 but it's just wrong so me too 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.870
 Just wanted a little something too 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.840
 because somehow that's what they say to me 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.489
 has been busy and we hope to come 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.500
 now every tenth interesting besides 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.209
 for the positive topics here on the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.340
 channel happens to be really one 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.359
 except that my son video is so 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.359
 we see that at the next video
