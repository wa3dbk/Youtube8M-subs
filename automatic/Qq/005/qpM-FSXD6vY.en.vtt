00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
just underneath here this is your height

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.009 
just underneath here this is your height
of<00:03:29.220> cut<00:03:29.930> six<00:03:30.930> levels<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.880> just<00:03:33.120> move<00:03:33.989> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
of cut six levels you just move the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.650 
of cut six levels you just move the
lever<00:03:34.350> up<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.769> down<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.630> desired<00:03:36.630> height<00:03:38.660> to

the back of the tractor you've got your
rear<00:03:42.360> chute<00:03:43.519> but<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.640> can<00:03:44.820> see<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.150> very<00:03:45.329> well

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
rear chute but we can see it very well

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.979 
rear chute but we can see it very well
because<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.079> light<00:03:47.540> basically<00:03:48.540> that's<00:03:48.870> where

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
because the light basically that's where

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.590 
because the light basically that's where
your<00:03:49.140> grass<00:03:49.380> comes<00:03:49.680> up<00:03:49.920> now<00:03:50.850> if<00:03:51.000> your<00:03:51.180> grass<00:03:51.360> is

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
your grass comes up now if your grass is

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.130 
your grass comes up now if your grass is
wet<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.870> long<00:03:52.350> you<00:03:53.180> might<00:03:54.180> find<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.630> blocks<00:03:54.870> up

so you don't need to get a stick and

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.970 
so you don't need to get a stick and
just<00:03:57.810> drag<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.170> grass<00:03:58.380> out<00:03:58.590> of<00:03:58.680> it<00:03:58.799> basically

bumpy<00:05:05.690> there's<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.810> section<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.440> selection<00:05:07.860> of

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
bumpy there's a section of selection of

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.250 
bumpy there's a section of selection of
holes<00:05:08.190> there<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:09.090> basically<00:05:09.510> just<00:05:09.840> move<00:05:10.080> the

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
holes there and basically just move the

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.140 
holes there and basically just move the
spring<00:05:10.620> down<00:05:10.949> to<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.220> next<00:05:11.520> hole<00:05:11.729> and<00:05:12.030> that

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
spring down to the next hole and that

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.760 
spring down to the next hole and that
picks<00:05:12.449> the<00:05:12.599> grass<00:05:12.840> box<00:05:13.110> closed<00:05:13.440> tighter<00:05:15.770> grass

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
picks the grass box closed tighter grass

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.520 
picks the grass box closed tighter grass
box<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.400> some<00:05:17.639> clips<00:05:18.539> onto<00:05:18.780> these<00:05:19.050> brackets

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
box that some clips onto these brackets

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.730 
box that some clips onto these brackets
here<00:05:20.510> and<00:05:21.510> see<00:05:21.720> how<00:05:21.930> they<00:05:22.020> drop<00:05:22.229> into<00:05:22.530> there

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
here and see how they drop into there

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.010 
here and see how they drop into there
and<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.880> gives<00:05:24.150> you<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.300> pivot<00:05:24.659> point<00:05:27.020> if

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
and it gives you a pivot point if

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.040 
and it gives you a pivot point if
there's<00:05:28.380> any<00:05:29.220> chance<00:05:29.639> that<00:05:29.849> you<00:05:30.030> about<00:05:30.720> falls

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
there's any chance that you about falls

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.589 
there's any chance that you about falls
off<00:05:31.320> the<00:05:31.530> main<00:05:31.710> drive<00:05:32.039> belt<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:33.300> need<00:05:33.479> to

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
off the main drive belt you need to

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.020 
off the main drive belt you need to
remove<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.199> grass<00:05:34.440> chute<00:05:34.800> which<00:05:35.460> again<00:05:35.789> is

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
remove the grass chute which again is

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.920 
remove the grass chute which again is
under<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.690> two<00:05:37.039> knobs<00:05:38.039> there<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.729> the<00:05:39.690> main

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
under the two knobs there and the main

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.839 
under the two knobs there and the main
chute<00:05:40.259> slides<00:05:40.710> out<00:05:41.009> and<00:05:41.300> inside<00:05:42.300> you'll<00:05:42.750> see

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
chute slides out and inside you'll see

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.670 
chute slides out and inside you'll see
the<00:05:44.849> gear<00:05:45.060> box<00:05:45.300> and<00:05:45.720> basically<00:05:46.110> hook<00:05:46.409> on<00:05:46.560> the

belt

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:06:00.110 

so<00:05:52.860> on<00:05:53.250> do<00:05:53.490> you<00:05:53.640> nobs<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:58.760> inside<00:05:59.760> there

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
so on do you nobs and inside there

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.560 
so on do you nobs and inside there
you'll<00:06:00.450> see<00:06:00.800> your<00:06:01.800> gearbox<00:06:02.070> as<00:06:02.490> a<00:06:02.520> fan<00:06:02.850> you'll

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
you'll see your gearbox as a fan you'll

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.720 
you'll see your gearbox as a fan you'll
see<00:06:03.750> a<00:06:03.780> couple<00:06:04.110> of<00:06:04.170> pulleys<00:06:04.530> and<00:06:04.770> the<00:06:05.490> belt

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
see a couple of pulleys and the belt

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.470 
see a couple of pulleys and the belt
that<00:06:05.910> runs<00:06:06.150> around<00:06:06.860> the<00:06:07.860> actual<00:06:08.480> pulleys

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
that runs around the actual pulleys

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.780 
that runs around the actual pulleys
basically<00:06:11.240> to<00:06:12.240> refit<00:06:13.170> that<00:06:13.440> bow<00:06:13.710> you<00:06:14.460> put<00:06:14.670> it

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
basically to refit that bow you put it

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.640 
basically to refit that bow you put it
into<00:06:14.970> Park<00:06:15.270> position<00:06:15.780> which<00:06:16.080> is<00:06:16.230> your<00:06:16.380> brake

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
into Park position which is your brake

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.880 
into Park position which is your brake
pedal<00:06:16.890> down<00:06:17.930> that's<00:06:18.930> this<00:06:19.140> is<00:06:19.200> makes<00:06:19.530> it<00:06:19.680> about

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
pedal down that's this is makes it about

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.930 
pedal down that's this is makes it about
slack<00:06:20.370> and<00:06:21.060> then<00:06:22.310> hook<00:06:23.310> on<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.610> belt<00:06:23.790> around

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940 
slack and then hook on the belt around

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.320 
slack and then hook on the belt around
the<00:06:24.120> pulleys<00:06:24.860> and<00:06:25.860> then<00:06:26.310> reinstall<00:06:26.670> the<00:06:26.970> chute

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
the pulleys and then reinstall the chute

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.710 
the pulleys and then reinstall the chute
basically<00:06:28.170> that's<00:06:28.380> it<00:06:28.530> it's<00:06:28.800> pretty<00:06:29.130> basic

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.110 

because<00:06:33.720> this<00:06:34.050> tractor<00:06:34.440> is<00:06:34.470> a<00:06:34.590> hydrostatic

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
because this tractor is a hydrostatic

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.600 
because this tractor is a hydrostatic
like<00:06:36.120> an<00:06:36.240> automatic<00:06:36.780> car<00:06:37.080> at<00:06:37.920> the<00:06:38.070> moment<00:06:38.280> it's

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
like an automatic car at the moment it's

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.390 
like an automatic car at the moment it's
in<00:06:38.730> freewheel<00:06:39.360> mode<00:06:40.460> so<00:06:41.460> all<00:06:41.610> you<00:06:41.760> have<00:06:41.880> to<00:06:42.030> do

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
in freewheel mode so all you have to do

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.280 
in freewheel mode so all you have to do
is<00:06:44.400> a<00:06:44.460> little<00:06:44.700> lever<00:06:45.090> on<00:06:45.480> the<00:06:45.750> side<00:06:45.990> of<00:06:46.020> the

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
is a little lever on the side of the

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.200 
is a little lever on the side of the
tractor<00:06:46.770> let's<00:06:47.160> get<00:06:47.490> around<00:06:47.610> there<00:06:47.910> a<00:06:47.940> minute

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
tractor let's get around there a minute

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.990 
tractor let's get around there a minute
on<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.330> side<00:06:51.570> of<00:06:51.600> the<00:06:51.780> track<00:06:52.020> there<00:06:52.290> in<00:06:52.770> there

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.580 

and<00:06:57.000> you<00:06:57.090> pull<00:06:57.330> it<00:06:57.360> out<00:06:57.660> and<00:06:58.050> that<00:06:58.260> gives<00:06:58.470> you

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
and you pull it out and that gives you

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.430 
and you pull it out and that gives you
full<00:06:58.920> drive<00:06:59.660> if<00:07:00.660> you<00:07:00.840> break<00:07:01.050> down<00:07:01.080> in<00:07:01.380> the

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
full drive if you break down in the

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.530 
full drive if you break down in the
middle<00:07:01.650> of<00:07:01.710> your<00:07:01.860> garden<00:07:02.250> you<00:07:03.000> just<00:07:03.210> push<00:07:03.390> it

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
middle of your garden you just push it

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.040 
middle of your garden you just push it
back<00:07:03.720> in<00:07:04.520> and<00:07:05.520> that<00:07:05.700> gives<00:07:05.940> you<00:07:06.180> the<00:07:06.780> wheels

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050 
back in and that gives you the wheels

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.840 
back in and that gives you the wheels
will<00:07:07.290> turn<00:07:07.500> by<00:07:07.680> hand<00:07:07.710> you<00:07:08.130> can<00:07:08.280> just<00:07:08.310> push<00:07:08.640> it

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
will turn by hand you can just push it

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.110 
will turn by hand you can just push it
wherever<00:07:09.090> you<00:07:09.210> need<00:07:09.330> it<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:09.540> go<00:07:10.970> and<00:07:11.970> that's

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 
wherever you need it to go and that's

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.390 
wherever you need it to go and that's
about<00:07:12.330> it<00:07:12.480> really

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400
