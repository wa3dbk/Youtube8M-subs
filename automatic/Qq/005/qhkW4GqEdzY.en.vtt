Beauty<00:01:45.329> blenders<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:47.189> foundation<00:01:47.880> is

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
Beauty blenders now this foundation is

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.280 
Beauty blenders now this foundation is
like<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:50.399> claims<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.509> large

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
like it claims to have a large

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.800 
like it claims to have a large
percentage<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.979> water<00:01:53.220> something<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.450> 20

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810

percentile<00:01:55.470> range<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:56.070> water<00:01:56.520> um<00:01:58.369> let's<00:01:59.369> all

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
percentile range of water um let's all

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.389 
percentile range of water um let's all
revisit<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.450> science<00:02:00.869> lesson<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:02.250> do

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
revisit a science lesson here what do

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.780 
revisit a science lesson here what do
sponges<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.950> that's<00:02:04.950> very<00:02:05.070> big<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
sponges do that's very big kind of

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.570 
sponges do that's very big kind of
absorbed<00:02:06.210> water<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.369> where

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
absorbed water right so I can see where

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.520 
absorbed water right so I can see where
the<00:02:08.759> Beauty<00:02:09.030> Blender<00:02:09.149> might<00:02:09.959> not<00:02:10.140> give<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.379> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
the Beauty Blender might not give you a
