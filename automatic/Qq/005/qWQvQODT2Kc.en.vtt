00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.510 

sometimes<00:02:35.690> I'll<00:02:35.900> take<00:02:36.140> my<00:02:36.350> hand<00:02:36.830> blender<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
sometimes I'll take my hand blender a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.570 
sometimes I'll take my hand blender a
little<00:02:38.209> stick<00:02:38.450> blender<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.170> use<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.190> for<00:02:40.400> this

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
little stick blender and use it for this

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.350 
little stick blender and use it for this
so<00:02:41.390> by<00:02:41.870> adding<00:02:42.110> water<00:02:42.560> to<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:43.010> plaster<00:02:43.760> first

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
so by adding water to the plaster first

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.050 
so by adding water to the plaster first
it<00:02:45.170> helps<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.650> kind<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.160> moisten<00:02:46.610> everything

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
it helps to kind of moisten everything

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.460 
it helps to kind of moisten everything
because<00:02:47.300> before<00:02:47.720> when<00:02:48.020> I<00:02:48.050> first<00:02:48.320> started

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
because before when I first started

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.880 
because before when I first started
using<00:02:48.800> chopping<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.880> would<00:02:50.360> just<00:02:50.390> dump<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.989> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
using chopping I would just dump the the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.270 
using chopping I would just dump the the
dry<00:02:52.489> powder<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.209> paint<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.870> then<00:02:54.770> like<00:02:55.070> if

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
dry powder in the paint and then like if

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.130 
dry powder in the paint and then like if
you<00:02:55.430> if<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.910> don't<00:02:56.090> mix<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.480> well<00:02:56.600> good<00:02:56.900> then

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
you if you don't mix it well good then

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.380 
you if you don't mix it well good then
you<00:02:57.290> store<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.890> for<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.130> while<00:02:58.340> if<00:02:58.730> one<00:02:59.000> little
