Scotland but in a controlled way in a

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.959 
Scotland but in a controlled way in a
controlled<00:00:14.919> environment<00:00:15.040> into<00:00:15.610> a<00:00:15.700> large

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
controlled environment into a large

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.920 
controlled environment into a large
enclosure<00:00:16.450> I<00:00:16.660> think<00:00:16.840> a<00:00:17.020> lot<00:00:17.620> of<00:00:17.650> people<00:00:18.930> when

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
enclosure I think a lot of people when

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.269 
enclosure I think a lot of people when
you<00:00:19.960> talk<00:00:20.170> about<00:00:20.199> wolves<00:00:20.740> and<00:00:20.859> bears<00:00:21.010> they

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
you talk about wolves and bears they

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.380 
you talk about wolves and bears they
think<00:00:21.460> people<00:00:21.580> are<00:00:21.730> going<00:00:21.820> to<00:00:21.880> drop<00:00:22.090> them<00:00:22.269> into

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
think people are going to drop them into

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.240 
think people are going to drop them into
the<00:00:22.480> freedom<00:00:22.929> of<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.140> countryside<00:00:23.470> and

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
the freedom of the countryside and

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.220 
the freedom of the countryside and
that's<00:00:24.519> never<00:00:24.730> really<00:00:24.849> been<00:00:25.240> my<00:00:25.449> objective<00:00:25.630> I

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
that's never really been my objective I

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.499 
that's never really been my objective I
think<00:00:26.740> that's<00:00:26.920> where<00:00:27.369> we<00:00:27.519> kind<00:00:27.670> of<00:00:27.849> beyond

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
think that's where we kind of beyond

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.669 
think that's where we kind of beyond
that<00:00:28.720> now

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:29.679 
that now

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.100 
that now
I'd<00:00:29.920> rather<00:00:30.099> sadly<00:00:30.490> maybe<00:00:31.089> maybe<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.750> right

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
I'd rather sadly maybe maybe the right

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.360 
I'd rather sadly maybe maybe the right
way<00:00:32.259> forward<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:32.650> best<00:00:32.920> way<00:00:33.040> forward<00:00:33.160> is<00:00:33.250> to

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
way forward the best way forward is to

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.360 
way forward the best way forward is to
create<00:00:33.700> this<00:00:33.820> this<00:00:34.450> large<00:00:34.870> reserve<00:00:35.590> where

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
create this this large reserve where

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.820 
create this this large reserve where
where<00:00:36.730> you<00:00:37.060> can<00:00:37.240> actually<00:00:37.800> manage<00:00:38.800> the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
where you can actually manage the

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.070 
where you can actually manage the
situation<00:00:39.150> without<00:00:40.150> letting<00:00:40.810> the<00:00:40.990> animals

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
situation without letting the animals

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.350 
situation without letting the animals
feel<00:00:41.500> they're<00:00:41.680> too<00:00:42.250> confined<00:00:42.700> space<00:00:43.000> yeah<00:00:43.330> I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
feel they're too confined space yeah I

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.060 
feel they're too confined space yeah I
think<00:00:43.510> 50,000<00:00:44.260> acres<00:00:44.500> would<00:00:44.650> be<00:00:44.740> big<00:00:45.040> enough

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
think 50,000 acres would be big enough

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.920 
think 50,000 acres would be big enough
here<00:00:45.580> and<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.300> throat<00:00:46.450> one<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.750> first

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
here and the throat one of the first

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.600 
here and the throat one of the first
steps<00:00:47.170> is<00:00:47.410> trying<00:00:47.650> to<00:00:47.770> encourage<00:00:48.010> this<00:00:48.250> forest

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
steps is trying to encourage this forest

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.160 
steps is trying to encourage this forest
by<00:00:48.760> how<00:00:48.940> many<00:00:49.060> how<00:00:49.330> many<00:00:49.360> trees<00:00:49.660> we<00:00:49.840> planted

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
by how many how many trees we planted

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.610 
by how many how many trees we planted
over<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:51.010> last<00:00:51.190> 10<00:00:51.850> to<00:00:51.940> 15<00:00:52.060> years<00:00:52.620> something

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
over the last 10 to 15 years something

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.400 
over the last 10 to 15 years something
like<00:00:54.240> 850,000<00:00:55.240> trees<00:00:55.450> were<00:00:55.660> planted<00:00:55.690> here

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
like 850,000 trees were planted here

like 850,000 trees were planted here
which<00:00:56.980> now<00:00:57.220> covers<00:00:57.760> 15%<00:00:58.720> of<00:00:58.870> out<00:00:59.020> of<00:00:59.140> those

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
which now covers 15% of out of those

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.590 
which now covers 15% of out of those
landmass<00:00:59.770> when<00:01:00.580> we<00:01:00.700> when<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.030> purchase<00:01:01.480> down

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
landmass when we when I purchase down

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.660 
landmass when we when I purchase down
there<00:01:01.840> there<00:01:01.990> was<00:01:02.020> just<00:01:02.290> 5%<00:01:02.530> cover<00:01:03.160> so<00:01:03.400> we<00:01:03.520> now

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
there there was just 5% cover so we now

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.429 
there there was just 5% cover so we now
we<00:01:03.730> push<00:01:04.089> push<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.479> up<00:01:04.570> three<00:01:04.780> times<00:01:04.989> what

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
years ago and there are pockets of

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.949 
years ago and there are pockets of
forests<00:02:44.230> all<00:02:44.320> over<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:44.860> Eastern<00:02:45.550> Europe<00:02:45.760> and

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
forests all over the Eastern Europe and

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.510 
forests all over the Eastern Europe and
particularly<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.170> Romania<00:02:47.590> Romania<00:02:47.920> has<00:02:48.040> over

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
particularly in Romania Romania has over

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.070 
particularly in Romania Romania has over
fifty<00:02:48.790> percent<00:02:48.820> of<00:02:49.300> all<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> old-growth

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
fifty percent of all the old-growth

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.340 
fifty percent of all the old-growth
forests<00:02:50.980> left<00:02:51.360> in<00:02:52.360> Europe<00:02:52.540> fifty<00:02:53.110> percent

fifty percent

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.830 
fifty percent
so<00:02:54.070> I<00:02:54.310> mean<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.880> huge<00:02:55.180> amounts<00:02:55.750> of

course you know my interest in focus

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.949 
course you know my interest in focus
there<00:02:58.090> because<00:02:58.300> that's<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.630> sort<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
there because that's the sort of the

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.320 
there because that's the sort of the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
biodiversity a lot of how you call it

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.960 
biodiversity a lot of how you call it
the<00:03:03.390> longest<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.480> Europe<00:03:04.810> forests<00:03:05.350> there<00:03:05.970> and

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
the longest of Europe forests there and

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.580 
the longest of Europe forests there and
of<00:03:07.030> course<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:07.510> know<00:03:07.690> there's<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> huge<00:03:08.140> rush

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590

European companies extracting timber

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.030 
European companies extracting timber
they<00:03:16.690> can<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.049> can<00:03:17.200> get<00:03:17.350> away<00:03:17.470> with<00:03:17.799> it<00:03:17.890> a
