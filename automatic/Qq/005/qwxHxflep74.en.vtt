00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
replace easily by doing the same process

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.610 
replace easily by doing the same process
okay<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> very<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.049> good

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
okay so this is the very so the good

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.020 
okay so this is the very so the good
thing<00:02:27.650> at<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.040> point<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.730> battery

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
thing at this point is the battery

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.600 
thing at this point is the battery
doesn't<00:02:29.540> have<00:02:29.810> any<00:02:30.310> any<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.790> say<00:02:33.310> blue<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.459> it

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
doesn't have any any you say blue on it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.479 
doesn't have any any you say blue on it
so<00:02:34.849> you<00:02:35.269> can't<00:02:35.480> just<00:02:35.690> easily<00:02:36.640> differ<00:02:38.290> okay

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
so you can't just easily differ okay

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.289 
so you can't just easily differ okay

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
screwdriver

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.400 
screwdriver
you<00:02:53.389> have<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.690> insert<00:02:54.609> insert<00:02:55.609> it<00:02:55.760> under<00:02:56.410> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
you have to insert insert it under the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.580 
you have to insert insert it under the
connector<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.760> connector<00:02:58.790> which<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.750> right

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
connector the connector which is right

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.120 
connector the connector which is right
here<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.269> lift<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.450> up<00:03:02.569> okay<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:06.350> once<00:03:06.560> pops<00:03:06.859> up

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
here and lift it up okay so once pops up

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.479 
here and lift it up okay so once pops up
is<00:03:07.370> going<00:03:07.609> to<00:03:07.700> be<00:03:07.790> like<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:09.190> this<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.370> the

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
is going to be like this this is the

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.220 
is going to be like this this is the
connector

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.440 

and<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:16.159> is<00:03:16.219> the<00:03:16.340> way<00:03:16.519> what<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.819> do<00:03:16.969> is<00:03:17.209> going<00:03:17.359> to

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
and so is the way what I do is going to

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.199 
and so is the way what I do is going to
replace<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:18.019> battery<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.340> have<00:03:19.939> another

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
replace the battery so I have another

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.119 
replace the battery so I have another
one<00:03:20.450> here

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
one here

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.880 
one here
okay<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:23.180> film<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:23.989> to<00:03:24.140> be<00:03:24.469> sure<00:03:24.680> that

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
okay the film you have to be sure that

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.330 
okay the film you have to be sure that
is<00:03:25.040> off<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:26.439> just<00:03:29.739> okay<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:30.769> this<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.159> back

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
is off and just okay so this is the back

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.589 
is off and just okay so this is the back
of<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.549> phone<00:03:31.819> so<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.120> is<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.299> motherboard

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
of the phone so this is the motherboard

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.209 
of the phone so this is the motherboard
the<00:03:33.609> charger<00:03:34.609> port<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:36.079> coaxial<00:03:36.620> cable<00:03:37.040> which

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:37.219 
the charger port the coaxial cable which

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.059 
the charger port the coaxial cable which
is<00:03:37.250> connected<00:03:37.969> Wi-Fi<00:03:38.469> this<00:03:39.469> is<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.799> cable

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
is connected Wi-Fi this is the cable

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.339 
is connected Wi-Fi this is the cable
that<00:03:40.280> connects<00:03:40.969> the<00:03:41.120> power<00:03:41.389> to<00:03:42.230> the

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
that connects the power to the

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.339 
that connects the power to the
motherboard<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.159> that<00:03:44.120> helps<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:44.810> charge<00:03:45.139> the

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
motherboard so that helps to charge the

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:48.280 
motherboard so that helps to charge the
battery<00:03:45.739> -<00:03:46.510> sometimes<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.840> connect<00:03:48.139> the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
battery - sometimes you connect the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.890 
battery - sometimes you connect the
charger<00:03:48.500> in<00:03:48.859> doesn't<00:03:49.189> charge<00:03:49.400> then<00:03:49.900> this

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
charger in doesn't charge then this

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.349 
charger in doesn't charge then this
cable<00:03:51.290> maybe<00:03:51.769> need<00:03:52.579> to<00:03:52.609> replace<00:03:53.269> or<00:03:54.819> or<00:03:55.819> the

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
cable maybe need to replace or or the

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.640 
cable maybe need to replace or or the
battery<00:03:56.689> is<00:03:56.750> not<00:03:57.019> good<00:03:57.230> that's<00:03:57.379> why<00:03:57.590> it

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
battery is not good that's why it

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.319 
battery is not good that's why it
doesn't<00:03:57.769> charge<00:03:58.480> okay<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:01.760> let's<00:04:02.000> replace

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
doesn't charge okay so let's replace

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.280 
doesn't charge okay so let's replace
this<00:04:02.629> battery<00:04:03.139> just<00:04:04.040> like<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.909> then

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
this battery just like that and then

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.020 
this battery just like that and then
like<00:04:06.290> you<00:04:06.469> see<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.769> connector<00:04:07.400> make<00:04:07.819> sure

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
like you see the connector make sure

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.379 
like you see the connector make sure
that<00:04:08.299> is<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.840> right<00:04:09.769> position<00:04:09.980> and<00:04:10.519> chance

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
that is the right position and chance

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.670 
that is the right position and chance
with<00:04:11.629> your<00:04:11.810> finger<00:04:12.169> up<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:13.700> press<00:04:13.939> properly

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
you hear a click if you feel the click

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.540 
you hear a click if you feel the click
ok<00:04:19.099> so<00:04:19.820> when<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.500> is<00:04:21.500> properly<00:04:21.949> then<00:04:24.010> just<00:04:25.010> use

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
ok so when the is properly then just use

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.570 
ok so when the is properly then just use
