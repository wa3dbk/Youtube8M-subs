how to scribe around odd shaped objects

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.150 
how to scribe around odd shaped objects
I've<00:00:10.500> got<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> 1<00:00:11.010> by<00:00:11.219> 10<00:00:11.550> piece<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.240> cedar<00:00:13.160> I'm

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
I've got a 1 by 10 piece of cedar I'm

I've got a 1 by 10 piece of cedar I'm
running<00:00:14.549> around<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.940> room<00:00:15.179> like<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.480> belly

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
running around the room like a belly

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.630 
running around the room like a belly
band<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.470> cap<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.920> top<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.400> walls

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
band just to cap the top of the walls

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.849 
band just to cap the top of the walls
and<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:19.140> kind<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.500> imitate<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> timber<00:00:20.580> frame

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
and to kind of imitate a timber frame

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.040 
and to kind of imitate a timber frame
style<00:00:22.859> being<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.640> beam<00:00:23.939> will<00:00:24.810> march

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
style being that this beam will march

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.429 
style being that this beam will march
into<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.430> I've<00:00:26.970> got<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.420> get<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.779> 1<00:00:28.019> by<00:00:28.199> 10

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
into you so I've got to get this 1 by 10

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.910 
into you so I've got to get this 1 by 10
up<00:00:28.680> around<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.550> about<00:00:30.060> halfway<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.710> beam

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
up around here about halfway up the beam

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.840 
up around here about halfway up the beam
and<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.600> scribe<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.350> not<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.489> big<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
and I can scribe that not that big of a

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.660 
and I can scribe that not that big of a
deal<00:00:36.170> but<00:00:37.170> it's<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.710> look<00:00:37.890> better<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.550> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
deal but it's going to look better if I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.930 
deal but it's going to look better if I
can<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:39.059> notch<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.020> into<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
can actually notch it into this now to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.200 
can actually notch it into this now to
do<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.780> just<00:00:42.840> use<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.530> board<00:00:44.030> which<00:00:45.030> is

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
do that I just use this board which is

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.360 
do that I just use this board which is
just<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:46.110> perfect<00:00:46.559> thickness<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.340> my<00:00:47.750> 1<00:00:48.750> by<00:00:48.930> 10

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
just the perfect thickness of my 1 by 10

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.180 
just the perfect thickness of my 1 by 10
actually<00:00:50.370> -<00:00:50.879> about<00:00:51.120> 1/32<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.140> 16th<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
actually - about 1/32 or 16th for the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.389 
actually - about 1/32 or 16th for the
blade<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.020> multi-master<00:00:55.190> I'm<00:00:56.190> going<00:00:56.340> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
blade of the multi-master I'm going to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.360 
blade of the multi-master I'm going to
put<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.760> around<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.920> use<00:00:59.129> my

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
put that around here and then use my

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
put that around here and then use my
tool<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.910> faith<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:01.399> cut<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.579> about<00:01:02.940> half<00:01:03.210> an

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
tool to faith in cut in about half an

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.020 
tool to faith in cut in about half an
inch<00:01:03.739> all<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> way<00:01:05.010> around<00:01:05.100> where<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> 1<00:01:05.880> by

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
inch all the way around where the 1 by

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.899 
inch all the way around where the 1 by
10<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.600> sit<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.430> way<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.729> just

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
10 is going to sit that way I can just

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.090 
10 is going to sit that way I can just
kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.420> closed<00:01:09.780> notch<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.530> my<00:01:10.740> 1<00:01:10.920> by

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
kind of get it closed notch out my 1 by

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310 
kind of get it closed notch out my 1 by
10<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> slide<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
10 and when I slide it up in here it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.340 
10 and when I slide it up in here it
will<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.560> slide<00:01:14.509> into<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.689> beam<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
will actually slide into this beam and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.520 
will actually slide into this beam and
be<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:16.860> absolutely<00:01:17.460> perfect<00:01:17.850> scene<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:19.229> looked

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
be an absolutely perfect scene it looked

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.100 
be an absolutely perfect scene it looked
like<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.330> actually<00:01:21.330> knowledge<00:01:21.750> damp

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
like it was actually knowledge damp

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.789 
like it was actually knowledge damp
because<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.790> let's<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.710> see<00:01:25.710> how

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
because it is so let's do that see how

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:32.389 
because it is so let's do that see how
good<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.040> looks

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.999 

all<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.719> that<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.990> got<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> cut<00:01:34.770> in

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
all right so now that we got the cut in

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.209 
all right so now that we got the cut in
there<00:01:35.929> we've<00:01:36.929> got<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.469> a<00:01:37.530> chisel<00:01:37.859> of<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
there we've got to take a chisel of the

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:45.109 
there we've got to take a chisel of the
mallet<00:01:39.079> chisel<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> gap<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:43.250> then<00:01:44.250> slide

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
mallet chisel of the gap and then slide

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.240 
mallet chisel of the gap and then slide
our<00:01:45.299> board

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.860 

all<00:01:48.730> right<00:01:48.850> so<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.180> can<00:01:49.330> see<00:01:49.480> the<00:01:49.600> notch<00:01:49.840> that

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
all right so you can see the notch that

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.550 
all right so you can see the notch that
I've<00:01:50.290> made<00:01:50.500> about<00:01:50.830> half<00:01:51.100> an<00:01:51.220> inch<00:01:51.310> deep<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:52.560> made

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
I've made about half an inch deep I made

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.360 
I've made about half an inch deep I made
the<00:01:53.740> first<00:01:54.070> cut<00:01:54.430> for<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.470> outside<00:01:56.860> edge<00:01:57.100> and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
the first cut for the outside edge and

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.880 
the first cut for the outside edge and
then<00:01:58.330> I<00:01:58.420> also<00:01:58.570> made<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.870> cut<00:01:59.170> tight<00:01:59.530> against<00:01:59.800> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
then I also made a cut tight against the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.010 
then I also made a cut tight against the
wall<00:02:00.010> here<00:02:00.730> so<00:02:00.910> that<00:02:01.600> you<00:02:01.660> don't<00:02:01.840> have<00:02:01.900> to

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
wall here so that you don't have to

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.980 
wall here so that you don't have to
chisel<00:02:02.410> out<00:02:02.500> all<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:02.890> wood<00:02:03.390> back<00:02:04.390> here<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
chisel out all this wood back here the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.980 
chisel out all this wood back here the
board<00:02:05.230> will<00:02:05.380> just<00:02:05.530> slide<00:02:05.830> right<00:02:05.860> up<00:02:06.220> into<00:02:06.430> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
board will just slide right up into that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.860 
board will just slide right up into that
makes<00:02:07.990> chiseling<00:02:08.470> out<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.679> lot<00:02:08.950> easier

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:03:10.949 

all<00:02:12.590> right

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.020 

tiny<00:03:11.959> little<00:03:12.349> gap<00:03:12.650> there<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.340> by<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.640> time<00:03:13.879> I

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
tiny little gap there but by the time I

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.509 
tiny little gap there but by the time I
put<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.269> couple<00:03:14.510> coats<00:03:14.930> of<00:03:15.140> poly<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.709> it<00:03:18.519> you

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
put a couple coats of poly on it you

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:26.890
