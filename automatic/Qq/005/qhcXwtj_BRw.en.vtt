 usable but the vehicle he noticed 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.789
 just before 6 o'clock 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.550
 this is the country of the region 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.589
 the whole thing a little bit shorter at the end of the contribution 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:38.589
 whether the summary 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.130
 On the outside you will not find much new for luxury exclusive 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.530
 really worth seeing predecessor of Frank Heine big British the engines 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.520
 at the headlights 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 the broad grin of progress so 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.930
 At the rear, the viewer finds no noteworthy innovations 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.450
 606 plus 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010
 joins there plus to its predecessors and only the 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.890
 transparent parts of the taillights give an idea 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 that it is a newer model 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.789
 something stale and misplaced act honored developed there 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.789
 and the locks on the doors 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.440
 imposing the antenna of the radio towers in the sky and leaves on a broken 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.440
 Hoppers hope 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.490
 the test car costs according to list price 12 goals and 820 euros 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.290
 and there are not any on the internet 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.290
 can deduct 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.780
 Under the slogan you can find the rest of my liter of big gasoline engine and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.390
 Justus Frantz at first glance is all going well and due to the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.489
 Pupils make an exception 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.260
 Wariner blown means it will be difficult to trade them because of the 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.629
 Students there are rarely very poorly accessible and a workshop 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 the right tool will be visited 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.339
 Looking into the trunk, the asymmetrically divisible rear seat sits in front of you 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:41.769
 on the many possibilities also offers something larger things 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.039
 transport and still have room for three people 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.439
 The instruments are well legible, the silver scouts edged 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:54.659
 side of the steering wheel you will find the usual greed missing 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.139
 the wipers and one for the radio and on the other side the 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.139
 Lever for the light 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.089
 The Schalke have to switch off the display 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.089
 that at Parallels and the lighting control regulation 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:24.069
 Our model has a CD radio and a manual air conditioning system 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.069
 Radio makes a good impression after the small with those ups and downs 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.259
 and Lourdes attitudes has been upgraded quite a bit 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:45.609
 7 four times in the cockpit little change one misses something the 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.609
 French sense of design 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.389
 the seats offer the occupants a pretty leisurely place so let yourself be carried away 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.929
 various settings 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:04:00.399
 only the Ebel for the inclination of the rest becomes somewhat unstable and could in the 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:03.399
 Maybe break car life once 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.239
 on 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.400
 one 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.349
 Villiger's clientele dominated the picture inside 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.229
 and you will find only on parts of the door panel something fabric 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.400
 which was tilted on the panel 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.069
 on 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:33.529
 a Dr to big man on board came to a size of even two 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:34.259
 meters 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.840
 hanging on the legs and head will also lead the legroom 

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:41.110
 then very strong when the driver or passenger has gotten bigger 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:46.169
 Duisburg 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.169
 instead of landscape 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.719
 the Frankfurt concord 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.719
 Halver 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.210
 According to Peugeot tries in Motodrom need in about 7 8 liters out of town 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.440
 rose by 0 6 liters 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.610
 and combines 5 comma 8 liters 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.180
 we do not consume them anything repainted 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.910
 No fuel consumption butter is now at 6 plus at an average 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.910
 Consumption of 7 Komatsu liters 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.460
 the summit 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.469
 a knife 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.259
 many consumers 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.259
 where and how fast he can go with the Wave 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.330
 the background noise is due to Berlusconi's weaknesses and preferences 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.400
 and you can still talk 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.080
 the 1 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.939
 the race was over 

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:07.939
 Lyondell 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:10.369
 the two want 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.369
 to the men 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:19.809
 otherwise during 60 cameras in the message 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.830
 The Wiener Strasse proclaims I am perfectly adequate 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.250
 the brake and clutch are not too hard or Brecht and against those of Palma 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.210
 Good feedback to slow the situation appropriately and accelerate 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:36.710
 can be 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.710
 test yours 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.490
 injured after driving on the highway 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.610
 Let's see how the mission 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.659
 there beats 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.719
 how much we will consume 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.719
 like Siemens or elsewhere again 

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:06.339
 Meanwhile, the bottom line was still undefeated and with a bit 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:09.339
 Country liters per 100 kilometers 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:16.550
 Dr 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.159
 if a bit too high Â» 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:23.150
 a judge what the processed materials are quite so high quality 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:25.430
 like the competition 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.379
 otherwise a solid one 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.369
 reasonable car 

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:31.689
 Too shocked again, a game was just starting 

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:32.919
 go away 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:33.680
