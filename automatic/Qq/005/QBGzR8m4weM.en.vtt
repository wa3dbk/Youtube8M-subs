00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you're gonna finally clean this up do

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.260 
you're gonna finally clean this up do
what<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.979> circulus<00:01:32.340> could<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.729> do<00:01:33.060> before

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
what the circulus could not do before

but<00:01:35.550> they<00:01:35.640> can't<00:01:35.910> do<00:01:36.090> enough<00:01:36.360> damage<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.990> all

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
but they can't do enough damage to all

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
the lone ranger survives the minimag oh
my<00:01:42.930> guess<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> queens<00:01:43.890> are<00:01:44.009> gonna

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
my guess and the queens are gonna

00:01:44.100 --> 00:02:25.700 
my guess and the queens are gonna
finally<00:01:44.729> clean<00:01:44.940> up<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> scream

just

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:53.830 

you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:03.490 

six<00:02:54.640> estimation<00:02:55.750> successful

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.990 

well<00:03:04.500> as<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.769> looks<00:03:05.129> like<00:03:05.250> both<00:03:05.700> play<00:03:05.879> is

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
well as that looks like both play is

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.309 
well as that looks like both play is
actually<00:03:06.269> going<00:03:06.390> to<00:03:06.450> be<00:03:06.510> second<00:03:06.930> finding<00:03:07.230> each

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
actually going to be second finding each

other hand tallying done the add-on so
far<00:03:25.980> getting<00:03:26.459> some<00:03:26.760> runners<00:03:26.970> and<00:03:27.209> popping<00:03:27.510> out

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659

I<00:03:28.079> really<00:03:28.829> like<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.099> from<00:03:29.280> Bonnie<00:03:29.549> focusing

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
I really like this from Bonnie focusing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.309 
I really like this from Bonnie focusing
the<00:03:30.090> pylons<00:03:30.510> down<00:03:30.659> meaning<00:03:30.900> they'll<00:03:31.079> be<00:03:31.170> no

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
the pylons down meaning they'll be no
