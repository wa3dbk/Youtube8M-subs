00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.260
 Hi, I'm happy and this is my first 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.050
 video design I decided to do it because 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.990
 I'm happy that the ninja turtles 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.270
 have returned to the child if he loved to 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.910
 the turtles was in love with that 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.710
 so stupid and great concept imagine 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.140
 what was my surprise when I found out 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.720
 that they were going to make a movie with the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.480
 ninja turtles in flesh and bone or as 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.279
 I said, I really remember with a lot 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.520
 honey the day my mother took me 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.100
 to the cinema to see her I felt the boy more 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.590
 fortunate of the world for that time 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.019
 there was the terrible habit of putting 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.120
 intermediates to the films stopped the 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.719
 projection half and usually 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.200
 in the middle of a memorable scene 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.270
 everyone in chorus heard themselves scream 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.980
 during the intermission all children 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.940
 we stopped in the corridors to take 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.580
 I remember that much that day 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.580
 The only thing I wanted to do was run 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.770
 towards the screen I imagined that if I 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.150
 poked behind the screen I was going to 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.620
 find with the ninja turtles 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:15.960
 acting the movie for us run 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.960
 I reached the screen when I looked 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.310
 I find myself with a fucking wall of 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.530
 true sheets a brick wall 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.580
 it was not even carpeted or in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.870
 karradÃ¡ was a fucking brick wall 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.260
 as you grow, life goes 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.820
 disappointed the point is the illusion and the 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.250
 magic that made me feel those 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.369
 movies so with that same illusion 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.729
 I launched my 27 years to see the 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.310
 Box turtles since they left the 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.920
 light the new designs all started 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.200
 to whimper has noses because 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.149
 they put noses we want back to the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.220
 dolphin trunk they have always had 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.220
 cultures seem 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.390
 but I remember that years ago they left 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.040
 some designs made by fans that 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.040
 they were almost the same 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.730
 It was designed 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.410
 I do not think the designs are bad I 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.630
 I think that all this controversy was put together 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.360
 because to this new formula of the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.360
 ninja turtles decided to add the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.560
 element that makes the kirchner 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.520
 reproduce as michael bay graphics 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.530
 mike the method of a childhood and michael 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.900
 bay 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.730
 again with him 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.799
 you have to keep in mind that in this 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.709
 movie michael bay just from his 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.500
 prestanombres he only produces the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.450
 director noticed the hands as 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.730
 fuck you say bad I will not give my opinion 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.159
 objective and neutral the new film of 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.290
 the ninja turtles are dry a good 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.209
 commercial movie has good rhythm the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.099
 special effects are excellent the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.049
 action is very well directed despite 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.420
 this custom of having a wey with bad 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.670
 of Parkinson's in the camera and of that 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.980
 we never really know how much they weigh 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.349
 these new turtles sometimes look like 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.239
 that weigh tons shed cars a 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.010
 just hit and sometimes it seems that they are very 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.230
 light that can not even break a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.239
 glass with the normal fist or as 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.250
 always with the blockbusters is the script 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.260
 this new fashion that everything is 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.480
 connected and that nothing happened to the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.819
 chance force the writers to create a 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.069
 cobweb of events that ends in the end 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.139
 for not sustaining itself as 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.689
 demons you learn to be ninja by reading 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.280
 a single book is as if I read the 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:39.139
 biography of stephen hawking me 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.019
 become a theoretical physicist astro 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:44.960
 physicist and cosmologist the villains are not 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.700
 very well grounded and the protagonists 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.650
 turtles do not have enough 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.570
 time on screen being themselves 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.030
 they are always in action throwing punches 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.620
 we do not know them in reality my 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.300
 rating on a scale of 1 to 10 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.210
 it would be 1 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.270
 almost throwing him to 7 my personal opinion 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.520
 it's amazing 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.740
 is exactly the movie that any 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.350
 fan would have done if he had millions of 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.690
 dollars sones and hands is very funny 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.490
 the line structure we finally see them in 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.830
 the action as we never had before 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.580
 seen sprinter after you get 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.440
 it removes the disgust of reading it is incredible is 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.330
 exactly like the transition that 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.430
 they made iodine in the movies 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.130
 originals from star wars to prequels 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.400
 before it was a motel now kicks ass 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.220
 same splinter now tour uses his tail 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.870
 as if it were a lizard is 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.810
 awesome megaphones I feel that what 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.430
 really do well always open 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.440
 been the character that there is simply 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.480
 to rescue them but this time 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.820
 both the character and the actress 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.560
 they try to give something more to be in 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.650
 means of action remain clumsy 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.570
 but still they want the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.970
 destroyer is nothing but a sweet ex 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.410
 machin or as it is said but for me it is 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.660
 enough because the movies based 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.460
 they always anticipated a great battle 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.250
 towards him and when I do not know 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.390
 they faced was a terrible battle 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.700
 I ended up dying for stupidity 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.830
 every one who finds the ninja turtles 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.660
 he kicks their ass 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.880
 my recommendation if you are really a fan 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.980
 of the turtles is that you go to see her without 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.990
 some pretension as well as what 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.630
 you saw the cartoons were only for 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.580
 waste time and they were incredible I the 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.860
 I really enjoyed it and really if it reaches me 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.260
 the time and the fortnight I will go back to 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.390
 go see but this is my opinion if you 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.689
 liked share it if not many 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.689
 Thank you for wasting your time 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.689
 mons 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.030
 and now
