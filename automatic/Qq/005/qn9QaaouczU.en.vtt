for<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.420> nicks<00:00:21.570> then<00:00:21.720> we'll<00:00:21.840> see<00:00:21.990> anyway<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
for the nicks then we'll see anyway and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.150 
for the nicks then we'll see anyway and
the<00:00:23.400> bat<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:23.990> that's<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:25.199> too<00:00:25.350> bad<00:00:25.650> we'll<00:00:25.980> put

the bat one that's not too bad we'll put

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:47.200 
the bat one that's not too bad we'll put
that<00:00:26.279> one<00:00:26.430> back<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.760> well

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:01:04.010 

that's<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.420> one<00:01:02.300> now<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.330> have<00:01:03.570> undone<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
that's that one now that have undone the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.420 
that's that one now that have undone the
clamps<00:01:06.050> well<00:01:07.050> done<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.830> put<00:01:07.980> an<00:01:08.070> axle

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
clamps well done is it just put an axle

stand<00:01:09.260> under<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.290> front<00:01:10.590> exhaust<00:01:11.070> because

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
stand under the front exhaust because

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820 
stand under the front exhaust because
otherwise<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.810> pull<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.470> middle<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
otherwise and we pull the the middle and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.190 
otherwise and we pull the the middle and
back<00:01:13.980> one<00:01:14.220> off<00:01:14.400> there's<00:01:15.390> nothing<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> hold<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
back one off there's nothing to hold it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:26.420 
back one off there's nothing to hold it
off<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> now<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:25.020> case<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.430> lifting

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
off so now it's just a case of lifting

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.609 
off so now it's just a case of lifting
these<00:01:26.550> off<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.060> buns<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.510> take<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> out

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
these off at the buns and take it out

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.320 
these off at the buns and take it out
the<00:01:29.040> rear<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.840> they<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:30.960> hit<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:32.270> how<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
the rear and they all hit on how the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:45.490 
the rear and they all hit on how the
head<00:01:33.600> bat<00:01:33.900> removing<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> bunks

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:02:04.020 

-<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.620> different

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:20.160 

yeah<00:02:06.720> like<00:02:07.720> a<00:02:07.750> little<00:02:08.820> sugar<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:11.020> no<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.990> that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
yeah like a little sugar or no is that

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.380 
yeah like a little sugar or no is that
one<00:02:20.320> out<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.490> then<00:02:21.640> with<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.910> bat<00:02:22.060> one<00:02:22.240> out

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
one out and then with the bat one out

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.050 
one out and then with the bat one out
this<00:02:22.720> one<00:02:22.900> should<00:02:23.860> cause<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.130> bit<00:02:24.340> easier<00:02:27.060> as

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
this one should cause a bit easier as

00:02:28.060 --> 00:03:02.520 
this one should cause a bit easier as
that<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:28.450> off

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.330 

nobody<00:03:03.530> said<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.800> was<00:03:03.860> going<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.069> be<00:03:04.220> there

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
nobody said it was going to be there

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.610 
nobody said it was going to be there
that<00:03:07.340> was<00:03:07.519> good<00:03:07.670> timing<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:09.170> while<00:03:09.500> we

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
that was good timing because while we

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.000 
that was good timing because while we
were<00:03:09.709> doing<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:12.200> new<00:03:12.350> middle<00:03:12.620> section

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
were doing that the new middle section

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.490 
were doing that the new middle section
and<00:03:13.480> too<00:03:14.480> many<00:03:14.660> clumps<00:03:15.019> have<00:03:15.200> arrived<00:03:17.500> there's

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
and too many clumps have arrived there's

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.150 
and too many clumps have arrived there's
that<00:03:18.739> was<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.069> old<00:03:19.190> exhaust<00:03:23.799> some<00:03:24.799> exhaust

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
that was on the old exhaust some exhaust

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:37.320 
that was on the old exhaust some exhaust
paste<00:03:25.459> on<00:03:25.670> that

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.600 

they'll<00:03:37.840> be<00:03:37.960> gone<00:03:38.110> easier<00:03:38.590> then<00:03:39.160> get<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.460> good

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
they'll be gone easier then get a good

00:03:39.610 --> 00:04:26.690 
they'll be gone easier then get a good
seal

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:42.790 

you

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.400 

and<00:04:43.800> just<00:04:44.039> support<00:04:44.160> that<00:04:44.490> exhaust<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.229> can

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
and just support that exhaust and I can

00:04:46.410 --> 00:05:01.340 
and just support that exhaust and I can
join<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.069> next<00:04:47.220> one

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:20.380 

Oh

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
then the same again with this section

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.670 
then the same again with this section
pasted<00:05:25.230> onto<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:27.180> exhaust<00:05:27.480> before<00:05:28.290> would

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
pasted onto the exhaust before would

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.650 
pasted onto the exhaust before would
join<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.370> other<00:05:29.460> one<00:05:29.580> on<00:05:29.670> to<00:05:29.850> it<00:05:29.940> we've

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
join the other one on to it we've

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:49.620 
join the other one on to it we've
already<00:05:30.780> got<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.050> clamping<00:05:31.500> in<00:05:31.770> place<00:05:32.310> that

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630

and<00:05:50.620> I'm<00:05:50.850> that'll<00:05:51.850> set<00:05:52.090> with<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.360> heat<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.540> the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
and I'm that'll set with the heat of the

00:05:52.690 --> 00:06:01.290 
and I'm that'll set with the heat of the
exhaust<00:05:53.050> when<00:05:53.620> it<00:05:53.740> needs<00:05:53.920> to

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.529 

try<00:06:02.300> that<00:06:02.479> on<00:06:02.599> to<00:06:02.719> that<00:06:04.539> yep<00:06:05.539> straight<00:06:06.169> up<00:06:06.409> a

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
try that on to that yep straight up a

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.869 
try that on to that yep straight up a
little<00:06:08.539> wiggle<00:06:08.780> and<00:06:10.930> then<00:06:11.930> all<00:06:12.050> we<00:06:12.169> got<00:06:12.319> to<00:06:12.379> do

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
is get the bongs back on and we done

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:21.670 
is get the bongs back on and we done
I<00:06:17.560> put<00:06:18.560> the<00:06:18.680> back<00:06:18.860> rub<00:06:19.099> anger<00:06:19.490> huh<00:06:20.439> that<00:06:21.439> helped

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
I put the back rub anger huh that helped

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.779 
I put the back rub anger huh that helped
assist<00:06:22.120> putting<00:06:23.120> the<00:06:23.210> two<00:06:23.479> difficult<00:06:24.199> ones<00:06:24.379> on

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
assist putting the two difficult ones on

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.800 
assist putting the two difficult ones on
so<00:06:25.789> now<00:06:26.000> just<00:06:26.469> gotta<00:06:27.469> tighten<00:06:27.680> up<00:06:27.860> the<00:06:28.009> clumps

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
so now just gotta tighten up the clumps

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.179 
so now just gotta tighten up the clumps
