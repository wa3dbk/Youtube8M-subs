battlefield<00:00:06.870> 1942<00:00:14.240> we<00:00:15.240> have<00:00:15.450> actually

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
battlefield 1942 we have actually

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.970 
battlefield 1942 we have actually
managed<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.890> narrow<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.670> gap<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:18.270> tickets

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
managed to narrow the gap in tickets

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.380 
managed to narrow the gap in tickets
down<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.310> 30<00:00:20.670> points

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
down to 30 points

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
down to 30 points
it<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:22.020> way<00:00:22.470> way<00:00:22.769> more<00:00:22.800> than<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.369> earlier<00:00:23.760> on

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
it was way way more than that earlier on

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.710 
it was way way more than that earlier on
and<00:00:25.410> if<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.619> actually<00:00:25.980> managed<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.029> win<00:00:27.510> this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and if we actually managed to win this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
and if we actually managed to win this
round<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.619> would<00:00:28.800> be<00:00:28.949> one<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> great

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
round it would be one of the great

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.840 
round it would be one of the great
comebacks<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
comebacks of all time I don't know that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
comebacks of all time I don't know that
will<00:00:33.000> necessarily<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.690> able<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.260> if

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
will necessarily be able to do that if

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.560 
will necessarily be able to do that if
we<00:00:34.710> had<00:00:34.860> narrowed<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.610> down<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.910> 30<00:00:36.120> tickets

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we had narrowed it down to 30 tickets

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.520 
we had narrowed it down to 30 tickets
earlier<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:37.170> maybe<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:39.110> believe<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.350> they

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
earlier on maybe but believe that they

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.950 
earlier on maybe but believe that they
have<00:00:40.920> over<00:00:41.340> us<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.760> almost<00:00:42.149> as<00:00:42.390> much<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.629> our

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
have over us is almost as much as our

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
have over us is almost as much as our
total<00:00:43.320> number<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> tickets<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.390> be

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
total number of tickets so it would be

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.869 
total number of tickets so it would be
very<00:00:45.750> difficult<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.320> do<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> but<00:00:47.100> even<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
very difficult to do that but even so it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389 
very difficult to do that but even so it
really<00:00:48.030> shows<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.600> how<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.160> just

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
really shows you how you can if you just

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
really shows you how you can if you just
keep<00:00:50.670> up<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:51.030> efforts<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> good

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
keep up your efforts and you do a good

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
keep up your efforts and you do a good
job<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:55.399> recovering<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.760> guess<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.480> really

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
job of recovering I guess you can really

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:19.100 
job of recovering I guess you can really
make<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> good<00:00:58.559> comeback

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.600 

the<00:01:20.110> Americans<00:01:20.650> should<00:01:20.950> be<00:01:21.100> able<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.400> yo

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the Americans should be able to yo

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.830 
the Americans should be able to yo
they've<00:01:21.790> just<00:01:21.940> taken<00:01:22.120> back<00:01:22.420> their<00:01:22.660> main

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
they've just taken back their main

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.110 
they've just taken back their main
bridge<00:01:23.140> flag<00:01:23.730> because<00:01:24.730> there<00:01:24.910> were<00:01:24.970> no

we're gonna have to scan around the area

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.899 

now<00:02:18.560> we're<00:02:18.739> gonna<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.189> clear<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.610> slag

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
as well and that other guy who's in

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.039 
as well and that other guy who's in
front<00:02:22.129> of<00:02:22.310> me<00:02:22.400> was<00:02:22.670> definitely<00:02:23.299> thinking

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
front of me was definitely thinking

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.809 
front of me was definitely thinking
along<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.590> same<00:02:24.799> lines<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:25.220> was<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.640> always

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
along the same lines I was you always

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.360 
along the same lines I was you always
want<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.090> check<00:02:26.299> this<00:02:26.450> building<00:02:26.810> first<00:02:27.370> and

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
want to check this building first and

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.160 
want to check this building first and
since<00:02:28.640> we've<00:02:28.819> captured<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.420> flag<00:02:29.689> that<00:02:29.720> means

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
since we've captured the flag that means

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.300 
since we've captured the flag that means
no<00:02:30.500> one's<00:02:30.709> anywhere<00:02:31.069> near<00:02:31.340> here<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:34.010> once

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
no one's anywhere near here and once

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.330 
no one's anywhere near here and once
again<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.700> Americans<00:02:35.409> well<00:02:36.409> for<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.980> moment

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
again the Americans well for a moment

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.490 
again the Americans well for a moment
there<00:02:37.519> they<00:02:37.670> had<00:02:37.849> lost<00:02:38.450> everything<00:02:38.989> except

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
there they had lost everything except

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.759 
there they had lost everything except
for<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.739> church<00:02:39.980> flag<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:42.019> although<00:02:42.530> they

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
for the church flag and although they

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.319 
for the church flag and although they
can't<00:02:43.010> spawn<00:02:43.250> at<00:02:43.430> that<00:02:43.549> neutral<00:02:43.909> flag<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
can't spawn at that neutral flag and

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.849 
can't spawn at that neutral flag and
probably<00:02:44.659> won't<00:02:44.840> be<00:02:44.989> able<00:02:45.079> to<00:02:45.319> with<00:02:45.620> all<00:02:45.739> the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:45.859 
probably won't be able to with all the

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.030 
probably won't be able to with all the
German<00:02:46.159> defenders<00:02:46.430> over<00:02:46.760> there<00:02:47.769> it's<00:02:48.769> really

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
German defenders over there it's really

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.979 
German defenders over there it's really
nice<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.430> have<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.730> third<00:02:50.090> flag<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.780> be<00:02:50.900> able

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
nice to have that third flag to be able

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.050 
nice to have that third flag to be able
to<00:02:51.170> inflict<00:02:51.829> ticket<00:02:52.220> lead<00:02:52.400> especially<00:02:52.609> when

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
to inflict ticket lead especially when

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:03.030 
to inflict ticket lead especially when
you've<00:02:53.180> desperately<00:02:53.810> got<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.079> make<00:02:54.230> up<00:02:54.379> a<00:02:54.470> gap

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.670 

there<00:03:04.040> we<00:03:04.220> go<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:05.209> can<00:03:05.239> hold<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.019> flag<00:03:06.319> see

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
there we go you can hold the flag see

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.190 
there we go you can hold the flag see
the<00:03:06.799> capture<00:03:07.129> radius<00:03:07.400> extends<00:03:07.939> out<00:03:08.090> here<00:03:08.420> just

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
the capture radius extends out here just

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:26.760 
the capture radius extends out here just
barely<00:03:09.709> on<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.310> side<00:03:10.579> of<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.810> building

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.770 

this<00:03:27.770> round<00:03:28.100> is<00:03:28.280> going<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.610> go<00:03:28.730> down<00:03:29.120> right<00:03:29.570> to

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
this round is going to go down right to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.370 
this round is going to go down right to
the<00:03:29.900> wire<00:03:30.140> at<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.980> end<00:03:32.050> that's<00:03:33.050> really

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
the wire at the end that's really

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.190 
the wire at the end that's really
impressive<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:34.010> would<00:03:34.220> not<00:03:34.400> have<00:03:34.490> thought<00:03:34.760> that

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
impressive I would not have thought that

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.080 
impressive I would not have thought that
the<00:03:36.200> outcome<00:03:36.770> of<00:03:36.800> this<00:03:37.070> battle<00:03:37.520> would<00:03:37.670> be<00:03:37.850> so

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
the outcome of this battle would be so

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.450 
the outcome of this battle would be so
much<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.330> doubt<00:03:38.720> earlier<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.800> in<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.040> round<00:03:40.280> it

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
much in doubt earlier on in the round it

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.450 
much in doubt earlier on in the round it
really<00:03:40.700> looked<00:03:40.880> like<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.060> Allies<00:03:41.810> had<00:03:42.460> total

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
really looked like the Allies had total

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.220 
really looked like the Allies had total
control<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.880> everything<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.690> was<00:03:44.840> going<00:03:44.960> on

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
control of everything that was going on

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.900 
control of everything that was going on
I<00:03:50.290> think<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.560> main<00:03:51.740> reason<00:03:51.770> why<00:03:52.610> things

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
I think the main reason why things

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.580 
I think the main reason why things
turned<00:03:53.000> around<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.750> once<00:03:54.050> we<00:03:54.230> were<00:03:54.350> able<00:03:54.470> to

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
turned around is once we were able to

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.670 
turned around is once we were able to
get<00:03:54.740> a<00:03:54.800> solid<00:03:55.390> on<00:03:56.390> this<00:03:56.750> side<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.410> we

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
get a solid on this side and we

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.100 
get a solid on this side and we
controlled<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.280> church<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.850> do<00:03:58.970> it<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.930> were

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
controlled the church to do it we were

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.380 
controlled the church to do it we were
able<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.380> get<00:04:00.650> total<00:04:01.190> tank<00:04:01.460> supremacy<00:04:02.180> not

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
able to get total tank supremacy not

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.680 
able to get total tank supremacy not
just<00:04:02.720> finally<00:04:03.320> the<00:04:03.560> Allies<00:04:04.520> are<00:04:04.550> bringing<00:04:05.540> out

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
just finally the Allies are bringing out

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.620 
just finally the Allies are bringing out
tanks<00:04:06.020> it's<00:04:06.350> been<00:04:06.500> a<00:04:06.530> long<00:04:06.770> time<00:04:07.390> so<00:04:08.390> if<00:04:08.600> you

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
tanks it's been a long time so if you

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.160 
tanks it's been a long time so if you
can<00:04:08.750> just<00:04:09.050> disrupt<00:04:09.530> the<00:04:09.770> church<00:04:10.040> flag<00:04:10.400> and

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
can just disrupt the church flag and

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.990 
can just disrupt the church flag and
even<00:04:12.170> turning<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.740> neutral<00:04:13.190> kind<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.520> resets

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
even turning in neutral kind of resets

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.500 
even turning in neutral kind of resets
the<00:04:14.500> spawn<00:04:15.500> timer<00:04:15.830> for<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.190> tanks<00:04:16.580> so<00:04:17.390> it's

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
the spawn timer for the tanks so it's

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:27.770 
the spawn timer for the tanks so it's
important<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:17.930> do<00:04:18.080> that

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.510 

if<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.990> can<00:04:29.170> manage<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.710> take<00:04:29.980> this

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
if I can manage to take this

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.700 
if I can manage to take this
Stonebridge<00:04:31.000> flag<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.990> other<00:04:32.140> two<00:04:32.440> flies

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
Stonebridge flag and the other two flies

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.500 
Stonebridge flag and the other two flies
get<00:04:33.100> held<00:04:33.340> then<00:04:33.580> we'll<00:04:33.760> start<00:04:34.060> inflicting

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
get held then we'll start inflicting

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:43.129 
get held then we'll start inflicting
ticket<00:04:34.810> bleed<00:04:34.990> on<00:04:35.140> them<00:04:35.290> once<00:04:35.470> again

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.389 

unfortunately<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.259> guy<00:04:44.409> was<00:04:44.619> hiding<00:04:45.039> just

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:45.399 
unfortunately that guy was hiding just

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.679 
unfortunately that guy was hiding just
where<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.669> didn't<00:04:45.969> expect<00:04:46.329> him<00:04:46.479> to<00:04:46.509> be<00:04:46.659> I

00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:46.689 
where I didn't expect him to be I

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.539 
where I didn't expect him to be I
thought<00:04:46.929> he<00:04:47.109> was<00:04:47.229> probably<00:04:47.469> gonna<00:04:47.619> be<00:04:47.829> inside

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:48.549 
thought he was probably gonna be inside

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:51.449 
thought he was probably gonna be inside
the<00:04:48.939> bunker<00:04:49.179> there<00:04:49.769> but<00:04:50.769> he<00:04:50.949> was<00:04:51.069> on<00:04:51.219> the<00:04:51.249> other

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:51.459 
the bunker there but he was on the other

00:04:51.459 --> 00:05:03.349 
the bunker there but he was on the other
side<00:04:51.759> and<00:04:52.529> really<00:04:53.529> laid<00:04:53.829> a<00:04:53.859> good<00:04:54.099> trap<00:04:54.369> there

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:03.359 

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:05.669 

well<00:05:04.359> looks<00:05:04.599> like<00:05:04.689> this<00:05:04.929> round<00:05:05.229> is<00:05:05.349> gonna<00:05:05.469> be

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:05.679 
well looks like this round is gonna be

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:07.949 
well looks like this round is gonna be
over<00:05:05.829> only<00:05:06.249> gonna<00:05:06.369> lose<00:05:06.609> by<00:05:06.879> about<00:05:07.089> 30<00:05:07.419> tickets

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:07.959 
over only gonna lose by about 30 tickets

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.519 
over only gonna lose by about 30 tickets
so<00:05:08.229> that's<00:05:08.769> not<00:05:08.949> bad<00:05:09.009> for<00:05:09.249> a<00:05:09.489> comeback<00:05:10.529> and

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 
so that's not bad for a comeback and

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.439 
so that's not bad for a comeback and
I'll<00:05:11.829> see<00:05:12.129> you<00:05:12.339> on<00:05:12.549> the<00:05:12.699> next<00:05:12.909> episode<00:05:13.119> of
