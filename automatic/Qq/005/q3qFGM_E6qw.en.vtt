00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.820
 I welcome everyone again today 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:23.920
 finally flew 922 flew very 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.320
 long mail for some reason very slow so 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.890
 need nothing fixed 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:34.240
 Now let's unpack I remind you here 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:38.090
 six-channel micro or copter 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:41.290
 in front of them a helicopter are good small 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.690
 six-channel with collective pitch 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.940
 who can fly an envelope so here 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.840
 so everything is beautifully packed and even myself 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:57.560
 shocked complete we get 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.160
 but some parts here are thrust blades 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.030
 our 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.540
 and something else there turn on the pro charger 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.449
 device 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.900
 so we already have so splitters here 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:12.350
 I look at us will understand even 2 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.920
 just wondering or is it for us for that 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.450
 I need everything for an adapter just did not give 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.830
 stuck and there are adapters 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.080
 To stick the case and 22 battery 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:29.409
 we have 30 milliamps 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:33.200
 such flat normal 1 meeting 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:38.180
 no one stole that well 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:44.049
 Well, the equipment is basically standard yes 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.049
 our standard tag is already a lot 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.650
 get him touch no door 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.620
 from 955 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.410
 all dusty what is 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:02.470
 where was she at all taxi city 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:05.890
 functions like this and all this too 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.500
 plays so instructions without instructions 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.740
 There is no way 6k on some try 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.740
 figure it out and we have a helicopter 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:25.390
 look not to all soft but here 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:27.600
 comfortable look all then this is all 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.990
 the rest is far away 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:35.350
 this feed here is our attached so for 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.140
 comparison here took got another 955 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:42.690
 just to be seen the difference here at 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.700
 us 922 955, respectively, it is longer 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.850
 just a few centimeters there 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.680
 conop even more so that is shorter 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.170
 942 will be the same size compared 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.190
 from nine hundred thirty third well this if 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.670
 compare 4 fits 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.519
 here so near yet well, okay, we 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.830
 let's see this well what we have means 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.730
 here we are of course all collector 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:13.750
 engines now we have new models 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.330
 925 926 and 4 6 channels go there 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.230
 already sbk that is how they will appear in 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.830
 I will order the sale immediately while the pre-order is on 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.720
 that's why collector engines 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:31.989
 3 servi worth collective step that is 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.820
 our blades can be in the red 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.070
 so well min this negative 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.250
 angle so positively have everything 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.910
 started talking actually nothing more 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.280
 interesting not interesting yes only we 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.240
 run it let's see it generally flies 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.700
 or not 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.370
 so that we have on the street is very winter 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.980
 difficult to test such fine ice and 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.980
 because their batteries are frozen 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:09.040
 Now let 's pack the battery here 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:14.620
 freeze especially failure here on this 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:17.620
 911 fly so I did not work out just 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.890
 literally there in how many seconds are you 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.650
 look here 20 all he stops throwing 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.140
 and if the snow itself is the only way at all 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.540
 completely losing traction 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.640
 so I do not know how this can this 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:35.590
 it will be normal for us to warm the batteries 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:39.370
 and everything will be clear to him so 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:44.730
 batteries, I mean 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:47.830
 the temperature is somewhere around -15 -20 degrees 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.460
 minus 5t i think de suffer can not 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:56.650
 have time to freeze even contact 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:59.700
 right there everything is standard here they are 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:05.650
 only a little different seems to me 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:07.510
 the envelope is strange i think they have it 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.090
 equally the equipment is slightly different 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:13.950
 because there was a choice on that one 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.670
 here 93 3922 that is, these are all models 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:23.320
 here she is not here 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:27.310
 low speed high speed protocol and so necessary 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.330
 see how it turns on here 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.500
 mods 4 set mods 2 that's all low 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:37.660
 speed high speed 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:40.630
 here we are so incomprehensible 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.650
 Okay, let 's figure it out, but the battery 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.550
 Likely to leave on simple 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.400
 I do not even know how to get it 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.550
 deepen much probably not much 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:56.700
 try hard 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:01.510
 I just make will not let us fly 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:09.420
 thats all the contact went so so buzzed 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:09.420
 I went to teach 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.210
 check 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:38.370
 painted everything seems to work a plate 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:41.689
 clearly a little ball does not go from the right 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.889
 Now I will try to figure out what's in there. 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:47.490
 maybe on the spot she is just his floor 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:49.169
 bad but I do nâ€™t know how to proceed 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.840
 like crayons we have from big not 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.060
 differ by nothing so me this is the first 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.539
 six-channel fine ice before 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.979
 only big well, maybe we can see something 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:03.180
 not that pereklinilo here so that everything is now 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:07.080
 I'll try to fly on it in the street 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.080
 generally otherwise wait 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.969
 very, very soft, that's horrible highway straight 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:15.360
 sags itself under my weight and I don't 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:18.210
 I know collapse very quickly so everything 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.370
 waiting for the review does not guarantee when it 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:23.879
 I will eat there will be such frosts 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:26.879
 so difficult and so do not rush me 

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:28.740
 then everyone writes heaps it is difficult in winter 

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:31.650
 complex winter review do immediately speak 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.789
 all thank you for your attention to all new 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:37.409
 meetings and to new reviews and parcels yet 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:41.460
 who is this something when i first run 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:42.659
 pereklinilo him here 2 tab is done 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:46.310
 ok from the plate 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:48.779
 side speed goes like this we see 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.779
 for this here corrected to the river Neva 

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:55.969
 so understand but now. 

00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:55.969
 so no complaints yet
