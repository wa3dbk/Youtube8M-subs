00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
drawing air out of the harmonica the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.810 
drawing air out of the harmonica the
beauty<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.920> slow<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
beauty is that you can slow down the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:50.950 
beauty is that you can slow down the
music<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.449> slow<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.409> like

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.330 

so<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.049> see<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.380> slow<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.679> down<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.039> you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so you see you can slow it down as you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.730 
so you see you can slow it down as you
can<00:01:54.060> stop<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.509> almost<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.140> wanted<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
can stop it almost if you wanted to

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.099 
can stop it almost if you wanted to
which<00:01:56.189> makes<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.060> understand<00:01:57.600> where<00:01:57.929> you're

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
which makes you understand where you're

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.919 
which makes you understand where you're
trying<00:01:58.289> to<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:59.159> can<00:01:59.429> loop<00:02:00.179> it<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:00.780> you

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
trying to go you can loop it when you

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:03.020 
trying to go you can loop it when you
loop<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.289> that<00:02:01.500> means<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:02.009> play<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.549> series

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
loop it that means you can play a series

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:25.080 
loop it that means you can play a series
of<00:02:03.060> notes<00:02:03.380> over<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.679> over<00:02:05.340> again

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.210

see if you're having trouble anywhere in
the<00:02:28.460> song<00:02:28.700> where<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.450> find<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.840> notes<00:02:30.050> a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
the song where you find the notes a

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.260 
the song where you find the notes a
little<00:02:30.410> difficult<00:02:31.040> to<00:02:31.100> reach<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:32.060> don't

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
little difficult to reach you don't

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.230 
little difficult to reach you don't
quite<00:02:32.540> know<00:02:32.750> exactly<00:02:32.780> how<00:02:33.470> to<00:02:33.940> position<00:02:34.940> your

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
quite know exactly how to position your

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.870 
quite know exactly how to position your
mouth<00:02:35.450> of<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:36.050> harmonica<00:02:36.740> or<00:02:36.770> whatever<00:02:37.100> didn't

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
mouth of a harmonica or whatever didn't

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.780 
mouth of a harmonica or whatever didn't
stop<00:02:38.240> it<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.570> loop<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.990> at<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.260> at<00:02:40.160> that<00:02:40.460> spot

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
stop it and loop it at that at that spot

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.450 
stop it and loop it at that at that spot
I<00:02:41.060> would<00:02:41.870> recommend<00:02:42.380> probably<00:02:42.920> not

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
I would recommend probably not

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.330 
I would recommend probably not
looping<00:02:44.090> more<00:02:44.330> than<00:02:44.600> five<00:02:45.410> or<00:02:45.440> six<00:02:45.890> notes<00:02:46.100> at<00:02:46.250> a

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
looping more than five or six notes at a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.400 
looping more than five or six notes at a
time<00:02:46.370> because<00:02:46.850> otherwise<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.960> becomes<00:02:48.080> too

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
time because otherwise it becomes too

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.130 
time because otherwise it becomes too
confusing<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.370> but<00:02:49.690> literally<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.960> could

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
confusing to you but literally you could

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.500 
confusing to you but literally you could
really<00:02:51.320> loop<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:52.220> whole<00:02:52.400> song<00:02:52.730> if<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.210> wanted

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
really loop the whole song if you wanted

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.110 
really loop the whole song if you wanted
to<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:54.860> all<00:02:55.010> these<00:02:55.190> things<00:02:55.490> are<00:02:55.760> all<00:02:55.970> in
