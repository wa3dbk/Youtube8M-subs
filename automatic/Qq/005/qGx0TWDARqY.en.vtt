coders<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.990> talked<00:01:07.290> about<00:01:07.590> how<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.860> encoders

were<00:01:08.909> what<00:01:09.180> tells<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.840> needle<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.290> move<00:01:10.470> up

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
were what tells the needle to move up

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550 
were what tells the needle to move up
and<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.090> where<00:01:12.390> those<00:01:12.600> encoders
