00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
okay so today I'll be doing an unboxing

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.160 
okay so today I'll be doing an unboxing
of<00:00:07.850> the<00:00:08.870> Fuji<00:00:09.870> s<00:00:10.110> 69

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:11.170 
of the Fuji s 69

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.910 
of the Fuji s 69
you<00:00:11.230> can<00:00:11.710> see<00:00:11.920> there<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.990> is<00:00:14.230> a<00:00:14.260> bridge

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
you can see there this is a bridge

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.380 
you can see there this is a bridge
camera<00:00:15.370> and<00:00:16.500> basically<00:00:17.910> replaces<00:00:18.910> my<00:00:19.119> old

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
camera and basically replaces my old

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.070 
camera and basically replaces my old
aging<00:00:20.140> Fuji<00:00:20.950> camera<00:00:21.310> which<00:00:22.300> needed<00:00:22.630> replacing

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
aging Fuji camera which needed replacing

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.350 
aging Fuji camera which needed replacing
anyway<00:00:23.349> but<00:00:23.590> er<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:24.570> was<00:00:25.570> looking<00:00:25.869> at<00:00:25.960> sort<00:00:26.230> of<00:00:26.320> a

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
anyway but er I was looking at sort of a

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.689 
anyway but er I was looking at sort of a
similar<00:00:28.360> compact<00:00:29.350> digital<00:00:29.470> camera<00:00:30.010> and<00:00:30.220> then

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
similar compact digital camera and then

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.040 
similar compact digital camera and then
solve<00:00:30.940> this<00:00:31.060> for<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:31.300> very<00:00:31.420> good<00:00:31.539> price<00:00:31.779> I

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
solve this for a very good price I

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.710 
solve this for a very good price I
thought<00:00:32.230> well<00:00:32.379> why<00:00:32.559> not<00:00:32.590> so<00:00:33.520> as<00:00:34.300> you<00:00:34.449> can<00:00:34.510> see

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
thought well why not so as you can see

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:42.560 
thought well why not so as you can see
it's<00:00:34.870> got<00:00:35.020> a<00:00:35.050> 15<00:00:35.320> time<00:00:35.739> optical<00:00:36.340> zoom<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.739> has<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
it's got a 15 time optical zoom it has a

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.360 
it's got a 15 time optical zoom it has a
12<00:00:43.570> point<00:00:43.750> two<00:00:43.989> megapixel<00:00:44.260> camera<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.220> it

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
12 point two megapixel camera and it

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.360 
12 point two megapixel camera and it
does<00:00:45.550> some<00:00:45.940> interesting<00:00:46.000> stuff<00:00:46.600> like

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
does some interesting stuff like

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.979 
does some interesting stuff like
panoramic<00:00:48.370> shots<00:00:48.640> as<00:00:48.879> well<00:00:49.210> as<00:00:49.269> HD<00:00:49.750> video

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989

the<00:01:14.320> annual<00:01:14.650> instruction<00:01:15.369> manual<00:01:15.780> pretty

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
the annual instruction manual pretty

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.219 
the annual instruction manual pretty
simple<00:01:17.969> so<00:01:18.969> getting<00:01:19.240> into<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.539> camera<00:01:19.869> itself

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
simple so getting into the camera itself

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.620 
simple so getting into the camera itself
I've<00:01:21.039> actually<00:01:21.250> taken<00:01:21.640> this<00:01:21.880> out<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.180> used<00:01:22.390> it

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
I've actually taken this out and used it

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.459 
I've actually taken this out and used it
but<00:01:23.079> the<00:01:24.070> box<00:01:24.280> is<00:01:24.399> piercing<00:01:25.109> this<00:01:26.109> is<00:01:26.289> your

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:26.469 
but the box is piercing this is your

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.800 
but the box is piercing this is your
carrying<00:01:27.340> strap<00:01:27.700> thing<00:01:27.939> I<00:01:28.090> guess<00:01:28.329> which

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
carrying strap thing I guess which

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.149 
carrying strap thing I guess which
basically<00:01:29.109> hooks<00:01:29.350> onto<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.649> camera<00:01:30.039> and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
basically hooks onto the camera and

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
basically hooks onto the camera and
allows<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.609> carry<00:01:30.880> around<00:01:31.000> your<00:01:31.210> neck

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
allows you to carry around your neck

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.340 
allows you to carry around your neck
always<00:01:32.890> useful<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.659> then<00:01:34.750> you've<00:01:34.869> got<00:01:35.109> this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
always useful and then you've got this

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.330 
always useful and then you've got this
is<00:01:35.469> just<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.770> box<00:01:35.950> for<00:01:36.280> SDK<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.100> then<00:01:39.219> you've

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
is just a box for SDK and then you've

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.620 
is just a box for SDK and then you've
got<00:01:39.520> a<00:01:39.960> AV<00:01:41.429> USB<00:01:42.429> sort<00:01:42.729> of<00:01:42.820> cable<00:01:43.090> which<00:01:43.390> allows

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
got a AV USB sort of cable which allows

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.940 
got a AV USB sort of cable which allows
you<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.960> see<00:01:44.560> your<00:01:44.710> photos<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.899> your<00:01:47.409> computer

for a bit and I found that it has pretty
good<00:03:17.370> image<00:03:18.370> quality<00:03:18.960> certainly<00:03:19.960> better<00:03:20.140> than

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
good image quality certainly better than
