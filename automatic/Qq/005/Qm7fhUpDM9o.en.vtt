 arrives to be an irony in the video game started the 3d graphics revolution 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.149
 one of his best children was placed on the old school platform in 2008 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.400
 the game in question is the classic I decide I feel in the plenary 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.640

 united is called classic tube six sons 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.720
 the production was impeccable 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.410
 and used the capacity of cd rom a novelty in the year 1993 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410
 when the game was released 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.860
 by means of this communicate to psp

 trait long donors dinalva 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.009
 almost as it was conceived on the third day 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.680
 and also never final symphony 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.210
 15 25 hours a week the newest to meet the characters the year is 1792 the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.530
 supporters etc 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.850
 Dracula figures the lord of darkness back to life said the young man's coming 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.010
 belmont's list of the traditional vampire hunting family is destroyed and 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.170
 several citizens are taken hostage including the table at the address of the 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.490
 hero di marÃ­a also a hunter of 6th 'shadows different from the successor 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.840
 when the two will have mediation with platforms without elements of rpg 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.590
 the third island 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.390
 the scheme is similar to that of the b-series leader 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.260
 instead of having a huge profanity 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.750
 with the results to analysts on a farm in turn 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.610
 but it does not mean 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.450
 the decoration elements were removed 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.060
 the stages with which a series of secrets is the magazine songs and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.500
 this brings to be discovered 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.189
 there are alternative ways and even two heads to do 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.369
 with so much to reveal 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:20.359
 it is inevitable to play in the same stadium several times 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.649
 I was kind of turned from the atlantic is not a title for beginners then it was 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:29.569
 thought for the old fans of the series who know how ruthless their 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.259
 children of old 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:34.539
 You will not find anything friendly around here. 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.180
 the controls are destructive many traps killing him on the hour 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.249
 runners-up are scattered sparsely 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.789
 Your children ended up 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.999
 now the beginning of doing is missing 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.339
 I got a carriage going to the castle of Dracula 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.279
 and is intensified by death 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:58.029
 The structure of the phases is quite traditional as classical sites of 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:02:59.609
 other case of email 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.859
 The same happens with the creation of the hour and are arrangements of some of the most 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:04.740
 known 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.309
 franchise songs 

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:11.099
 although most of the compositions are great some have had a very high tempo 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.989
 modified and may not please tourists the script is the same as the robbery 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.340
 from the regional side 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.679
 I only saw something like the interview 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:25.719
 to the standards of the present time the quality is not surprising but it translates well 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.760
 the spirit of the title that was inspiration 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.099
 the point of contention lies with the employees 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.869
 in place of the most beautiful countries the allusion are models 

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:37.709
 three-dimensional 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.539
 here reduced ask for detail and all grace 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:46.869
 who is accustomed to today's games should have difficulty controlling 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:52.329
 fire it has fed and has many limitations as the public that follows 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.199
 a correct trajectory 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:59.259
 although nine difficulty level selection the municipality has easier 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.569
 when the user accesses the memory 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.419
 she was the least complicated 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.779
 but it has much more loose corridors than the leaders 

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:11.649
 which stopped me from doing this because I was actively fighting but the producer who 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:15.479
 included a bunch of ingredients contained to improve the factor 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.040
 to ruin everything is one of the amusements in the middle 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.370
 As for the original game that appears as a minister it is difficult to imagine that it was 

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:27.319
 an overproduction at the time 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.759
 by the precariousness of the graphics 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.719
 reduction in the pass made because of problems with immolation 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.170
 make it clear is that 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.940
 also includes 5 in the plenum he compared over the year was well 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.240
 best adapted to pcp 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.430
 to complete 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.910
 the company in a little surprise 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.910
 five thousand wonders as playable character 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.199
 for those who did not play either game and this union will get clients 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.229
 chronicle or only with the almost irrecusable title 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.240
 but if you have already tried South 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.170
 the novenario 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.090
 and has no interest in releasing it, it is more difficult to recommend the incident 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.270
 did not last more than five hours
