00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello everyone I just have a 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.490
 little question what it is you already 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.260
 arrived from home to do 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.599
 a little exploration and not to be 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.980
 returned to the night and play in order 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.900
 he will ask just in full of world 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.029
 we had no choice but to bury 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.859
 to make a little hut do you like 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.630
 not say deteriorate the environment 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.010
 so do like me a tent so 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 here today teach you how to do 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.619
 a nice little tent with 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.719
 god have to have pistons levers 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.690
 a lever with three pistons of the red wool 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:41.520
 ali two chests of stones sand one 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.350
 paid ice and a torch 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.120
 so I learn from one to do a 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.090
 try like that one two three four five 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 six wall ag will continue so you do 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.489
 a minimum what is good is 6 to 15 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:02.329
 2 3 4 5 6 he does the same from above 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.329
 like that and ladies photo m6 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.119
 so it's not it's not the best 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.950
 thing after a little it takes a little 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.369
 of time to build what you are 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.630
 still undergoing the ford breath but 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.640
 good it can be very nice I 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.799
 do that with a friend on a server 2 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.750
 put your public place here and I 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:29.180
 forgot something without something 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.740
 special thing ellen page so that's it 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.659
 I will try to copy the leash 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.080
 all because I do not know 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:41.289
 to wear stride m here and there you put 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.850
 a torch 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.850
 so there is also a block 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.230
 I understand myself 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.170
 we 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.030
 hop logically this meaning and and the last 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.259
 Right now I think we await me 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.459
 giuly so you do not have to 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.010
 to put the histones slava needed them 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.390
 two models you do not have to 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.150
 to be what I find it just makes 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.890
 pretty it's class now let's go 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.120
 inside because out salaries 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.400
 small but good it's still a small 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:34.489
 not very spacious but also spacious 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:37.580
 it's warm of league 1 so 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.989
 here you are going to ask now from 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.840
 the red laddh and there you go to ask 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.840
 something unusual pistons 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.260
 wait I finish because if not when 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.170
 the pistons looks like and it will not do 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:03:00.280
 pretty you're going to ask pistons inc 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.130
 it's done it's done perfectly 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.180
 so why I left a space 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.860
 destiny to know that's what I got 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.860
 completely crazy the spaces look 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:18.120
 logically it is to a space 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.120
 maybe not I made a space 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.260
 ah ah ah these dead who crumples me to 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:29.420
 look what I did I'm strong 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.040
 no what do not I do that I 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.260
 breaks in fact so that's me 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:43.190
 I'm completely messed up so that 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:45.350
 pistons to put themselves up here here is 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.130
 so here you put a red wing in 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.360
 lever and there you put three pistons 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.420
 in hand is similarly game we 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:58.130
 would 3 so the pistons what are they going to 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:03.950
 to serve, he keeps above all mystery 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:06.550
 mystery so we pistons I find that 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.960
 it's a little security door hop 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.090
 here is gold not put pistons how 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.860
 otherwise mortars to reach will go 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.710
 it's all a little security zone 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.880
 simple and so the doll put your 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.000
 chests because otherwise we can not 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.400
 the dedicated ones and a bed and there you have 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.880
 your vegetable garden is that a friend in 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.790
 multi is great for that it's really 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.500
 great because we have a small cove 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.080
 on which we feel it is not finished 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.669
 the tutorial you have a small cove 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.480
 on which we settled and we 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:43.880
 built two small tents and prevents 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:47.660
 simply and it's great so a moment 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.850
 so obviously that's it I took the 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.000
 lighter and we also have fun doing 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.370
 we're going to cut wood 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.890
 cut wood and made a small fire 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.590
 just like that 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:04.550
 he did this when it's not me who 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.730
 the fact is here and so like that and you 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.910
 salute and you enjoy polite in your 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.860
 aunt so how far do I advise 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.510
 is that m before we are better pistons 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.880
 here like that was totally closed 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.740
 could not move and unfortunately a 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.300
 scared cry had arrived right in front and 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.890
 apples is but did not have the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.980
 time to back away while there you are 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.060
 still fetch a cry like that you finally 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.910
 are fishing a scream share and 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.210
 backing is good it will no 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.210
 to make you 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.520
 here is the fire consumed until I 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.940
 find it quite nice and so 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:45.620
 tried not to burn me so madam 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:50.840
 ann m I 'm going to bowl m but I have the 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:54.410
 time this reserve habit because 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.820
 that it does not see it sinks and so 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.950
 here I say goodbye and 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.090
 next for next animated tome 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.090
 not to send me your ideas a 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:06.820
 comment when this is otherwise c 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.820
 otherwise I have more convoy ideas
