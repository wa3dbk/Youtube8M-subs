00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.429
 yes 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.470
 let's see a little bit the operation 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.540
 of windows 8 in about 1,820 to review 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.490
 it's very simple it's very fluid 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.169
 the menu consists of two screens because 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.660
 the screen is full of window above 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.829
 where we can organize the icons with 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.620
 the size we want small or medium 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.329
 great that we can receive all the 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.219
 information that we have within the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.460
 application without access 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.460
 she 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.350
 we can anchor all the applications 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.910
 that we want to the home screen with 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.570
 issues like dismissing applications 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.400
 click on the diary 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 the second screen where we are going to see 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.810
 all the applications that we have 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.420
 installed in we can rent everything 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.759
 to the home page 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 with a simple gesture we create an access 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:11.030
 new direct we can move by the 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.030
 screen to others 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.010
 how 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.570
 the integration of social networks in 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.890
 a 2 with 8 is pretty will get 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.300
 we have integrated applications 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.979
 linkedin twitter is one articulated to 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.360
 all the forces we can access 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.610
 all our contacts either from the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.380
 social network that is already the news of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.750
 all contacts in all networks 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.640
 social good as the people avoiding 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.540
 the steps of having to enter several 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.540
 different applications 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.390
 a room of rooms where we can 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.590
 share with our users and 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.630
 we arrive for example a group 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.540
 of works both photographs and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.369
 videos as a shared calendar without 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.330
 that we can all edit and virtualize 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.330
 what we are doing wrong 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.000
 also to have an access 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.880
 more direct you can talk the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.860
 contacts to the moon start 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.630
 to have them more at hand and receive all 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.700
 notifications of your news in 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.410
 social networks emails 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.120
 we can anchor to the home page 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.150
 also shortcuts to web pages 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.250
 of type of applications we have the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.870
 installed office package 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.210
 inside the phone with the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.180
 ratings for example onenote where 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.880
 we can share create audio notes 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.130
 of voice lists 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.340
 and future and it is automatically saved in 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.730
 ours and 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:44.019
 we give a free storage 7 gigas 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:47.120
 to all customers and 820 also to 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.170
 through memory 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.170
 have memory 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.840
 so you can see exclusive applications 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.840
 we have for example memory 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.659
 is the quite important application already 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.900
 they do not force the customer to 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.879
 use the same 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.520
 the pps from anywhere in the world 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.480
 free of charge 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.480
 good we use 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.790
 we can create the map to confirm that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.260
 we are fine 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.060
 and we can look for a destination either to 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.459
 please we know saved last 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.959
 destinations we can not search well for a 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.090
 address well for a point of interest 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.750
 many times we do not know the address of 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.750
 what we are going to look for 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.710
 we can see all we have 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.710
 around shows us on the map 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.880
 Route 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.230
 and from the application itself we can 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.190
 manage the navas we have 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.920
 saved on the phone in this case 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.450
 Spain and we can expand with this has 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:59.069
 looked like more than 90 countries around the 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.069
 world for free 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.720
 and as I said before they force us 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.889
 ace 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.110
 yes
