00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
talk about some of these I mean things

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240 
talk about some of these I mean things
like<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.509> when<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.140> draw<00:01:19.320> there<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.009> lip

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
like this when you draw there the lip

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.420 
like this when you draw there the lip
return<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:21.000> live<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
return or live right here it's it's a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.529 
return or live right here it's it's a
little<00:01:23.670> wider<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.210> than<00:01:24.329> it<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.479> there

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
little wider here than it is there

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.120 
little wider here than it is there
becomes<00:01:25.079> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.320> thinner<00:01:25.619> there<00:01:25.890> because

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
becomes a little thinner there because

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
becomes a little thinner there because
it's<00:01:26.250> further<00:01:26.490> away<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:26.759> us<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.840> only<00:01:27.990> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
it's further away from us not only that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
it's further away from us not only that
because<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.920> cheek<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.429> you<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
because you have a cheek then you have a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.960 
because you have a cheek then you have a
little<00:01:30.509> bit<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.899> over<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.729> those

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
little bit of that over there so those

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.539 
little bit of that over there so those
little<00:01:33.000> things<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.380> give<00:01:34.679> give<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> kind

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
little things really give give the kind

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
little things really give give the kind
of<00:01:35.670> form<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.360> respective<00:01:39.350> ESL<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.500> be

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
of form and just respective ESL just be

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.300 
of form and just respective ESL just be
the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:41.119> round<00:01:42.119> sometimes<00:01:42.539> little<00:01:42.780> oval

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
larger than one is further away those

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:17.500 
larger than one is further away those
little<00:02:04.490> tricks<00:02:06.430> really<00:02:07.430> help<00:02:07.760> I<00:02:16.210> have<00:02:17.210> ever

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
the main thing also to keep in mind see

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.580 
the main thing also to keep in mind see
how<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.030> follow<00:02:23.660> everything<00:02:24.020> on<00:02:24.320> a<00:02:24.350> some<00:02:24.560> other

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
how I follow everything on a some other

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.720 
how I follow everything on a some other
real<00:02:25.520> simple<00:02:25.910> are<00:02:26.090> like<00:02:26.750> this<00:02:26.959> do<00:02:27.470> whatever

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
real simple are like this do whatever

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.699 
real simple are like this do whatever
the<00:02:28.730> fluid<00:02:29.209> flows<00:02:29.480> suppose<00:02:30.050> that<00:02:30.260> way<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.470> you

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
the fluid flows suppose that way to you

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.930 
the fluid flows suppose that way to you
what<00:02:30.890> you<00:02:30.980> don't<00:02:31.130> want<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.280> break<00:02:31.459> it<00:02:31.520> up<00:02:31.760> with

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
what you don't want to break it up with

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.390 
what you don't want to break it up with
a<00:02:32.030> lot<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.240> angles<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.950> directional<00:02:33.950> changes

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
a lot of angles and directional changes

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.250 
a lot of angles and directional changes
so<00:02:34.610> everything<00:02:35.030> is<00:02:35.450> basically<00:02:35.720> doing<00:02:36.230> that

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.350
