you accidentally ride off with them on
and<00:00:17.970> they'll<00:00:18.240> spin<00:00:18.539> round<00:00:18.750> crack<00:00:19.380> into<00:00:19.680> their

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and they'll spin round crack into their

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.950 
and they'll spin round crack into their
possibly<00:00:20.699> dropping<00:00:20.970> off<00:00:21.029> your<00:00:21.060> bike<00:00:21.359> possibly

possibly dropping off your bike possibly
break<00:00:22.140> your<00:00:22.289> caliper<00:00:22.970> with<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.180> system<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
break your caliper with this system it

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.019 
break your caliper with this system it
basically<00:00:25.500> fits<00:00:25.980> onto<00:00:26.220> your<00:00:26.430> caliper<00:00:26.820> over

basically fits onto your caliper over
here<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:28.220> this<00:00:29.220> pin<00:00:30.050> clicks<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.470> goes

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
here and this pin clicks in and goes

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.389 
here and this pin clicks in and goes
through<00:00:32.540> there<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.500> beauty<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.280> if

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
through there the beauty of this is if

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.790 
through there the beauty of this is if
you<00:00:35.489> happen<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.790> ride<00:00:36.059> off<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.540> locks

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
you happen to ride off with it locks

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
you happen to ride off with it locks
it's<00:00:37.800> already<00:00:38.219> locked<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.149> it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it's already locked in so what it

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.910 
it's already locked in so what it
actually<00:00:39.300> does<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.989> just<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.500> riding

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
actually does is just it's like riding

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040 
actually does is just it's like riding
with<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> brake<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:42.270> riding<00:00:42.570> off<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
with the brake on or riding off with the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.760 
with the brake on or riding off with the
brake<00:00:43.200> on<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.860> doesn't<00:00:44.190> go<00:00:44.340> anywhere<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.770> I'm

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
brake on it doesn't go anywhere so I'm

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.930 
brake on it doesn't go anywhere so I'm
going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> show<00:00:47.789> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
going to do is just going to show you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
going to do is just going to show you
how<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.120> fit<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:48.930> very<00:00:49.200> easy<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.590> fit

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
how to fit it it's very very easy to fit

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
how to fit it it's very very easy to fit
you're<00:00:50.579> getting<00:00:50.789> two<00:00:50.969> keys<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.660> first

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you're getting two keys so the first

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.450 
you're getting two keys so the first
thing<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.469> remove<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.070> bolts<00:00:56.309> from<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
thing to do is remove the bolts from the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.889 
thing to do is remove the bolts from the
caliper<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.030> I've<00:00:57.149> already<00:00:57.420> loosened<00:00:57.570> off

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
caliper which I've already loosened off

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.380 
caliper which I've already loosened off
just<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> make<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.829> easier<00:01:01.100> and

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
just to make it a little bit easier and

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
just to make it a little bit easier and
then<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.539> get<00:01:03.690> issued<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.650> either<00:01:04.799> short

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
then you get issued with either short

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.340 
then you get issued with either short
bolts<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.760> long<00:01:05.970> bolts<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.689> replace<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.200> with

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
bolts or long bolts to replace it with

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.670 
bolts or long bolts to replace it with
I've<00:01:08.010> worked<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> Aprilia<00:01:09.210> Tuono

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
I've worked out on the Aprilia Tuono

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.120 
I've worked out on the Aprilia Tuono
APRC<00:01:11.240> spacers<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:13.350> all<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> need

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
APRC spacers a is all you need

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.690 
APRC spacers a is all you need
the<00:01:15.060> G's<00:01:15.360> are<00:01:15.689> thicker<00:01:15.900> spacers<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.710> then<00:01:17.520> you

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the G's are thicker spacers and then you

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.010 
the G's are thicker spacers and then you
obviously<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.240> thinnest<00:01:18.509> bases<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:18.990> well

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
obviously get the thinnest bases as well

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.870 
obviously get the thinnest bases as well
it<00:01:19.710> works<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.280> pretty<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it works out with you pretty that the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.340 
it works out with you pretty that the
smallest<00:01:21.180> spaces<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.869> ones<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
smallest spaces are the ones that do the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
smallest spaces are the ones that do the
job<00:01:22.909> so<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> way<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.150> mount<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:25.340> is<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.490> pop

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
job so the way to mount it is to pop

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.990 
job so the way to mount it is to pop
that<00:01:26.850> into<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> disc<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> around<00:01:28.880> feed<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that into the disc and around feed the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.499 
that into the disc and around feed the
spacers<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.630> there's<00:01:31.409> one<00:01:31.680> first<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.509> pop

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
spacers on there's one first of all pop

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.469 
spacers on there's one first of all pop
the<00:01:33.659> bolt<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.119> again<00:01:36.119> with<00:01:36.329> this

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the bolt in there and again with this

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.429 
the bolt in there and again with this
one<00:01:37.040> second<00:01:38.040> spacer<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.150> again<00:01:39.570> pop<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> bolt

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
one second spacer and again pop the bolt

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.140 
one second spacer and again pop the bolt
in<00:01:40.619> there<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> tighten<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.540> down

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:54.530 

you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.280 

you

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.010 

also<00:02:00.290> they<00:02:00.470> don't<00:02:00.650> give<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.810> allen<00:02:02.810> key

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
also they don't give you the allen key

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.080 
also they don't give you the allen key
that<00:02:03.920> comes<00:02:04.130> with<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.490> so<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.730> need<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:04.970> get

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
that comes with it so you need to get

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.600 
that comes with it so you need to get
yourself<00:02:05.180> an<00:02:05.510> eight<00:02:05.720> millimeter<00:02:05.930> allen<00:02:06.380> key

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.970 

okay<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.750> thing<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:13.990> do<00:02:14.230> here<00:02:14.470> is<00:02:14.740> when

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
okay now the thing to do here is when

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.340 
okay now the thing to do here is when
you<00:02:15.070> go<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.250> use<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.870> come<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
you go to use it you come to the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.850 
you go to use it you come to the
blanking<00:02:17.740> plate<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:20.140> when<00:02:20.290> you're<00:02:20.410> not<00:02:20.560> using
