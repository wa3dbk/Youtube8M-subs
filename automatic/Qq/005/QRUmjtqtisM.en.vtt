00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi guys and welcome back with a 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.660
 brand new video today i wanted to show you 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.859
 a bit of simulators for iphone 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.530
 before starting as usual 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.590
 I wanted to invite you to leave a like one 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.680
 having said that we begin immediately then the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.960
 today's first game is something 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.590
 really absurd I think it's the game anymore 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.980
 meaningless I've ever tried 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.310
 that is, in practice it is called the 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.669
 possible breakfast simulator or 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.579
 breakfast impossible a simulator of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.579
 breakfast impossible and that is not already 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.829
 that makes a lot of sense then us in 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.140
 practice we have to play hafla big bird 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.030
 while we have breakfast when i am 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 awake in the morning is already impossible 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.870
 have breakfast for as long as they are 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.629
 stoned then I should also play 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.140
 platì bird that is impossible too 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.879
 when i'm beautiful conscious 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 but if we have to do everything 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.969
 at the same time then man then 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.340
 on the left side of the screen 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.450
 we should touch with the edito while di 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.970
 here we will have to make slides to eat 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.439
 let's see what we can do if 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 we can make a good score 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.290
 then I already fla greenest I am tied 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.360
 so I imagine how good it will be 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.290
 meanwhile he has to have breakfast no 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.240
 ok we have to start with the bird and flap 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.579
 I'm already dead perfect then 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.740
 no it is an impossible stuff in practice not 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:32.979
 I know what I'm doing with this alone 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:37.360
 randomly moving the record of four that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.820
 I went further than expected wow 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.399
 if I were doing this in reality 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.140
 what do I imagine I would put myself like 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.950
 breakfast all in the face and did the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.500
 burgundy and I would make zero as usual 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.729
 Cereal times are the good kellogg's 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.830
 small are a figure maybe not that 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.130
 I will eat the cereals from a lot I have to 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.200
 concentrate on playing then we are a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 quota 4 from which exceeds the record of 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.750
 first 9 by the give by the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.410
 perfect that is starting to take us 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.790
 the fucking hand I almost died I don't know 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.630
 plus what i'm doing 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.519
 I'm not understanding a perfect bat 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.100
 unbelievable I'm still alive 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.810
 I have to train for breakfast maybe there 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.599
 I can do this thing before 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.200
 morning at 8 o'clock starting school time 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.480
 unfortunately you don't make me think about it 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.470
 wow i got a score of 100 points 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.530
 25 but I did 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.120
 baird scrolls 25 would be floppy bird e 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.970
 cerea lscore that would be breakfast 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.430
 four 25 for 4 equal certain to say that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.780
 I'm not complaining 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.990
 so yes I just have to try 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.000
 in reality this perfect thing I would say 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.600
 to pass with the next simulator 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.910
 which is dinosaur simulator or similar 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.880
 to the dinosaur simulator 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.580
 I would say to start then city ​​one 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.150
 airport we go to a city we see a 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.830
 little with the and we choose the day why 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.660
 we must see what we destroy 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:17.250
 fuck was that noise 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.000

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.720
 helicopter 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.360
 ok a water cost has broken out 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.730
 car could jump on it was a 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.840
 train that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:38.129
 I saw a train crashing into flight 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 perfect then a person 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:44.010
 now he is doing something like dancing 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.049

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.239
 when playing shit games 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.420
 perfect I would say to change maps 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:03.260

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:06.810

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.599
 it looked more like a ufo ok this already me 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.900
 like best where the planes are up for 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.000
 a mini space helicopter will do one 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.479
 bad end let me get you in 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.220
 space i am a fat dinosaur the 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.600
 quadruple of this helicopter not 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.750
 I can make it move an inch 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.940
 well let's try with this other here 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.060
 this is the big five times more 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:37.169

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.930
 another beautiful helicopter nothing 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.880
 not even this with a run-up of 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.620
 300,000 km I didn't destroy it well 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.410
 then divertiamoci splitting in which 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.530
 all that was few are in steak if 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:55.980
 I'm not mistaken or what a rocket this is 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:59.700
 we hope this is straight on the moon 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:03.240
 and instead no, but when all 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:10.140
 these planes did that type shot 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:13.530
 on himself then there he is in the meantime 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:17.000

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.580
 every self-respecting simulator or the 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:30.390
 possibility of moving from the dead yes 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:35.220
 i can even skip price goes by jumps 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:37.770
 kind of huge ok guys so i would say that 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.860
 for today with these simulators that don't 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.510
 they make no logical sense it can end like this 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.340
