Wayne<00:00:34.840> in<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.170> movie<00:00:35.469> do<00:00:35.530> you<00:00:35.589> think<00:00:35.829> yeah

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
Wayne in this movie do you think yeah

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:40.770

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
reason though Halford raised and regular

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.099 
reason though Halford raised and regular
I<00:00:42.579> thought<00:00:42.819> it<00:00:42.999> was<00:00:43.059> a<00:00:43.120> father<00:00:43.359> figure<00:00:43.539> and
