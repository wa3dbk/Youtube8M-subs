00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
and I know it's been a while but I got

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.120 
and I know it's been a while but I got
some<00:00:06.420> call<00:00:06.629> 2d<00:00:06.899> ghost<00:00:07.080> gameplay<00:00:07.649> for<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:07.950> guys

some call 2d ghost gameplay for you guys
and<00:00:08.429> I'm<00:00:08.490> gonna<00:00:08.550> break<00:00:08.910> down<00:00:08.970> what<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.139> best

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
and I'm gonna break down what the best

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.440 
and I'm gonna break down what the best
class<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.130> call<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.519> ghost<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:11.969> in<00:00:12.210> my

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
class and call to the ghost is in my

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.299 
class and call to the ghost is in my
opinion<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.590> let's<00:00:13.889> do<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.099> real<00:00:14.250> quick

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
opinion so let's do this real quick

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.120 
opinion so let's do this real quick
create<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.910> soldier<00:00:15.890> Tellem<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:18.050> uh<00:00:19.050> lo<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.039> out

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
create a soldier Tellem and uh lo it out

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.900 
create a soldier Tellem and uh lo it out
three<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.970> probably<00:00:21.449> my<00:00:22.230> favorite<00:00:23.070> class<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
three is probably my favorite class in

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.310 
three is probably my favorite class in
the<00:00:24.269> game<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.199> most

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the game and I think it's the most

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.609 
the game and I think it's the most
effective<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.070> well<00:00:26.279> right<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> most

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
effective as well right so so the most

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.269 
effective as well right so so the most
versatile<00:00:29.250> gun<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.640> my<00:00:29.730> opinion<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.750> ak-12

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
versatile gun in my opinion is the ak-12

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.790 
versatile gun in my opinion is the ak-12
which<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.460> an<00:00:32.579> assault<00:00:32.940> rifle<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.600> that's<00:00:34.500> not

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
which is an assault rifle and that's not

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.440 
which is an assault rifle and that's not
really<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> surprise<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:36.000> we've<00:00:36.149> known

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
really a surprise because we've known

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
really a surprise because we've known
that<00:00:36.510> Infinity<00:00:37.350> Ward<00:00:37.590> really<00:00:37.920> loves<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
that Infinity Ward really loves on the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.119 
that Infinity Ward really loves on the
assault<00:00:39.329> rifles<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.870> their<00:00:40.020> games<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
assault rifles in their games so the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.030 
assault rifles in their games so the
ak-12<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:42.239> probably<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> best<00:00:42.930> gun<00:00:43.290> I've<00:00:43.559> got

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
ak-12 is probably the best gun I've got

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.580 
ak-12 is probably the best gun I've got
a<00:00:44.070> red<00:00:44.399> dot<00:00:44.640> sight<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.600> silencer<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
a red dot sight and a silencer on it and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.680 
a red dot sight and a silencer on it and
the<00:00:47.370> good<00:00:47.579> thing<00:00:47.760> about<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.149> gun<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the good thing about this gun is that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
the good thing about this gun is that
it's<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.050> effective<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.739> long<00:00:49.950> range<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
it's really effective at long range and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's really effective at long range and
if<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.700> guys<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.030> played<00:00:51.210> colder<00:00:51.629> ghosts

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
if you guys have played colder ghosts

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
if you guys have played colder ghosts
yet<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.920> thing<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.520> game<00:00:53.699> that's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
yet one thing about the game that's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.990 
yet one thing about the game that's
pretty<00:00:54.149> obvious<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.230> people<00:00:56.100> die<00:00:56.430> really

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
pretty obvious is that people die really

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
pretty obvious is that people die really
fast<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> health<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.840> really<00:00:58.109> lower<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.559> guns

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
fast the health is really lower the guns

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.189 
fast the health is really lower the guns
are<00:00:59.039> really<00:00:59.309> powerful<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.570> gun<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
are really powerful so this gun is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.860 
are really powerful so this gun is
pretty<00:01:01.590> good<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.920> long<00:01:02.129> range<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.870> it's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pretty good at long range and it's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.050 
pretty good at long range and it's
really<00:01:04.260> really<00:01:04.409> effective<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.549> only<00:01:05.820> thing

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
really really effective the only thing

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.020 
really really effective the only thing
is<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:07.229> most<00:01:07.680> assault<00:01:08.040> rifles<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.729> meet<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
is for most assault rifles if you meet a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.850 
is for most assault rifles if you meet a
submachine<00:01:09.720> gun<00:01:09.900> at<00:01:10.049> close<00:01:10.080> quarters<00:01:10.710> you're

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
submachine gun at close quarters you're

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
submachine gun at close quarters you're
probably<00:01:11.369> lost<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> good<00:01:12.450> thing<00:01:12.479> about

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
probably lost but the good thing about

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.350 
probably lost but the good thing about
the<00:01:12.840> ak-12<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> shot<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.240> if

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
the ak-12 is you have a shot with it if

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
the ak-12 is you have a shot with it if
you<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.630> good<00:01:15.900> accuracy<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.950> drop

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you have good accuracy and your drop

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010 
you have good accuracy and your drop
shot<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:18.479> probably<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> most

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
shot and it's probably the most

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.530 
shot and it's probably the most
versatile<00:01:19.650> gun<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> game<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> reason

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
versatile gun in the game now the reason

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.910 
versatile gun in the game now the reason
why<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> red<00:01:22.080> dot<00:01:22.290> sight<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.740> just

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
why I got the red dot sight is just

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.520 
why I got the red dot sight is just
because<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.189> prefer<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.390> silencer<00:01:25.020> so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
because I prefer it and the silencer so

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.120 
because I prefer it and the silencer so
for<00:01:25.740> me

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
for me

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.060 
for me
I'm<00:01:26.270> basically<00:01:27.270> having<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> silencer<00:01:28.560> um

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
I'm basically having the silencer um

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.710 
I'm basically having the silencer um
it's<00:01:29.520> been<00:01:29.610> pretty<00:01:29.820> effective<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> totally

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it's been pretty effective and I totally

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.760 
it's been pretty effective and I totally
recommend<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.229> free<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.650> all

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
recommend it free for all

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
recommend it free for all
search-and-rescue<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.939> don't<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> die

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
search-and-rescue you don't want to die

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.760 
search-and-rescue you don't want to die
in<00:01:33.479> those<00:01:33.840> especially<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.590> team<00:01:34.740> deathmatch

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
in those especially in team deathmatch

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.429 
in those especially in team deathmatch
as<00:01:35.220> well<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> keep<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.900> cover<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
as well you want to keep your cover and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.109 
as well you want to keep your cover and
remain<00:01:37.650> hidden<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> damage<00:01:38.700> drop-off

remain hidden and the damage drop-off

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.170 
remain hidden and the damage drop-off
isn't<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.600> much<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:40.049> long<00:01:40.200> distances<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
isn't that much at long distances on the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
isn't that much at long distances on the
secondary<00:01:42.180> right<00:01:42.540> now<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.840> would<00:01:43.409> say<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> best

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
secondary right now I would say the best

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.359 
secondary right now I would say the best
secondary<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.710> PDW<00:01:46.710> which<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.070> three

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

secondary is the PDW which is a three
round<00:01:47.549> burst<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.479> reminds<00:01:48.780> me<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> m-19<00:01:50.130> in

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.289 
round burst it reminds me of the m-19 in
modern<00:01:51.270> warfare<00:01:51.570> 2<00:01:52.009> which<00:01:53.009> was<00:01:53.189> really<00:01:53.549> really

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
modern warfare 2 which was really really

thing<00:02:26.069> about<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.400> objective<00:02:26.909> based<00:02:27.090> game

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
thing about the objective based game

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.740 
thing about the objective based game
modes<00:02:27.659> is<00:02:28.760> usually<00:02:29.760> near<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.030> objective<00:02:30.269> you

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
modes is usually near the objective you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.080 
modes is usually near the objective you
can<00:02:30.780> throw<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.109> see<00:02:31.439> some<00:02:31.799> c4<00:02:32.129> somewhere<00:02:32.849> and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
can throw a see some c4 somewhere and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.509 
can throw a see some c4 somewhere and
have<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.569> hidden<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.139> when<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.950> objective<00:02:35.099> is

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
have it hidden and when the objective is

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.220 
have it hidden and when the objective is
under<00:02:35.700> attack<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.299> just<00:02:36.450> explode<00:02:36.840> it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
under attack you can just explode it

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.589 
under attack you can just explode it
one<00:02:37.590> thing<00:02:37.799> about<00:02:38.069> color<00:02:38.370> teego's<00:02:38.819> is<00:02:39.120> nobody

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
one thing about color teego's is nobody

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.720 
one thing about color teego's is nobody
expects<00:02:40.109> that<00:02:40.290> from<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.590> c4<00:02:41.040> yet<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.459> nobody

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
expects that from the c4 yet so nobody

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.059 
expects that from the c4 yet so nobody
really<00:02:41.939> goes<00:02:42.120> looking<00:02:42.629> for<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.930> c4<00:02:43.439> so<00:02:43.889> my

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
really goes looking for a c4 so my

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.369 
really goes looking for a c4 so my
recommendation<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.819> to<00:02:45.030> hide<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.540> c4<00:02:46.109> near

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
recommendation is to hide the c4 near

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.289 
recommendation is to hide the c4 near
the<00:02:46.530> objective<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.310> just<00:02:47.609> blow<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:48.000> up<00:02:48.090> when

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
the objective and just blow it up when

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.240 
the objective and just blow it up when
you're<00:02:48.389> losing<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.900> tactical<00:02:49.799> I'll<00:02:49.919> just<00:02:50.129> go

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
you're losing it tactical I'll just go

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.830 
you're losing it tactical I'll just go

with the concussion I'm not too crazy on
anything<00:02:52.109> else<00:02:52.379> trophy<00:02:52.829> system<00:02:53.010> always<00:02:53.430> has

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
anything else trophy system always has

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.729

advantages<00:02:54.480> same<00:02:54.750> thing<00:02:54.900> with<00:02:55.019> motion<00:02:55.379> sensor

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
advantages same thing with motion sensor

you know how to use them really good I

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.339 
you know how to use them really good I
would<00:06:21.060> go<00:06:21.210> ahead<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.419> recommend<00:06:21.750> using<00:06:22.110> them

would go ahead and recommend using them

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.499

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:24.509 
but for the most part I only think my

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.330 
but for the most part I only think my
only<00:06:24.779> major<00:06:25.050> recommendation<00:06:25.919> would<00:06:26.069> have<00:06:26.219> to

only major recommendation would have to

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.670 
only major recommendation would have to
be<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.580> ak-12<00:06:27.169> right<00:06:28.169> and<00:06:28.349> I<00:06:28.409> think<00:06:28.620> the

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
be the ak-12 right and I think the

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.260 
be the ak-12 right and I think the
silencer<00:06:29.069> is<00:06:29.159> also<00:06:29.370> pretty<00:06:29.610> important<00:06:30.090> but<00:06:30.210> if

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
silencer is also pretty important but if

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.659 
silencer is also pretty important but if
you<00:06:30.360> don't<00:06:30.479> want<00:06:30.599> to<00:06:30.659> use<00:06:30.779> it<00:06:30.810> no<00:06:31.229> big<00:06:31.440> deal<00:06:31.680> um
