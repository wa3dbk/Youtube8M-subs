eh<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.750> become<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.260> popular<00:00:34.440> and

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
eh and become really popular and

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.580 
eh and become really popular and
drifting<00:00:35.130> among<00:00:35.910> program<00:00:36.540> kids<00:00:36.900> and<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.500> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
drifting among program kids and some of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
drifting among program kids and some of
the<00:00:37.680> bigger<00:00:37.860> teams<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.540> understand<00:00:39.540> their

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the bigger teams I understand their

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.880 
the bigger teams I understand their
effectiveness<00:00:40.050> but<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
effectiveness but I think it's kind of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.220 
effectiveness but I think it's kind of
boring<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.489> lot<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.850> cars<00:00:42.090> sound<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.809> same<00:00:42.960> now

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
boring a lot of cars sound the same now

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.189 
boring a lot of cars sound the same now
and<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.070> think<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:45.300> whatever<00:00:45.720> motor<00:00:46.050> you

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
and I think it in whatever motor you

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.509 
and I think it in whatever motor you
have<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.710> drive<00:00:47.040> you<00:00:47.309> should<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
have you have to drive you should be

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.490 
have you have to drive you should be
driving<00:00:47.699> far<00:00:48.090> 100%<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.080> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> lot<00:00:49.470> of

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
driving far 100% and I think a lot of

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.950 
driving far 100% and I think a lot of
these<00:00:49.650> guys<00:00:49.970> don't<00:00:50.970> drive<00:00:51.300> their<00:00:51.510> v8s<00:00:51.839> as

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
these guys don't drive their v8s as

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.549 
these guys don't drive their v8s as
gnarly<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.620> should

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
gnarly as they should

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.350 
gnarly as they should
there's<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.620> big<00:00:55.830> debate<00:00:55.949> about<00:00:56.400> v8s<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.269> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
there's a big debate about v8s in the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
there's a big debate about v8s in the
sport<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.750> drifting<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.710> definitely<00:00:59.370> feel<00:00:59.610> that

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
sport of drifting I definitely feel that

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.630 
sport of drifting I definitely feel that
they<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.150> home<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> place<00:01:01.079> here

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
they have a home and a place here

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
they have a home and a place here
reasons<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.119> I<00:01:03.360> was<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.839> first<00:01:04.049> person

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
reasons for that I was the first person

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.980 
reasons for that I was the first person
to<00:01:04.530> introduce<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.129> v8<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.060> domestic<00:01:06.600> vehicle

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
to introduce a v8 in a domestic vehicle

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.039 
to introduce a v8 in a domestic vehicle
the<00:01:07.080> Pontiac<00:01:07.500> GTO<00:01:07.729> back<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> 2004<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the Pontiac GTO back in 2004 the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.200 
the Pontiac GTO back in 2004 the
inaugural<00:01:10.470> year<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> Formula<00:01:11.310> Drift

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
inaugural year of Formula Drift

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
inaugural year of Formula Drift
and<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.140> was<00:01:13.350> based<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> fact

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
and that really was based on the fact

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.310 
and that really was based on the fact
that<00:01:14.760> there's<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.510> lot<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.689> clutch<00:01:16.020> keep

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that there's a lot of clutch keep

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
that there's a lot of clutch keep
kicking<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.040> keep<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> turbo<00:01:17.700> spools<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
kicking to keep the turbo spools the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
kicking to keep the turbo spools the
torque<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> displacement<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.220> v8

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
torque the displacement of the v8

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
torque the displacement of the v8
eliminates<00:01:21.090> all<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.510> makes<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
eliminates all of that makes you a

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
eliminates all of that makes you a
smoother<00:01:22.470> driver<00:01:22.740> makes<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> vehicle

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
smoother driver makes the vehicle

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:39.420 
smoother driver makes the vehicle
attitude<00:01:24.390> changes<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> lot<00:01:25.049> smoother<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.590> well

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:51.480 

I<00:01:48.990> come<00:01:49.990> from<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.500> background<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:51.220> four

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
I come from a background of four

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.550 
I come from a background of four
cylinders<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.150> V<00:01:52.300> sixes<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.110> that's<00:01:53.229> hype<00:01:53.410> of

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
cylinders and V sixes and that's hype of

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.920 
cylinders and V sixes and that's hype of
things<00:01:53.740> so<00:01:54.010> I'm<00:01:54.580> used<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:55.060> small<00:01:55.390> motor<00:01:55.600> with

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
things so I'm used to a small motor with

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.650 
things so I'm used to a small motor with
a<00:01:55.960> turbo<00:01:56.350> doing<00:01:56.620> all<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.830> work<00:01:57.040> versus<00:01:57.970> a<00:01:58.270> big

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
a turbo doing all the work versus a big

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.460 
a turbo doing all the work versus a big
motor<00:01:58.900> doing<00:01:59.410> a<00:01:59.680> little<00:02:00.220> work<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:01.360> I<00:02:01.810> kind<00:02:02.380> of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
motor doing a little work so I kind of

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.530 
motor doing a little work so I kind of
am<00:02:02.650> lucky<00:02:02.860> enough<00:02:02.979> now<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.400> be<00:02:03.670> at<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.210> best<00:02:04.390> of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
am lucky enough now to be at the best of

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.420 
am lucky enough now to be at the best of
both<00:02:04.690> worlds<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:05.229> have<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.470> v8<00:02:05.830> that's<00:02:06.010> also

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
both worlds I have a v8 that's also

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.570 
both worlds I have a v8 that's also
turbo<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:07.840> get<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.500> boost<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:09.009> get<00:02:09.280> all<00:02:09.399> that

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
turbo so I get the boost I get all that

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.949 
turbo so I get the boost I get all that
type<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:09.850> thing<00:02:09.970> with<00:02:10.240> the<00:02:10.330> top-end

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
type of thing with the top-end

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.110 
type of thing with the top-end
but<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.440> same<00:02:11.650> sense<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:12.250> have<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.730> low<00:02:12.880> end

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
but in the same sense I have the low end

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.470 
but in the same sense I have the low end
torque<00:02:13.360> from<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.230> v8<00:02:14.560> so<00:02:14.950> it's<00:02:15.910> it's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
torque from the v8 so it's it's

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.050 
torque from the v8 so it's it's
definitely<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:17.020> an<00:02:17.800> advantage<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.640> sense

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
definitely a an advantage in that sense

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.479 
definitely a an advantage in that sense
because<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:20.320> have<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:20.680> work<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.190> gives<00:02:21.310> you

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
because you have this work it gives you

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.729 
because you have this work it gives you
leeway<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.880> make<00:02:22.540> make<00:02:22.840> up<00:02:23.020> for<00:02:23.170> mistakes<00:02:23.530> and

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
leeway to make make up for mistakes and

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.280 
leeway to make make up for mistakes and
do<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.040> type<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.280> thing<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:26.170> a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
do that type of thing so it's it's a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.449 
do that type of thing so it's it's a
good<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.560> bad<00:02:26.680> thing<00:02:26.920> with<00:02:27.070> American

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
good and bad thing with American

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.160 
good and bad thing with American
drifting<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:27.970> know<00:02:28.060> I'd<00:02:28.330> like<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.690> see<00:02:28.840> people

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
drifting you know I'd like to see people

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.800 
drifting you know I'd like to see people
maybe<00:02:29.350> stray<00:02:30.250> away<00:02:30.400> from<00:02:30.820> everybody<00:02:31.390> doing<00:02:31.720> an

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
maybe stray away from everybody doing an

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.380 
maybe stray away from everybody doing an
LS<00:02:32.170> setup<00:02:32.560> or<00:02:32.770> something<00:02:32.800> like<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:33.850> in

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
LS setup or something like that but in

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.120 
LS setup or something like that but in
the<00:02:34.600> same<00:02:34.810> sense<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.350> know<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:35.680> good<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:35.980> see

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
the same sense you know it's good to see

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.110 
the same sense you know it's good to see
people<00:02:36.160> progressing<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.060> trying

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
people progressing and trying

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.330 
people progressing and trying
you<00:02:38.989> know<00:02:39.080> step<00:02:39.349> up<00:02:39.470> their<00:02:39.709> competitive

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
you know step up their competitive

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.509 
you know step up their competitive
levels<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:41.650> think<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:42.769> any<00:02:42.950> sport<00:02:43.250> there's<00:02:43.459> a

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
levels I think in any sport there's a

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.699 
levels I think in any sport there's a
progression<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.480> know<00:02:44.510> obviously<00:02:45.170> it's<00:02:45.530> it's

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
progression you know obviously it's it's

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.039 
progression you know obviously it's it's
not<00:02:45.950> going<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.310> be<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.760> biggest<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.629> baddest

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
not going to be the biggest and baddest

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.509 
not going to be the biggest and baddest
form<00:02:48.379> of<00:02:48.470> motorsports<00:02:48.890> right<00:02:49.099> away<00:02:49.310> there's

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
form of motorsports right away there's

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.520 
form of motorsports right away there's
gonna<00:02:49.610> be<00:02:49.760> that<00:02:49.879> natural<00:02:50.360> step<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.900> get<00:02:51.409> to

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
gonna be that natural step to get to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.229 
gonna be that natural step to get to
that<00:02:51.650> point<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.640> know<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.879> just<00:02:53.030> look<00:02:53.150> at

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
that point and you know you just look at

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.080 
that point and you know you just look at
the<00:02:53.330> evolutions<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.019> things<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:54.560> it's<00:02:54.680> just
