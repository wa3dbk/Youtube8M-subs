00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.419
 hello I'm under this time survival and 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.799
 in this video we are going to do some tests 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.800
 to the knight action 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.340
 archer 10 auto how it has been 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.340
 after being 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.759
 hello if it comes in this time it 's survival 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.050
 and in this video we're going to try the united 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.910
 archer 1 cv 2 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.650
 this case a flashlight that I carry two 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.990
 months with her 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.790
 I can assure you that it is very good 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.890
 I kept as I said in the 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.930
 pocket always all day and I never 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.580
 has failed now I have tried around here 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.320
 I'm going to put you in a cave 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.010
 here a picture of how it was after 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 to leave the cave 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.420
 He has had work and you can see that he was 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.420
 as new 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.660
 so we're not going to see a bit of the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.330
 characteristics that it has and then what 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.710
 we try so here we have it as 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:15.400
 always in your cardboard box with the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.820
 model name yesterday this sticker 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 and inside we have the next flashlight 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.030
 with a clip 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.680
 that the truth is pretty good and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.630
 It is very useful to carry it as it says 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.720
 It has the perfect size to carry it 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.960
 as it is to do 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.430
 to this foam rubber to protect it a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.840
 strap to hook on the part 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.840
 back in the holes it carries 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:48.170
 the instructions as always in English 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.719
 but good that the data come so 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.380
 The internal weight distance lighting 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.380
 all these little things 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.330
 and the spare parts that comes in 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.780
 two rubber bands 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.000
 so that no water comes in and a button 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.090
 spare part also if we close 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.880
 the lantern has 9.5 centimeters of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.810
 long two diameter controls and one 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:21.300
 weight of 52 grams and in the battery the led 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.730
 is a led that xp g2 with a maximum of 418 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.330
 lumens and a maximum distance 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.820
 158 meter lighting is quite 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.310
 good for the size of the body 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.840
 it's aeronautical aluminum that makes 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.910
 be very resistant to all kinds of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.489
 impacts but at the same time it gives you a 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.959
 extra lightness that is something very good for 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.739
 this type of flashlight that are made 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.830
 to make the df the pile is a cr 123a 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.570
 that this is an inconvenience because it is 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.580
 a normal battery that has been spent is 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.530
 rechargeable but in turn it is more difficult 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.770
 to find that a normal battery like 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.870
 a double to a triple to the flashlight 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.290
 It has five lighting modes 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.330
 to turn it on it has a back button and 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.370
 we already have on and then for 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.230
 change mode has this button 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.770
 front that makes it pretty 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.770
 comfortable 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:15.480
 We have seen this same system in the 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.770
 has 12 one back button to turn on 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.530
 and a forward one to move from one to the other 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.840
 in fact these lanterns are pretty 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.160
 comparable are very similar as you see 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.610
 the back parts 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.370
 they are practically identical thickness the 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.610
 diameter are quite similar 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.510
 the five modes of art the sun 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:45.080
 moonlight with 0 17 lumens that stack 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.959
 it will last us 168 hours later we have a 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.930
 seventeen lumens bass mode here the 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:55.940
 battery lasts 11 hours an average mode of 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.470
 71 lumens where the battery lasts three 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.010
 hours and a half more or less 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.380
 a high mode of 418 lumens you see that 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.590
 it's a big jump and where the stack 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.900
 It lasts 40 minutes later if we keep 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.740
 the tight front button happens to us 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.630
 strobe mode with 418 lumens and the 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.940
 pile will last us 50 minutes 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.150
 let's make the flower of resistance 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.970
 we started with the impact that says that 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.160
 Stamina up to two meters of good height 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.810
 you see that it is on two meters is 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.500
 more or less this earth pretty 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.500
 Let's go there 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.090
 keep cooking I'm going to throw it with the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.090
 button or down 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.699
 if it's working and now with the light 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.699
 down 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.620
 Well, nothing very good , you can see that 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.610
 operating modes 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.919
 two 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.110
 and second resistance test the 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.849
 water resistance that puts that 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.030
 bet up to one and a half meters 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.840
 depth we light 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.840
 and to the water 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:27.770
 well we have already left there for two 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.389
 pulling and changing minutes 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.020
 let's see if you have entered a bit of 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.020
 Water 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.070
 let's take it out a bit so it does not 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.820
 between water inside 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.820
 and we open it 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:46.540
 completely dry 

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:50.310
 You see, there's the rubber band in there 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.310
 and does not frost water 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:57.250
 so I do not expect the flashlight and the 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.500
 video you liked and nothing 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.070
 a greeting 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.070
 wrong 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:09.959
 no no
