 family or with your friends and these are 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.640
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 for this recipe 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:40.670
 and we're going to start putting the 6 cups 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:45.650
 of water and let's put a high fire 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.479
 we are going to add cinnamon this is 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.299
 to the taste of each person you can 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.729
 put as much as you want and if you do not 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.619
 Like you can not opt ​​for 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.380
 put a little vanilla if 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.289
 you like 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.700
 but let's leave like this and let's wait 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.500
 that the water starts to boil is going to put 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.560
 the rose 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.539
 although while the water is there 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.840
 heating up with cinnamon and all that 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.840
 I'm going to wash the rice 4x 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.740
 I'm doing this to the sea 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.660
 wash it four times the rice and treat 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:32.360
 to break it because the rice that I 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.880
 I'm occupying is not rice left 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.250
 in the arrocito but then between more 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.610
 Broken rice 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.430
 absorbs more this milk in the red and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.740
 quebraditas because the water is already 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.670
 wants to start boiling then now 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.670
 we are going to add the rice 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.689
 and now 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.400
 let's move a little bit and we're not going to 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.500
 touch the fire we are going to leave it so 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.519
 continue cooking while cooking 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.500
 that is consuming the water little by little 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.849
 although as you can see already the rice has 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.050
 consumed practically not all the water 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.690
 I hope 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.500
 you can see that I already expressed enough 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.300
 the bottom in which the rice was known and 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.950
 keep in mind that you have to be 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.680
 moving from time to time so you do not 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.500
 go hit down and do not go to 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.290
 make this capital- coffee we call it 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.270
 smoked and so does not taste good because it tastes 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.390
 a bit bitter that then while 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.190
 is boiling when we put it to cook 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.260
 we have to stay a moment 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.260
 when I'm going to add milk 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
 Y 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:04:01.110
 and right here I'm going to add the sugar 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:03.810
 I'm taking you 2% milk 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.800
 they can occupy whole milk the taste 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:10.800
 it definitely changes quite a bit from 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.750
 Milk milk either 1% past is 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.230
 different you will not see as creamy as 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.959
 with milk it will be like that 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.790
 as it is usually eaten, it saves us from the north 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.109
 you know it knows well we believe and all the 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.230
 flavor of rice pudding 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.870
 ok another thing before I forget 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.870
 the rice when I put the milk and 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.980
 It was a little soft now what 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.370
 I will do nothing else is to lower the fire 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.650
 well more or less 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.620
 and I'll let it continue to cook 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.190
 another little bit to consume a little bit of 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:50.700
 milk only for rice to absorb 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.500
 completely the taste of milk 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.470
 because I already said that dry rice 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.990
 society as for whoever is 20 minutes 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.110
 more or less over low heat is already the red 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:05.729
 It absorbed enough milk and is super 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:09.779
 super super wielder is ready 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:12.589
 now let's see the fire and it's 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:12.589
 ready for what
