00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.040

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.159

 pretty sad facial expression fine 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.890
 unfortunately the disco message 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.909
 So all in English and again 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.210

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.040
 not correct 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.710
 there are practically only 600 and they are 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.710

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.380

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:18.030
 no , they are just not around us 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.880

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.490

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.430
 played on it and the secret ones 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.050
 news to pick up or 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.670
 give a first good 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.610
 Great part already off so that you just 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.360
 do not discover any secrets 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.210
 could 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:45.900
 otherwise it's all pretty 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:50.180
 uninteresting yes that does not exist 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.640
 the exact same again accident damage 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:58.230
 is the secret message to next 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.130
 No different that is also the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.560
 same thing 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.290
 that does not exactly have 100 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.850
 percent identical reminds that there is 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.670
 only here should you really understand that 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.000
 not me I do not have 26 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.959
 come over each other where is actually 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.870
 the other here is the other super 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.209
 Well that's very disappointing 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.700
 People love people, I thought so 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.160
 soft spot is the new generation chichi 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.590
 often only better but in reality 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.270
 even worse I had that 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.709
 already predicted but oh yes so 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.800
 I sometimes look like that too when I am 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.670
 just do not unpack blindly so colorful 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.670
 until snappy
