00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.360
 the big one all the harder 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.840
 then of course 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.410
 only there with such star type 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.659
 a core is formed inside which is heavier 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.060
 as the last one 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.629
 critical boundary masses limit the matter yet 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.019
 can build against the tyranny of gravity 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.249
 this last limit is the limit 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.019
 are so three solar masses we are so so what exactly this way to this 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.389
 less two decimals Eich maybe also two commanders 

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:31.169
 maybe three point 1, it's about the size 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.550
 the one such ball 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.830
 Odin mass that may have such a ball 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.300
 when she gets bigger 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.300
 So if more mass is in it than three sun masses 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.650
 it is over 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.380
 then at the core of such a star a black hole is created 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.900
 and exactly that 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.900
 one actually suspects at Wolf Rallye Stern 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.930
 So again there is a final limit to the matter where you are going to 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.710
 the very last time against the tyranny of gravitation 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 these are quantum mechanical reasons 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.479
 «To lead again» «that matter is no longer below a certain 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.860
 Tightness can be compressed 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.240
 ultimately it works 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.990
 for the specialists on the screen 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.670
 Under the name Pauli principle, there are certain reasons for the matter itself 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.329
 to behavior and not otherwise 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.329
 because besides quantum mechanical particles 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.210
 just should not be in the same grant mechanical state 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.520
 but one always has to be variable in "at least one" state 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.000
 different from others one speaks of the Paulinchen double bed 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.100
 There can always be two people in this room, no more 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.679
 to be able to do so 1 as it is called beautiful 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.180
 to the from 1 am there open 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.430
 that works and that means that if matter in the EU own weight 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.090
 collapses 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.830
 thanks for waiting 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.240
 Just on a ten-kilometer ball a star compressed 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.610
 can be 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.850
 of three solar masses 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.290
 with that he becomes steps 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.460
 then matter has no chance to resist gravitation 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.690
 and the whole thing went 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.989
 and then arise inside such a star 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.339
 An Estella year is born 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.949
 black hole 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.279
 from the price and power 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:19.529
 3 times 13 9 km is said to be a black hole of about ten 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.829
 kilometre 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.229
 that is the scientifically interesting part 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:27.959
 how should I say nature is the philosophical explosive parts of the 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:28.549
 other 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.409
 namely, the whole part of Stands that has been pushed away because yes this 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.319
 He had Wolverine Stern long before he exploded as a supernova 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.109
 just described the creation of the black hole 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.300
 Our aim is this furious act of explosion 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.860
 but long before the exploded wolf was gone he has star for yes 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.390
 Year a significant portion of its higher authority in the dynamite 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.989
 returned 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.209
 Vodafone follows 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.099
 there are all here in the studio are cheap and they synonymous even the camera 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.049
 the 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.069
 this has been included in the current program 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.579
 all the heavy elements that are on this planet are from this one 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.529
 Huge Mater Circus and the Wolverine Stars are so to speak 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:12.089
 with the most efficient suppliers 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:16.049
 On the other hand, one has to say the entire star spectrum of ours 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.769
 Milky Way percent that's the wolf because the stones are so to speak the whole 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.959
 Big so the Big Boss is the very heavy stars and of those there is God 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.589
 Thank goodness not so much 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:25.840
 the explosions 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.390
 from such supernovae as they take place at Wolf Reilly Stern they exist 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.430
 Thank God not too often in our Milky Way certainly not in 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.360
 So close to our neighborhood was the earth never saw anything like that in their vicinity 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.609
 Solar system never experienced something like that in their vicinity 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.979
 and in the end, rally stars then actually form from a wolf 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.529
 possibly only left to small ball 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.679
 because the rest is gone the gas is from it 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:49.429
 and the career 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.479
 that Wolf Reilly Sterns is over but that's what everyone has said 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.639
 the best word that can be used to describe a career
