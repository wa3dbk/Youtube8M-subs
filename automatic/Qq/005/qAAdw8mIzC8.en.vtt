00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.050
 if the word labyrinth evokes a 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.000
 concrete architecture for the 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.340
 majority of us toss etymology 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.320
 remain the dark first two labyrinth 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.790
 thus characterized would be that that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 slabs built for the king minos 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.030
 in order to lock up the Minotaur in the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.559
 Greek mythological stories 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 but if the antiquity of architecture 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.520
 Labyrinth is no longer to prove 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.079
 other engraving and racy prehistoric 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.910
 reveals to us that man has since 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.219
 long a certain fascination for 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.170
 misplacement and disorientation sometimes 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.610
 main subject of artistic works there 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.980
 will often be used as a tool 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.600
 of inspiration or narration so if 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.190
 the literature will be able to retain 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 works like the divine comedy of dante 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.879
 or the name of umberto eco's pink it's 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.739
 through art like painting or 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.330
 the cinema that the labyrinth will form a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.280
 real visual identity 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.510
 the arrival of the video game will however give 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.340
 a new breath to the structures 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.720
 labyrinthine some will allow 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.729
 besides the players to find themselves 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.189
 in the very heart of a maze as it was 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.330
 the case for my players in 1973 but the 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.220
 technical constraints of the time 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.630
 suggests that the idea of â€‹â€‹the labyrinth 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.130
 was just a pretext for 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.810
 developers to create a strong place but 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.909
 two boxes where everything looks alike 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.680
 nevertheless the interest that the player carries 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.549
 to the exercise will bring forth a good number 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 similar games 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.049
 my game was born back to 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.579
 pass the maze's popularity 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.810
 but if the vision of labyrinths 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.030
 that maintain these games remain 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.650
 however academic others will dare 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.290
 to draw inspiration from more 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000
 original this will be the case in 1997 or 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.770
 final fantasy parties will offer players 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.270
 a vision of the maze that will not be 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.220
 without recalling the artists as 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.079
 mauritius corner 10 and dear where that of 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.840
 the film adaptation of the name of 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.579
 the 1986 rose the inspirations will be 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.079
 multiple for more and more games 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.909
 many but sometimes the support 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.040
 videogame will go further than the simple 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.750
 adaptation and will propose to the players of 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.520
 get lost either because of the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.810
 structure of the labyrinth itself but 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.409
 especially because of a game design 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.300
 research 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.580
 this will be the case two years later with 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.870
 final fantasy 8 here the labyrinth of 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.850
 we will have to explore will offer a 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.680
 architecture of the simplest is the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.540
 way the game presents it to us who 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.920
 will pose difficulties characters 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.600
 being always present and dodo 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.460
 when they cross the screens the 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.350
 player can no longer pinpoint associates 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.910
 will have to deduce its location in 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.410
 function of memorizing its 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.400
 own movements and not in function 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.080
 of his position 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.730
 the new rules of possibilities 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.320
 that allow the game design will open 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.610
 new labyrinth doors if 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.170
 as long as we define them as a 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.550
 where the orientation is 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.860
 difficult where he logical 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.390
 so this legend of zelda will democratize 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.160
 an original practice in the game 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.770
 ventured into saddle similar screens 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.300
 designed to disorient the player here this 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.680
 last tries to go in different 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.630
 directions and realizes that the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.040
 progression is impossible until he 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.720
 does not know the order in which the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.250
 explore a labyrinthine vision 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.080
 interesting for the player but also 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.209
 for the developer who extends 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.010
 so the duration of the game without having to create 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.690
 new environments glycated it 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 also suited to make a game of 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.440
 super mario platforms close to them 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.540
 being particularly generous in the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.459
 number of infinite corridor requiring 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.350
 know or understand the right path 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.540
 labyrinthine structure in itself 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.590
 blends perfectly with game concepts 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.480
 video game design 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.680
 and if a lot of games adopt it 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.540
 in one way or another 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.980
 some will soak up the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.970
 symbolic of the labyrinth that of his 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.739
 physical structure 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.780
 so if stanley kubrick but the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.800
 labyrinth at the center of his film shining 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.330
 it's not only in a way 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.430
 visual but also in its structure 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.140
 narrative the labyrinth then represents 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.459
 back and forth and the misguidance of 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.750
 characters a vision that one 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.760
 will find in particular to make a 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.380
 castlevania or the hero will have to get lost 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.150
 in a labyrinthine castle so 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.470
 to move forward in history then these are 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.120
 the comings and goings that will bring the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.220
 scenario to unravel as is the case 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.230
 in many rpg or adventurous game 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.269
 nevertheless some games will try to 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.709
 to draw inspiration from older symbolism 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.570
 related to the labyrinth myth 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.340
 because if that final fantasy quickly done 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.019
 reference to the myth of the minotaur the idea 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.519
 fear and anxiety that it generates 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.260
 will be more easily 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.209
 other games this is the case of resident 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.980
 evil 4 where the hero sees himself immersed in 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.989
 a garden maze the player having 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.950
 available a map go astray becomes 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.420
 then impossible 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.489
 the important thing is not the orientation 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.690
 but the fear engendered by the noises 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.700
 caused by the monsters and their 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.410
 sudden appearance here the labyrinth 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.660
 scares because it restricts the vision of 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.920
 Thu 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.080
 gold which then develops a form 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.910
 of anguished obvious finally he would 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.170
 obvious to put forward the family of 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.850
 kate whether it's personal or 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.590
 heroics that represents the labyrinth 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.510
 but even more so it's the triumph of the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.980
 trick represented by the breadcrumb where 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.480
 the pebbles of the petit poucet that we 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.890
 will find in the majority of 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.140
 labyrinths of video games the player 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.880
 lost will have to find its way thanks to 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.350
 his deduction and his intelligence in 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.090
 obeying established rules 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.920
 and if the labyrinth has always had a 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.750
 some success with artists and 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.190
 curious is the video game that will have 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.230
 allowed better than any other 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.210
 support to feel the immersion see the 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.830
 anguish of detours and impasses if 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.720
 often described in many 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.190
 video game works was inspired by 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.230
 labyrinths and their ism symbols 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.090
 but he would not be wrong to judge 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.980
 that they used the video game 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.990
 to be reborn and that if he had never 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.500
 existed is surely the video game he 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.500
 would be born 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.630
