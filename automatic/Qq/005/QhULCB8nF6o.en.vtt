00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:47.160

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.640
 stark naked what some of the black 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.290
 Buildings native guide 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.189
 tourist attractions can hold that 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.310
 I understand 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.439
 do not let her fingers off that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.860
 our collars a wonderful 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.020
 creature 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.820
 i am interested in his book man 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.630
 everything on it 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.630
 wonderful experience 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:43.369
 we are in america here are in puerto 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:45.350
 rico a south america and a small one 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.950
 bet that they translucent front of me going on and 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.950

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.100
 I have her alive 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:28.940
 that you do it differently diary morina 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.380
 the amneris from the year 2011 120 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.820
 minutes and here plays johnny depp 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.530
 a man named paul kemp the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.630
 writer is the drunk one 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.770
 the unsuccessful is finally but once 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.060
 wants to earn money and therefore as 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.920
 Journalist hiring a newspaper 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.570
 and not just in the US but 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.990
 a beautiful place namely in 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.850
 puerto rico and that's 159 today 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.780
 So we have a nice time in 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.400
 the whole one played one 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.110
 wonderful place and the whole movie is 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.150
 elated by the atmosphere of love 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.500
 air land and people and that is really 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 Great there you can get the whole two 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.120
 hours to look around is cool 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.770
 here only the story alone 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.270
 is a little weak though the whole 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.040
 a novel adaptation would have to because 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.750
 not quite by itself somehow 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.830
 the script was created but here 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.080
 Actually, it does not exist right now 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.580
 unsuccessful book as a template but so 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.870
 the story really does not want to work 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.670
 because the writer is here in 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.140
 the main role is just drunk 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.970
 and hires as a journalist at said 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.130
 newspaper at the turn is now more of a 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.260
 step remains successful but he 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.270
 encounters a story around a tree 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.920
 mogul and my husband the illegal 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.290
 He handles his own business 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.000
 could benefit greatly or but 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.290
 for the justice decides and 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.640
 what is really the case now 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.440
 I do not anticipate on the spot 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.090
 But this is the main square 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.280
 peppered with a wonderful 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.440
 beauty played by amber heard the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.360
 Halo is a young boy in her role 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.590
 Woman forgive but ours is ours 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.110
 currently not just the fingers 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.910
 can let and actually has 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.320
 johnny depp with her one of the song the 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.970
 Shooting started after he was straight 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.560
 in the wet paradise had left 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.330
 whole maybe as a small gossip info 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.190
 here on they way, is the rand 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.930
 interested in sexual appointment I wanted 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.700
 still have said and that is 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.050
 The problem of Randa rehab about the 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.340
 Hauptplatz a little bit around this 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.470
 writer slash author 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.850
 slash journalists tells but 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.590
 The movie loses itself in so many 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.850
 small facets all around 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.500
 nice that we said the ambiente 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.900
 and the atmosphere and the time is great 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.610
 but that is over two hours very much 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.860
 very lengthy so that you ask yourself 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.419
 what the movie is still going on and that 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.970
 is a great pity and just something 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.500
 Therefore, Johnny Depp As with 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.610
 eberhard and eric gave him this 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.620
 dodgy is a 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.780
 a good trio gives one 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.939
 great scenery if the three together 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.560
 turn up 1000 game can deliver 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.150
 they seem a little underchallenged and 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.469
 not so well done that 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.729
 It is a great pity because you can tell 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.500
 film right to the potential 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.539
 is wasted and therefore is the 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.129
 movie really not worth a visit 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.240
 in my opinion and now 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.919
 maybe in the rental the right one 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.870
 I would buy him a decision 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.520
 not by the way, in the morning in the 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.289
 Raffle you can have the chance there 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.060
 one or the other copy for free 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.590
 dust off that as a little info for you 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.240
 and that's why restaurant diary 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.800
 dangerous gray zone with a lot 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.120
 potential what is lost because of that 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.639
 expectations downscale even if 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.650
 johnny depp it is it is a pity 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.810
 it is a pity that then have to see it that way 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.430
 but who the 60s or outgoing 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.349
 50s lives can be really fun here 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.819
 I still want to have that feeling 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.310
 once the film music underline 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.060
 is very interesting so all around 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.529
 is beautiful 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.150
 the core unfortunately too weak and so 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.860
 he gets around diary of them by the way 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.550
 damn hard job for me 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.349
 can be assigned 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.610
 he has such a dramatic element is one 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.919
 argue funny has almost 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.610
 satirical facets it's hard that 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.560
 here exactly and that 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.389
 exactly in words therefore today 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.400
 again jean rating gets freed 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.349
 the film of me altogether acceptable 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.360
 five out of ten possible points, the 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:35.430
 hardly anybody else is enough these days 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.810
 to attract attention 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.159
 Your opinion of the film you have 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.349
 seen in the cinema or you already 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.849
 borrowed and covers that 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:43.889
 I'm interested in my evaluation 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.240
 me what you say and think about it 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.099
 otherwise I would go for one 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.479
 wonderful day tomorrow is there in 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.919
