mentioned and you know the big thing

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.139 
mentioned and you know the big thing
here<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> ability<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.700> sort<00:00:39.030> by

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
here is now the ability to sort by

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
here is now the ability to sort by
content<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.649> always<00:00:40.770> perfect<00:00:41.010> but

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
content and it's not always perfect but

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.100 
content and it's not always perfect but
if<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.090> want<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.570> click<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
if you if you want you just click in the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.750 
if you if you want you just click in the
top<00:00:43.290> left<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> ability<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
top left and you have the ability to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.380 
top left and you have the ability to
jump<00:00:45.059> between<00:00:45.180> articles<00:00:45.690> video<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.350> images

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
jump between articles video and images

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
jump between articles video and images
so<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.510> video<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.110> should<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.680> pulling<00:00:50.010> in

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so with video it should be pulling in

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.670 
so with video it should be pulling in
YouTube<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.940> Vimeo<00:00:51.510> links<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.559> you've

YouTube and Vimeo links that you've

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
YouTube and Vimeo links that you've
saved<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.340> it'll<00:00:54.120> pop<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.539> player

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
saved and it'll pop up a player

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.299 
saved and it'll pop up a player
unfortunately<00:00:55.739> doesn't<00:00:55.860> always<00:00:56.039> work<00:00:56.280> right

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
unfortunately doesn't always work right

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.369 
unfortunately doesn't always work right
so<00:00:56.760> there's<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> lot<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> things<00:00:57.420> here<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.109> I

we<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.830> don't<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> same

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
we just don't it's it's not the same

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.899 
we just don't it's it's not the same
thing<00:01:22.080> as<00:01:22.200> saving<00:01:22.560> video<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.220> text<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.790> read

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
thing as saving video or text to read

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.990 
thing as saving video or text to read
later<00:01:24.170> but<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.470> know<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.070> load<00:01:26.340> images

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000

Instapaper<00:04:03.919> readability

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
Instapaper readability

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.670

to save articles especially to only read

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.740 
to save articles especially to only read
text<00:04:07.069> it's<00:04:07.669> probably<00:04:07.940> not<00:04:08.120> worth<00:04:08.329> making<00:04:08.629> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
text it's probably not worth making the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.420 
text it's probably not worth making the
upgrade<00:04:09.139> you<00:04:09.410> know<00:04:09.949> the<00:04:10.069> nice<00:04:10.220> thing<00:04:10.370> with

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
upgrade you know the nice thing with

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.009 
upgrade you know the nice thing with
pocket<00:04:10.790> though<00:04:10.940> is<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.449> is<00:04:11.599> starting<00:04:11.959> to

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
pocket though is that it is starting to

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.110 
pocket though is that it is starting to
expand<00:04:12.349> out<00:04:12.530> beyond<00:04:12.859> just<00:04:13.400> text<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.030> you

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
expand out beyond just text and so you

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.629 
expand out beyond just text and so you
can<00:04:14.239> save<00:04:14.449> video<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:15.019> images<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.650> so<00:04:16.190> you

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
can save video and images and so you

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.969 
can save video and images and so you
know<00:04:16.729> if<00:04:16.940> you<00:04:17.090> really<00:04:17.989> see<00:04:18.109> yourself<00:04:18.199> watching

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
know if you really see yourself watching

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.650 
know if you really see yourself watching
a<00:04:19.190> lot<00:04:19.340> more<00:04:19.489> video<00:04:19.760> then<00:04:20.209> it's<00:04:20.359> probably

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
a lot more video then it's probably

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.100 
a lot more video then it's probably
worth<00:04:20.750> considering<00:04:21.409> a<00:04:21.469> switch

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.680
