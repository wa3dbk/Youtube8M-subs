00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.680
Summer in New York can be really hot and really
humid and you spent a

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.850
lot of time outdoors.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.610
There's this instinct to just wear jeans and
a

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.369
tank top every single day, but that's not
fun if you want to have a

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.170
little bit more playfulness to your style
or be a little more creative.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.790
There's a few things you can do to make it
a little easier to spice up

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.180
your summer style without wearing the same
thing over and over again.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.150
So, you're really hot and you want to wear
as little clothing as

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.150
possible.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.050
An easy way to do that without looking like
you're wearing

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.820
jeans and a tank top to the office is a sheer
blouse or something that's

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.870
a lighter loose material that's really, really
breathable.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.519
There's so
many out there right now in different prints

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.149
and different patterns and
bright colors that if you wear that with some

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.129
nice loose slacks or even
a cropped, high-waisted skirt.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.289
That's a really easy way to look
professional, to look creative and interesting

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.129
and not look like you're
too hot or uncomfortable.

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.530
Another thing is your footwear.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.500
You want to
try and avoid wearing flip flops in the city.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.530
It really doesn't look
good and it doesn't feel good because it's

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.650
not a clean city.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.000
Wear some
flats or wear some really nice sandals.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.150
There's, again, so many options
and bright colors and with different hardware.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.970
Maybe a pair of brown
ones that are a little more classic for work

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.939
and maybe on the weekends
or evenings a bright yellow pair or a bright

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.240
green pair.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.940
That's another
way to take a simple dress and wear some cool

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.250
sandals or some bright
colored footwear.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.090
That's really going to spice up that outfit.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.649
Another
thing to keep in mind is sunglasses and jewelry

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.770
and all those cheap
accessories that you can cycle in and out

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.719
during the summer.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.420
Use a
simple dress or simple uniform and then cycle

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.649
those accessories in.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.920
I
love taking a simple breathable dress and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.110
wearing it a few different
ways, even if I wear it multiple times a week.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.049
You can belt it higher
or lower or you can wear it with a different

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.570
pair of shoes, big earrings
or a bright bag.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.740
The best thing to do is get a dress that's
really

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.750
comfortable and that is very simple in a neutral
color, something like a

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.440
camel or a white, or a pale green, whatever
your favorite color is, but

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.660
something that you can really play with.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.940
That's another way to beat the
heat but without looking like you're wearing

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.160
the same thing over and
over again.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160
?
