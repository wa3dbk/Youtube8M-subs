it's<00:01:44.610> got<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> walkway<00:01:45.390> under<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.840> which

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
it's got the walkway under there which

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.830 
it's got the walkway under there which
is<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.350> map<00:01:46.530> got<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> big<00:01:47.450> box<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.689> which

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
is on the map got a big box here which

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.350 
is on the map got a big box here which
was<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> believe<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.590> car<00:01:50.070> actually<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:51.240> can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
was I believe a car actually you can

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.870 
was I believe a car actually you can
actually<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.750> through<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.500> as<00:01:52.770> well<00:01:53.070> yeah<00:01:53.610> go

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
actually go through here as well yeah go

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.020 
actually go through here as well yeah go
through<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.450> as<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.680> literally<00:01:56.340> it's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
through here as like literally it's

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.590 
through here as like literally it's
almost<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.750> one-to-one<00:01:58.670> recreation<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
almost a one-to-one recreation of the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.580 
almost a one-to-one recreation of the
map<00:02:01.110> rust<00:02:01.530> from<00:02:02.250> modern<00:02:02.610> warfare<00:02:02.820> 2<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.689> like

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
map rust from modern warfare 2 but like

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.990 
map rust from modern warfare 2 but like
you<00:02:04.860> got<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.100> think<00:02:05.219> about<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.549> for<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.759> second

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you got to think about this for a second

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.190 
you got to think about this for a second
you<00:02:06.060> got<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.240> think<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.689> for<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.869> second

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you got to think about it for a second

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.580 
you got to think about it for a second
so<00:02:07.320> initial<00:02:08.250> thoughts<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.819> oh<00:02:09.319> does<00:02:10.319> this

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so initial thoughts be like oh does this

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890 
so initial thoughts be like oh does this
mean<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.640> will<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.910> getting<00:02:12.150> rust

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
mean that we will be getting rust

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.179 
mean that we will be getting rust
some<00:02:13.019> point<00:02:13.290> for<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> near<00:02:13.680> future<00:02:13.980> for

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
some point for the near future for

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.000 
some point for the near future for
advanced<00:02:14.640> warfare<00:02:14.930> why<00:02:15.930> am<00:02:16.290> i<00:02:16.379> teasing<00:02:16.890> this

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
advanced warfare why am i teasing this

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.399 
advanced warfare why am i teasing this
to<00:02:17.280> us<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.510> meant<00:02:18.689> to<00:02:18.900> me

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
to us what is it meant to me

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.390 
to us what is it meant to me
oh<00:02:20.030> maybe<00:02:21.030> they<00:02:21.420> were<00:02:21.480> just<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.400> honestly

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
oh maybe they were just like I honestly

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.030 
oh maybe they were just like I honestly
like<00:02:23.610> they<00:02:24.450> have<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.230> spend<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.680> decent<00:02:25.980> amount

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
like they have to spend a decent amount

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.559 
like they have to spend a decent amount
of<00:02:26.220> time<00:02:26.430> putting<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.879> together<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.510> not

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
of time putting this together it's not

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.660 
of time putting this together it's not
even<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.200> freaking<00:02:28.890> map<00:02:29.189> so<00:02:29.430> I'm<00:02:29.519> not

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
even in the freaking map so I'm not

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.009 
even in the freaking map so I'm not
really<00:02:29.760> sure<00:02:29.939> what<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.299> make<00:02:30.329> of<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.930> be

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
really sure what to make of it to be

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.649 
really sure what to make of it to be
honest<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:31.769> I<00:02:31.829> would<00:02:32.640> say<00:02:32.879> if<00:02:33.180> you<00:02:33.450> think

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
honest but I would say if you think

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.030 
honest but I would say if you think
about<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.930> map<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.349> you<00:02:34.379> haven't<00:02:34.709> played<00:02:34.890> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
about this map if you haven't played it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.670 
about this map if you haven't played it
it<00:02:35.129> is<00:02:35.220> extremely<00:02:36.030> extremely<00:02:36.209> small<00:02:36.720> think

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
it is extremely extremely small think

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.280 
it is extremely extremely small think
about<00:02:37.950> being<00:02:38.220> here<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:39.090> standing<00:02:39.900> there<00:02:40.079> on

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
about being here and standing there on

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.789 
about being here and standing there on
the<00:02:40.409> map

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
the map

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.770 
the map
and<00:02:40.890> trying<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.310> shoot<00:02:41.459> someone<00:02:41.879> like<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.420> know

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
and trying to shoot someone like I know

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.199 
and trying to shoot someone like I know
over<00:02:43.200> there<00:02:43.470> own<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.129> typical<00:02:44.670> cool<00:02:44.849> producer

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
over there own a typical cool producer

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.149 
over there own a typical cool producer
game<00:02:45.329> like<00:02:45.540> modern<00:02:45.840> warfare<00:02:45.870> 2<00:02:46.260> you're<00:02:47.069> gonna

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
game like modern warfare 2 you're gonna

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.949 
game like modern warfare 2 you're gonna
have<00:02:47.370> cover<00:02:47.819> you're<00:02:48.090> gonna<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.359> ducking<00:02:48.810> back

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
have cover you're gonna be ducking back

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.149 
have cover you're gonna be ducking back
and<00:02:49.170> forth<00:02:49.409> you<00:02:49.620> know<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:49.799> not<00:02:49.889> going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.099> be

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
and forth you know it's not going to be

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.649 
and forth you know it's not going to be
necessarily<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.579> straight-up<00:02:50.879> gunfight

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
necessarily a straight-up gunfight

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.569 
necessarily a straight-up gunfight
advanced<00:02:52.200> warfare<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.799> just<00:02:52.980> double<00:02:53.250> jump<00:02:53.459> in

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
advanced warfare you just double jump in

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.949 
advanced warfare you just double jump in
the<00:02:53.670> air<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.060> once<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.389> double<00:02:54.569> jumped<00:02:54.870> in

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
the air and once you double jumped in

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.240 
the air and once you double jumped in
yeah<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.349> pretty<00:02:55.470> much<00:02:55.530> look<00:02:55.859> over<00:02:56.159> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
yeah you can pretty much look over the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.009 
yeah you can pretty much look over the
whole<00:02:56.400> map<00:02:56.760> I<00:02:57.000> don't<00:02:57.569> think<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.989> very

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
whole map I don't think it's a very

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.050 
whole map I don't think it's a very
advanced<00:02:58.680> warfare<00:02:59.099> friendly<00:02:59.579> map<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.000> be

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
advanced warfare friendly map to be

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.569 
advanced warfare friendly map to be
honest<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.680> honestly<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.950> they<00:03:02.099> were<00:03:02.159> gonna

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
honest and honestly if they were gonna

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.610 
honest and honestly if they were gonna
make<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.970> full<00:03:03.209> multiplayer<00:03:03.780> map<00:03:04.019> they

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
make it a full multiplayer map they

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.530 
make it a full multiplayer map they
wouldn't<00:03:05.010> really<00:03:05.129> go<00:03:05.400> ahead<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:05.970> tease<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.420> or

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
wouldn't really go ahead and tease it or

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.559 
wouldn't really go ahead and tease it or
builder<00:03:06.989> sort<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.290> fun<00:03:07.650> version<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:09.209> an

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
builder sort of fun version of it in an

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.030 
builder sort of fun version of it in an
earlier<00:03:09.750> field<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.409> map<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.739> like

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
earlier field of the map like like

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.069 
earlier field of the map like like
compound<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.730> then<00:03:12.269> decide<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.870> go<00:03:12.989> and

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
compound and then decide to go and

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.170 
compound and then decide to go and
release<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.590> don't<00:03:14.069> think<00:03:14.189> I<00:03:14.579> think<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:15.060> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
release it I don't think I think this is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.229 
release it I don't think I think this is
just<00:03:15.269> more<00:03:15.629> of<00:03:15.689> literally<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.919> fun<00:03:17.639> Easter<00:03:17.910> Egg

really<00:03:22.199> happy<00:03:22.560> about<00:03:22.590> this<00:03:22.859> but<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.069> just<00:03:23.430> I

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
really happy about this but I just I

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.460 
really happy about this but I just I
don't<00:03:23.879> think<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:24.510> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.840> be<00:03:24.989> added<00:03:25.260> into

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
don't think it's going to be added into

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.860 
don't think it's going to be added into
advanced<00:03:25.829> warfare<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.699> think<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.449> developers

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
advanced warfare I think the developers

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.240 
advanced warfare I think the developers
has<00:03:28.019> had<00:03:28.169> a<00:03:28.199> little<00:03:28.409> bit<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.590> fun<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:28.949> wanted

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
has had a little bit of fun and wanted

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.409 
has had a little bit of fun and wanted
to<00:03:29.280> throw<00:03:29.489> it<00:03:29.639> in<00:03:29.760> there<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.030> mean<00:03:30.150> I'm<00:03:30.239> not

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
to throw it in there I mean I'm not

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.449 
to throw it in there I mean I'm not
ruling<00:03:30.659> out<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.959> option<00:03:31.500> at<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.980> not<00:03:32.250> ruling

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
ruling out the option at all not ruling

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.369 
ruling out the option at all not ruling
out<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.790> option<00:03:33.090> at<00:03:33.209> all<00:03:33.359> but<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.019> don't<00:03:34.290> think

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
out the option at all but I don't think

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.800 
out the option at all but I don't think
is<00:03:34.500> gonna<00:03:34.560> happen<00:03:34.799> however<00:03:35.480> within<00:03:36.480> nolot

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
is gonna happen however within nolot

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.089 
is gonna happen however within nolot
pretty<00:03:37.109> much<00:03:37.199> all<00:03:37.409> of<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.620> previous<00:03:37.919> Call<00:03:38.069> of

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
pretty much all of the previous Call of

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.030 
pretty much all of the previous Call of
Duty<00:03:38.340> games<00:03:38.579> we<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:38.879> had<00:03:39.150> Maps<00:03:39.629> return<00:03:40.139> maybe

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
Duty games we have had Maps return maybe

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.119 
Duty games we have had Maps return maybe
just<00:03:41.909> maybe<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.540> could<00:03:42.989> return<00:03:43.139> in<00:03:43.650> black<00:03:43.889> ops

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
just maybe it could return in black ops

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.420 
just maybe it could return in black ops
3<00:03:44.329> but<00:03:45.329> then<00:03:45.479> again<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:46.139> still<00:03:46.440> have<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.159> new

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
3 but then again you still have the new

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.610 
3 but then again you still have the new
boost<00:03:47.819> ability<00:03:48.359> you<00:03:49.169> could<00:03:49.260> over<00:03:49.500> new

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
boost ability you could over new

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.379 
boost ability you could over new
movement<00:03:50.010> abilities<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.699> maybe<00:03:50.909> again<00:03:51.239> it

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
movement abilities so maybe again it

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:52.909 
movement abilities so maybe again it
won't<00:03:51.540> even<00:03:51.750> work<00:03:51.900> too<00:03:52.199> well<00:03:52.319> in<00:03:52.470> black<00:03:52.590> ops<00:03:52.829> 3

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
won't even work too well in black ops 3

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.399 
won't even work too well in black ops 3
maybe<00:03:53.699> we'll<00:03:53.940> never<00:03:54.090> see<00:03:54.359> rust<00:03:54.750> return<00:03:55.139> within

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:55.409 
maybe we'll never see rust return within

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.409 
maybe we'll never see rust return within
a<00:03:55.530> Call<00:03:55.709> of<00:03:55.739> Duty<00:03:56.159> I<00:03:56.370> don't<00:03:56.940> know<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.299> is

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
little Easter Egg I thought it was

little Easter Egg I thought it was
really<00:04:18.810> cool<00:04:19.049> brings<00:04:19.409> up<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.620> lot<00:04:19.739> of

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
really cool brings up a lot of

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.250 
really cool brings up a lot of
speculation<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:21.479> think<00:04:21.719> honestly<00:04:22.079> that

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
speculation and I think honestly that

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.930 
speculation and I think honestly that
this<00:04:22.469> is<00:04:22.620> if<00:04:22.740> done<00:04:22.889> a<00:04:22.919> good<00:04:23.159> job<00:04:23.219> building<00:04:23.700> it

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
this is if done a good job building it

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.790 
this is if done a good job building it
into<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.389> outside<00:04:24.779> of<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.139> mat<00:04:25.320> hopefully
