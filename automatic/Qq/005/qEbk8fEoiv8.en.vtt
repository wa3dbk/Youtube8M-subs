00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.430 
and it was such a pain in the ass when
we<00:02:29.450> were<00:02:29.569> testing<00:02:30.020> it<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.230> ratchet

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
we were testing it on ratchet

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.380 
we were testing it on ratchet
I<00:02:31.470> think<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.610> stopped<00:02:32.940> doing<00:02:33.150> it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
I think that we stopped doing it

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.540 
I think that we stopped doing it
entirely<00:02:33.770> so<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:34.860> your<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.130> anyone<00:02:35.430> was

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
entirely so if your if anyone was

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.760 
entirely so if your if anyone was
wondering<00:02:35.940> why<00:02:36.120> there<00:02:37.080> are<00:02:37.200> different<00:02:37.560> themes

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
wondering why there are different themes

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.320 
wondering why there are different themes
for<00:02:38.130> different<00:02:38.400> segments<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.880> ratchet<00:02:39.030> one

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
for different segments and ratchet one

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.410 
for different segments and ratchet one
and<00:02:39.540> not<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.900> later<00:02:40.110> games<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.120> for<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
and not in later games you know for the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.040 
and not in later games you know for the
most<00:02:42.600> part<00:02:43.820> that's<00:02:44.820> why<00:02:45.090> it's<00:02:45.510> cuz<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.900> was<00:02:46.020> a

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
most part that's why it's cuz it was a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.460 
most part that's why it's cuz it was a
huge<00:02:46.350> pain<00:02:46.530> in<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.710> ass<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.100> say<00:02:47.280> yeah

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
huge pain in the ass to say yeah

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.980 

beyond<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.160> though<00:02:50.460> I<00:02:50.490> don't<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.510> mean<00:02:51.900> we

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
beyond that though I don't I I mean we

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.080 
beyond that though I don't I I mean we
didn't<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.290> music<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.710> house<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.850> was<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
didn't do music in house it was the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.050 
didn't do music in house it was the
thing<00:02:54.390> we<00:02:54.540> farmed<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.020> out<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> composer

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
thing we farmed it out to a composer

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.020 
thing we farmed it out to a composer
right<00:02:57.060> David<00:02:57.750> Burge<00:02:57.960> oh<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> think<00:02:58.410> he's<00:02:58.680> yeah

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
right David Burge oh I think he's yeah

right David Burge oh I think he's yeah
hopefully<00:03:00.030> I'm<00:03:00.150> pronouncing<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.690> correctly

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
hopefully I'm pronouncing that correctly

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.330 
hopefully I'm pronouncing that correctly

games because the whole point of the

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.430 
games because the whole point of the
games<00:05:04.590> was<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:04.920> sell<00:05:05.570> hardware<00:05:06.570> right<00:05:07.050> Sony<00:05:07.320> is

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
games was to sell hardware right Sony is

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.610 
games was to sell hardware right Sony is
a<00:05:07.530> hardware<00:05:07.800> company<00:05:09.170> so<00:05:10.170> they<00:05:10.290> didn't<00:05:10.530> do<00:05:10.590> a

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
a hardware company so they didn't do a

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.990 
a hardware company so they didn't do a
lot<00:05:10.830> of<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.040> kind<00:05:11.220> of<00:05:11.310> making<00:05:11.610> money<00:05:11.790> off<00:05:11.970> of

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
lot of the kind of making money off of

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.830 
lot of the kind of making money off of
the<00:05:12.270> side

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
the side

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.000 
the side
things<00:05:13.800> like<00:05:14.040> soundtracks<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.820> all<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.090> so

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
things like soundtracks and all that so

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.900 
things like soundtracks and all that so
if<00:05:17.010> anything<00:05:17.340> it's<00:05:17.850> probably<00:05:18.390> just<00:05:18.690> sort<00:05:19.290> of<00:05:19.350> a

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
if anything it's probably just sort of a

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.580 
if anything it's probably just sort of a
you<00:05:20.910> know<00:05:21.000> what<00:05:21.240> what<00:05:21.690> Sony's<00:05:22.110> corporate

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
you know what what Sony's corporate

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.110 
you know what what Sony's corporate
stance<00:05:22.830> on<00:05:23.040> soundtracks<00:05:23.490> were<00:05:23.580> back<00:05:23.820> then<00:05:24.030> I

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
stance on soundtracks were back then I

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.230 
stance on soundtracks were back then I
think<00:05:24.330> because<00:05:25.290> we<00:05:25.470> all<00:05:25.590> wanted<00:05:25.920> one<00:05:26.100> I<00:05:26.850> I

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
think because we all wanted one I I

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.910 
think because we all wanted one I I
remember<00:05:27.510> we<00:05:27.960> asked<00:05:28.290> for<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:28.560> a<00:05:28.620> number<00:05:28.860> of

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
remember we asked for it a number of

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.400 
remember we asked for it a number of
times<00:05:29.160> so<00:05:29.580> it's<00:05:30.180> not<00:05:30.390> like<00:05:30.630> it<00:05:30.780> was<00:05:30.870> impossible

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
times so it's not like it was impossible

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.650 
times so it's not like it was impossible
or<00:05:31.560> anything<00:05:31.710> it's<00:05:32.400> just<00:05:32.520> they<00:05:33.090> did<00:05:33.270> you<00:05:33.540> know

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
or anything it's just they did you know

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.110 
or anything it's just they did you know
well<00:05:34.470> there<00:05:34.620> was<00:05:34.740> a<00:05:34.770> sighted<00:05:35.280> lot<00:05:35.460> going<00:05:35.970> on
