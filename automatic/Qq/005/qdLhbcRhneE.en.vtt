00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.940
 it's an order that I made to Miami and it's 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:19.060
 for you to decide are a few things 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.400
 so we decided these comments what 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.420
 is what you want me to upload before I go 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.520
 to teach the things that you caught 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.100
 as you can see this that always comes 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.400
 in each box that of the shipments that you 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.400
 send 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.280
 here 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:43.930
 well we started first here what 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.850
 we have are covers for letters of 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.880
 educate I picked up two packages because 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.150
 as they are 32 covers for a teacher 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.400
 well until this 60 so you can not 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.860
 be alone with a text I do not think that the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.930
 opening unless you ask me to but 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.280
 I see it a little silly 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.460
 I leave you here the following is this one 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.120
 box of 20 envelopes with 5 cards each 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.780

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.509

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.899
 this time since I have more things the 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.610
 it divides only into two parts so yes that 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.969
 I exist to say of the comments left 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.969
 here too 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.820
 then this is another thing a box of 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.490

 an exactly at home but a deck and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.180
 when we open it, it explains what it is 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.700
 exactly 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.820
 As you can see here, it has an Alex look and a 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.960
 megabyte álex and the truth is that it aims 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.960
 enough way is this 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.490

 parts here the m 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.250
