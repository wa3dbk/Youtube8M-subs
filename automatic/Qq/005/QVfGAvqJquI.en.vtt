and now you guys turn this on so I'm
gonna<00:04:02.730> slide<00:04:03.210> this<00:04:03.390> over<00:04:03.600> and<00:04:04.080> it's<00:04:04.500> working

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.020 

and<00:04:07.830> it's<00:04:08.280> telling<00:04:08.580> me<00:04:08.640> that<00:04:08.700> there's<00:04:08.970> a

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
and it's telling me that there's a

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.010 
and it's telling me that there's a
warning<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.720> chromakey<00:04:10.820> operation<00:04:12.020> it's

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
warning the chromakey operation it's

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.620 
warning the chromakey operation it's
gonna<00:04:13.140> scale<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:14.400> avoid<00:04:15.120> performance

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
gonna scale it to avoid performance

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.870 
gonna scale it to avoid performance
issues<00:04:15.960> basically<00:04:16.590> give<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.100> same<00:04:17.280> size<00:04:17.549> I

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
issues basically give the same size I

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.570 
issues basically give the same size I
already<00:04:18.090> did<00:04:18.270> all<00:04:18.360> that<00:04:19.310> so<00:04:20.310> we're<00:04:20.459> gonna

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
already did all that so we're gonna

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.540 
already did all that so we're gonna
leave<00:04:20.760> that<00:04:20.910> alone<00:04:21.500> so<00:04:22.500> now<00:04:22.830> let's<00:04:23.280> take<00:04:23.490> a

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
leave that alone so now let's take a

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.980 
leave that alone so now let's take a
look<00:04:23.850> as<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:24.240> can<00:04:24.360> see<00:04:24.540> here<00:04:24.780> we've<00:04:24.960> got

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
look as you can see here we've got

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.120 
look as you can see here we've got
threshold

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
threshold

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.940 
threshold
we've<00:04:26.520> got<00:04:26.760> smoothing<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.810> red<00:04:28.440> green<00:04:28.740> and

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
we've got smoothing and red green and

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.550 
we've got smoothing and red green and
blue<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:30.060> threshold<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.930> gonna<00:04:31.110> be<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.380> main

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
blue so threshold is gonna be the main

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.750 
blue so threshold is gonna be the main
thing<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.010> we're<00:04:32.160> gonna<00:04:32.220> do<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.700> that's

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
thing that we're gonna do and that's

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.140 
thing that we're gonna do and that's
gonna<00:04:33.000> say<00:04:33.240> how<00:04:33.510> much<00:04:33.750> are<00:04:33.990> we<00:04:34.080> gonna<00:04:34.320> let<00:04:35.150> be

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
gonna say how much are we gonna let be

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.510 
gonna say how much are we gonna let be
transparent<00:04:36.960> so<00:04:37.170> let's<00:04:37.950> see<00:04:38.130> where<00:04:38.340> we're<00:04:38.460> at

the<00:05:06.450> light<00:05:06.690> over<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.140> little<00:05:07.320> bit<00:05:07.880> right<00:05:08.880> there

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
the light over a little bit right there

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.740 
the light over a little bit right there
still<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.590> little<00:05:10.950> too<00:05:11.160> much<00:05:11.520> so<00:05:12.090> now<00:05:12.360> let's<00:05:12.600> go

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
still a little too much so now let's go

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.660 
still a little too much so now let's go
back<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.170> and<00:05:13.380> fix<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.310> hold<00:05:14.490> on

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670

Alexander<00:05:15.380> let's<00:05:16.380> go<00:05:16.590> back<00:05:16.890> into<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:18.290> chroma

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
Alexander let's go back into the chroma

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.070 
Alexander let's go back into the chroma
key<00:05:19.820> and<00:05:20.820> I<00:05:20.910> might<00:05:21.120> bring<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.450> threshold<00:05:21.990> down

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
key and I might bring the threshold down

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.550 
key and I might bring the threshold down
just<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:23.820> couple<00:05:23.940> notches<00:05:24.720> it's<00:05:25.170> a<00:05:25.230> little<00:05:25.410> too

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
just a couple notches it's a little too

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.990 
just a couple notches it's a little too
much<00:05:25.800> let's<00:05:26.100> go<00:05:26.190> back<00:05:26.280> to<00:05:26.730> like<00:05:27.470> nice<00:05:29.000> it's

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
much let's go back to like nice it's

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.550 
much let's go back to like nice it's
very<00:05:30.390> sensitive<00:05:32.390> well<00:05:33.390> let<00:05:33.630> me<00:05:33.660> see<00:05:33.870> what<00:05:33.990> 14

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
very sensitive well let me see what 14

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.650 
very sensitive well let me see what 14
does<00:05:34.830> it's<00:05:35.520> probably<00:05:35.880> way<00:05:36.000> too<00:05:36.030> much<00:05:36.240> but

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660
