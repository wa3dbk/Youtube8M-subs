is it's a full wig so I think it's a

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
and the comb in the back and so instead

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.669

00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:02.010 
don't like this it just looks horrible
to<00:01:57.130> me<00:01:57.279> so<00:01:57.579> I<00:01:57.819> put<00:01:58.599> the<00:01:58.689> twists<00:01:59.170> in<00:01:59.459> and<00:02:00.959> then<00:02:01.959> I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
to me so I put the twists in and then I

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.370 
to me so I put the twists in and then I
put<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.349> wig<00:02:02.529> back<00:02:02.979> here<00:02:04.109> so<00:02:05.109> I'm<00:02:05.169> just<00:02:05.289> gonna

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
put the wig back here so I'm just gonna

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.820 
put the wig back here so I'm just gonna
slide<00:02:06.039> this<00:02:06.279> first<00:02:06.520> comb<00:02:06.789> in<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:08.080> part

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.120 

and<00:02:12.490> tuck<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.880> tails<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.990> back<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:18.010> I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
and tuck the tails in the back so if I

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.330 
and tuck the tails in the back so if I
had<00:02:18.340> done<00:02:18.490> a<00:02:18.550> proper<00:02:18.910> twist<00:02:19.750> out<00:02:19.990> then<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:21.070> could

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
had done a proper twist out then I could

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.330 
had done a proper twist out then I could
just<00:02:21.490> leave<00:02:21.640> my<00:02:22.000> hair<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.990> hang<00:02:23.200> out<00:02:23.410> but<00:02:24.130> since

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
just leave my hair to hang out but since

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.800 
just leave my hair to hang out but since
its<00:02:24.550> kind<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.820> fuzzy<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.300> you<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.510> tell<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
its kind of fuzzy and you can tell the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.990 
its kind of fuzzy and you can tell the
difference<00:02:26.200> all<00:02:26.500> I'm<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> do<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.490> tuck

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
difference all I'm going to do is tuck

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.800 
difference all I'm going to do is tuck
the<00:02:28.210> ends<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.840> my<00:02:29.080> hair<00:02:30.300> back<00:02:31.300> underneath<00:02:31.690> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
the ends of my hair back underneath the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.640 
the ends of my hair back underneath the
wig<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.730> kind<00:02:33.880> of<00:02:33.940> acts<00:02:34.150> as<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.450> barrier<00:02:34.840> so

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
wig so it kind of acts as a barrier so

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.280 
wig so it kind of acts as a barrier so
I'm<00:02:35.710> going<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.920> tuck<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:36.250> one<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.640> two<00:02:37.290> just

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
I'm going to tuck this one in two just

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.010 
I'm going to tuck this one in two just
to<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.620> side<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.280> now<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.970> acts<00:02:40.540> as<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.810> barrier

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
to that side so now it acts as a barrier

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.230 
to that side so now it acts as a barrier
so<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:41.440> not<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.980> obvious<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:42.670> have<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:42.940> wig

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
so it's not so obvious that I have a wig

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.800 
so it's not so obvious that I have a wig
on<00:02:43.390> this

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
on this

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.810 
on this
possibly<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.860> know<00:02:44.890> could<00:02:45.250> be<00:02:45.400> my<00:02:45.580> hair

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
possibly you know could be my hair

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.600 
possibly you know could be my hair
another<00:02:46.660> thing<00:02:46.960> that<00:02:47.590> I'm<00:02:47.710> cognizant<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.400> is

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
another thing that I'm cognizant of is

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.630 
another thing that I'm cognizant of is
when<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> wind<00:02:49.150> blows<00:02:50.370> tuck<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.490> down<00:02:51.520> a

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
when the wind blows tuck it down a

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.910 
when the wind blows tuck it down a
little<00:02:51.730> bit<00:02:51.850> more<00:02:52.060> when<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> wind<00:02:53.140> blows<00:02:53.410> you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
little bit more when the wind blows you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.150 
little bit more when the wind blows you
can<00:02:54.820> tell<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.600> wig<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.020> see<00:02:56.290> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
can tell that it's a wig so you see the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.370 
can tell that it's a wig so you see the
line<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.940> try<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.330> mask<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:59.050> as<00:02:59.230> much

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
line here so I try to mask that as much

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.820 
line here so I try to mask that as much
as<00:02:59.500> possible<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.980> I<00:03:00.040> take<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> few<00:03:00.520> of<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.300> curls

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.000 

and<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.010> just<00:03:06.220> slop<00:03:07.030> them<00:03:07.270> in<00:03:07.450> between<00:03:07.920> some<00:03:08.920> of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
and I just slop them in between some of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.890 
and I just slop them in between some of
the<00:03:09.070> twists<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:11.860> just<00:03:12.660> pushing<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.780> through

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
the twists so just pushing it through

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.260 
the twists so just pushing it through
there<00:03:17.459> pull<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.520> all<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.700> way<00:03:18.790> through<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.209> it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
there pull it all the way through so it

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.510 
there pull it all the way through so it
hangs<00:03:19.480> may<00:03:20.410> do<00:03:22.500> down<00:03:23.500> through<00:03:23.739> there<00:03:23.890> and<00:03:24.160> then

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
hangs may do down through there and then

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.670 
hangs may do down through there and then
I<00:03:24.640> secure<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.239> with<00:03:25.360> bobby<00:03:25.420> pins<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.470> of

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
I secure it with bobby pins and of

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.140 
I secure it with bobby pins and of
course<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.980> would<00:03:27.280> do<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.520> other<00:03:27.550> side<00:03:27.940> as<00:03:28.120> well

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
course I would do the other side as well

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.350 
course I would do the other side as well
but<00:03:29.340> secure<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.430> with<00:03:30.489> bobby<00:03:30.550> pins<00:03:30.880> to<00:03:31.239> make

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
but secure it with bobby pins to make

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.560 
but secure it with bobby pins to make
sure<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:32.680> doesn't<00:03:32.890> come<00:03:33.040> off<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:34.270> pull<00:03:34.450> it

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
sure it doesn't come off and pull it

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.900 
sure it doesn't come off and pull it
down<00:03:34.800> place<00:03:35.800> where<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.130> feels<00:03:36.280> really<00:03:36.520> secure

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
down place where it feels really secure

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.940 
down place where it feels really secure
and<00:03:37.150> now<00:03:37.600> when<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.020> wind<00:03:38.230> blows<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.680> doesn't

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
and now when the wind blows it doesn't

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.310 
and now when the wind blows it doesn't
look<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.160> obvious<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> wig<00:03:40.209> on<00:03:40.390> so

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
look so obvious that I have a wig on so

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.830 
look so obvious that I have a wig on so
you<00:03:41.380> see<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.680> difference<00:03:42.070> between<00:03:42.280> this

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
you see the difference between this

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.470 
you see the difference between this
these<00:03:43.840> two<00:03:44.110> sides<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:45.610> took<00:03:45.940> that<00:03:46.090> in<00:03:46.209> a<00:03:46.300> bit

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
these two sides and took that in a bit

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.390 
these two sides and took that in a bit
more<00:03:46.510> so<00:03:47.200> if<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.350> just<00:03:47.530> left<00:03:47.770> it<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.040> way<00:03:48.070> that<00:03:48.340> I

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
more so if I just left it the way that I

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.370 
more so if I just left it the way that I
put<00:03:48.730> it<00:03:48.790> on<00:03:48.940> it's<00:03:49.390> very<00:03:49.450> obvious<00:03:50.020> if<00:03:50.140> the<00:03:50.230> wind

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
put it on it's very obvious if the wind

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.080 
put it on it's very obvious if the wind
blows<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.709> have<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.860> wig<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.160> however<00:03:51.910> what

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
blows that I have a wig on however what

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.610 
blows that I have a wig on however what
I'm<00:03:52.209> after<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.600> put<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.900> curls<00:03:53.230> under<00:03:53.380> this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
I'm after I put the curls under this

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.020 
I'm after I put the curls under this
side<00:03:53.890> it<00:03:54.040> just<00:03:54.070> kind<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.520> blends<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:56.470> this<00:03:56.650> is

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
side it just kind of blends so this is

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.490 
side it just kind of blends so this is
this<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.239> one<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.510> my<00:03:58.570> favorite<00:03:58.930> go-to<00:03:59.140> piece

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
this is one of my favorite go-to piece

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.979 
this is one of my favorite go-to piece
this<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.860> also<00:04:00.010> good<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:00.550> you<00:04:01.239> are<00:04:01.420> in<00:04:01.690> a<00:04:01.780> rush

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:29.259 
thing that I did with the last one I'm

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:30.899 
thing that I did with the last one I'm
not<00:05:29.349> going<00:05:29.530> to<00:05:29.590> go<00:05:29.710> through<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.460> motions<00:05:30.880> and

not going to go through the motions and
show<00:05:31.180> you<00:05:33.000> but<00:05:34.000> this<00:05:34.150> is<00:05:34.300> it<00:05:34.479> so<00:05:34.630> what<00:05:34.810> you've

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
show you but this is it so what you've

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.439 
show you but this is it so what you've
got<00:05:35.110> it<00:05:35.259> sitting<00:05:35.530> back<00:05:35.860> a<00:05:35.889> bit<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.389> just

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
got it sitting back a bit and you just

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.589 
got it sitting back a bit and you just
kind<00:05:37.719> of<00:05:37.949> toss<00:05:38.949> it<00:05:39.130> to<00:05:39.219> one<00:05:39.400> side<00:05:39.699> and<00:05:40.029> make<00:05:40.449> it
