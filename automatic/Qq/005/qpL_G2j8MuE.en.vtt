00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.040
 cast mine as greetings are 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.230
 doubles welcome again to my channel 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.020
 now they are brought with what is a support 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.180
 to put our tablet without importing 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.650
 of what company or brand is so 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.779
 let's get him out of here so that you 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.630
 they can realize everything that we 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 It is important to emphasize that this 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.949
 works with any tablet that is in 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.160
 the market not only with ipad as 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.260
 I will show in the video so good 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.239
 already said that we are going to remove it so that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 you can see it much better what 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.020
 first thing that we find is the manual 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.540
 I recommend dedicating a couple of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.000
 minutes since that way we know much more 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.520
 easy where each piece goes and we make sure 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.860
 very good our device now what 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.960
 that we are going to extract here is the most 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.329
 I'll teach you a lot 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.129
 better to see every detail and not 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.640
 lose nothing we 'll see what else we 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.489
 includes let's take out what would be the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.940
 support and apart from that it brings us as 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.490
 some legs I imagine that it is for 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.150
 to accommodate the ipad either large or 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.560
 small I also invite you to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.790
 to like what would be your page 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.250
 facebook in the description are going to 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.950
 find the details since to be 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.660
 always aware of what is news 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.740
 and more as you can see this is everything 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:28.470
 which includes us is really quite 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.660
 well let's see how it is already in what 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.330
 what is the car and these would be the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.180
 little legs that I was telling you to 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.580
 accommodate different tablets no longer 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 we are going to install it very easy only 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.150
 you have to do upward pressure 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.850
 to remove what is like the insurance that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.230
 bring so that we do not fall remember 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.240
 make him up a little bit of 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.120
 upward pressure and then towards 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.180
 outside so we adjusted it to mode 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.700
 that is comfortable and does not move like 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.420
 can see what we adjust and after that 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.120
 we already have what would be the part of what 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.220
 which is the support as you can see 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.650
 you can also stretch since this is 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.570
 for one or many people you can not 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.310
 put in between and the people who are going 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.890
 back can enjoy 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.810
 of what they are seeing on their tablets 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.030
 putting the base is very simple just what 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.220
 we align once it is aligned 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.849
 we press down so that 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.770
 remain what is safe and as you can see 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.200
 we already have sure what the base is 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.420
 Now let's put what would be the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.730
 little feet remember this came two 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.180
 pairs and a few shorts and a few 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.300
 it depends on your tablet, we are going to 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.120
 review it so that they enter what 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.150
 it's like a little channel they bring to both 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.430
 sides as you can see there I am 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.890
 showing really easy really very 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.500
 simple so it's very easy to change 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.840
 also what would be the legs like 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.660
 can you see if we say your tablet is a 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.410
 little smaller you can use that kind 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.540
 of paws to put it observe very well is 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.209
 very simple no more gets first 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.950
 one side and then the other right now 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.319
 I'll show you where the trick is 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.230
 since it looked small and how can 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.750
 see was super good because really not 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.930
 is a trick but what it does is that 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.880
 is the base stretches becomes longer 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.130
 Now I'm going to teach you on the part of 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.800
 back to give you an idea how it is 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.440
 that works and is in that same way 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.900
 can put different tablets as 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.520
 I told them about the whole video as 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.400
 can see there is stretched what is 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.850
 the base actually quite good because 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.220
 it is a universal support that can 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.900
 serve for any tablet so 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.810
 you and your friends can already enjoy 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.090
 of that movie of those videos that 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.770
 you both like it and needlessly 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.200
 to go having the ipad in their hands 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.900
 really this is a very comfortable way 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.590
 and really the price is very reasonable 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.120
 for 3495 if you want to know more about this 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.880
 product the only thing they have to do 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.040
 is to go to arc dotcom in the description 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.959
 will find the links of this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.420
 product and what would your website be for 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.910
 to check the truth the pile of 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.410
 products that they have and super good as well 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.130
 that I am double there we see ourselves in the 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.130
 next video
