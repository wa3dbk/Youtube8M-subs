00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.110
 ok standard tuning the song is in 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.110
 Re tone 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.390
 it's only the whole song is 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.850
 exactly a circle of chords that 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.820
 repeated over and over again 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.780
 the rhythm is a simple ballad rhythm 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.210
 where is 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:25.850
 down 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.140
 then up 3 above 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.140
 not under 3 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.969
 I heard 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.150
 so 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 to sing 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.219
 now 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.070
 the letter begins 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.840
 I love you because I feel more secure 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:19.579
 that you want me look at me that all this 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.579
 I think you've been left 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:27.719
 I hope to give you everything you long for 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.719
 clean my hand 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.090
 I do not want it to be 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.670
 always be destructive 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.070
 best 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:52.080
 tenente means that I am alive that 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.500
 I walk the respite that works my 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.190
 senses 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.960
 in response to good luck 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.650
 because nothing else to see if I'm happy 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.590
 known 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.590
