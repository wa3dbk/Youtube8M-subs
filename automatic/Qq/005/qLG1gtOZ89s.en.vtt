playing<00:00:31.599> hard<00:00:32.079> defense<00:00:32.560> or<00:00:32.800> they<00:00:33.040> get

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
playing hard defense or they get

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.760 
playing hard defense or they get
challenged<00:00:33.730> by<00:00:33.850> a<00:00:33.879> teammate<00:00:34.390> or<00:00:34.420> coach<00:00:34.840> or<00:00:35.320> an

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
challenged by a teammate or coach or an

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.560 
challenged by a teammate or coach or an
opponent<00:00:36.039> they<00:00:36.370> may<00:00:36.550> start<00:00:36.850> playing<00:00:37.120> defense

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
opponent they may start playing defense

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.779 
opponent they may start playing defense
but<00:00:37.750> overall<00:00:38.109> most<00:00:38.530> people<00:00:38.920> don't<00:00:39.550> really

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
but overall most people don't really

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.520 
but overall most people don't really
give<00:00:40.059> that<00:00:40.239> much<00:00:40.420> effort<00:00:40.629> on<00:00:40.930> defense<00:00:41.379> so

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
give that much effort on defense so

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.229 
give that much effort on defense so
that's<00:00:41.800> is<00:00:41.980> one<00:00:42.309> way<00:00:42.460> that<00:00:42.550> you<00:00:42.699> can<00:00:42.850> separate

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
that's is one way that you can separate

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.790 
that's is one way that you can separate
yourself<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.780> your<00:00:43.899> opponents<00:00:44.350> by<00:00:44.500> putting

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
yourself and your opponents by putting

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.919 
yourself and your opponents by putting
some<00:00:44.949> effort<00:00:45.280> in<00:00:45.370> today<00:00:45.640> like<00:00:46.449> I<00:00:46.539> said<00:00:46.570> it's

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
some effort in today like I said it's

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.450 
some effort in today like I said it's
all<00:00:47.050> about<00:00:47.079> effort<00:00:47.590> you<00:00:47.679> have<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.980> want<00:00:48.219> to<00:00:48.280> do

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.860 
all about effort you have to want to do
it<00:00:48.609> it's<00:00:48.820> not<00:00:48.910> something<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.420> could<00:00:49.539> just<00:00:49.600> go

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
it it's not something you could just go

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.509 
it it's not something you could just go
out<00:00:49.929> there<00:00:50.199> and<00:00:50.260> be<00:00:50.620> good<00:00:50.859> at<00:00:51.039> and<00:00:51.190> just<00:00:51.370> be

out there and be good at and just be
good<00:00:51.699> at<00:00:51.850> defense<00:00:52.269> if<00:00:52.480> you're<00:00:52.629> not<00:00:52.750> putting<00:00:53.019> in

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:53.109 
good at defense if you're not putting in

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:54.630 
good at defense if you're not putting in
the<00:00:53.170> effort<00:00:53.320> you<00:00:53.739> won't<00:00:54.309> get<00:00:54.429> burned

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
the effort you won't get burned
