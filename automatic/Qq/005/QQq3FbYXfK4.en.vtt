00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.789
 one of them 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 2 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.929
 hello I am selling his place as mayor today I had never tried 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.960
 this daily 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 but small budget we do not speak again 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 a victory 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.580
 I am already observing okay 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.329
 fifteen boxers last is not obvious because I do not know him well 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.250
 I do not know them 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.520
 its magnitude 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.200
 it's a little complicated 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.200
 you can do my best 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.750
 not exactly how a guy quite rare when we know her players 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.490
 we will find it available a report 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.630
 at this concert 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.030
 it's much easier 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.890
 the voice near me I do not have much experience so little 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.890
 it's more experience of the players than more than one coach 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.659
 remember finally that the hoya we will see we can know amphibians 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.550
 the financial mission of the oxer these two oppositions 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.890
 and before doing oppositions we worked a little hard 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.520
 on the theme today that's the goal he's basing on the trend shows that's 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.610
 to recap 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.590
 what we worked on land in all movements in 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.140
 the intervals and who died from it the deep aviation width 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.130
 that's after the auditions are in progress set up the work ends 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.460
 always pay 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.360
 on the red carpet I prefer to observe a little 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.720
 because I see it as a pitfall to avoid 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.460
 both hockey players 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.350
 who will have the worst crisis in a year 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.769
 we already have there the game vision 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.769
 because technically it's not for lunch 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.489
 already technically it's not bad 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.049
 do not wait until believe the tests of 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.189
 to build the game the report to that is clear 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.239
 that's what I like 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.729
 already on the bass as a player 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.799
 novelist 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.799
 it's interesting it's interesting 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.459
 employees 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.449
 so here I can learn with theirs with their listening 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.199
 as many facets that's it that's good too 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.060
 afp photo 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.820
 three hours 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.129
 impeccable I talked about 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.129
 but here it is the end of a little by little towards sebha and ghat 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.790
 that's where she does fly would have judged maybe a little paranoid no 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.500
 no no no no I'm still looking a little bit because he's 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.529
 this help 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.819
 to see the players what do you want to snow and I like it already 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:08.519
 heart 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.440
 the idea is not clear everywhere
