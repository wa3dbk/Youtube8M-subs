00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
I'd remarked how dark it was and it was

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.250 
I'd remarked how dark it was and it was
I<00:02:50.519> mean<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.390> tropics<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.900> course<00:02:52.109> so

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
I mean it was the tropics of course so

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.869 
I mean it was the tropics of course so
it's<00:02:52.410> quite<00:02:52.590> early<00:02:52.799> in<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.220> evening<00:02:53.549> it<00:02:53.670> gets

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
it's quite early in the evening it gets

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.430 
it's quite early in the evening it gets
dark<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.329> there<00:02:54.450> was<00:02:54.540> absolutely<00:02:54.690> an<00:02:55.170> utterly

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
dark but there was absolutely an utterly

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.559 
dark but there was absolutely an utterly
no<00:02:55.769> moon<00:02:56.069> and<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.310> hit<00:02:59.310> me<00:02:59.519> as<00:02:59.640> we<00:02:59.879> got

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
no moon and that just hit me as we got

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.140 
no moon and that just hit me as we got
into<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> car<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:02.190> that<00:03:02.549> was<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.819> only<00:03:02.879> thing

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
into the car and that was the only thing

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.729 
into the car and that was the only thing
that<00:03:03.359> was<00:03:03.480> unusual<00:03:03.510> about<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.709> other

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
that was unusual about it and the other

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.099 
that was unusual about it and the other
was<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.700> don't<00:03:05.819> suppose<00:03:06.090> it's<00:03:06.299> unusual<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
was I don't suppose it's unusual the

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.720 
was I don't suppose it's unusual the
airplane<00:03:07.470> was<00:03:07.590> about<00:03:07.829> half<00:03:08.129> an<00:03:08.340> hour<00:03:08.430> late

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
airplane was about half an hour late

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.940 
airplane was about half an hour late
coming<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.049> it<00:03:10.170> had<00:03:10.260> been<00:03:10.379> on<00:03:10.560> time<00:03:10.890> I

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
coming in and if it had been on time I

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.369 
coming in and if it had been on time I
think<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.489> would<00:03:11.670> have<00:03:11.790> missed<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.260> also<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
think we would have missed it also the

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.009 
think we would have missed it also the
timing<00:03:13.709> was<00:03:13.950> quite<00:03:14.220> critical<00:03:14.430> wasn't<00:03:15.030> well<00:03:15.959> I

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
timing was quite critical wasn't well I

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.979 
timing was quite critical wasn't well I
don't<00:03:17.010> know<00:03:17.220> we<00:03:17.489> don't<00:03:17.640> know<00:03:17.879> that<00:03:17.909> but<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
don't know we don't know that but I

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.599 
don't know we don't know that but I
think<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.470> was<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:19.829> were<00:03:19.980> half<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.400> the

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
think it was we were half and the

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.039 
think it was we were half and the
airplane<00:03:20.940> was<00:03:21.000> half<00:03:21.180> an<00:03:21.329> hour<00:03:21.419> late<00:03:21.599> coming<00:03:21.840> in

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
airplane was half an hour late coming in

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.930 
airplane was half an hour late coming in
and<00:03:22.200> we<00:03:22.290> were<00:03:22.380> half<00:03:22.590> an<00:03:22.709> hour<00:03:22.799> late<00:03:22.859> taking<00:03:23.790> off

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
and we were half an hour late taking off

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.430 
and we were half an hour late taking off
we<00:03:24.090> should<00:03:24.269> have<00:03:24.359> taken<00:03:24.599> over<00:03:24.690> half<00:03:24.900> past<00:03:25.169> 7

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
we should have taken over half past 7

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.500 
we should have taken over half past 7
local<00:03:25.620> time<00:03:25.919> we<00:03:26.459> left<00:03:26.639> into<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> air<00:03:27.239> at<00:03:27.359> 8

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
local time we left into the air at 8

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.699 
local time we left into the air at 8
o'clock<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:29.660> apparently<00:03:30.660> it<00:03:30.959> was<00:03:31.139> about<00:03:31.440> half

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
o'clock and apparently it was about half

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.559 
o'clock and apparently it was about half
past<00:03:31.980> 7<00:03:32.639> that<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:34.340> volcano<00:03:35.340> erupted<00:03:36.000> perhaps

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
past 7 that the volcano erupted perhaps

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.809 
past 7 that the volcano erupted perhaps
if<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.900> got<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.709> half<00:03:37.980> an<00:03:38.160> hour<00:03:38.310> early

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
if we got there that half an hour early

if we got there that half an hour early
the<00:03:39.359> ash<00:03:39.840> wouldn't<00:03:40.200> have<00:03:40.290> been<00:03:40.410> up<00:03:40.530> quite<00:03:40.799> as

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
the ash wouldn't have been up quite as

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:54.759 
board of the on the upstairs lounge
there<00:05:53.629> was<00:05:53.749> something<00:05:54.139> what<00:05:54.499> looked<00:05:54.709> like

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:54.769 
there was something what looked like

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:57.729 
there was something what looked like
smoke<00:05:55.129> billowing<00:05:55.849> in<00:05:56.149> around<00:05:56.539> the<00:05:56.749> bottom<00:05:57.559> of

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:57.739 
smoke billowing in around the bottom of

00:05:57.739 --> 00:05:59.859 
smoke billowing in around the bottom of
the<00:05:57.889> floor<00:05:58.579> where<00:05:58.849> the<00:05:59.209> air<00:05:59.329> conditioning

00:05:59.859 --> 00:05:59.869

the floor where the air conditioning
comes<00:06:00.110> in<00:06:00.379> and<00:06:00.589> that<00:06:01.459> and<00:06:02.149> with<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.389> was<00:06:02.779> an

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:02.929 
comes in and that and with that was an

comes in and that and with that was an
acrid<00:06:03.439> electrical<00:06:04.309> burning<00:06:04.639> smell<00:06:05.329> and

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:05.769 
acrid electrical burning smell and

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:08.619 
acrid electrical burning smell and
obviously<00:06:06.769> it<00:06:06.829> was<00:06:06.919> sulfuric<00:06:07.549> smell<00:06:07.849> as<00:06:08.419> well

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
obviously it was sulfuric smell as well

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.350 
obviously it was sulfuric smell as well
and<00:06:08.899> at<00:06:09.199> the<00:06:09.289> time<00:06:09.559> I<00:06:09.589> described<00:06:10.249> it<00:06:10.519> it's<00:06:10.909> it

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.509 
and at the time I described it it's it
smelt<00:06:11.749> like<00:06:11.869> the<00:06:12.409> London<00:06:12.769> Underground

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:13.519 
smelt like the London Underground

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:14.979 
smelt like the London Underground
now<00:06:13.849> they've<00:06:13.999> obviously<00:06:14.299> changed<00:06:14.719> something

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:14.989 
now they've obviously changed something

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:16.209 
now they've obviously changed something
in<00:06:15.110> the<00:06:15.169> London<00:06:15.379> Underground<00:06:15.409> it's<00:06:15.919> probably

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
in the London Underground it's probably

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:17.619 
in the London Underground it's probably
their<00:06:16.429> change<00:06:16.699> their<00:06:16.879> brake<00:06:17.059> linings<00:06:17.539> or

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:19.429 
something and that characteristic smell

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.059 
something and that characteristic smell
has<00:06:19.669> disappeared<00:06:20.239> but<00:06:20.809> I<00:06:21.019> now<00:06:21.349> know<00:06:21.379> of<00:06:21.679> course

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
has disappeared but I now know of course

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.889 
has disappeared but I now know of course
that<00:06:22.279> it<00:06:22.399> was<00:06:22.549> a<00:06:22.579> sulfuric<00:06:23.029> smell<00:06:23.209> and<00:06:23.719> a

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:23.899 
that it was a sulfuric smell and a

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:26.709 
that it was a sulfuric smell and a
volcanic<00:06:24.379> ash<00:06:24.559> smell<00:06:24.919> and<00:06:25.189> that<00:06:26.029> carried<00:06:26.599> on

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
volcanic ash smell and that carried on

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.600 
volcanic ash smell and that carried on
onto<00:06:27.019> the<00:06:27.079> phytic<00:06:27.529> so<00:06:27.649> when<00:06:27.769> I<00:06:27.799> went<00:06:28.039> on<00:06:28.099> I<00:06:28.399> was

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
onto the phytic so when I went on I was

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.239 
onto the phytic so when I went on I was
half<00:06:28.819> expecting<00:06:28.999> them<00:06:29.509> to<00:06:29.539> say<00:06:29.689> we<00:06:30.289> had<00:06:30.559> fire

00:06:31.239 --> 00:06:31.249 
half expecting them to say we had fire

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:33.669 
half expecting them to say we had fire
or<00:06:31.610> smoke<00:06:32.089> in<00:06:32.299> the<00:06:32.389> electronics<00:06:32.959> Bay<00:06:33.169> which

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:33.679 
or smoke in the electronics Bay which

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:36.549 
or smoke in the electronics Bay which
would<00:06:33.919> have<00:06:34.039> been<00:06:34.249> scary<00:06:34.929> well<00:06:35.929> we<00:06:36.289> thought

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:36.559 
would have been scary well we thought

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:38.259 
would have been scary well we thought
they<00:06:36.860> were<00:06:36.919> fire<00:06:37.219> extinguishing<00:06:37.849> there<00:06:38.029> too

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:38.269
