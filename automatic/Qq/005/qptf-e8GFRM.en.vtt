00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
sandwich as one of them would you try it

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
sandwich as one of them would you try it
to<00:02:11.009> buy<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> definitely<00:02:11.849> would<00:02:11.970> at<00:02:12.120> least<00:02:12.239> try

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
to buy I definitely would at least try

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.670 
to buy I definitely would at least try
it<00:02:12.540> once<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.900> if<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.110> was<00:02:13.230> nice

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
it once and if it was nice

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
it once and if it was nice
we<00:02:13.829> buy<00:02:14.010> again<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.549> stuff<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.329> I<00:02:15.390> think<00:02:15.569> what

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
we buy again and stuff but I think what

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.280 
we buy again and stuff but I think what
could<00:02:16.469> be<00:02:16.739> an<00:02:17.120> extremely<00:02:18.120> big<00:02:18.540> seller

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
could be an extremely big seller

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.140 
could be an extremely big seller
if<00:02:19.349> valve<00:02:19.680> ever<00:02:19.980> did<00:02:20.219> decide<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.609> do<00:02:20.909> this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
if valve ever did decide to do this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.289 
if valve ever did decide to do this
would<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.079> be<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.680> de<00:02:22.859> locas<00:02:23.120> chocolate<00:02:24.120> bar

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
would it be the de locas chocolate bar

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.899 
would it be the de locas chocolate bar
which<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.599> normally<00:02:25.200> equipped<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.519> heavy

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
which is normally equipped for the heavy

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.660 
which is normally equipped for the heavy
because<00:02:27.540> as<00:02:28.049> everybody<00:02:28.859> knows<00:02:29.219> nearly

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
because as everybody knows nearly

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.690 
because as everybody knows nearly
everybody<00:02:30.299> likes<00:02:30.569> chocolate<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.799> many<00:02:32.280> people

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
everybody likes chocolate so many people

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.520 
everybody likes chocolate so many people
like<00:02:32.879> that<00:02:33.060> so<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.269> think<00:02:33.359> it<00:02:33.629> pick<00:02:33.810> up<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.200> well

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
like that so I think it pick up so well

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.280 
like that so I think it pick up so well
because<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.519> know<00:02:35.939> it's<00:02:36.299> not<00:02:36.569> like<00:02:36.719> a<00:02:36.750> big<00:02:37.049> make

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
because I know it's not like a big make

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.959 
because I know it's not like a big make
of<00:02:37.500> chocolate<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:37.980> anything<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.609> because<00:02:38.939> of

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
of chocolate or anything but because of

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.360 
of chocolate or anything but because of
the<00:02:39.120> Team<00:02:39.329> Fortress<00:02:39.359> 2<00:02:40.049> aspect<00:02:40.709> people<00:02:41.189> would

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
the Team Fortress 2 aspect people would

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.069 
the Team Fortress 2 aspect people would
really<00:02:41.639> like<00:02:41.909> that<00:02:42.150> anybody<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.659> the<00:02:42.719> gaming

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
really like that anybody in the gaming

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.099 
really like that anybody in the gaming
industry<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.560> think<00:02:43.709> would<00:02:44.219> really<00:02:44.700> be

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
industry I think would really be

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.809 
industry I think would really be
interested<00:02:46.109> in<00:02:46.260> buying<00:02:46.739> something<00:02:47.159> like<00:02:47.519> that

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
interested in buying something like that

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.929

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
but him so yeah in my opinion I think it

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.879 
but him so yeah in my opinion I think it
would<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.239> cool<00:02:51.510> but<00:02:51.750> now<00:02:51.930> rounding<00:02:52.439> back<00:02:52.590> off

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889

for them to do it to get the original
proper<00:03:09.329> version<00:03:09.599> because<00:03:10.349> as<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:11.310> said<00:03:11.549> before

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
proper version because as I said before

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.629 
proper version because as I said before
if<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:13.049> was<00:03:13.200> valve<00:03:13.469> I'd<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.859> a<00:03:13.889> lot<00:03:14.069> more<00:03:14.129> yeah

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
if it was valve I'd be a lot more yeah

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.129 
if it was valve I'd be a lot more yeah
because<00:03:14.849> I'm<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.120> collector<00:03:15.359> I'll<00:03:15.780> grab<00:03:16.109> that

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
because I'm a collector I'll grab that

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.619 
because I'm a collector I'll grab that
but<00:03:16.680> because<00:03:17.219> it's<00:03:17.579> not<00:03:17.669> from<00:03:18.000> valve<00:03:18.389> that

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
but because it's not from valve that

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.360 
but because it's not from valve that
puts<00:03:18.900> me<00:03:19.079> off<00:03:19.229> a<00:03:19.260> little<00:03:19.470> bit<00:03:19.650> because<00:03:20.099> at<00:03:20.280> the
