00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.039
 deal here we are again with new 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.130
 video on this occasion we are going to teach you 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.080
 how can they enable or put what is 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.410
 call waiting that they have requested 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.419
 many users with devices 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.880
 andrea free that in most of 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.800
 devices this should have activated 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.050
 but that already remember that it depends 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.719
 also from the operator or the company 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.660
 of communication that some also 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.520
 they enable this option of what is 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.020
 the call on hold however we have 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.489
 also an application as you can see 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.440
 here that is called Carlos walking 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.260
 universe that to enable also what 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.270
 which is the call waiting but in 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.850
 principle so that you do not need any 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.610
 occupies no space installing any 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.470
 application than another normally in the 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.570
 Android device either smartphone or 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.670
 tablet you can configure what is the 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.440
 call waiting for it simply 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.170
 let's go to what is the option of 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.360
 phone inside the phone option 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.479
 let's get to records and within 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.610
 register let's go to the menu option 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.770
 of the menu option we're going to go to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.409
 call settings within settings of 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.380
 call let's look 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.619
 what is the option additional adjustments of 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.049
 the option additional adjustments there 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.869
 what is called waiting appears 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.719
 we simply activate or stop this 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.920
 option and we can leave everything because 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.109
 says he is already updating the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.869
 adjustments we already have what is the 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.549
 call waiting call option 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.319
 standby activated from this 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.119
 moment we have activated what is the 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.849
 call waiting that the pse we can 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.250
 take call of two people at a time 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.289
 in case you have this option 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.170
 disabled and can not activate what the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.079
 call option usually the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.250
 telephone companies may have 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.349
 deactivated this option in case 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.560
 have no power too, which costs you a 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:05.619
 little bit more money so we're going to 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.050
 see we're going to follow this and go 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 to be worth 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.460
 what is an application that is called 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.050
 waiting to see what is to activate that 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.480
 is available in prehistory that what 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.040
 can download for free no 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.780
 however we are going to leave the link and the 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.850
 description of the video so that you 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.370
 they can dispose of it in case they do not 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.960
 can activate by default what is the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.090
 call is very simple simply a 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.220
 Once you have it loaded and installed 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.320
 in your device activate this castle 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.810
 also so that we can 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.340
 have the call function in 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.440
 wait and this is all but I think that 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 you grow mostly outside 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.290
 utility can not write true the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.790
 benches but that you the video any 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.010
 doubt any suggestion always 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.390
 we say leave us re comment here below 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.220
