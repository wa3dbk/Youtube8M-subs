little class custom lockdown well first

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.870 
little class custom lockdown well first
let's<00:00:25.099> see<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.250> articulation<00:00:26.380> okay<00:00:27.759> for<00:00:28.759> the

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
let's see the articulation okay for the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.670 
let's see the articulation okay for the
articulation<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.869> figure<00:00:29.899> I<00:00:30.380> use<00:00:31.039> the

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
articulation of the figure I use the

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.380 
articulation of the figure I use the
construct<00:00:33.680> box<00:00:33.890> grimlock<00:00:34.550> joints<00:00:35.739> which<00:00:36.739> are

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
construct box grimlock joints which are

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.000 
construct box grimlock joints which are
rubber<00:00:38.890> ball<00:00:39.890> joint<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:41.570> can<00:00:41.720> see<00:00:41.899> here<00:00:43.899> and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
rubber ball joint you can see here and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.599 
rubber ball joint you can see here and
which<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:46.220> can<00:00:48.280> attach<00:00:49.280> some<00:00:49.640> decent<00:00:50.239> at

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
which you can attach some decent at

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:55.479 
which you can attach some decent at
whenever<00:00:52.609> you<00:00:52.879> want<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:53.780> it's<00:00:54.489> pretty

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
whenever you want and it's pretty

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.810 
whenever you want and it's pretty
articulated<00:00:56.440> all<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.679> leg<00:00:58.000> come<00:00:59.000> off<00:00:59.210> this

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
articulated all the leg come off this

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:10.389 
articulated all the leg come off this
back<00:01:01.820> forward<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.869> side<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:09.369> yeah<00:01:10.369> I

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
back forward to the side and yeah I

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.710 
back forward to the side and yeah I
think<00:01:10.580> it's<00:01:10.940> a<00:01:11.119> smooth<00:01:11.720> movement<00:01:13.509> def<00:01:14.509> it's

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
think it's a smooth movement def it's

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.960 
think it's a smooth movement def it's
come<00:01:15.050> back<00:01:15.080> to<00:01:16.960> and<00:01:17.960> that's<00:01:18.860> about<00:01:19.069> it<00:01:19.190> the

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
come back to and that's about it the

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.480 
come back to and that's about it the
same<00:01:20.240> on<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.080> other<00:01:21.289> leg<00:01:21.820> okay

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.550 

for<00:01:26.450> the<00:01:26.630> arms<00:01:27.200> I<00:01:27.230> used<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.250> D<00:01:29.230> joint<00:01:30.230> that

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
for the arms I used the D joint that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.660 
for the arms I used the D joint that
comes<00:01:30.800> with<00:01:31.070> a<00:01:31.100> triple<00:01:32.090> chains<00:01:32.510> lockdown

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
comes with a triple chains lockdown

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.469 
comes with a triple chains lockdown
which<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.150> project<00:01:36.220> that's<00:01:37.390> but<00:01:38.390> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
which is a project that's but the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.750 
which is a project that's but the
problem<00:01:38.780> is<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.920> can<00:01:39.979> only<00:01:40.310> move<00:01:40.520> like

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
problem is that it can only move like

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.719 
problem is that it can only move like
this<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:41.870> I'm<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:43.070> good<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:43.910> piece<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.400> that<00:01:46.400> I

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
this but I'm a good this piece so that I

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.310 
this but I'm a good this piece so that I
can<00:01:47.540> move<00:01:47.780> more<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:49.630> that's<00:01:50.630> about<00:01:50.780> it

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
can move more and that's about it

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.719 
can move more and that's about it
it<00:01:51.950> can<00:01:52.190> you<00:01:52.760> can't<00:01:53.000> move<00:01:53.210> back<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:55.340> too<00:01:55.580> much

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
it can you can't move back in too much

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.590 
it can you can't move back in too much
and<00:01:56.920> for<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.040> shoulders<00:01:58.369> I<00:01:58.580> used<00:01:59.330> to<00:01:59.450> be

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
and for the shoulders I used to be

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.960 
and for the shoulders I used to be
disjoint<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.600> that<00:02:02.810> when<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.110> move<00:02:03.820> the<00:02:04.820> arm

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
disjoint so that when you move the arm

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.760 
disjoint so that when you move the arm
like<00:02:05.210> this<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:06.410> piece<00:02:06.680> doesn't<00:02:06.950> work<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:09.470> it

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
like this this piece doesn't work and it

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.580 
like this this piece doesn't work and it
moves<00:02:10.070> too<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:11.360> if<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:12.080> moves<00:02:12.320> up<00:02:14.350> this<00:02:15.350> joint

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
moves too and if it moves up this joint

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.640 
moves too and if it moves up this joint
is<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.190> one<00:02:16.660> from<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.959> flippin<00:02:18.440> chains

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
is the one from the flippin chains

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.430 
is the one from the flippin chains
figure<00:02:18.950> two<00:02:20.050> back<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.230> forward<00:02:21.620> up<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.640> down

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
figure two back and forward up and down

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.190 
figure two back and forward up and down
and<00:02:24.440> that's<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:25.720> okay<00:02:26.750> the<00:02:27.410> hands<00:02:27.880> have

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and that's it okay the hands have

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.400 
and that's it okay the hands have
Robotech<00:02:30.230> shown<00:02:30.830> here<00:02:31.190> which<00:02:31.880> come<00:02:32.150> of<00:02:32.410> 360

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
Robotech shown here which come of 360

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.940 
Robotech shown here which come of 360
degrees<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.070> out<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.410> can<00:02:39.799> do
