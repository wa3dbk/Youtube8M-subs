00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
really getting the basic app up there

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.580 
really getting the basic app up there
and<00:01:33.299> making<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.720> successful<00:01:33.960> getting<00:01:34.350> enough

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
and making it successful getting enough

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.899 
and making it successful getting enough
people<00:01:34.860> using<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.430> we've<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> whole

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
people using it that we've got a whole

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.340 
people using it that we've got a whole
bunch<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.180> great<00:01:36.540> user<00:01:36.750> generated<00:01:36.930> content

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
bunch of great user generated content

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.690 
bunch of great user generated content
and<00:01:37.740> becomes<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.009> really<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> kind<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and becomes a really a kind of a go to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940 
and becomes a really a kind of a go to
app<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.270> any<00:01:39.390> driver<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.840> car<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.590> also

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
app for any driver in the car and also

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.080 
app for any driver in the car and also
starting<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.310> migrate<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.939> other

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
starting to migrate it to other

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.609 
starting to migrate it to other
platforms<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.869> really<00:01:43.079> our<00:01:43.170> next<00:01:43.320> step

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
platforms are really our next step

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.469 
platforms are really our next step
rather<00:01:44.280> than<00:01:44.369> juicing<00:01:44.759> advertising<00:01:45.240> which<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
rather than juicing advertising which is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.359 
rather than juicing advertising which is
to<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.720> beyond<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> iphone<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.950> start<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
to go beyond the iphone and start to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.100 
to go beyond the iphone and start to
integrate<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.880> actual<00:01:48.540> cars<00:01:48.869> themselves

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
integrate with actual cars themselves

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.200 
integrate with actual cars themselves
and<00:01:49.680> with<00:01:49.829> other<00:01:50.009> electronic<00:01:50.549> devices<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.149> you

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
and with other electronic devices so you

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.550 
and with other electronic devices so you
can<00:01:51.420> get<00:01:51.570> our<00:01:51.720> audio<00:01:52.079> or<00:01:52.259> our<00:01:52.380> traffic

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
can get our audio or our traffic

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.889 
can get our audio or our traffic
channels<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.189> multiple<00:01:53.970> devices<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.689> at<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
channels on multiple devices and at that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660 
channels on multiple devices and at that
point<00:01:55.110> we've<00:01:55.259> got<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> big<00:01:55.590> user<00:01:55.710> base<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.250> then

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
point we've got a big user base and then

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
point we've got a big user base and then
be<00:01:56.790> able<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.030> put<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.360> 10-second<00:01:57.869> audio

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
be able to put a little 10-second audio

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.249 
be able to put a little 10-second audio
at<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> makes<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> lot<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.890> sense<00:01:58.979> well<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.600> talk

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
at in makes a lot of sense well so talk

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.359 
at in makes a lot of sense well so talk
about<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.619> you're<00:02:01.770> you're<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
about that you're you're going to

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.740 
about that you're you're going to
integrate<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.850> cars<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.329> who<00:02:03.450> are<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.630> Lee

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
integrate with cars so who are you Lee

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.830 
integrate with cars so who are you Lee
speaking<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:05.149> early<00:02:06.149> discussions<00:02:06.479> will<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
speaking with early discussions will a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.999 
speaking with early discussions will a
whole<00:02:07.020> number<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.259> different<00:02:07.590> car<00:02:07.680> makers

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
whole number of different car makers

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.499 
whole number of different car makers
think<00:02:08.190> everybody's<00:02:08.610> looking<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:09.179> at<00:02:09.209> how

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
think everybody's looking now at how

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.119 
think everybody's looking now at how
they<00:02:09.690> build<00:02:09.929> connected<00:02:10.500> cars<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.920> next

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
they build connected cars the next

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.940 
they build connected cars the next
couple<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.370> years<00:02:11.459> both<00:02:12.180> through<00:02:12.569> better

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
couple of years both through better

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.470 
couple of years both through better
integration<00:02:13.370> with<00:02:13.489> things<00:02:13.670> like<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.940> iPhone

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
integration with things like the iPhone

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.940 
integration with things like the iPhone
but<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.050> later<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.319> through<00:02:15.680> actual

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
but it later on through actual

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.949 
but it later on through actual
connectivity<00:02:16.520> directly<00:02:16.879> to<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.150> car<00:02:17.330> but

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
connectivity directly to the car but

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.479 
connectivity directly to the car but
they're<00:02:18.140> all<00:02:18.319> in<00:02:18.680> need<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.220> other

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
they're all in need of other

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.890 
they're all in need of other
applications<00:02:20.120> which<00:02:20.269> makes<00:02:20.480> sense<00:02:20.720> they're

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
applications which makes sense they're

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.020 
applications which makes sense they're
easy<00:02:21.050> for<00:02:21.349> drivers<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.709> use<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.340> we<00:02:22.700> see<00:02:23.000> a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
easy for drivers to use so we see a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.580 
easy for drivers to use so we see a
great<00:02:23.330> space<00:02:23.720> kind<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.140> right<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.319> the<00:02:24.440> middle

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
great space kind of right in the middle

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.750 
great space kind of right in the middle
there<00:02:24.680> aren't<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> lot<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.160> people<00:02:25.370> in<00:02:25.580> right

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
there aren't a lot of people in right

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.390 
there aren't a lot of people in right
now<00:02:25.910> connecting<00:02:26.690> the<00:02:26.780> internet<00:02:26.810> to<00:02:27.230> a<00:02:27.260> car<00:02:27.590> for

everybody has in the app store I think

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.720 
everybody has in the app store I think
one<00:04:25.909> of<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.060> ways<00:04:26.180> is<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.539> we

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
one of the ways is that we

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.830 
one of the ways is that we
something<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:27.120> compelling<00:04:27.420> enough<00:04:27.540> that

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
something is compelling enough that

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.030 
something is compelling enough that
people<00:04:27.870> start<00:04:28.320> telling<00:04:28.620> my<00:04:28.680> friends<00:04:28.980> about

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
people start telling my friends about

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.870 
people start telling my friends about
that<00:04:29.340> and<00:04:29.700> then<00:04:30.210> we<00:04:30.300> also<00:04:31.550> build<00:04:32.550> something

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
that and then we also build something

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.120 
that and then we also build something
where<00:04:33.030> there<00:04:33.270> enough<00:04:33.420> other<00:04:33.920> reasons<00:04:34.920> for

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
where there enough other reasons for

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.800 
where there enough other reasons for
people<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.460> notice<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.880> so<00:04:36.060> that's<00:04:36.390> part<00:04:36.780> of

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
people to notice it so that's part of

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.330 
people to notice it so that's part of
the<00:04:36.900> integration<00:04:37.290> we<00:04:37.380> did<00:04:37.500> with<00:04:37.650> Facebook<00:04:38.160> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
the integration we did with Facebook and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.400 
the integration we did with Facebook and
Twitter<00:04:38.550> was<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.480> people<00:04:39.840> can<00:04:39.960> be<00:04:40.050> leaving

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
want to download people do the same

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.190 
want to download people do the same
thing<00:04:51.300> so<00:04:51.420> we're<00:04:51.570> looking<00:04:51.660> at<00:04:51.840> ways<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.020> kind

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
thing so we're looking at ways to kind

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.410 
thing so we're looking at ways to kind
of<00:04:52.290> reach<00:04:52.440> out<00:04:52.620> Boyd<00:04:52.980> bill<00:04:53.310> does<00:04:53.490> make<00:04:54.210> sense

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
of reach out Boyd bill does make sense

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.620 
of reach out Boyd bill does make sense
on<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.810> highway<00:04:56.120> could<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.300> think<00:04:57.540> the

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
on the highway could I think the

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.240 
on the highway could I think the
challenge<00:04:58.020> is<00:04:58.110> translating<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:58.920> down<00:04:59.070> to

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
challenge is translating it down to

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.280 
challenge is translating it down to
today<00:05:00.180> because<00:05:00.570> right<00:05:00.840> now<00:05:00.900> we're<00:05:01.140> only<00:05:01.230> on

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
today because right now we're only on

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.530 
today because right now we're only on

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
and you're fairly narrowing it down

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.280 
and you're fairly narrowing it down
pretty<00:05:05.760> far<00:05:05.970> and<00:05:06.180> one<00:05:06.360> is<00:05:06.510> this<00:05:06.690> available<00:05:06.900> on
