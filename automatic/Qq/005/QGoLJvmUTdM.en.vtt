would catch it from us and it would be

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.520 
would catch it from us and it would be
really<00:03:55.260> bad<00:03:55.709> for<00:03:55.770> her<00:03:56.100> actually<00:03:57.200> she's<00:03:58.200> become

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
really bad for her actually she's become

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.680 
really bad for her actually she's become
a<00:03:58.560> real<00:03:58.830> nuisance

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
a real nuisance

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.570 
a real nuisance
you<00:04:00.690> don't<00:04:00.959> really<00:04:01.170> mean<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.590> do<00:04:02.310> you

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
you don't really mean that do you

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.040 
you don't really mean that do you
I<00:04:03.380> guess<00:04:04.380> not<00:04:04.739> it's<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.150> we<00:04:06.750> feel

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
I guess not it's just that we feel

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.470 
I guess not it's just that we feel
little<00:04:07.380> left<00:04:07.590> out<00:04:07.800> lately<00:04:08.190> since<00:04:08.760> Janice<00:04:09.239> got

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
little left out lately since Janice got

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:18.380 
little left out lately since Janice got
sick<00:04:15.560> she<00:04:16.560> sure<00:04:16.950> gets<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.489> lot<00:04:17.640> of<00:04:17.820> presents

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
sick she sure gets a lot of presents

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.630 
sick she sure gets a lot of presents
though<00:04:18.570> maybe<00:04:19.410> that's<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.950> way<00:04:20.070> for<00:04:20.310> people

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
though maybe that's the way for people

00:04:20.640 --> 00:05:46.950 
though maybe that's the way for people
to<00:04:20.790> show<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.269> they<00:04:21.419> hope<00:04:21.600> she<00:04:21.780> gets<00:04:21.930> well

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.890
