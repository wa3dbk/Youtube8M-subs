basically got to get a new hard drive if

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.600 
basically got to get a new hard drive if
in<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.750> worst<00:01:57.960> case<00:01:58.290> scenario<00:01:58.860> those<00:01:59.369> two

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
in the worst case scenario those two

or<00:06:24.190> so<00:06:24.610> worth<00:06:25.029> of<00:06:25.210> use<00:06:25.449> it<00:06:25.719> sometimes<00:06:26.620> goes

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
or so worth of use it sometimes goes

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.670 
or so worth of use it sometimes goes
right<00:06:27.129> back<00:06:27.279> to<00:06:27.460> the<00:06:27.550> same<00:06:27.729> problem<00:06:27.879> so<00:06:28.870> when

right back to the same problem so when

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.499 
right back to the same problem so when
working<00:06:29.860> on<00:06:30.130> anything<00:06:30.370> make<00:06:31.000> sure<00:06:31.149> you<00:06:31.300> do<00:06:31.389> it

right the first time

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.250 
right the first time
