00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello very good everyone welcome to me 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.900
 channel to those who do not know and you do not have 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.450
 seen you never have enough there 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.939
 videos of reviews and nothing today I bring you 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.680
 this pieces but pieces of 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.680
 guitar gibson les paul fair 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.369
 we dedicate the model is the 50th anniversary 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.810
 from the 1960's I think it's no longer 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.640
 you will not find it in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.099
 stores as I understand it does not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 go to send zillions of messages 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.940
 after that because I have found 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.949
 because I'm not a specialist either 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.260
 I have as I read it is not found in 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.800
 stores comparing the price with a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.650
 What does a gibson les paul custom cost? 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.170
 We take that well over three thousand 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.059
 four hundred-odd euros nearly two 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.210
 thousand 500 euros what would it cost in his 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.210
 day 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.250
 and nothing to tell you if a couple of little things and nothing 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.240
 that you see the sound that listens to it most 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.980
 that everything is what I want the 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.630
 listen and you think and of you 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.940
 sound quality and all that I'm 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.950
 recording on base 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.590
 let's say with a mic my amplifier that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.660
 it's a marshall valve state after 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.330
 I teach if I do a nightmare for 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.970
 that you see it and I hope that it is well captured 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.970
 the sound if you see me weird with half 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.530
 head cut or things like that is not that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.600
 put the plan and I could not put it more 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.000
 far so forgive yourself let's go to heras 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.910
 so first of the guitar as you see the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.720
 typical simbolito del just around here 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.370
 behind 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.800
 Yes I can see 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.990
 the serial number I do not know if you see it 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:45.470
 good the body of the custom with the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.510
 finished in goal that is to say it has both 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.210
 pills this is one for the cowboy 1 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.740
 and this is a part of bakker 2 is not a 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.050
 gene so from what I understand 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.390
 sound a little several look alike 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.040
 very much but it sounds a little more garish 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.040
 than the previous 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.170
 the body according to state looking no 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.450
 found no information in 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.940
 Spanish but if a state looking at the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.020
 gibson page and that said that they were 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.330
 and the neck of the tuning fork let's say nothing 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.790
 I want to teach if the sound a little bit 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.800
 in distortion in the channel 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.800
 clean so that the others 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.090
 in the clover pill 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.430
 or not 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.060
 or not 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.450
 two 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.640
 do not 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.640
 x 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.610
 let's see a combined of the two 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.610
 pills 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.240
 and now to the mast pill I'm going to 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.320
 play something more classic so you can see the 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.320
 variety that has and everything 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.310
 there you have it in the clean channel sounds 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.160
 very, very nice, very clean 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.220
 no ordinary dirt for what 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.300
 costs and for the gay brand not 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.280
 should be 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.430
 nothing worse we will see the channel 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.300
 distortion is worth 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.300
 good 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.230
 r 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.480
 and 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.710
 and 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.910
 all right 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:26.929
 you in the neck pickup we 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.929
 to see the combination of the two pills 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.580
 and 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.520
 and 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.690
 and on the bridge pickup 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.690

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.940
 Y 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.810

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.150
 guitar is a piece but little of 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.250

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.900
