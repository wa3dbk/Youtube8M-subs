00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this is a new blades wolf math I just

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.780 
this is a new blades wolf math I just
finished<00:00:03.840> creating<00:00:04.500> and<00:00:05.069> it's<00:00:05.549> just<00:00:05.730> a

made<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.439> mold<00:00:28.680> for<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.490> made<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.150> own

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
made a mold for it and made my own

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.749 
made a mold for it and made my own
version<00:00:31.009> so<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.070> latex

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
version so the latex

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.750 
version so the latex
I<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.210> sculpey<00:00:33.750> was<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.620> sculpey<00:00:35.130> epoxy

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
I have sculpey was it sculpey epoxy

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.139 
I have sculpey was it sculpey epoxy
sculpey<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.870> create<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.579> structure<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.910> so

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
sculpey to create a structure for it so

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.360 
sculpey to create a structure for it so
it's<00:00:39.450> firm<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:39.840> soft<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.710> same<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.160> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it's firm but soft the same time it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.180 
it's firm but soft the same time it
feels<00:00:41.579> realistic<00:00:42.440> as<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.710> see<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> also

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
feels realistic as you see I also

installed<00:00:45.050> whiskers<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.100> muzzle<00:00:47.309> area

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
installed whiskers on the muzzle area

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.790 
installed whiskers on the muzzle area
and<00:00:48.379> those<00:00:49.379> are<00:00:49.590> actually<00:00:50.570> horse<00:00:51.570> hairs<00:00:51.809> black

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and those are actually horse hairs black
