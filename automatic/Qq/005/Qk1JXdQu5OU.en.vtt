are also engaged with a population

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.460 
are also engaged with a population
within<00:01:59.440> our<00:01:59.590> community<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.399> very<00:02:00.820> often

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
within our community is very often

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.630 
within our community is very often
overlooked<00:02:02.470> forgotten<00:02:02.799> about<00:02:03.310> and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
overlooked forgotten about and

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.889 
overlooked forgotten about and
misunderstood<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.470> journey<00:02:05.830> of<00:02:06.899> changing

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
misunderstood so the journey of changing

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.830 
misunderstood so the journey of changing
the<00:02:08.050> world<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.679> we<00:02:08.800> all<00:02:09.039> want<00:02:09.550> has<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.539> start

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
the world that we all want has to start

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.630 
the world that we all want has to start
within<00:02:11.050> yourself<00:02:11.680> so<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.010> change<00:02:12.459> yourself

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
within yourself so you change yourself

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.300 
within yourself so you change yourself
and<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.600> can<00:02:13.780> lead<00:02:14.019> by<00:02:14.200> example<00:02:14.350> within<00:02:15.130> that

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and you can lead by example within that

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.759 
and you can lead by example within that
and<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.640> think<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.989> organization<00:02:17.739> is

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
and I think that the organization is

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.770 
and I think that the organization is
supported<00:02:18.459> by<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.640> slice<00:02:18.970> office<00:02:19.540> and

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
supported by the slice office and

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.500 
supported by the slice office and
engagement<00:02:20.470> on<00:02:20.590> campus<00:02:21.239> start<00:02:22.239> these

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
engagement on campus start these

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.930 
engagement on campus start these
conversations<00:02:23.440> community<00:02:24.100> engagement<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:24.700> so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
conversations community engagement is so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.740 
conversations community engagement is so
