00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
that have been cloned off of this one

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.110 
that have been cloned off of this one
right<00:04:07.579> ran<00:04:08.680> he<00:04:09.680> comes<00:04:09.919> was<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:10.939> one<00:04:11.209> and<00:04:11.599> he<00:04:13.120> oh

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.229 
he could he got to the point where he
could<00:04:17.329> see<00:04:17.630> that<00:04:17.900> he<00:04:18.049> was<00:04:18.079> just<00:04:18.769> a<00:04:18.949> little<00:04:19.239> more

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
could see that he was just a little more

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.640 
could see that he was just a little more
and<00:04:20.419> he'd<00:04:20.630> be<00:04:20.780> able<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:21.049> take<00:04:21.259> it<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.590> ride

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
and he'd be able to take it for a ride

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.770 
and he'd be able to take it for a ride
so<00:04:22.099> he<00:04:22.250> just<00:04:22.430> starts<00:04:22.759> throwing<00:04:23.000> stuff<00:04:23.270> on<00:04:23.509> and

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
so he just starts throwing stuff on and

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.830 
so he just starts throwing stuff on and
cutting<00:04:24.199> corners<00:04:24.469> and<00:04:24.949> and<00:04:25.509> doing<00:04:26.509> all<00:04:26.659> manner

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
cutting corners and and doing all manner

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.390 
cutting corners and and doing all manner
of<00:04:27.050> stuff<00:04:27.380> and

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
of stuff and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.180 
of stuff and
buried<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.479> project<00:04:29.960> along<00:04:30.259> buried<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:30.830> along

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
buried the project along buried it along

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.600 
buried the project along buried it along
rather<00:04:31.580> than<00:04:32.110> take<00:04:33.110> his<00:04:33.350> time<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.889> do<00:04:34.580> it

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
rather than take his time and do it

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.070 
rather than take his time and do it
right<00:04:34.759> and<00:04:35.270> so<00:04:36.020> after<00:04:36.820> he<00:04:37.820> sold<00:04:38.240> the<00:04:38.539> bike<00:04:38.750> to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
right and so after he sold the bike to

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.029 
right and so after he sold the bike to
this<00:04:39.229> other<00:04:39.470> fellow<00:04:41.320> the<00:04:42.320> other<00:04:42.440> guy<00:04:42.650> wanted

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
this other fellow the other guy wanted

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.080 
this other fellow the other guy wanted
to<00:04:43.280> know<00:04:43.820> if<00:04:45.009> he<00:04:46.009> could<00:04:46.220> come<00:04:46.460> down<00:04:46.850> and

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
to know if he could come down and

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.480 
to know if he could come down and

that's<00:05:24.349> what<00:05:24.560> happened<00:05:24.740> and<00:05:25.220> then<00:05:25.370> uh<00:05:26.349> and<00:05:27.349> it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
that's what happened and then uh and it

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.589 
that's what happened and then uh and it
was<00:05:27.620> popular<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.130> set<00:05:28.430> this<00:05:28.550> motor<00:05:28.880> in<00:05:29.090> an

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:29.599 
was popular to set this motor in an

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.930 
was popular to set this motor in an
early<00:05:30.050> Indian<00:05:30.470> chassis<00:05:30.889> for<00:05:31.070> racing<00:05:31.430> yeah

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
early Indian chassis for racing yeah

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.960 
early Indian chassis for racing yeah
yeah<00:05:32.479> that<00:05:33.169> that<00:05:33.530> engine<00:05:33.949> would<00:05:34.130> go<00:05:34.490> in<00:05:34.669> well

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
yeah that that engine would go in well

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.240 
yeah that that engine would go in well
it<00:05:35.510> had<00:05:35.660> probably<00:05:36.199> even<00:05:36.349> go<00:05:36.590> into<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.949> Thor

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
it had probably even go into that Thor

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.159 
it had probably even go into that Thor
chassis<00:05:37.789> although<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.240> Thor<00:05:38.599> chassis<00:05:39.080> is

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
chassis although the Thor chassis is

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.339 
chassis although the Thor chassis is
pretty<00:05:39.410> light<00:05:39.740> yes<00:05:40.570> but<00:05:41.570> the<00:05:41.840> Indian<00:05:42.139> loop

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
pretty light yes but the Indian loop

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:48.000 
pretty light yes but the Indian loop
frame<00:05:43.479> 1909<00:05:44.479> was<00:05:44.870> a<00:05:44.900> was<00:05:45.800> a<00:05:45.830> rigid<00:05:46.280> frame<00:05:46.550> and

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
frame 1909 was a was a rigid frame and

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.640 
frame 1909 was a was a rigid frame and
cyclone<00:05:49.010> engine<00:05:49.430> drops<00:05:50.419> right<00:05:50.599> in<00:05:50.810> Wow<00:05:51.260> and

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
cyclone engine drops right in Wow and

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.529 
cyclone engine drops right in Wow and
it's<00:05:52.159> doubt<00:05:52.370> framed<00:05:52.699> for<00:05:52.940> racing<00:05:53.300> but<00:05:53.419> it's

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
it's doubt framed for racing but it's

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:58.350 
it's doubt framed for racing but it's
yeah<00:05:53.960> yeah<00:05:54.740> stop<00:05:55.400> frame<00:05:55.760> in<00:05:56.060> fact<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:58.130> other

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
yeah yeah stop frame in fact the other

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.719 
yeah yeah stop frame in fact the other
racer<00:05:59.360> that<00:06:00.020> Marion<00:06:00.979> Dietrich's<00:06:01.400> had<00:06:01.580> the

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
racer that Marion Dietrich's had the

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:04.180 
racer that Marion Dietrich's had the
other<00:06:01.849> cyclone<00:06:02.389> was<00:06:02.659> a<00:06:03.020> cyclone<00:06:03.650> engine<00:06:04.070> in

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
other cyclone was a cyclone engine in

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.399 
other cyclone was a cyclone engine in
onions<00:06:04.520> and<00:06:04.699> frame<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.300> even<00:06:05.750> had<00:06:05.900> the<00:06:06.110> end<00:06:06.229> in

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
onions and frame it even had the end in

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.589 
onions and frame it even had the end in
front<00:06:06.680> fork<00:06:07.010> and<00:06:07.310> gas<00:06:08.150> tank<00:06:09.669> well<00:06:10.669> if<00:06:11.210> we<00:06:11.419> get

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
front fork and gas tank well if we get

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.450 
front fork and gas tank well if we get
that<00:06:11.780> machine<00:06:11.990> in<00:06:12.320> time<00:06:12.560> we<00:06:12.889> might<00:06:13.220> come<00:06:13.400> up

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
that machine in time we might come up

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.439 
that machine in time we might come up
and<00:06:14.320> take<00:06:15.320> some<00:06:15.590> footage<00:06:16.010> of<00:06:16.250> that<00:06:17.030> rare
