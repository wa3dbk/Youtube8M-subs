are very young larvae I don't know

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.700 
are very young larvae I don't know
whether<00:00:19.510> that<00:00:19.619> answer<00:00:20.619> disease<00:00:20.980> goes<00:00:21.310> up<00:00:22.710> so

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710

like this you know with that many bees
in<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.699> hive<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:44.230> are<00:00:44.440> accustomed<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:45.449> being

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
in the hive they are accustomed to being

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.720 
in the hive they are accustomed to being
nudged<00:00:46.960> from<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.649> side<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.140> if<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.890> go<00:00:50.920> put<00:00:51.550> my

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
nudged from the side so if I go put my

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.770 
nudged from the side so if I go put my
finger<00:00:52.149> if<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.480> want<00:00:52.719> to<00:00:52.899> create<00:00:53.230> this<00:00:53.469> area<00:00:54.430> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
finger if I want to create this area I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.349 
finger if I want to create this area I
can<00:00:55.780> notch<00:00:56.019> on<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.379> side<00:00:56.699> see<00:00:57.699> they<00:00:58.149> don't

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
can notch on the side see they don't

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.619 
can notch on the side see they don't
sting<00:00:58.780> they<00:00:59.079> just<00:00:59.350> move<00:00:59.620> away<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:01.120> that's

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
sting they just move away because that's

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.760 
sting they just move away because that's
normal<00:01:02.410> for<00:01:02.440> them<00:01:02.949> to<00:01:03.760> be<00:01:03.969> not<00:01:04.239> as<00:01:04.510> soon<00:01:05.260> as<00:01:05.560> I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
normal for them to be not as soon as I

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.789 
normal for them to be not as soon as I
would<00:01:06.159> squeeze<00:01:06.640> them<00:01:06.939> then<00:01:07.720> tasting<00:01:08.200> because

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
would squeeze them then tasting because

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.609 
would squeeze them then tasting because
that's<00:01:09.189> the<00:01:09.340> only<00:01:10.890> defense<00:01:11.890> they<00:01:12.280> have<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.990> if

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
that's the only defense they have but if

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.719 
that's the only defense they have but if
you<00:01:14.830> not<00:01:15.130> jump<00:01:15.430> from<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.180> side<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:18.340> will<00:01:18.520> not

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
you not jump from the side they will not

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.719 
you not jump from the side they will not
sting<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.390> see<00:01:20.229> a<00:01:20.259> few<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:20.829> are<00:01:21.009> very<00:01:21.220> like

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
sting I see a few that are very like

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.760 
sting I see a few that are very like
it's<00:01:22.450> almost<00:01:22.630> like<00:01:22.930> they<00:01:23.079> might<00:01:23.290> be<00:01:23.439> doing<00:01:23.590> a

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
it's almost like they might be doing a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.200 
it's almost like they might be doing a
waggle<00:01:24.130> dance<00:01:24.159> do<00:01:24.729> you<00:01:24.820> think<00:01:25.000> it's<00:01:25.150> possible

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
waggle dance do you think it's possible

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.499 
waggle dance do you think it's possible
that<00:01:25.869> it's<00:01:26.799> all<00:01:27.009> doable<00:01:27.340> wagger<00:01:27.759> and<00:01:28.119> that's

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
that it's all doable wagger and that's

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.539 
that it's all doable wagger and that's
how<00:01:28.930> they<00:01:29.110> communicate<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.920> each<00:01:29.950> other<00:01:30.250> where

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
how they communicate to each other where

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.010 
how they communicate to each other where
there's<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:32.399> there's<00:01:33.399> flowers<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.659> source

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
there's a there's flowers and a source

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.069 
there's a there's flowers and a source
of<00:01:35.290> nectar<00:01:35.649> and<00:01:36.220> so<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.240> depending<00:01:37.780> on<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
of nectar and so that depending on the

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.550 
of nectar and so that depending on the
angle<00:01:38.979> of<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.430> waggle<00:01:40.030> right<00:01:40.360> they<00:01:40.990> tell<00:01:41.290> them

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
angle of the waggle right they tell them

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.139 
angle of the waggle right they tell them
each<00:01:41.740> area<00:01:41.979> where<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.430> downloads<00:01:42.909> the

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
each area where the downloads the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.469 
each area where the downloads the
distance<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:44.409> they<00:01:45.060> communicated<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
distance so they communicated the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.889 
distance so they communicated the
direction<00:01:47.320> and<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.850> distance<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.070> go<00:01:51.899> 200

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
direction and the distance so go 200

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.319 
direction and the distance so go 200
yards<00:01:53.350> in<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:53.710> direction<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.880> will<00:01:55.000> find

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
yards in this direction you will find

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.840 
yards in this direction you will find
something<00:01:55.810> yeah<00:01:56.409> let's<00:01:56.649> see<00:01:56.829> if<00:01:56.979> any<00:01:57.189> see<00:01:57.670> this
