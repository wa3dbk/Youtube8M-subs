00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.830
 You are already several victor plus it is a game 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.630
 difficult to speak 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.929
 on the one hand it is exactly what 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.670
 I expected strength from him but on the other hand 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.220
 he is exactly what he hoped he would 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.560
 was the superficial game with mechanics 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.180
 strange and absolutely full of fans 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.949
 Serbs do not think about the day. 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 replace as a fighting game 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.449
 I think of it as a game of action or for 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.009
 playing with friends is better this way 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.380
 this is a game that deserves applause 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.140
 just because you left Japan 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.059
 to the obvious early on when the game 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.100
 already have a wall of indications 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.680
 four sites of all these characters 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 each one coming from an anime series 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.489
 different mangos each with a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.090
 different company responsible for its 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.820
 brand 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.980
 Believe it's a nightmare to translate and bring 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.480
 out of japan a title like this 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.180
 but even so the game is not 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.129
 necessarily the simplistic system 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.039
 how to give you a series of attacks 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.870
 weak and strong and a special button 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.030
 these three forms of attack in three 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.049
 variations and you can combine the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.510
 as you wish 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.310
 and this is the combat system for all 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.110
 the characters is not much different from 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.049
 games such as the series of very 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.450
 naruto but does not have the same polishing 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 ugly or necessarily bad 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.930
 to the animations characters are good but 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.840
 are not great 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.970
 all the voices of the original voice actors 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 but with few repeated several times 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.549
 during combat in the exact same tone of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.200
 voice over again again excepting 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.210
 almost all the names used in 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.490
 characters you will hear all that 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.500
 have to listen for a few hours 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 visually the game changes between moments 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.090
 in which it is beautiful and visually pleasing 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.770
 while in others there is so much 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.170
 happening on the screen that pollution 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.619
 simply makes it impossible to 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.200
 to understand what is happening is easy 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.659
 the camera on your enemy but not the 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.820
 your character's orientation by doing 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.100
 that until you get used to it perfectly 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.439
 often you attack where the enemy 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.149
 not in a design decision 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.550
 completely absurd when your 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.590
 enemy takes damage he flashes for some 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.959
 seconds becoming totally insensitive 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.540
 forcing you to hit and run time 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.459
 all 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.799
 because even though you can not attack it 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.540
 he can attack himself during his 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.790
 animations special attacks the enemy 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.620
 can interrupt and break your attack 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.780
 with their attack making the character 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.579
 distance has an advantage of 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.659
 unequals about characters struggling 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.579
 Body body 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.129
 at the same time since the enemy has 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.599
 You do not eat anything you do. 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.250
 break or late on line 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.980
 this makes every fight a tug-of-war 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.239
 from 2 to 2 which is sometimes fun and 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.489
 in the next second it becomes 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.230
 terribly frustrating to win a 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.510
 team needs to defeat opponent three 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.099
 times which means that sometimes it goes 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.260
 lose a fight because the computer 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.239
 he decided to attack his ally too 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.040
 controlled by the computer but even with 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.319
 all these problems the game offers 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.540
 four modes of adventure each one only 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.549
 a variation of the same game mode 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.590
 besides other modes a system of 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.870
 accounting for characters by letters 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.669
 the online- level gaming system at 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.099
 possibility to play with friends 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:11.799
 there is a lot of content here 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.680
 made for fans and is exactly the point 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.970
 principle for a general public this does not 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.590
 It is a game that is worth 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.959
 but it was not made for the public 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.209
 Overall it was made for fans of the champ 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.030
 were those of the series that always wanted 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.669
 have a wilson team that is in go cup 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.599
 for this audience you will have fun 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:33.489
 even if a little just do not run to 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.650
 pick up this game at launch 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.780
 I expect a discount for the reviews and 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.569
 culture of the world of games is 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.430
 in the channel you want to sweat my name was the ju 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.430
 I'll see you in the next video.
