00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
cut or blister or something on there

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.770 
cut or blister or something on there
it's<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.520> difficult<00:03:08.760> or<00:03:09.270> very

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it's just difficult or very

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.080 
it's just difficult or very
uncomfortable<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.710> push<00:03:10.920> down<00:03:11.220> as<00:03:11.520> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
uncomfortable to push down as you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.270 
uncomfortable to push down as you
normally<00:03:12.210> would<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:13.110> button<00:03:13.350> lock<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.740> pretty

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
normally would the button lock is pretty

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.280 
normally would the button lock is pretty
versatile<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.360> again<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.990> could<00:03:16.140> try<00:03:16.260> that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
versatile so again you could try that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.020 
versatile so again you could try that
with<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.770> access<00:03:17.100> lock<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.820> little

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
with the access lock it's a little

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.310 
with the access lock it's a little
different<00:03:18.210> with<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.510> access<00:03:18.780> lock<00:03:18.990> instead

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
different with the access lock instead

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.480 
different with the access lock instead
of<00:03:19.410> pushing<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.740> button<00:03:20.010> which<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.430> be

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
of pushing a button which is going to be

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.790 
of pushing a button which is going to be
super<00:03:20.790> easy<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.600> do<00:03:21.750> you're<00:03:22.380> going<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.560> have<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
super easy to do you're going to have to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.890 
super easy to do you're going to have to
you<00:03:23.280> know<00:03:23.340> train<00:03:23.670> that<00:03:23.850> muscle<00:03:24.240> to<00:03:24.270> pull<00:03:24.690> back

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
you know train that muscle to pull back

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.050 
you know train that muscle to pull back
I<00:03:25.200> don't<00:03:25.650> know<00:03:25.800> if<00:03:25.890> naturally<00:03:26.370> people<00:03:26.790> have

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
I don't know if naturally people have

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.510 
I don't know if naturally people have
enough<00:03:27.330> strength<00:03:27.600> to<00:03:27.690> do<00:03:27.930> that<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:29.190> Omega

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
enough strength to do that that Omega

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
spring is a little bit tough in that

don't<00:03:34.410> give<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> try<00:03:34.770> something<00:03:35.340> to

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
don't give it a try something to

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.550 
don't give it a try something to
practice<00:03:35.520> but<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.150> button<00:03:36.360> locks

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
practice but with the button locks

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.470 
practice but with the button locks
perfectly<00:03:37.560> able<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.520> do<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:38.850> very<00:03:39.090> easy<00:03:39.330> to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
perfectly able to do that very easy to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.180 
perfectly able to do that very easy to
do<00:03:39.660> all<00:03:40.380> right<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.680> want<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.010> show<00:03:41.100> you

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
do all right so I just want to show you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.100 
do all right so I just want to show you
that<00:03:41.310> technique<00:03:41.700> there<00:03:41.970> this<00:03:42.840> doesn't

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
that technique there this doesn't

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.810 
that technique there this doesn't
necessarily<00:03:43.200> come<00:03:43.740> from<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:44.070> idea<00:03:44.310> using<00:03:44.700> it

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
necessarily come from the idea using it

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.000 
necessarily come from the idea using it
in<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.000> manual<00:03:45.390> sense<00:03:45.720> this<00:03:46.350> comes<00:03:46.650> from<00:03:46.830> me

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
in a manual sense this comes from me

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.880 
in a manual sense this comes from me
using<00:03:47.430> automatics<00:03:48.240> and<00:03:48.570> here's<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.500> cheapo

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
using automatics and here's a cheapo

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.290 
using automatics and here's a cheapo
automatic<00:03:50.430> but<00:03:50.580> basically<00:03:51.030> it's<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.240> same

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
automatic but basically it's the same

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.180 
automatic but basically it's the same
thing<00:03:51.480> it's<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.900> button<00:03:52.230> lock<00:03:52.410> only<00:03:52.860> there<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.160> a

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
thing it's a button lock only there is a

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.860 
thing it's a button lock only there is a
coil<00:03:53.520> spring<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:53.970> here<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.360> when<00:03:54.480> you<00:03:54.540> push<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
coil spring in here so when you push the

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.630 
coil spring in here so when you push the
button<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.860> know<00:03:56.190> they're<00:03:56.340> spring

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
button that you know they're spring

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.550 
button that you know they're spring
tension<00:03:57.090> throws<00:03:57.480> that<00:03:57.630> blade<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.440> is

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
tension throws that blade out so this is

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.190 
tension throws that blade out so this is
a<00:03:58.590> full<00:03:58.860> automatic<00:03:59.130> knife<00:03:59.780> alright<00:04:00.780> but<00:04:01.020> I

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
a full automatic knife alright but I

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.480 
a full automatic knife alright but I
still<00:04:01.590> play<00:04:01.680> around<00:04:01.890> with<00:04:02.010> autos<00:04:02.310> all<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
still play around with autos all the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.430 
still play around with autos all the
time<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.480> reverse<00:04:03.690> grip<00:04:03.990> I<00:04:04.200> would<00:04:04.320> do

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
time and in the reverse grip I would do

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.620 
time and in the reverse grip I would do
this<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.890> same<00:04:05.100> technique<00:04:05.490> and<00:04:05.730> shoot<00:04:06.450> that

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
this and same technique and shoot that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.690 
this and same technique and shoot that
out<00:04:06.780> alright<00:04:07.380> so<00:04:07.440> if<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.980> were<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.280> carry<00:04:08.490> this

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
out alright so if you were to carry this

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.930 
out alright so if you were to carry this
in<00:04:09.200> Reverse<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.920> know<00:04:11.250> position<00:04:11.550> this<00:04:11.820> of

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
in Reverse you know position this of

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.520 
in Reverse you know position this of
course<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.240> tipped<00:04:12.450> down<00:04:12.630> but<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:13.050> don't<00:04:13.410> I've

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
course is tipped down but I don't I've

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.810 
course is tipped down but I don't I've
seen<00:04:13.709> your<00:04:13.800> hand<00:04:13.950> whatever<00:04:14.250> it's<00:04:14.459> just<00:04:14.610> fun<00:04:14.790> to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
seen your hand whatever it's just fun to

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.789 
seen your hand whatever it's just fun to
reach<00:04:15.060> down<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.330> shoot<00:04:16.080> out<00:04:16.200> like<00:04:16.230> that

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
reach down and shoot out like that

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.590 
reach down and shoot out like that
for<00:04:17.040> a<00:04:17.070> reverse<00:04:17.280> grip<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:18.060> that's<00:04:18.180> where<00:04:18.330> I<00:04:18.359> got

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
for a reverse grip so that's where I got

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.660 
for a reverse grip so that's where I got
the<00:04:18.720> technique<00:04:19.049> from<00:04:19.170> originally<00:04:19.770> but<00:04:20.340> as<00:04:20.520> you

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
the technique from originally but as you

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.820 
the technique from originally but as you
can<00:04:20.820> see<00:04:21.000> obviously<00:04:21.359> works<00:04:21.900> just<00:04:22.109> fine<00:04:22.290> with<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
can see obviously works just fine with a

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.940 
can see obviously works just fine with a
manual<00:04:23.130> version<00:04:23.520> as<00:04:23.640> well<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:24.840> get<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.229> same

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
manual version as well to get that same

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.060 
manual version as well to get that same
grip<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.370> same<00:04:26.520> position

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
grip and same position

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.520 
grip and same position
