futuristic or his modern kitchen um and
here<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:22.369> from<00:00:23.369> what<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> understood<00:00:25.519> basically

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
here is from what I understood basically

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.750 
here is from what I understood basically
it<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.539> tells<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.410> much<00:00:28.760> electricity

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
it this tells you how much electricity

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.410 
it this tells you how much electricity
is<00:00:30.390> being<00:00:30.570> generated<00:00:31.099> by<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.730> photovoltaic

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
is being generated by the photovoltaic

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.729 
is being generated by the photovoltaic
pounds<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.860> make<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> home's<00:00:35.880> roof<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
pounds that make up the home's roof and

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.950 
pounds that make up the home's roof and
because<00:00:37.739> today<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> fairly<00:00:38.730> cloudy<00:00:39.239> day<00:00:39.719> in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
because today is a fairly cloudy day in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.240 
because today is a fairly cloudy day in
Japan<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:41.120> believe<00:00:42.120> today's<00:00:42.829> generation<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
Japan I believe today's generation is

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.810 
Japan I believe today's generation is
only<00:00:44.460> half<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.180> kilowatt<00:00:45.890> these<00:00:46.890> panels<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.700> am

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
only half a kilowatt these panels I am

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.260 
only half a kilowatt these panels I am
told<00:00:48.090> are<00:00:48.450> able<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.469> produce<00:00:49.680> 14<00:00:50.520> kilowatts

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
told are able to produce 14 kilowatts

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.340 
told are able to produce 14 kilowatts
which<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.809> about<00:00:52.079> three<00:00:52.500> times<00:00:52.860> what<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> normal

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
which is about three times what a normal

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.290 
which is about three times what a normal
solar<00:00:55.350> panel<00:00:55.829> array<00:00:55.980> would<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> normal

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
solar panel array would be on a normal

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.959 
solar panel array would be on a normal
home<00:00:57.930> in<00:00:58.559> Japan<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.010> even<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> United

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.569 
home in Japan or even in the United
States<00:01:00.379> but<00:01:01.379> despite<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.010> fact<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.489> has

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
States but despite the fact that it has

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600 
States but despite the fact that it has
a<00:01:02.609> potential<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> create<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> 14

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
a potential to create some out of 14

generate 14a kilowatts of energy today

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.149 
generate 14a kilowatts of energy today
it's<00:01:07.890> only<00:01:08.130> point<00:01:08.460> 4<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.380> means<00:01:10.710> that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
it's only point 4 and so that means that

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.670 
it's only point 4 and so that means that
today<00:01:12.439> this<00:01:13.439> home<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.770> actually<00:01:14.250> buying<00:01:14.850> about

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
today this home is actually buying about

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
today this home is actually buying about
4.3<00:01:16.680> kilowatts<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.549> energy<00:01:18.320> from<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> power

not living up to its name but other days
I'm<00:01:31.500> told<00:01:31.799> when<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.280> sunny<00:01:32.579> outside<00:01:33.320> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320

does live up to its name and it balances

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.470 
does live up to its name and it balances
out<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.950> end<00:01:38.130> apparently<00:01:38.869> and

out in the end apparently and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.090

he<00:01:40.600> actually<00:01:40.780> generates<00:01:41.530> more<00:01:41.710> electricity

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
he actually generates more electricity

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.560 
he actually generates more electricity
than<00:01:42.370> it<00:01:42.580> consumes<00:01:42.670> on<00:01:43.240> some<00:01:43.450> days<00:01:45.390> i'm<00:01:46.390> going

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
your clothes to recycle and I guess

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.550 
your clothes to recycle and I guess
after<00:02:35.800> about<00:02:36.100> an<00:02:36.250> hour<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.970> finished<00:02:37.560> so

after about an hour it's finished so

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.510 
after about an hour it's finished so
that's<00:02:38.740> one<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.070> most<00:02:39.250> interesting

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
that's one of the most interesting

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.400 
that's one of the most interesting
things<00:02:39.880> about<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.270> homes<00:02:40.510> is<00:02:40.810> this<00:02:41.170> type<00:02:41.380> of

technology<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.520> you<00:02:42.700> find<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.060> type<00:02:43.240> of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
technology and you find this type of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.060 
technology and you find this type of
technology<00:02:43.420> all<00:02:43.960> over<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> home<00:02:44.440> which<00:02:44.590> is<00:02:44.980> a

kind<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.580> cutting-edge<00:02:46.150> Japanese<00:02:46.810> technology

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
kind of cutting-edge Japanese technology

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.010 
kind of cutting-edge Japanese technology
let's<00:02:48.580> see<00:02:48.730> another<00:02:49.030> thing<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:52.510> has

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
let's see another thing that really has

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.420 
let's see another thing that really has
nothing<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.890> do<00:02:54.070> with<00:02:54.490> carbon<00:02:56.430> but

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
nothing to do with carbon but

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.949 
nothing to do with carbon but
nonetheless<00:02:58.000> kind<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:59.700> exhibits<00:03:00.700> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
nonetheless kind of exhibits the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.260 
nonetheless kind of exhibits the
Japanese<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:01.989> kind<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.739> obsession<00:03:03.160> with<00:03:03.670> robots

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
Japanese a kind of obsession with robots

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.190 
Japanese a kind of obsession with robots
is<00:03:04.590> they<00:03:05.590> decided<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.130> put<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.640> seal<00:03:07.330> robot<00:03:07.900> in

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
is they decided to put a seal robot in

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.890 
is they decided to put a seal robot in
this<00:03:08.950> zero<00:03:09.250> emissions<00:03:09.610> home<00:03:09.820> has<00:03:10.480> nothing<00:03:10.810> to

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
this zero emissions home has nothing to

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.300 
this zero emissions home has nothing to
do<00:03:11.050> with<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.470> fact<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.800> there's<00:03:12.100> zero

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
do with the fact that there's zero

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.979 
do with the fact that there's zero
emissions<00:03:12.610> actually<00:03:12.880> it's<00:03:13.180> actually<00:03:13.360> plugged

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
emissions actually it's actually plugged

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.320 
emissions actually it's actually plugged
in<00:03:14.230> so<00:03:14.350> it's<00:03:14.470> actually<00:03:15.330> consuming

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
in so it's actually consuming

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.420 
in so it's actually consuming
electricity<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:17.140> probably<00:03:17.500> not<00:03:18.010> doing<00:03:18.220> such

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
electricity it's probably not doing such

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.979 
electricity it's probably not doing such
a<00:03:18.459> great<00:03:18.640> job<00:03:18.730> as<00:03:19.120> far<00:03:19.300> as<00:03:19.390> your<00:03:19.540> mission<00:03:19.840> but

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
a great job as far as your mission but

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.229 
a great job as far as your mission but
this<00:03:20.650> is<00:03:20.860> I<00:03:21.070> guess<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.459> pet<00:03:21.700> this<00:03:24.030> if<00:03:25.030> you

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
this is I guess if you pet this if you

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.720 
this is I guess if you pet this if you
test<00:03:25.510> his<00:03:25.780> he's<00:03:26.530> going<00:03:26.739> to<00:03:26.800> make<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.010> noise<00:03:27.310> be

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
test his he's going to make a noise be

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
test his he's going to make a noise be
this<00:03:28.060> little<00:03:28.209> seal<00:03:28.600> pup<00:03:28.900> will<00:03:29.140> make<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.290> noise

this little seal pup will make a noise

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.630 
this little seal pup will make a noise
uh-oh<00:03:31.750> there<00:03:32.170> he<00:03:32.200> goes<00:03:34.320> so<00:03:35.320> here<00:03:35.950> we<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.400> it

fascinating things about them ok now I'm
going<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.569> spray<00:03:53.780> water<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:54.680> I'm<00:03:55.340> going<00:03:55.459> to

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
going to spray water on I'm going to

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.630 
going to spray water on I'm going to
spray<00:03:55.700> water<00:03:55.760> on<00:03:56.209> this<00:03:56.660> wall<00:03:57.200> and<00:03:57.519> let's<00:03:58.519> see

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
spray water on this wall and let's see

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.300 
spray water on this wall and let's see
let's<00:03:58.790> go<00:03:59.000> over<00:03:59.510> Willard's<00:04:00.170> lit<00:04:00.860> up<00:04:02.980> now<00:04:03.980> as

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
let's go over Willard's lit up now as

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.910 
let's go over Willard's lit up now as
you<00:04:04.550> can<00:04:04.640> see<00:04:04.840> i'm<00:04:05.840> spraying<00:04:06.290> a<00:04:06.470> lot<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.739> water

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
you can see i'm spraying a lot of water

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.490 
you can see i'm spraying a lot of water
and<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:10.459> wall<00:04:10.700> is<00:04:11.150> actually<00:04:11.900> absorbing

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
and the wall is actually absorbing

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.009 
and the wall is actually absorbing
pretty<00:04:13.220> much<00:04:13.400> all<00:04:14.269> of<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.540> water<00:04:14.690> that<00:04:14.840> i'm

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
pretty much all of the water that i'm

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.650 
pretty much all of the water that i'm
spraying<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:16.000> now<00:04:17.000> see<00:04:17.150> it's<00:04:17.239> beating<00:04:17.540> up

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
spraying on now see it's beating up

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.979 
spraying on now see it's beating up
finally<00:04:18.260> but<00:04:19.060> it's<00:04:20.060> starting<00:04:20.389> to<00:04:20.600> disappear

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
finally but it's starting to disappear

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.409 
finally but it's starting to disappear
now<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.220> new<00:04:22.550> building<00:04:22.970> material<00:04:23.330> this

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
now this is a new building material this

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.350 
now this is a new building material this
is<00:04:23.479> made<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:24.169> was<00:04:24.650> told<00:04:24.889> of<00:04:25.190> ceramic<00:04:26.180> and

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
is made I was told of ceramic and

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.830 
is made I was told of ceramic and
plastics<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.639> it<00:04:28.639> is<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.090> humidity-controlled

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
plastics and it is a humidity-controlled

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.870 
plastics and it is a humidity-controlled
building<00:04:30.650> material<00:04:31.130> meaning<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.520> the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
building material meaning that the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.210 
building material meaning that the
humidity<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.479> the<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.020> house<00:04:33.860> is

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
humidity in the in the house is

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.629 
humidity in the in the house is
basically<00:04:35.139> soaked<00:04:36.139> up<00:04:36.320> into<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:36.740> material

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
basically soaked up into this material

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.690 
basically soaked up into this material
like<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.850> sponge<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:39.050> that<00:04:39.260> it's<00:04:39.590> drier<00:04:40.040> when

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
like a sponge so that it's drier when

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.340 
like a sponge so that it's drier when
it's<00:04:40.850> humid<00:04:40.970> outside<00:04:41.270> making<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.169> a<00:04:42.200> lot<00:04:42.320> more

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
it's humid outside making it a lot more

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.219 
it's humid outside making it a lot more
comfortable<00:04:42.710> inside<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:44.570> apparently<00:04:45.050> also
