00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.690
 today we are going to try the coulant of 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.840
 doctor &amp; decker chocolate 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.480
 to look inside the box come four 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.059
 aluminum molds to make the four 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.369
 that can be done and then two 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.199
 sachets one that is cocoa to melt the 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.320
 metallic and another that is the mix the 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.990
 prepared to that we'll have to add two 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.540
 cold eggs from the fridge a little bit 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.760
 butter and a little flour as it 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.950
 First, preheat the oven according to 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.660
 as now we are boiling water 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.570
 because we have to put in it the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.140
 aluminum bag at least cocoa 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.670
 for 10 minutes meanwhile as 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.070
 we have plenty of time to do the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.539
 mass we're putting butter in 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.010
 our molds we first put 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.949
 butter and then we're going to put 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.690
 flour is very important that we make 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.449
 this step because although the mold is 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.129
 aluminum the coulant should detach if 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.859
 no we are not going to get the final effect 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.889
 then to get it to take off 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.850
 well as any other cake what 

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:07.580
 said butter and flour 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.430
 we put flour in one of the molds 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.440
 we put it well on the sides and with the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.770
 excess flour will do the same 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:20.509
 with the other mold and so with the 4 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.009
 Well once we finish 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.149
 butter and flour the molds 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.189
 what we are going to do is start with the 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.259
 mix for that we throw the powders the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.479
 that come in the white envelope in a 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.579
 mixer because you have to beat it to 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.960
 high speed for two minutes this 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.229
 is another of the drawbacks of this 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.750
 mix that requires a lot of preparation is not 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.130
 fast and can not be done by hand 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.600
 then now we incorporate the two 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 Eggs that, as we have already said, must 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.140
 be cold that we had taken them from 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.209
 the fridge 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.009
 another issue is to look at this mixture later 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.020
 once it's beaten those two minutes 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.479
 we will incorporate cocoa 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.069
 incorporate the cocoa immediately after removing it from 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.780
 the little bag just take it out of the water 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.549
 hot at best it's better to wait for a 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.259
 little that tempers because the difference of 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.840
 temperatures between the mixture that was 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.579
 beating and cocoa made the cocoa 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.549
 it would solidify it was like the mixture 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.959
 Whipped was colder than cocoa and 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.959
 then as in cocoa to be a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.790
 substitute solidified very fast then 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.500
 to avoid this I would leave a little 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.349
 temper the cocoa although it does not put it in 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.940
 the instructions well then once 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.490
 we have incorporated cocoa to our 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.470
 mix what we do is beat again 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.080
 and I say there I stayed in the part of the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.570
 background of the blender the cocoa mixture 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.690
 a little hard I had to do it with the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.400
 spoon then good then nothing once 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.160
 beaten what we do is place in the 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.590
 molds a little more or less in half 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.530
 of the mold and we will put it in the oven 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.510
 we put in the oven in theory 8 minutes I 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.510
 to say that he does not have much to me and I left him 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.270
 10 minutes that happened when we took out 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.280
 oven because the result was not good 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.320
 see you had exploded because this 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.660
 it's because the oven was higher 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.510
 of what was owed and what made the dough 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.970
 had gone up very quickly and there was 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.220
 exploded the layer above there is 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.900
 leave the oven lower even though the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.550
 presentation was not good we hope the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.170
 10 minutes to cool down that we 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.840
 indicates the manufacturer and we unmold it 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.160
 we unmold it is demold perfectly or 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.380
 be that the presentation can be good 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.260
 if we accept with the temperature and now 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.080
 inside 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.670
 Well, there is not the liquid that should 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.140
 stay that is to say we spent time 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.819
 or we have not made two mistakes the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.159
 oven temperature and the time of 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.319
 oven the result in terms of flavor is 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.450
 Well, I liked it, we're going to give it a 7 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.250
 the landlords are better but this is 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.290
 well however I thought that this 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.510
 preparation is complicated to do and in addition 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.940
 you have to accept it in the oven 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.470
 has liked this tutorial give me 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.470
 like we will continue doing more
