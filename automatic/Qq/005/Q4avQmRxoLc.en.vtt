00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that so first you pick the background

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.820 
that so first you pick the background
then<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.390> pick<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.630> clock<00:01:24.840> she's<00:01:25.530> what<00:01:25.650> kind

then you pick the clock she's what kind

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.789 
then you pick the clock she's what kind
of<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.310> want<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:28.380> keep<00:01:28.620> in<00:01:28.740> mind

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
of do you want now keep in mind

of do you want now keep in mind
you're<00:01:29.070> only<00:01:29.159> choosing<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> clock<00:01:29.820> how<00:01:30.240> it's

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
you're only choosing the clock how it's

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.320 
you're only choosing the clock how it's
designed<00:01:30.659> because<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.710> clock<00:01:31.950> color<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
designed because the clock color and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.539 
designed because the clock color and
background<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:34.049> over<00:01:34.260> here<00:01:34.440> so<00:01:35.070> first<00:01:35.460> just

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
background is over here so first just

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.040 
background is over here so first just
with<00:01:35.760> clogged<00:01:36.030> let's<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.659> for

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
with clogged let's go for

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.150 
with clogged let's go for
this<00:01:37.800> one<00:01:37.980> then<00:01:38.940> we're<00:01:39.240> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.420> pick<00:01:40.160> the

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
this one then we're going to pick the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.380 
this one then we're going to pick the
background<00:01:41.550> of<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:41.910> we<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.090> change<00:01:42.300> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
background of it so we can change the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.870 
background of it so we can change the
colors<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.140> everything<00:01:43.200> like<00:01:43.440> that<00:01:43.610> again<00:01:44.610> we

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
color doesn't match that color so you

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.709 
color doesn't match that color so you
