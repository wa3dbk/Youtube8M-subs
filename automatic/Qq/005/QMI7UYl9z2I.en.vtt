00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.660
 beauty talks, I'm a hobby. 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.349
 Welcome to another video here in my 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.930
 channel 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.300
 today we are there with mario kart 8 a 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.510
 online match where I am recording and 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.420
 running game at 60 frames per second at 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.159
 new tool and youtube, right? 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.559
 Good how you know the tool 

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:48.320
 really brings improvements to gameplay stays 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.739
 much more fluid and this time it was the turn 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.170
 mario kart's 8th brought his mpb 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.750
 60 frames per second 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 the game gets much more fluid there in the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.070
 youtube you will enjoy it very much 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.019
 more of the quality of the games only 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.509
 Hope that I play gameplay of all 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.580
 games to 60 frames because the demand for 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.560
 much more time to edit a lot 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.140
 more time to render and much 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.210
 more computer processor then not 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.520
 I will not make all the videos to 60 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.130
 frames but what else to call me 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.649
 I'll be fine, I'll tell you what, today's video is 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.229
 more to show you there is to running 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.970
 mario kart 8 to 60 frames on youtube and 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.530
 that's the rest of the game 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.780
 and I was fifth if I did not fail to 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:34.420
 memory and that's it thanks a lot 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.420
 by the support of all, a hug and a bad 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.170
