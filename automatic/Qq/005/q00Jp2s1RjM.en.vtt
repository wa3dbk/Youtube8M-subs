 adding butter then a 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:37.129
 little by integrating the butter seems 

00:06:35.299 --> 00:06:39.409
 he can not grab it but he can 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:43.479

 facebook a lady and it gave me an emotion 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.409
 because he told me that he had made the thread 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.819

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:06.169
 worried because he hit a lot on 

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:07.580
 the kitchen but it had come out 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:11.050
 barbarian the mass that did not have to give 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.050
 no flour 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:27.110
 nor in the time tunnel that we can not 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.180
 have a psychiatrist for all 2004 by 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:33.990

 well I want to buy a lot of beating 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:08.750
 forward hit forwards and hit the 

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:08.750
 moment that one becomes discouraged 

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.430
 do not make it original 

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.699
 in something something is surely going to have 

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:19.810
 what to put but he knows that you're going to 

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:19.810
 discover after all
