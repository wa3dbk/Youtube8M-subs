Asian<00:01:57.210> made<00:01:57.390> bats<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:59.219> yeah<00:01:59.399> pretty<00:01:59.610> much<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
Asian made bats so yeah pretty much the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.109 
Asian made bats so yeah pretty much the
same<00:02:00.180> shape<00:02:00.630> across<00:02:01.500> all<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.280> ton<00:02:02.549> bats<00:02:02.790> which

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
same shape across all the ton bats which

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
same shape across all the ton bats which
is<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> criticism<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.259> mine

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
is a bit of a criticism of mine

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.350 
is a bit of a criticism of mine
we've<00:02:05.520> been<00:02:05.610> nice<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> bit<00:02:06.329> more

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
we've been nice to see a bit more

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.570 
we've been nice to see a bit more
imagination<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.439> originality<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.280> few

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
imagination but originality a few

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.479 
imagination but originality a few
different<00:02:08.910> shapes<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> range<00:02:10.250> but<00:02:11.250> there

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
different shapes in the range but there

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.790 
different shapes in the range but there
you<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.790> at<00:02:11.910> least<00:02:12.120> this

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
you go at least this

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.580 
you go at least this
shake<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.580> very<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:14.450> demand<00:02:14.720> run<00:02:15.260> because

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
shake is a very in demand run because

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.160 
shake is a very in demand run because
it's<00:02:15.830> mid<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.310> low<00:02:16.460> sweet<00:02:16.880> spot<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:17.930> great

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
it's mid to low sweet spot so it's great

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.380 
it's mid to low sweet spot so it's great
for<00:02:18.200> front<00:02:18.650> foot<00:02:18.860> play<00:02:19.100> especially<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.090> slow

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
for front foot play especially on slow

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.870

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
and low pitches the taller batsman as

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.370 
and low pitches the taller batsman as
well<00:02:23.090> we<00:02:23.240> need<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.450> balls<00:02:23.690> not<00:02:23.870> coming<00:02:24.140> up<00:02:24.230> too

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
well we need the balls not coming up too

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.160 
well we need the balls not coming up too
high<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.790> you're<00:02:25.940> getting<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.300> course<00:02:26.600> very

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
high and you're getting of course very

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.930 
high and you're getting of course very
thick<00:02:27.380> edges<00:02:27.590> in<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.860> very<00:02:28.040> high<00:02:28.190> spine<00:02:28.640> for<00:02:28.880> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
thick edges in a very high spine for the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.930 
thick edges in a very high spine for the
weight<00:02:29.530> this<00:02:30.530> one's<00:02:30.800> not<00:02:31.040> perhaps<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.670> best

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
weight this one's not perhaps the best

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.340 
weight this one's not perhaps the best
example<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.900> certainly<00:02:33.080> not<00:02:33.230> the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
example of that is certainly not the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.280 
example of that is certainly not the
biggest<00:02:33.710> run<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.220> I'll<00:02:34.430> show<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.730> anyway<00:02:35.290> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
biggest run but I'll show you anyway the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.400 
biggest run but I'll show you anyway the
edges<00:02:36.680> are<00:02:36.890> about<00:02:37.250> 35<00:02:37.850> mils<00:02:38.240> and<00:02:38.660> these<00:02:39.080> spines

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
edges are about 35 mils and these spines

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.520 
edges are about 35 mils and these spines
about<00:02:39.680> 59<00:02:40.280> 60<00:02:40.970> millimetres<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:42.290> fairly

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
about 59 60 millimetres so it's fairly

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.770 
about 59 60 millimetres so it's fairly
big<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.460> back<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.790> only<00:02:43.940> 2<00:02:44.240> pound<00:02:44.510> 9

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
big the back is only 2 pound 9

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.930 
big the back is only 2 pound 9
incidentally<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.770> not<00:02:45.890> not<00:02:46.190> bad<00:02:46.460> specs

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
incidentally so it's not not bad specs

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.840 
incidentally so it's not not bad specs
we<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.200> bigger<00:02:48.470> thumb<00:02:48.950> bats<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.550> lot<00:02:49.760> of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
we do have bigger thumb bats a lot of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.570 
we do have bigger thumb bats a lot of
them<00:02:49.970> are<00:02:50.060> bigger<00:02:50.210> than<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.460> but<00:02:52.460> yeah

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
them are bigger than this and but yeah

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
them are bigger than this and but yeah
just<00:02:52.760> bear<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.090> mind<00:02:53.180> they're<00:02:53.450> always

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
just bear that in mind they're always

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.720 
just bear that in mind they're always
always<00:02:54.080> big<00:02:54.410> but<00:02:54.620> they<00:02:54.740> pick<00:02:55.280> up<00:02:55.430> pretty<00:02:55.670> well

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
always big but they pick up pretty well

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.080 
always big but they pick up pretty well
and<00:02:56.240> like<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.170> said<00:02:57.290> it's<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.500> tip<00:02:57.680> pound<00:02:57.950> 9<00:02:58.250> and

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
and like I said it's a tip pound 9 and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.450 
and like I said it's a tip pound 9 and
it<00:02:59.240> feels<00:02:59.570> pretty<00:03:00.500> nicely<00:03:00.770> balanced<00:03:01.310> and

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
it feels pretty nicely balanced and

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.680 
it feels pretty nicely balanced and
actually<00:03:01.790> maybe<00:03:02.000> even<00:03:02.120> half<00:03:02.450> an<00:03:02.600> ounce

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
actually maybe even half an ounce

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.900 
actually maybe even half an ounce
lighter<00:03:03.050> than<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.380> is<00:03:03.530> the<00:03:04.250> fact<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.640> it's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
lighter than it is the fact that it's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.030 
lighter than it is the fact that it's
got<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.060> mid<00:03:05.300> to<00:03:05.480> those<00:03:05.630> sweets<00:03:05.990> but<00:03:06.350> yet<00:03:06.770> still

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
got a mid to those sweets but yet still

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.280 
got a mid to those sweets but yet still
feeling<00:03:07.580> pretty<00:03:07.700> balanced<00:03:08.330> impresses<00:03:08.930> me<00:03:09.080> I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
feeling pretty balanced impresses me I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.140 
feeling pretty balanced impresses me I
would<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:09.860> personally<00:03:10.460> out<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.730> second

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
would so personally out of the second

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.700 
would so personally out of the second
grip<00:03:11.330> cuz<00:03:12.020> that'll<00:03:12.200> improve<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.560> balance

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
grip cuz that'll improve the balance

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.060 
grip cuz that'll improve the balance
even<00:03:13.160> more<00:03:13.570> yeah<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:14.750> good<00:03:14.930> important<00:03:15.890> thing

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
even more yeah it's good important thing

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
about ton bats they've got low sweep

about ton bats they've got low sweep
sweet<00:03:18.200> spot<00:03:18.470> that<00:03:18.500> still<00:03:18.980> pick<00:03:19.250> up<00:03:19.430> well<00:03:19.700> the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
sweet spot that still pick up well the

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.150 
sweet spot that still pick up well the
grip<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:20.810> may<00:03:21.140> have<00:03:21.260> noticed<00:03:21.680> actually<00:03:22.070> this

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
grip you may have noticed actually this

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.910 
grip you may have noticed actually this

gladiating<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.170> max<00:03:39.350> power<00:03:39.590> have<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:40.190> scale

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
gladiating the max power have this scale

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.250 
gladiating the max power have this scale
a<00:03:40.610> little<00:03:41.120> snake<00:03:41.420> grip<00:03:41.720> whatever<00:03:41.870> you<00:03:42.050> want<00:03:42.200> to

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
a little snake grip whatever you want to

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.740 
a little snake grip whatever you want to
call<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.650> whereas<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:43.760> Heritage<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.480> also

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
call it whereas the Heritage and also

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.620 
call it whereas the Heritage and also
the<00:03:44.930> power<00:03:45.170> blaster<00:03:45.820> have<00:03:46.820> these<00:03:47.150> ripple

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
the power blaster have these ripple

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.920 
the power blaster have these ripple
grips<00:03:48.140> which<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:48.980> personally<00:03:49.550> prefer<00:03:49.970> I<00:03:50.390> prefer

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
grips which I personally prefer I prefer

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.280 
grips which I personally prefer I prefer
the<00:03:51.470> feel<00:03:51.800> on<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.459> hands<00:03:52.940> they<00:03:53.660> don't<00:03:53.930> kind<00:03:54.170> of

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
the feel on the hands they don't kind of

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.590 
the feel on the hands they don't kind of
dig<00:03:54.680> into<00:03:54.890> your<00:03:55.160> palms<00:03:55.520> quite<00:03:55.940> as<00:03:56.030> much<00:03:56.239> so<00:03:56.510> if

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
dig into your palms quite as much so if

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.420 
dig into your palms quite as much so if
it<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:56.900> think<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.320> batting<00:03:57.709> gloves<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.130> used

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
it I think the batting gloves that used

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.699 
it I think the batting gloves that used
with<00:03:59.090> these<00:03:59.300> may<00:03:59.630> last<00:03:59.840> a<00:04:00.020> bit<00:04:00.050> longer<00:04:00.200> as<00:04:00.650> a

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
with these may last a bit longer as a

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:01.830 
with these may last a bit longer as a
result

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
result

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.210 
result
yeah<00:04:02.840> just<00:04:03.080> lovely<00:04:03.320> feel<00:04:03.620> they're<00:04:04.040> really

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
yeah just lovely feel they're really

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.650 
yeah just lovely feel they're really
like<00:04:04.340> I've<00:04:04.459> got<00:04:04.640> one<00:04:04.670> of<00:04:04.850> these<00:04:04.940> on<00:04:05.060> my<00:04:05.090> Salix

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
like I've got one of these on my Salix

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.710 
like I've got one of these on my Salix
back<00:04:05.870> now<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:08.090> another<00:04:08.300> thing<00:04:08.540> actually

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
back now and but another thing actually

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.449 
back now and but another thing actually
it's<00:04:08.989> interesting<00:04:09.470> about<00:04:09.560> the<00:04:09.680> Heritage

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
it's interesting about the Heritage

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.100 
it's interesting about the Heritage
so<00:04:10.820> I<00:04:10.850> think<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.150> handles<00:04:11.480> bit<00:04:11.660> thicker<00:04:11.959> than

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
so I think the handles bit thicker than

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.830 
so I think the handles bit thicker than
on<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:13.430> max<00:04:13.640> power<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.360> gladiator

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
on the the max power and the gladiator

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.360 
on the the max power and the gladiator
bats<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:16.790> may<00:04:16.970> be<00:04:17.540> able<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.720> see<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.370> very

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
bats you may be able to see this very

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.060 
bats you may be able to see this very
thin<00:04:19.760> handle<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:20.690> on<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.229> gladiator

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
thin handle really on the gladiator

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.939 
thin handle really on the gladiator
but<00:04:22.340> fairly<00:04:22.669> thick<00:04:23.030> on<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.590> Heritage

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:24.949 
but fairly thick on the Heritage

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:27.279 
but fairly thick on the Heritage
certainly<00:04:25.490> not<00:04:25.610> thicker<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:26.990> suggests

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
certainly not thicker so that suggests

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.620 
certainly not thicker so that suggests
to<00:04:27.620> me<00:04:27.770> that<00:04:27.949> it's<00:04:28.370> a<00:04:28.490> bit<00:04:28.849> better<00:04:29.060> for<00:04:29.360> big

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
to me that it's a bit better for big

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.020 
to me that it's a bit better for big
hitting<00:04:29.990> batsmen<00:04:30.500> there<00:04:31.190> perhaps<00:04:31.370> less<00:04:31.759> of<00:04:31.789> a

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
hitting batsmen there perhaps less of a

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.540 
hitting batsmen there perhaps less of a
touch<00:04:32.300> player<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:33.110> some<00:04:33.440> who<00:04:33.530> likes<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:33.889> swing

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
touch player and some who likes to swing

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.120 
touch player and some who likes to swing
and<00:04:34.729> hit<00:04:34.759> it<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.360> bit<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:36.050> handle<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.530> also<00:04:36.680> it's

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
and hit it a bit the handle is also it's

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.999 
and hit it a bit the handle is also it's
round<00:04:37.639> but<00:04:38.090> there's<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.539> hint<00:04:39.110> of<00:04:39.349> oval<00:04:39.830> mmus

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
round but there's a hint of oval mmus

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.150 
round but there's a hint of oval mmus
unlike<00:04:40.910> with<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.479> gladiator<00:04:42.289> that<00:04:42.590> max<00:04:42.860> power

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
unlike with the gladiator that max power

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.439 
unlike with the gladiator that max power
bats<00:04:43.460> which<00:04:43.729> is<00:04:43.880> round<00:04:44.150> round<00:04:45.069> so<00:04:46.069> perhaps<00:04:47.000> and

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
bats which is round round so perhaps and

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.689 
bats which is round round so perhaps and
if<00:04:47.690> you're<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:47.930> more<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.800> top<00:04:49.069> handed<00:04:49.460> player

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
if you're a more of a top handed player

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:50.950 
if you're a more of a top handed player
but<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.060> like<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.419> idea<00:04:50.509> of<00:04:50.660> using<00:04:50.780> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
but you like the idea of using the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.480 
but you like the idea of using the
tongue<00:04:51.199> back<00:04:51.440> then<00:04:51.710> you're<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> big<00:04:52.069> hitter<00:04:52.280> of

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
tongue back then you're a big hitter of

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.540 
tongue back then you're a big hitter of
course<00:04:53.020> then<00:04:54.020> go<00:04:54.830> for<00:04:55.130> something<00:04:55.310> like<00:04:55.400> the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
course then go for something like the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.399 
course then go for something like the
Heritage<00:04:55.940> or<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.449> pearl<00:04:56.720> blast<00:04:56.990> which<00:04:57.229> also

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409 
Heritage or the pearl blast which also

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:02.740 
Heritage or the pearl blast which also
has<00:04:57.680> a<00:04:57.710> thicker<00:04:58.610> handle<00:05:01.000> same<00:05:02.000> grip<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.509> also

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
has a thicker handle same grip and also

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.960 
has a thicker handle same grip and also
similar<00:05:03.110> thickness<00:05:03.470> of<00:05:03.620> handle<00:05:04.099> there's<00:05:04.789> just

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
similar thickness of handle there's just

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.700 
similar thickness of handle there's just
these<00:05:05.060> subtle<00:05:05.780> little<00:05:05.900> differences<00:05:06.530> between

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
these subtle little differences between

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.439 
these subtle little differences between
the<00:05:06.979> bat<00:05:07.099> so<00:05:07.250> where<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.490> profile<00:05:07.970> shapes<00:05:08.270> the

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
the bat so where the profile shapes the

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:10.480 
the bat so where the profile shapes the
same<00:05:08.720> it's<00:05:09.349> quite<00:05:09.560> encouraging<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.280> see<00:05:10.310> that

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
same it's quite encouraging to see that

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.210 
same it's quite encouraging to see that
there<00:05:10.759> is<00:05:10.789> some<00:05:11.120> variation<00:05:11.800> within<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.949> bat

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
there is some variation within the bat

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.740 
there is some variation within the bat
shapes<00:05:13.550> I<00:05:13.729> like<00:05:13.909> that<00:05:14.150> I'll<00:05:14.449> show<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:14.690> the

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
shapes I like that I'll show you the

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.330 
shapes I like that I'll show you the
concave<00:05:15.259> things<00:05:15.590> you<00:05:15.770> can<00:05:15.919> see<00:05:16.130> there's<00:05:16.280> a

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
concave things you can see there's a

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.399 
concave things you can see there's a
little<00:05:16.490> bit<00:05:16.669> they're<00:05:16.909> fairly<00:05:17.389> standard<00:05:17.960> as

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
little bit they're fairly standard as

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.740 
little bit they're fairly standard as
with<00:05:18.740> all<00:05:18.889> the<00:05:19.069> ton<00:05:19.490> bats<00:05:19.759> the<00:05:20.180> sweet<00:05:20.479> spots

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
with all the ton bats the sweet spots

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.309 
with all the ton bats the sweet spots
not<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.050> widest<00:05:21.530> as<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.740> result<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:23.270> yeah<00:05:23.479> I'll

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 
not the widest as a result but yeah I'll

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.890 
not the widest as a result but yeah I'll
just<00:05:24.500> do<00:05:25.039> a<00:05:25.370> mallet<00:05:26.060> test<00:05:26.330> now<00:05:26.509> before<00:05:26.840> we

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
just do a mallet test now before we

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.390 
just do a mallet test now before we
bounce<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.319> ball<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.560> it<00:05:27.830> just<00:05:27.860> you<00:05:28.069> can<00:05:28.220> see

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
bounce the ball and it just you can see
