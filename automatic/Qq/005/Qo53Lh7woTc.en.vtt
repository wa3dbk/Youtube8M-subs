definitely worth buying at the time of
the<00:00:15.990> case

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
the case

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.019 
the case
I<00:00:16.500> bought<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.340> side<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.760> we'll<00:00:17.880> come

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I bought it to one side and we'll come

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.929 
I bought it to one side and we'll come
back<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> that<00:00:18.390> shortly<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> kite

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
back to that shortly this is the kite

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.099 
back to that shortly this is the kite
itself<00:00:22.970> it's<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> two<00:00:24.269> part<00:00:24.570> case<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.019> would

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
itself it's a two part case it would

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.400 
itself it's a two part case it would
just<00:00:25.260> strip<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.529> down<00:00:25.590> give<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.130> quick<00:00:26.880> idea

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
just strip it down give you a quick idea

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
just strip it down give you a quick idea
so<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.560> actually<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.949> shock<00:00:29.640> absorbing

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
so it's actually a shock absorbing

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.020 
so it's actually a shock absorbing
polymer<00:00:30.890> you've<00:00:31.890> actually<00:00:32.040> got<00:00:32.309> these<00:00:32.460> these

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
polymer you've actually got these these

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.030 
polymer you've actually got these these
grips<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> side<00:00:33.840> here<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.770> write

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
grips at the side here so when you write

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.590 
grips at the side here so when you write
your<00:00:35.160> hand<00:00:35.340> sits<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> phoney<00:00:36.000> aids<00:00:36.329> in

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
your hand sits on the phoney aids in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
your hand sits on the phoney aids in
grip<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:36.989> well<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.829> stop<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.250> popping<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
grip as well so stop what popping that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.650 
grip as well so stop what popping that
on<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> iPhone<00:00:39.000> 5<00:00:40.969> it<00:00:41.969> fits<00:00:42.210> over<00:00:42.360> nice<00:00:42.629> and

on the iPhone 5 it fits over nice and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.590 
on the iPhone 5 it fits over nice and
easily<00:00:43.550> now<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> other<00:00:45.180> part

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
easily now this is the other part

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.450 
easily now this is the other part
it's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> rubberized<00:00:46.710> finish<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it's a rubberized finish it's a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.090 
it's a rubberized finish it's a
polycarbonate<00:00:48.210> exoskeleton<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.800> fits

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
polycarbonate exoskeleton so it fits

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.760 
polycarbonate exoskeleton so it fits
over<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.120> part<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.510> case<00:00:51.719> makes<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
over the this part of the case makes it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.709 
over the this part of the case makes it
nice<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:52.949> rigid<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.520> also<00:00:53.879> offers<00:00:54.239> extra

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
but they've obviously thought about

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.949 
but they've obviously thought about
anyway<00:03:42.820> so<00:03:43.820> like<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.269> said<00:03:44.329> this<00:03:44.510> adds<00:03:44.690> about

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
anyway so like I said this adds about

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.890 
anyway so like I said this adds about
$10<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.769> price<00:03:46.010> so<00:03:46.370> if<00:03:47.120> you<00:03:47.269> are<00:03:47.420> after<00:03:47.690> the

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
$10 to the price so if you are after the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.720 
$10 to the price so if you are after the
the<00:03:48.260> belt<00:03:48.470> clip<00:03:48.620> function<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.190> Mazal<00:03:49.519> get<00:03:49.640> it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
the belt clip function you Mazal get it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.100 
the belt clip function you Mazal get it
when<00:03:49.820> you<00:03:49.910> actually<00:03:50.030> buy<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.900> case

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
when you actually buy the the case

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.170 
when you actually buy the the case
itself<00:03:51.560> because<00:03:51.829> it's<00:03:52.010> harder<00:03:52.670> than<00:03:52.700> minimal

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
itself because it's harder than minimal

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.050 
itself because it's harder than minimal
cost<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:54.410> all<00:03:54.650> in<00:03:55.100> all<00:03:55.190> really<00:03:55.459> not<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.880> case

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
cost so all in all really not the case

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.610 
cost so all in all really not the case
