they do is they manufacture in China and

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.920 
they do is they manufacture in China and
they<00:02:17.550> subcontract<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:18.690> they're<00:02:18.810> not

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
they subcontract that so they're not

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.390
