know you can use your regular quick
attack<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.129> well<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.489> might<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.819> easier<00:01:03.179> but

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
attack as well which might be easier but

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:05.270 
attack as well which might be easier but
you<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.199> some<00:01:04.379> height<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:05.040> what's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you have to get some height see what's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.040 
you have to get some height see what's
what's<00:01:05.760> happening<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.780> getting
