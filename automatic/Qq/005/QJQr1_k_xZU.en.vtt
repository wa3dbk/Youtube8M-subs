00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.060
 Welcome dear friends too 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.770
 a new edition of wttv i'm looking forward to 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.570
 especially today because we have one 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.720
 make a delicious pizza and one 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.450
 angle pizza with spinach inlaid 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.970
 dried tomatoes gorgonzola and 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.810
 buffalo mozzarella refined refined 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.010
 the one from me 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.170
 First , of course, the pond 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.210
 then make an hour afterwards 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.710
 to go to a warm place must lay 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.750
 we simply take time off with the flour 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.880
 for a spelled wholemeal flour give that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.260
 in the kitchen machine since here 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.260
 700 gram measured 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.130
 then we need the help the crumbs 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130
 this must be pure 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.990
 a pinch of salt and then we give the 3 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.890
 150 milliliters of lukewarm water during 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890
 was then stir 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.630
 we are now covering the pond 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.070
 at least an hour to go and 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.369
 then we can with the covering already 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.830
 continue then we cut now 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.190
 times the ingredients to right prepare the 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.050
 in front 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.850
 we have a lot of spinach there 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.320
 large flows off which was cut 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.150
 just here directly behind the sheet times 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.390
 we also cut the console 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.650
 rightly cube from for the after one 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.979
 a little better thought about dissipating 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.979
 can 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.009
 then it goes on with the buffalo 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.660
 I already have mozzarella di 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.310
 let it dry a little bit dabbed 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.410
 had a kitchen towel in the bowl 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.530
 because otherwise the pizza would have 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.730
 he is not nice crispy here a yes 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.780
 then it goes on with the inserted 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.780
 dry tomatoes 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.780
 We could still equip the pine nuts 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.180
 a small breakdown that should be coated 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:36.130
 and then we do without oil in the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.640
 cellar in there and sometimes through here 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.410
 they are already swinging 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.360
 a great hour has passed us 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.100
 Now want to roll out the pizza 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.140
 Pizza dough still a bit more on it 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:56.350
 From this we now turn a little 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.239
 The whole thing can also be played with 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.510
 Rolling pin make what I small 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.510
 scooter 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:20.110
 the pond in size is almost true 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:22.030
 a bit high roll tomato sauce as 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.050
 Let's take the 24-hour tomatoes 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.610
 that's exactly what we already have 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.349
 my other programs had been cooked 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.910
 there's a link down here as well 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.799
 There you can rise with it 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.700
 How to know the delicious 24 hours 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:35.799
 makes tomato sauce then we put the 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.340
 then fresh spinach meter on it 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.680
 gorgonzola not exactly too much though 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.329
 that was enough for us here 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.799
 the hard stripes 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.440
 that is enough already and the 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.450
 delicious filling to remember the pizza 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.760
 then comes at 200 degrees 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.660
 call full pulle for minutes and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.660
 then it should be done 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.980
 Now we make the banks over it 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:14.450
 Sprinkle because the roasted pine nuts 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:16.950
 then cut the pizza on it first 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.400
 We wish you good appetite until the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.400
 next time
