00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.970 

we<00:00:33.890> believe<00:00:34.420> something<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.540> focus<00:00:35.720> on<00:00:36.140> beyond

we believe something to focus on beyond
the<00:00:37.850> end<00:00:38.060> of<00:00:38.240> the<00:00:38.360> school<00:00:38.570> year<00:00:38.630> but<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.470> is

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
the end of the school year but it is

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.490 
the end of the school year but it is
actually<00:00:39.830> very<00:00:40.070> much<00:00:40.460> about<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.000> journey

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
actually very much about the journey

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.640 
actually very much about the journey
from<00:00:42.500> beyond<00:00:42.950> their<00:00:43.370> school<00:00:43.670> life<00:00:44.110> to<00:00:45.110> the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
from beyond their school life to the

from beyond their school life to the
wider<00:00:45.890> world<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.750> this<00:00:47.750> provides<00:00:48.290> them<00:00:48.530> with

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
wider world and this provides them with

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.700 
wider world and this provides them with
a<00:00:48.980> learning<00:00:49.489> experience<00:00:50.140> but<00:00:51.140> also<00:00:51.200> give

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
a learning experience but also give

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.160 
a learning experience but also give
something<00:00:52.160> to<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.340> community<00:00:53.140> which<00:00:54.140> really

people involved in intervenes

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.270 
people involved in intervenes
I<00:03:03.270> understand<00:03:03.810> independent<00:03:04.260> schools<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.830> this

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
I understand independent schools on this

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
the boys in our case so we felt been

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.480 
the boys in our case so we felt been
really<00:03:09.870> appropriate<00:03:10.200> people<00:03:11.130> are<00:03:11.280> hard

working hands on no pretensions they
they're<00:03:14.790> well<00:03:15.000> planned<00:03:15.330> well<00:03:15.600> organised<00:03:16.200> it's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
they're well planned well organised it's

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.680 
they're well planned well organised it's
a<00:03:17.220> perfect<00:03:17.550> fit<00:03:17.700> for<00:03:17.820> us

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.330 

so<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:22.810> have<00:03:22.960> a<00:03:22.990> day<00:03:23.170> what<00:03:23.380> we<00:03:23.500> call<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.890> travel

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
so we have a day what we call the travel

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.070 
so we have a day what we call the travel
simulation<00:03:24.880> day<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.300> what<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:25.570> tried<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:25.960> do

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
simulation day and what we tried to do

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.380 
simulation day and what we tried to do
is<00:03:26.200> simulate<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.710> travel<00:03:27.040> in<00:03:27.280> country<00:03:27.700> but<00:03:28.300> we

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
is simulate the travel in country but we

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.180 
is simulate the travel in country but we
simulated<00:03:28.750> here<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:29.140> Australia<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.650> their<00:03:29.890> in

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
simulated here in Australia in their in

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.520 
simulated here in Australia in their in
their<00:03:30.340> city<00:03:30.580> so<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:31.240> get<00:03:31.360> into<00:03:31.690> pretends<00:03:32.380> with

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
and see those places so we're just

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.670 
and see those places so we're just
training<00:03:45.850> them<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.180> travel<00:03:46.630> as<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:46.990> team<00:03:47.290> in

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
training them to travel as a team in

country<00:03:48.900> they<00:03:49.900> all<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.470> sudden<00:03:50.800> understands

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
country they all of a sudden understands

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.990 
country they all of a sudden understands
the<00:03:51.790> idea<00:03:51.820> that<00:03:52.270> leadership<00:03:52.780> isn't<00:03:53.020> about

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
the idea that leadership isn't about

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.430 
the idea that leadership isn't about
telling<00:03:55.000> other<00:03:55.150> people<00:03:55.480> what<00:03:55.510> to<00:03:55.660> do<00:03:55.900> but<00:03:56.260> it's

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
telling other people what to do but it's

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.130 
telling other people what to do but it's
truly<00:03:56.740> about<00:03:57.070> leading<00:03:57.340> yourself<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.140> making

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
truly about leading yourself and making

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.810 
truly about leading yourself and making
decisions<00:03:59.560> and<00:03:59.740> acting<00:04:00.100> in<00:04:00.190> a<00:04:00.280> way<00:04:00.310> that

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
decisions and acting in a way that

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.080 
decisions and acting in a way that
enables<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:02.170> people<00:04:02.500> around<00:04:02.710> you<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.490> think

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
enables the people around you I think

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.610 
enables the people around you I think
that<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.300> leadership<00:04:04.600> element<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.380> really

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
that the leadership element is really

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.040 
that the leadership element is really
important<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.610> see<00:04:07.090> students<00:04:07.480> come<00:04:07.720> into<00:04:07.840> this

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
important I see students come into this

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.170 
important I see students come into this
