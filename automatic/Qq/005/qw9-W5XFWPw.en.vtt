older you have the maturity of the
artist<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.210> so<00:03:45.810> there's<00:03:46.020> this<00:03:46.200> kind<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.500> peak

moment<00:03:47.430> where<00:03:47.550> once<00:03:47.790> tapering<00:03:48.300> off<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
moment where once tapering off as the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.020 
moment where once tapering off as the
others<00:03:49.050> increasing<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.800> so<00:03:50.010> um<00:03:51.080> for<00:03:52.080> me<00:03:53.030> doing

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
others increasing and so um for me doing

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.710 
others increasing and so um for me doing
the<00:03:54.450> Tamala<00:03:54.980> program<00:03:55.980> kind<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.820> freed<00:03:57.270> me<00:03:57.510> up

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
the Tamala program kind of freed me up

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.570 
the Tamala program kind of freed me up
to<00:03:58.040> feel<00:03:59.040> like<00:03:59.990> it's<00:04:00.990> okay<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.500> show<00:04:02.100> off

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
to feel like it's okay to show off

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.910 
to feel like it's okay to show off
because<00:04:02.970> it's<00:04:03.300> not<00:04:03.390> necessarily<00:04:04.230> me<00:04:04.560> that's

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
because it's not necessarily me that's

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.010 
because it's not necessarily me that's
showing<00:04:05.340> off<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:05.700> was<00:04:05.850> able<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.120> dis<00:04:06.390> identify

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
showing off I was able to dis identify

showing off I was able to dis identify
with<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.590> while<00:04:08.310> it<00:04:08.490> that<00:04:08.640> on<00:04:08.790> one<00:04:09.090> hand<00:04:09.300> I<00:04:09.390> was

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
with it while it that on one hand I was

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.000 
with it while it that on one hand I was
being<00:04:09.660> more<00:04:09.810> authentic<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.500> other<00:04:10.650> hand<00:04:10.890> I

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
being more authentic on the other hand I

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.930 
being more authentic on the other hand I
was<00:04:12.740> creating<00:04:13.740> separate<00:04:14.190> characters<00:04:14.700> that

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
was creating separate characters that

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.580 
was creating separate characters that
were<00:04:15.030> not<00:04:15.240> me<00:04:15.600> but<00:04:15.870> were<00:04:15.960> facets<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.500> my

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
were not me but were facets of my

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.470 
were not me but were facets of my
personality<00:04:16.980> just<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:17.730> sculpture<00:04:18.090> I

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
personality just like the sculpture I

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.740 
personality just like the sculpture I
can<00:04:19.080> see<00:04:19.260> like<00:04:19.470> that's<00:04:19.710> not<00:04:19.920> me<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.609> would<00:04:21.540> say

can see like that's not me I would say
what's<00:04:21.989> cool<00:04:22.440> about<00:04:22.470> it<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.340> always<00:04:23.610> felt

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
what's cool about it is I always felt

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.810 
what's cool about it is I always felt
limited<00:04:24.330> with<00:04:24.780> dance<00:04:25.110> a<00:04:25.560> little<00:04:25.980> bit<00:04:26.130> like<00:04:26.370> God

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
limited with dance a little bit like God

music like God this music is so moving

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.530 
music like God this music is so moving
it<00:04:32.100> makes<00:04:32.250> me<00:04:32.430> feel<00:04:32.610> like<00:04:32.700> I'm<00:04:32.850> flying<00:04:33.150> through

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
it makes me feel like I'm flying through

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.040 
it makes me feel like I'm flying through
the<00:04:33.630> air

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
the air

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.010 
the air
but<00:04:34.470> I'm<00:04:34.590> limited<00:04:35.250> by<00:04:35.390> gravity<00:04:36.390> and<00:04:36.540> my

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
but I'm limited by gravity and my

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.220 
but I'm limited by gravity and my
ability<00:04:37.470> to<00:04:37.620> jump<00:04:38.010> in<00:04:38.220> space<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.420> suddenly

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
ability to jump in space and suddenly

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.190 
ability to jump in space and suddenly
aerial<00:04:40.800> enabled<00:04:41.760> me<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:41.940> have<00:04:42.030> more<00:04:42.450> speed<00:04:42.870> and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
aerial enabled me to have more speed and

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.320 
aerial enabled me to have more speed and
to<00:04:43.410> move<00:04:43.680> on<00:04:44.040> this<00:04:44.280> completely<00:04:44.730> other<00:04:45.030> plane

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
to move on this completely other plane

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.810 
to move on this completely other plane
and<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.630> apparatus<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:46.380> I<00:04:46.410> like<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:46.980> can

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
and the apparatus that I like I can

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.780 
and the apparatus that I like I can
really<00:04:48.300> swing<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.170> hover<00:04:49.640> you<00:04:50.640> know

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
really swing and hover you know

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.910 
really swing and hover you know
horizontally<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:51.840> can<00:04:52.020> move<00:04:52.140> across<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
horizontally so I can move across the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.530 
horizontally so I can move across the
space<00:04:53.220> rapidly<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:56.520> was<00:04:56.730> it's<00:04:57.270> more

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
space rapidly and it was it's more

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.980 
space rapidly and it was it's more
satisfying<00:04:58.110> for<00:04:58.350> me<00:04:58.500> I<00:04:58.770> mean<00:04:59.690> not<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.810> make<00:05:00.900> an

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
satisfying for me I mean not to make an

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.420 
satisfying for me I mean not to make an
overall<00:05:01.230> comparison<00:05:01.800> but<00:05:01.920> it's<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.160> tool<00:05:02.400> that

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
overall comparison but it's a tool that

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.890 
overall comparison but it's a tool that
gives<00:05:02.850> me<00:05:03.740> much<00:05:04.740> more<00:05:04.770> breadth<00:05:05.250> in<00:05:05.900> distance

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
gives me much more breadth in distance

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.460 
gives me much more breadth in distance
and<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.980> think<00:05:08.280> for<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.700> audience<00:05:09.150> it's<00:05:09.480> it's

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
and I think for the audience it's it's

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.620 
and I think for the audience it's it's
more<00:05:10.680> exciting<00:05:10.919> it's<00:05:11.250> more<00:05:11.460> flashy<00:05:11.820> it's<00:05:12.360> more

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
more exciting it's more flashy it's more

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.040 
more exciting it's more flashy it's more
you<00:05:13.140> know<00:05:13.260> I'm

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
you know I'm

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.320 
you know I'm
we<00:05:14.680> did<00:05:15.160> a<00:05:15.190> lot<00:05:15.370> of<00:05:15.490> performances<00:05:16.030> in<00:05:16.090> which

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
we did a lot of performances in which

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.740 
we did a lot of performances in which
people<00:05:17.289> were<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.710> was<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.919> dinner<00:05:18.729> theatre<00:05:19.240> show

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
people were it was a dinner theatre show

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.809 
people were it was a dinner theatre show
people<00:05:20.530> were<00:05:20.680> seated<00:05:20.949> at<00:05:21.129> tables<00:05:21.520> and<00:05:21.639> I<00:05:21.669> would

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
people were seated at tables and I would

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.490 
people were seated at tables and I would
swing<00:05:22.060> towards<00:05:22.419> them<00:05:22.599> and<00:05:22.720> flip<00:05:23.110> they<00:05:23.349> almost

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
swing towards them and flip they almost

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.869 
swing towards them and flip they almost
thought<00:05:23.770> they<00:05:23.889> were<00:05:23.949> going<00:05:24.099> to<00:05:24.159> be<00:05:24.280> run<00:05:24.520> into

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
thought they were going to be run into

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.939 
thought they were going to be run into
and<00:05:25.150> that's<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.479> kind<00:05:25.659> of<00:05:25.750> boundary<00:05:26.740> between

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
and that's the kind of boundary between

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.770 
and that's the kind of boundary between
circus<00:05:27.550> and<00:05:27.729> arts<00:05:27.940> circus<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.419> a<00:05:28.449> lot<00:05:28.599> more
