00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.000 

so<00:00:05.220> now<00:00:05.460> let's<00:00:05.850> try<00:00:06.120> our<00:00:07.080> horizontal<00:00:07.500> figure

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
so now let's try our horizontal figure

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.930 
so now let's try our horizontal figure
eight<00:00:08.510> this<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.780> outward<00:00:10.940> horizontal

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
eight this is the outward horizontal

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.740 
eight this is the outward horizontal
figure<00:00:12.059> eight<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.710> add<00:00:13.710> an<00:00:14.009> embellishment<00:00:14.750> so

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
figure eight and add an embellishment so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.480 
figure eight and add an embellishment so
let's<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.170> assume<00:00:16.410> our<00:00:16.560> original<00:00:17.100> position

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
let's just assume our original position

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.730 
let's just assume our original position
so<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> stand<00:00:18.119> with<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> knees

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
so we're going to stand with the knees

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.170 
so we're going to stand with the knees
with<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.830> feet<00:00:20.039> underneath<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.490> hip<00:00:20.850> bones

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
with the feet underneath the hip bones

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.740 
with the feet underneath the hip bones
the<00:00:21.960> knees<00:00:22.140> are<00:00:22.320> bent<00:00:22.609> jess<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.789> lifted<00:00:24.210> we're

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
the knees are bent jess is lifted we're

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.580 
the knees are bent jess is lifted we're
pushing<00:00:24.930> away<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.500> right<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.449> left<00:00:27.590> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
pushing away to the right and left to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.550 
pushing away to the right and left to
create<00:00:28.980> our<00:00:29.310> figure<00:00:29.939> eight<00:00:30.439> remember<00:00:31.439> that

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
create our figure eight remember that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.639 
create our figure eight remember that
initiates<00:00:32.040> with<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> twist<00:00:32.700> right<00:00:33.410> hip<00:00:34.410> comes

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
initiates with a twist right hip comes

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.790 
initiates with a twist right hip comes
forward<00:00:34.880> then<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.940> push<00:00:36.270> your<00:00:36.450> weight

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
forward then you push your weight

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.260 
forward then you push your weight
forward<00:00:37.800> trying<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.489> hit<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> diagonal<00:00:39.210> of

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
forward trying to hit the diagonal of

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.580 
forward trying to hit the diagonal of
the<00:00:39.360> room<00:00:39.540> imagine<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.410> box

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the room imagine that you're in the box

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.000 
the room imagine that you're in the box
then<00:00:41.309> going<00:00:41.640> along<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.210> wall<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.960> far<00:00:43.649> back<00:00:43.800> as

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
then going along the wall as far back as

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.400 
then going along the wall as far back as
possible<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.820> then<00:00:45.719> sliding<00:00:46.050> through<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
possible and then sliding through the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.810 
possible and then sliding through the
center<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.860> want<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.309> contract<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
center you want to really contract the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
center you want to really contract the
lower<00:00:48.000> abs<00:00:48.210> here<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.690> slide<00:00:49.350> through<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
lower abs here and slide through to the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.569 
lower abs here and slide through to the
side<00:00:50.840> along<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.020> wall<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:53.000> right<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.360> left

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
side along the wall and right and left

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.029 
side along the wall and right and left
and<00:00:56.870> again<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.079> figure<00:00:58.590> eight<00:00:58.710> doesn't

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
and again this figure eight doesn't

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.330 
and again this figure eight doesn't
really<00:00:59.160> have<00:00:59.579> any<00:01:00.559> vertical<00:01:01.559> dimension<00:01:02.190> it

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
really have any vertical dimension it

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.789 
really have any vertical dimension it
should<00:01:02.489> strive<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.059> be<00:01:03.559> parallel<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
should strive to be parallel to the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
should strive to be parallel to the
floor<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.430> dimension<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:05.970> because

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
floor in this dimension here because

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.649 
floor in this dimension here because
along<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.020> side<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.439> table<00:01:07.820> but<00:01:08.820> now<00:01:09.420> let's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
along the side of a table but now let's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
along the side of a table but now let's
add<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.200> twist<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.119> we're<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
add a little twist so we're going to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.609 
add a little twist so we're going to
start<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.840> usually<00:01:13.020> do

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
start like we usually do

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.249 
start like we usually do
one<00:01:14.400> hip<00:01:14.640> starts<00:01:14.880> forward<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.960> almost

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
one hip starts forward and it almost

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.070 
one hip starts forward and it almost
completes<00:01:16.920> an<00:01:17.070> entire<00:01:17.400> loop<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:18.630> soon<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.960> we

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
completes an entire loop as soon as we

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
completes an entire loop as soon as we
hit<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.650> back<00:01:19.860> corner<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:20.939> going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.299> switch

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
hit the back corner I'm going to switch

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.690 
hit the back corner I'm going to switch
our<00:01:21.659> attention<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.290> outward<00:01:22.560> hip<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
our attention from the outward hip to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.859 
our attention from the outward hip to
the<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:23.939> that's<00:01:24.119> underneath<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.720> ribcage

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
the one that's underneath your ribcage

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.320 
the one that's underneath your ribcage
now<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.189> let's<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.549> work<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.150> little

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
now and let's just work with it a little

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.190 
now and let's just work with it a little
bit<00:01:27.479> we're<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:27.990> twist

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
bit we're going to do a little twist

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.890 
bit we're going to do a little twist
forward<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> back<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:30.119> same<00:01:30.360> movement<00:01:30.750> we'll

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
forward and back the same movement we'll

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
forward and back the same movement we'll
do<00:01:31.049> when<00:01:31.290> our<00:01:31.320> feet<00:01:31.680> are<00:01:31.920> planted<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
do when our feet are planted on the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.170 
do when our feet are planted on the
floor<00:01:33.409> evenly<00:01:34.490> we're<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.670> sliding<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.060> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
floor evenly we're just sliding out to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.460 
floor evenly we're just sliding out to
the<00:01:36.299> side<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.380> on

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the side and it's a little bit on

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.429 
the side and it's a little bit on
diagonal<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.130> you're<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.479> hip<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
diagonal so you're one hip is at a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.920 
diagonal so you're one hip is at a
backward<00:01:41.040> corner<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:42.390> other<00:01:42.509> hip<00:01:42.780> is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
backward corner and the other hip is

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.319 
backward corner and the other hip is
underneath<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> ribcage<00:01:44.180> working<00:01:45.180> with

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
underneath the ribcage working with

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.210 
underneath the ribcage working with
twisting<00:01:45.750> use<00:01:45.869> back<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.409> forward<00:01:49.100> let's<00:01:50.100> try

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
twisting use back and forward let's try

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.520 
twisting use back and forward let's try
the<00:01:50.280> other<00:01:50.369> side<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.659> go<00:01:51.750> all<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the other side we're going to go all the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.700 
the other side we're going to go all the
way<00:01:52.560> around<00:01:52.829> hit<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> back<00:01:54.149> corner<00:01:54.540> make<00:01:55.500> sure

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
way around hit the back corner make sure

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.139 
way around hit the back corner make sure
that<00:01:55.890> other<00:01:56.100> hip<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.700> underneath<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that other hip is right underneath the

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.520 
that other hip is right underneath the
ribcage<00:01:57.770> push<00:01:58.770> me<00:01:58.920> forward<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.520> back

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.530 

so<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.740> let's<00:02:04.950> combine<00:02:05.160> that<00:02:05.460> into<00:02:05.730> a<00:02:05.940> clear

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
so now let's combine that into a clear

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.200 
so now let's combine that into a clear
prom<00:02:07.140> bow<00:02:07.290> so<00:02:07.880> circle<00:02:10.340> stop<00:02:11.340> somewhere<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210
