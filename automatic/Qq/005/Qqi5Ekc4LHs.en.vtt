I<00:00:00.060> know<00:00:00.450> there's<00:00:00.750> already<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:01.140> video<00:00:01.350> about

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I know there's already a video about

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.249 
I know there's already a video about
leading<00:00:02.100> lines<00:00:02.550> within<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.149> section<00:00:03.689> but

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
leading lines within this section but

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.960 
leading lines within this section but
leading<00:00:04.620> lines<00:00:04.799> aren't<00:00:05.069> just<00:00:05.339> about<00:00:05.549> finding

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
leading lines aren't just about finding

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.960 
leading lines aren't just about finding
a<00:00:06.210> river<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.379> right<00:00:07.560> location<00:00:08.429> for<00:00:08.940> a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
a river and the right location for a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.730 
a river and the right location for a
leading<00:00:09.269> line<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.960> find<00:00:10.200> leading<00:00:10.530> lines

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
leading line you can find leading lines

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.320 
leading line you can find leading lines
in<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.010> environment<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.550> over<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.120> place

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
in the environment all over the place

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.169 
in the environment all over the place
for<00:00:12.900> example<00:00:13.590> look<00:00:14.460> what<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.670> got<00:00:14.790> going<00:00:15.089> on

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
for example look what we got going on

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.820 
for example look what we got going on
here<00:00:15.240> now<00:00:15.750> that's<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.020> very<00:00:16.230> very<00:00:16.410> very<00:00:16.529> strong

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
here now that's a very very very strong

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.620 
here now that's a very very very strong
leading<00:00:17.490> line<00:00:17.760> coming<00:00:18.210> up<00:00:18.330> through<00:00:18.539> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
leading line coming up through the

picture leading you back to me and if I
step<00:00:21.750> out<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> side<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> bit<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.100> see

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
step out to the side a bit you can see

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.580 
step out to the side a bit you can see
that<00:00:23.550> even<00:00:23.910> if<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.269> wasn't<00:00:24.480> in<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> shot<00:00:25.140> this

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that even if I wasn't in the shot this

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.470 
that even if I wasn't in the shot this
leading<00:00:25.980> line<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.340> still<00:00:26.519> coming<00:00:26.820> around<00:00:27.029> here

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
leading line is still coming around here

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.000 
leading line is still coming around here
and<00:00:27.660> taking<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.619> door<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.920> the

Priory and the tree and the building and

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.500 
Priory and the tree and the building and
if<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:32.009> had<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> blue<00:00:32.430> sky<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:33.090> on<00:00:33.210> you'd<00:00:33.360> have

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
if we had a blue sky going on you'd have

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.450 
if we had a blue sky going on you'd have
nice<00:00:33.719> blue<00:00:33.989> sky<00:00:34.320> up<00:00:34.440> there<00:00:34.500> instead<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.070> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
nice blue sky up there instead of just a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.200 
nice blue sky up there instead of just a
white<00:00:36.030> area<00:00:36.300> where<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> cloud<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.850> to<00:00:38.850> find<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
white area where the cloud is to find a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
white area where the cloud is to find a
leading<00:00:39.510> line<00:00:39.809> it's<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.739> thought<00:00:41.190> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
leading line it's more about thought and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030 
leading line it's more about thought and
moving<00:00:42.210> yourself<00:00:42.329> around<00:00:43.110> two<00:00:43.320> line<00:00:43.559> elements

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
moving yourself around two line elements

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.639 
moving yourself around two line elements
up<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.910> let's<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.360> look<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:48.649> here's

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
up so let's go and look for some here's

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.860 
up so let's go and look for some here's
another<00:00:49.860> classic<00:00:50.489> lead<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.180> line<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
another classic lead in line for you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.260 
another classic lead in line for you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
look at this this wall is running all

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.760 
look at this this wall is running all
the<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.390> along<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.719> from<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> corner<00:00:55.710> of

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the way along here from the corner of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
the way along here from the corner of
the<00:00:55.860> picture<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.120> way<00:00:57.239> off<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:58.289> the

the picture all the way off up into the
distance<00:00:59.090> taking<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> door<00:01:00.629> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
distance taking you to the door the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.020 
distance taking you to the door the
Priory<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.770> building<00:01:02.190> beyond<00:01:02.520> it's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
Priory and the building beyond it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
Priory and the building beyond it's
absolutely<00:01:03.629> brilliant<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.559> easy

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
absolutely brilliant and it's so easy

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.490 
absolutely brilliant and it's so easy
but<00:01:05.460> how<00:01:05.700> did<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.060> find<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:07.520> right<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:09.500> came

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
but how did we find that right I came

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.039 
but how did we find that right I came
wandering<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.240> from<00:01:12.240> over<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:13.070> we<00:01:14.070> went<00:01:15.049> came

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
wandering in from over here we went came

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
wandering in from over here we went came
up<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> path<00:01:16.439> here<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.060> sort

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
up the path here and then you just sort

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.690 
up the path here and then you just sort
of<00:01:18.270> wander<00:01:18.570> around<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.930> corner<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.580> here<00:01:20.580> we

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
of wander around the corner and here we

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
of wander around the corner and here we
go<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.060> we're<00:01:21.390> looking<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.780> towards<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
go you see we're looking up towards the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
go you see we're looking up towards the
Priory<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.490> probably<00:01:23.700> already

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
Priory because you can probably already

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.420 
Priory because you can probably already
see<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.330> got<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.570> footpath<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.860> now

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
see we got this footpath going on now

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.850 
see we got this footpath going on now
the<00:01:26.520> footpath<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.299> itself<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.020> leading<00:01:28.560> line

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the footpath is in itself a leading line

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.469 
the footpath is in itself a leading line
and<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.700> take<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.909> picture<00:01:30.360> from

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and if you just take a picture from

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.990 
and if you just take a picture from
pretty<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:30.930> where<00:01:31.229> you're<00:01:31.409> standing<00:01:31.860> now

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
pretty much where you're standing now

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.630 
pretty much where you're standing now
like<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:34.100> turn<00:01:35.100> my<00:01:35.250> camera<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.759> helps

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
like this turn my camera on it helps

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.789 
like this turn my camera on it helps
we've<00:01:38.640> already<00:01:38.820> got<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.630> leading<00:01:40.290> line<00:01:40.439> going

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
we've already got a leading line going

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.190 
we've already got a leading line going
on<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> foreground<00:01:41.460> up<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> Priory

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
on in the foreground up to the Priory

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.910 
on in the foreground up to the Priory
it's<00:01:43.890> kind<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> natural<00:01:44.990> but<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.320> strength<00:01:46.680> is

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
it's kind of natural but the strength is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.130 
it's kind of natural but the strength is
increased<00:01:47.520> by<00:01:48.090> bringing<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> edge

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
increased by bringing it in to the edge

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.749 
increased by bringing it in to the edge
so<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.560> sort<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> really<00:01:49.860> pushing<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so it's sort of really pushing you in

through the picture and that was done by
using<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.729> wall<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.869> fill<00:01:55.079> me<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.590> now

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
using this wall and to fill me just now

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.819 
using this wall and to fill me just now
Jane<00:01:56.460> was<00:01:57.210> lying<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> floor<00:01:57.810> here<00:01:58.380> with

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
Jane was lying on the floor here with

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.149 
Jane was lying on the floor here with
the<00:01:58.920> video<00:01:59.189> camera<00:01:59.840> propped<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the video camera propped up on that

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.389 
the video camera propped up on that
little<00:02:02.280> tiny<00:02:02.610> stone<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.320> so<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
little tiny stone there like that so the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.109 
little tiny stone there like that so the
camera<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.060> looking<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.770> way<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.280> off<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
camera is looking that way and off and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.969 
camera is looking that way and off and
it's<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.390> wide<00:02:09.690> angle<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> lens<00:02:10.619> which<00:02:10.950> is

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
it's the wide angle of the lens which is

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.710 
it's the wide angle of the lens which is
picking<00:02:11.459> up<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> stuff<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.660> on

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
picking up all the stuff that's going on

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.100 
picking up all the stuff that's going on
in<00:02:12.840> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
in the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.200 
in the
ground<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.520> about<00:02:14.730> understanding

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
ground so this is about understanding

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.910 
ground so this is about understanding
your<00:02:15.300> lenses<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.990> an<00:02:16.080> extent<00:02:16.440> as<00:02:16.620> well<00:02:16.770> in

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
your lenses to an extent as well in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.860 
your lenses to an extent as well in
order<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.310> achieve<00:02:17.640> these<00:02:17.850> things<00:02:17.910> let<00:02:18.780> me

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
order to achieve these things let me

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.480 
order to achieve these things let me
take<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.260> picture<00:02:19.470> how<00:02:19.980> would<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.310> take

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.200 
take that picture how would you take
that<00:02:20.550> picture

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
I mean it down low get that leading line

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.880 
I mean it down low get that leading line
into<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:30.960> corner<00:02:32.180> because<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.480> is<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:35.450> very

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
into the corner because this is a very

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.590 
into the corner because this is a very
big<00:02:37.890> depth<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.400> field<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:38.850> want<00:02:39.030> for<00:02:39.240> this<00:02:39.330> shot

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
big depth of field we want for this shot

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.170 
big depth of field we want for this shot
I'm<00:02:40.110> using<00:02:41.180> f11<00:02:42.180> there<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:42.810> go<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
I'm using f11 there we go so there you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.240 
I'm using f11 there we go so there you
go<00:02:45.360> that's<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.140> leading<00:02:46.530> line<00:02:46.680> recorded

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
go that's that leading line recorded

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.130 
go that's that leading line recorded
with<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> camera<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.270> how<00:02:48.630> easy<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.080> is

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
with the camera you see how easy this is

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.670 
with the camera you see how easy this is
let's<00:02:49.709> go<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:49.980> look<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.130> another<00:02:50.340> one
