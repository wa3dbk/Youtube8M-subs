the<00:00:39.390> other<00:00:39.510> video<00:00:39.809> I've<00:00:40.020> seen<00:00:40.290> where<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.690> guy

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the other video I've seen where the guy

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.270 
the other video I've seen where the guy
buried<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:43.200> three<00:00:43.440> feet<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> ground<00:00:43.860> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
buried at three feet in the ground but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.350 
buried at three feet in the ground but
we're<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.700> think<00:00:44.820> we<00:00:45.000> really<00:00:45.210> need

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
we're not I don't think we really need

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.049 
we're not I don't think we really need
to<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:46.430> it's<00:00:47.430> spraying<00:00:47.820> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to do that because it's spraying and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.470 
to do that because it's spraying and
it's<00:00:48.180> warm<00:00:48.480> enough<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:49.640> if<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.789> do<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.180> fall

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it's warm enough but if we do the fall

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.279 
it's warm enough but if we do the fall
batch<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.110> planned<00:00:53.899> we'll<00:00:54.899> bury<00:00:55.110> these

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
batch like we planned we'll bury these

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.950 
batch like we planned we'll bury these
three<00:00:55.559> feet<00:00:55.770> deep<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.719> let<00:00:57.719> him<00:00:57.809> write

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
three feet deep and not let him write

00:00:57.960 --> 00:02:28.809 
three feet deep and not let him write
off<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> winter

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.890 

from<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.910> other<00:02:30.030> videos<00:02:30.360> they<00:02:30.510> showed<00:02:30.720> them

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
from the other videos they showed them

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.540 
from the other videos they showed them
putting<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:32.000> black<00:02:33.000> tarp<00:02:33.420> over<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:35.250> top<00:02:35.520> of

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
putting a a black tarp over the top of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.370 
putting a a black tarp over the top of
it<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:37.560> don't<00:02:38.099> have<00:02:38.190> any<00:02:38.310> black<00:02:38.489> tarp<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.230> I'm

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
it I don't have any black tarp so I'm

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.229 
it I don't have any black tarp so I'm
not<00:02:40.560> putting<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.830> on<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.430> think<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:42.090> was

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
not putting it on there I think it was
