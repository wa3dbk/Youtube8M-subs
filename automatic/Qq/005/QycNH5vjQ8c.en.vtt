one eight with filter Tron pickups and I
thought<00:00:21.060> I'd<00:00:21.210> start<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.570> clean<00:00:21.960> channel

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410

the 60s sounds okay but I prefer the the

idea the personality of the amp in case

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.700 
idea the personality of the amp in case
you're<00:01:15.299> not<00:01:15.450> already<00:01:15.630> aware<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
you're not already aware of it this is a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.480 
you're not already aware of it this is a
tube<00:01:17.009> amp<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.549> has<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:18.299> six<00:01:18.689> v6<00:01:19.350> power<00:01:20.189> tubes

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
tube amp it has two six v6 power tubes

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.260 
tube amp it has two six v6 power tubes
in<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> single<00:01:22.950> preamp<00:01:23.580> 12<00:01:24.000> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
in it and it's got a single preamp 12 I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.670 
in it and it's got a single preamp 12 I
think<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.570> called<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.810> 12ax7<00:01:26.000> tube<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.290> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
think it's called a 12ax7 tube and and I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.880 
think it's called a 12ax7 tube and and I
have<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> drive<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.780> gain<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
have the drive or the the gain in the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.120 
have the drive or the the gain in the
drive<00:01:32.189> channel<00:01:32.579> set<00:01:32.850> at<00:01:33.180> about<00:01:34.049> let's<00:01:34.890> see

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
drive channel set at about let's see

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.660 
drive channel set at about let's see
weird<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.560> set<00:01:37.829> at<00:01:38.009> about<00:01:38.189> 6

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
weird is that I have that set at about 6

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.679 
weird is that I have that set at about 6
and<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.939> in-home<00:01:41.939> volume<00:01:42.479> kind

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and I have just in in-home volume kind

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.280 
and I have just in in-home volume kind
of<00:01:42.840> setting<00:01:43.259> here<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.880> volume<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.140> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
of setting here it's the volume for that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.249 
of setting here it's the volume for that
channel<00:01:46.590> set<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.070> 2<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:48.659> get<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> amp<00:01:49.079> out

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
channel set at 2 so you get the amp out

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.460 
channel set at 2 so you get the amp out
into<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> gig<00:01:50.040> situation<00:01:50.700> probably<00:01:51.350> it's<00:01:52.350> going

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
into a gig situation probably it's going

to have somewhat of a different
personality<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.350> in-home<00:01:55.770> purposes

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.670 

that's<00:02:22.920> amp<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.810> manual<00:02:25.170> tells<00:02:25.500> you

that's amp one in the manual tells you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.550 
that's amp one in the manual tells you
what<00:02:25.890> each<00:02:26.040> of<00:02:26.250> them<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:26.550> some<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:28.140> might<00:02:28.350> be<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
what each of them are some it might be a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.870 
what each of them are some it might be a
Princeton<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:30.180> might<00:02:30.450> be<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> Fender<00:02:30.930> Bassman

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
Princeton it might be a Fender Bassman

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.760 
Princeton it might be a Fender Bassman
to<00:02:32.880> me<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.660> think<00:02:34.250> amps<00:02:35.250> 1<00:02:35.580> through<00:02:35.940> 9<00:02:36.510> all<00:02:37.110> have

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
to me I think amps 1 through 9 all have

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.350 
to me I think amps 1 through 9 all have
kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.250> fender<00:02:38.640> sound<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.120> them<00:02:39.210> which

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
kind of that fender sound to them which

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850 
kind of that fender sound to them which
I<00:02:39.510> thought<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.930> would<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.290> liked<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.740> it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
I thought that I would have liked as it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.570 
I thought that I would have liked as it
turns<00:02:41.070> out<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.420> actually<00:02:42.420> prefer<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.400> amp

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
turns out I actually prefer the the amp

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.230 
turns out I actually prefer the the amp
sounds<00:02:45.150> from<00:02:45.330> about<00:02:45.660> I<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.710> 10<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.190> 11<00:02:47.670> which

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
sounds from about I like 10 and 11 which

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.980 
sounds from about I like 10 and 11 which
are<00:02:48.770> British<00:02:49.790> amp<00:02:50.790> sounds<00:02:51.420> according<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
are British amp sounds according to the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.040 
are British amp sounds according to the
manual<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.410> think<00:02:53.010> number<00:02:53.190> 11<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:54.390> British

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
manual I think number 11 is is British

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.840 
manual I think number 11 is is British
compressed<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.890> number<00:02:56.160> 10<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.430> think<00:02:56.760> it's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
compressed and number 10 I think it's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:13.550

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.459 

and<00:06:51.639> then<00:06:52.029> from<00:06:52.269> there<00:06:52.539> it<00:06:52.719> gets<00:06:52.869> more<00:06:53.199> heavy

00:06:53.459 --> 00:06:53.469 
and then from there it gets more heavy

00:06:53.469 --> 00:07:44.060 
and then from there it gets more heavy
metal<00:06:59.610> and<00:07:00.610> there's<00:07:01.569> 14<00:07:02.529> or<00:07:02.679> 15

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:46.780 
and then for some reason 12 is pretty

00:07:46.780 --> 00:08:04.260 
and then for some reason 12 is pretty
clean

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.270 

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.409

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:11.140 
and that covers all of the sixteen
voices<00:08:08.930> I<00:08:09.169> do<00:08:09.560> like<00:08:09.889> this<00:08:10.099> amp<00:08:10.310> I<00:08:10.520> did<00:08:10.729> elect<00:08:11.030> to

go<00:08:11.300> with<00:08:11.509> the<00:08:11.659> the<00:08:12.110> blonde<00:08:12.379> version<00:08:12.650> I<00:08:12.949> think

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:12.979 
go with the the blonde version I think

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:15.689 
go with the the blonde version I think
they<00:08:13.250> call<00:08:13.430> it<00:08:13.460> the<00:08:13.610> oxblood<00:08:14.060> cover<00:08:14.629> on<00:08:14.870> it<00:08:14.900> and

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:15.699 
they call it the oxblood cover on it and

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:18.699 
they call it the oxblood cover on it and
