00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.589
 what guys are you with rice today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.660
 tell you how to get space and even 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.179
 land on builds minecraft without 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.349
 any modifications to start us 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.290
 command block required 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 Well, of course you need to install it 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.199
 install open insert into it 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.619
 command link to which is left under 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:27.119
 video and activate the command block now 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:31.320
 wait for the build machine so everything 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.190
 the machine is ready and we can proceed 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.559
 crafting our rockets for a flight into space 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.360
 we need oak steps glass 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.079
 iron block coal block 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.270
 fireball and funnel ie we need 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.710
 craft rocket compartments 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.390
 start creating the first bay this 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 we throw down oak steps we are 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.789
 got some say passenger then 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.109
 understands all further throw off the iron 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.739
 block and coal block we get 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.769
 fuel compartment and throw off the funnel and 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 fireball and we get an accelerator 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.820
 for our rocket now it's all 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.030
 dump in one place and we get 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.460
 egg calling rocket so we have it nowhere 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.409
 we can not sleep nowhere 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.020
 indulges and don't get angry right now 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.330
 for this we need to build some 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.509
 platform for take-off for this we 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.680
 need smooth andesite 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.780
 hellish brick and hellish steps 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.409
 iron block and 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.680
 Basically, we first lay everything here 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.940
 such here cross hell of a brick and 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.150
 my ends set the iron block 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.590
 corners 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.590
 smooth on visic 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.950
 be sure to do everything just like 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.490
 otherwise I will have nothing 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.900
 work and the rocket will not fly anywhere and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.900
 so here we set the steps 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:14.120
 Now I will note and show how to top 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:19.470
 looks u so on we will need 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:23.910
 iron bars from them we need 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.730
 make some nude racks install them 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:31.260
 so here too, in the corners and in the middle 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.190
 install well such a thing 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.410
 where we will have our rocket 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:42.360
 the playground is ready and we can spawn 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.940
 call our rocket and wait until y 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:49.500
 we have all the rocket we have appeared 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.780
 and we can go into space all this 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.620
 you press f5 to go view 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.110
 third person 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.440
 so it will be better seen and advise of course 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.350
 make a sound so loud fuck 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.150
 wagon children well and now we need 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.700
 go into the rocket for this not yet push 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.270
 but just we all jump in it inside 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.770
 rockets 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.770
 Here we start the engine 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.030
 we gain height 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.099
 so we are already in space 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.180
 without layers of atmosphere our rocket 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.569
 warmed up 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.859
 we are so hot and we start 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:05.950
 landing rockets now quietly 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.950
 starts to cool and we 'll see again 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.410
 so our rocket was again visible 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.680
 started to find their own colors and 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.540
 it's going down 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.339
 now we have to wish ourselves 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:03.119
 soft landing 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:06.569
 which of course is unlikely to happen exploded 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:14.149
 with us it will always always explode 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:16.559
 and we hit the asteroid here a bunch of mobs 

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:19.529
 Sorry now I'm in creative mode otherwise 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:23.039
 would you not even unfortunately then fortunately 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.349
 so they ate everything here with us 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.860
 very low gravity it can be seen by 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:33.959
 jumping and walking here is also not very 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.119
 convenient well guys on this in principle 

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:38.729
 all like it subscribe to 

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.459
 channel link to the command will leave on under 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.169
 video all bye 

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:45.179
 oh yeah almost forgot if you go 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:53.039
 back to normal land 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:55.759
 then you just need to jump down and we 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.759
 on earth again
