00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 level 30 then level 30 a little bit 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.230
 in two parts why do I say that because 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.030
 that I realized that there is 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.469
 many a lot of players who are we 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.670
 contact using and I do not understand 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.210
 because I find some but 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.199
 I can not open the door 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.180
 so we show you how to open it 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.970
 because it's not that complicated 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 already we need a code code to 4 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.750
 statistics 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.000
 a clue a clock and then here at the bottom 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.610
 on the right 95 you have nice shake your 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.260
 appears rip grab them and the book or 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.570
 whatever it will stay like that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.890
 for the time being 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.180
 keller see you here finally it looks like 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.440
 a clock but is not a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 since there are divisions instead of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 12 but you still have to make a 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 report because a little needle 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.870
 a big needle and when we read 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.820
 the hour we first look at the value 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 of the little needle that will be one here 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.480
 then after the value of the big which 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.500
 will be 8 here so the beginning of our code 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.059
 will be an 8 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.510
 that's for sure 1 8 kg 95 here so my code 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:13.890
 will be an 8 9 5 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:15.420
 I type 1.8 9.5 g no error I 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 can no longer type it since it was good 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.040
 the code is good but nothing is happening and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.450
 that's when we're happy 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.310
 would accuse I do not understand because 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.420
 doors do not open then certainly 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.680
 it may be the last level for 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.330
 the moment we hope for a good update 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.810
 thing that I play is really very 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.200
 but interesting times beyond must 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.400
 search 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.670
 well we advise you to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.509
 tap on the clock you will see 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.210
 she turns alone 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.650
 she goes back the time why she 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.540
 goes back down time which makes that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 before being in the state where she 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 was with plenty of sand and so on and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.720
 well been like that this door 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.840
 we have a green button we will just press 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.840
 above 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:59.310
 you have resolved the 30th level is expected 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.310
 hopefully a next update
