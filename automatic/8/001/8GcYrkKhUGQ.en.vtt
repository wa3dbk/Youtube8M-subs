00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
arts there is an area of a lot of

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.940 
arts there is an area of a lot of
misinformation<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.410> has<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.740> do<00:00:10.920> with

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
misinformation and that has to do with

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.580 
misinformation and that has to do with
stretchy<00:00:11.910> number<00:00:12.360> one<00:00:12.540> first<00:00:13.230> off<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.530> is

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
stretchy number one first off this is

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.860 
stretchy number one first off this is
the<00:00:13.799> 21st<00:00:14.340> century<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.940> lot<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.480> stretches

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the 21st century a lot of the stretches

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.529 
the 21st century a lot of the stretches
we<00:00:15.990> inherited<00:00:16.619> go<00:00:17.100> back<00:00:17.310> decades<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.330> know

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
we inherited go back decades and we know

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
we inherited go back decades and we know
a<00:00:18.779> lot<00:00:19.109> better<00:00:19.410> now<00:00:19.710> about<00:00:20.130> how<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.310> stretch

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
a lot better now about how to stretch

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.730 
a lot better now about how to stretch
number<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.300> stretching<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:22.050> part<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
number one stretching is part of the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060 
number one stretching is part of the
workout<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.609> cooled<00:00:24.119> down<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:25.230> not<00:00:25.529> part<00:00:25.980> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
workout and cooled down it's not part of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.790 
workout and cooled down it's not part of
the<00:00:26.189> warm-up<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.449> warm-up<00:00:27.960> is<00:00:28.170> meant<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.680> get

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the warm-up the warm-up is meant to get

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700 
the warm-up the warm-up is meant to get
the<00:00:28.859> big<00:00:29.189> muscles<00:00:29.789> warm<00:00:30.570> blood<00:00:31.140> flowing<00:00:31.590> so

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the big muscles warm blood flowing so

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.530 
the big muscles warm blood flowing so
that<00:00:31.859> when<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.219> stretch<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> kick<00:00:33.329> we

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
that when we do stretch and kick we

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.850 
that when we do stretch and kick we
don't<00:00:33.750> pull<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> muscle<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> damage<00:00:34.739> ourselves

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
don't pull a muscle and damage ourselves

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
don't pull a muscle and damage ourselves
so<00:00:35.520> stretching<00:00:35.969> typically<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.750> most

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
so stretching typically is most

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
so stretching typically is most
effective<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.520> end<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:39.149> class<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
effective at the end of class when the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540 
effective at the end of class when the
muscles<00:00:40.110> are<00:00:40.230> really<00:00:40.350> tired<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.980> not

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
muscles are really tired and not

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
muscles are really tired and not
resisting<00:00:42.149> second<00:00:42.960> thing<00:00:43.079> here<00:00:43.500> are<00:00:43.590> some<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
resisting second thing here are some of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.290 
resisting second thing here are some of
the<00:00:43.829> stretches<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.460> was<00:00:44.670> raised<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.059> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the stretches that I was raised with and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.430 
the stretches that I was raised with and
I<00:00:45.329> certainly<00:00:45.629> hope<00:00:45.840> you're<00:00:45.930> not<00:00:46.079> doing<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
I certainly hope you're not doing in

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.930 
I certainly hope you're not doing in
your<00:00:46.530> school<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.190> would<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.460> things<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
your school we would do things like the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
your school we would do things like the
high<00:00:48.329> four<00:00:48.750> leg<00:00:48.960> raise<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> need<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.559> swing

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
high four leg raise it need to swing

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670 
high four leg raise it need to swing
your<00:00:50.129> leg<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.210> was<00:00:51.360> very<00:00:51.629> easy<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.170> blow

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
your leg up and it was very easy to blow

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.400 
your leg up and it was very easy to blow
out<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.190> hamstring<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> hide<00:00:54.539> side<00:00:55.079> leg

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
out a hamstring we do the hide side leg

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
out a hamstring we do the hide side leg
raise<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.980> raise<00:00:56.520> our<00:00:56.699> legs<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.149> way<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
raise and we raise our legs this way and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.970 
raise and we raise our legs this way and
it<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.629> just<00:00:58.199> archaic

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it was just archaic

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.920 
it was just archaic
ancient<00:00:59.399> stretching<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.300> we've<00:01:00.600> done<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> lot

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
ancient stretching so we've done a lot

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.299 
ancient stretching so we've done a lot
of<00:01:00.960> research<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> here<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.800> some<00:01:01.890> stretches

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
of research and here are some stretches

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.729 
of research and here are some stretches
that<00:01:02.460> we<00:01:02.879> know<00:01:03.090> work<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.870> martial<00:01:04.170> arts<00:01:04.439> this

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
that we know work for martial arts this

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
that we know work for martial arts this
is<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.949> simple<00:01:05.400> routine<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> do

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
is a simple routine that I like to do

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
is a simple routine that I like to do
with<00:01:06.630> my<00:01:06.780> students<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.229> start<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.430> horse

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
with my students I start in a horse

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
with my students I start in a horse
stance<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.570> don't<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.960> four<00:01:10.260> hands

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
stance and I don't take my four hands

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.920 
stance and I don't take my four hands
four<00:01:11.130> hands<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:11.520> four<00:01:11.729> arms<00:01:12.090> push<00:01:12.750> them

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
four hands my four arms push them

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.810 
four hands my four arms push them
against<00:01:13.170> my<00:01:13.320> knee<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:14.040> trying<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.670> my

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
against my knee I'm trying to get my

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.060 
against my knee I'm trying to get my
hips<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.420> open<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.110> relax<00:01:16.770> right

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
hips just to open up and relax right

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
hips just to open up and relax right
down<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.400> might<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.759> some<00:01:17.939> dynamic<00:01:18.119> stretching

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
down I might do some dynamic stretching

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.840 
down I might do some dynamic stretching
which<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.500> bouncing<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.460> ballistic

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
which is not bouncing like ballistic

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
which is not bouncing like ballistic
that<00:01:21.330> would<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.570> real<00:01:21.720> hard<00:01:21.869> fairly<00:01:22.710> simple

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that would be real hard fairly simple

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.070 
that would be real hard fairly simple
motions<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.450> my<00:01:24.630> hands<00:01:24.869> go<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
motions then from here my hands go to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
motions then from here my hands go to
the<00:01:25.140> ground<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the ground and I'm going to go and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.160 
the ground and I'm going to go and
gently<00:01:27.030> turn<00:01:27.150> sideways<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.960> don't

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
gently turn sideways to this I don't

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.620 
gently turn sideways to this I don't
lose<00:01:28.259> our<00:01:28.380> microphone<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> mini<00:01:30.119> split

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
lose our microphone into a mini split

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.510 
lose our microphone into a mini split
let's<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.259> rock<00:01:31.530> back<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.770> forth<00:01:32.040> again<00:01:32.400> them

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
let's go rock back and forth again them

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.640 
let's go rock back and forth again them
