you<00:02:00.060> know<00:02:00.210> exponent<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.469> me<00:02:01.649> I'll

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
you know exponent one for me I'll

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.789 
you know exponent one for me I'll
probably<00:02:02.340> have<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> get<00:02:02.909> down<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.329> about<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
probably have to get down to about a

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.499 
probably have to get down to about a
seven<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> eight<00:02:05.009> percent<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:06.329> reach

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
seven to eight percent to really reach

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
seven to eight percent to really reach
muscle<00:02:06.780> separation<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.009> want<00:02:08.220> that

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
muscle separation and if I want that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.760 
muscle separation and if I want that
drag<00:02:08.759> draining<00:02:09.300> look<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.319> down<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
drag draining look I have to get down so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.059 
drag draining look I have to get down so

or<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.239> vary<00:02:12.510> for<00:02:12.750> different

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
or it's going to vary for different

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.080

definitely<00:02:13.680> from<00:02:13.799> person<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.219> person<00:02:14.430> that's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
definitely from person to person that's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.280 
definitely from person to person that's
pretty<00:02:15.359> much<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.140> be

pretty much going to have to be

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.959 
pretty much going to have to be
something<00:02:16.680> you're<00:02:17.189> going<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.459> have<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.640> figure

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
something you're going to have to figure

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.839

out<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.209> your<00:02:18.239> own<00:02:18.420> but<00:02:19.049> most<00:02:19.400> importantly<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
out on your own but most importantly you

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.270 
out on your own but most importantly you
have<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.510> your<00:02:21.689> body<00:02:21.959> fat<00:02:22.319> percentage<00:02:22.349> low

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
have to get your body fat percentage low

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.550 
have to get your body fat percentage low
that's<00:02:23.819> how<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.150> achieve<00:02:24.359> that<00:02:24.989> definition

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
that's how you achieve that definition

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.770 
that's how you achieve that definition
in<00:02:25.859> that<00:02:25.920> separation<00:02:26.670> look<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.510> know<00:02:27.599> there's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
in that separation look you know there's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.589 
in that separation look you know there's
a<00:02:27.840> difference<00:02:28.200> between<00:02:28.500> being<00:02:29.209> hot<00:02:30.209> beach

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
a difference between being hot beach

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.649 
a difference between being hot beach
body<00:02:30.930> looking<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.799> stage<00:02:32.549> ready<00:02:33.030> there's<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
body looking and stage ready there's a

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.960 
body looking and stage ready there's a
big<00:02:33.900> difference<00:02:34.379> from<00:02:34.530> getting<00:02:35.519> ready<00:02:35.730> for

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
big difference from getting ready for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.599 
big difference from getting ready for
the<00:02:36.090> hoes<00:02:36.359> and<00:02:36.959> getting<00:02:37.709> ready<00:02:37.889> for<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.280> shows

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
the hoes and getting ready for the shows

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.459 
the hoes and getting ready for the shows
that's<00:02:39.239> two<00:02:39.599> different<00:02:40.079> levels<00:02:40.260> of

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
that's two different levels of

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.140 
that's two different levels of
conditioning<00:02:41.069> you<00:02:41.400> have<00:02:41.609> to<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.939> your<00:02:42.090> body

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
conditioning you have to get your body

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.629 
conditioning you have to get your body
fat<00:02:42.450> percentage<00:02:42.629> pretty<00:02:43.349> fucking<00:02:43.739> low<00:02:43.920> if<00:02:44.400> you

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
fat percentage pretty fucking low if you

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.119 
fat percentage pretty fucking low if you
want<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.939> see<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.209> separation<00:02:45.900> between<00:02:46.290> each

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
want to see that separation between each

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.309 
want to see that separation between each
muscle<00:02:47.730> group<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.269> to<00:02:48.569> be<00:02:48.720> honest<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.139> you

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
lowest I was never super separated I was

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.520 
lowest I was never super separated I was
leaning<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.019> fuck
