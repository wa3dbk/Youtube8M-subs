00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
display and we can see that the auto

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.450 
display and we can see that the auto
detect<00:00:39.690> puts<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> graphics<00:00:40.590> details<00:00:40.980> low

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
detect puts the graphics details low

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.450 
detect puts the graphics details low
which<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.960> sucks<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.920> i'm<00:00:44.280> not

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
which kind of sucks right but i'm not

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.680 
which kind of sucks right but i'm not
going<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> listen<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> i'm<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
going to listen to that and i'm going to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.779 
going to listen to that and i'm going to
put<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:45.960> old<00:00:46.230> Jahi<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:47.340> i<00:00:47.370> think<00:00:47.550> you

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
put it on old Jahi because i think you

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.080 
put it on old Jahi because i think you
can<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.950> now<00:00:49.950> there's<00:00:50.160> no<00:00:50.370> apply<00:00:50.820> button

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
can do it now there's no apply button

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.209 
can do it now there's no apply button
but<00:00:51.360> i'm<00:00:51.989> just<00:00:52.410> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.590> take<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.010> granted

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
but i'm just going to take for granted

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.250 
but i'm just going to take for granted
that<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:54.000> set<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.449> let's<00:00:55.110> just

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that it is going to set that let's just

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
that it is going to set that let's just
go<00:00:55.410> back<00:00:55.440> into<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
go back into it and have a look it is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
go back into it and have a look it is
said<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.660> ultra<00:00:58.020> high<00:00:58.140> okay<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.160> let's<00:00:59.520> find<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
said to ultra high okay so let's find a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.470 
said to ultra high okay so let's find a
match<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> yeah<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.789> much<00:01:02.940> better<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.270> use<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
match so yeah it's much better to use a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.179 
match so yeah it's much better to use a
controller<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.080> these<00:01:04.229> sorts<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.589> games<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.010> an

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
controller in these sorts of games is an

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.649 
controller in these sorts of games is an
online<00:01:05.339> game<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:05.939> you've<00:01:06.030> never<00:01:06.180> played<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
online game if you've never played it

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.090 
online game if you've never played it
and<00:01:06.780> you'll<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.260> get<00:01:07.409> destroyed<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.010> you

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and you'll just get destroyed if you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.630 
and you'll just get destroyed if you
kind<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> use<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> on-screen<00:01:08.820> buttons<00:01:09.390> so

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
kind of use the on-screen buttons so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.320 
kind of use the on-screen buttons so
control<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:12.000> controller<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.869> up<00:01:12.990> baby

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
control the way up controller it up baby

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
control the way up controller it up baby
so<00:01:15.330> Ron<00:01:15.540> ultra-high<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.439> high<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
so Ron ultra-high this as high as the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.770 
so Ron ultra-high this as high as the
game<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.700> terms<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> graphics<00:01:18.210> let's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
game can go in terms of graphics let's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.780 
game can go in terms of graphics let's
have<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:18.990> look<00:01:19.229> keep<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.740> eye<00:01:19.830> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.130> counter

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
have a look keep an eye on the counter

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.980 
have a look keep an eye on the counter
at<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> top<00:01:21.150> here<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.420> you're<00:01:21.540> interested<00:01:21.600> in

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
the frames per second and yeah let's go

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.620 
the frames per second and yeah let's go
okay<00:01:28.130> crap<00:01:29.130> I'm<00:01:29.340> betting<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.119> die<00:01:30.270> then

fantastic so you can see the frames per

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.130 
fantastic so you can see the frames per
second<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> moment<00:01:35.909> kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.360> ranging

that's just fantastic I'll kill out of
that<00:02:28.920> ni<00:02:29.160> so<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.850> can<00:02:29.970> see<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.210> performance

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
that ni so you can see the performance

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.850 
that ni so you can see the performance
is<00:02:30.720> decent<00:02:31.290> if<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:33.020> this<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.170> all<00:02:34.290> from<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.680> so

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
is decent if I and this is all from I so

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.980 
is decent if I and this is all from I so
I<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.040> no<00:02:35.190> idea<00:02:35.460> why<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.730> picked<00:02:36.150> low<00:02:36.570> i<00:02:36.600> guess

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
I have no idea why it picked low i guess

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.140 
I have no idea why it picked low i guess
it<00:02:37.140> picked<00:02:37.350> low<00:02:37.620> because<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.820> know<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.060> a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
it picked low because you know it's a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.000 
it picked low because you know it's a
new<00:02:39.300> GPU<00:02:39.720> know<00:02:40.050> much<00:02:40.320> about<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.620> year<00:02:40.920> they

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
new GPU know much about a year they

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.620 
new GPU know much about a year they
haven't<00:02:41.280> set<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.550> up<00:02:41.760> cuz<00:02:41.970> if<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.210> spin<00:02:42.450> round

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
haven't set it up cuz if I spin round

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.210 
haven't set it up cuz if I spin round
you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.960> see<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> frames<00:02:43.560> go<00:02:43.800> from<00:02:44.010> 29<00:02:44.490> 30<00:02:44.910> 35

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
you can see the frames go from 29 30 35

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.600 
you can see the frames go from 29 30 35
and<00:02:47.220> it's<00:02:47.460> decent<00:02:47.850> enough<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:49.050> use<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.610> ultra

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
and it's decent enough to use on ultra
