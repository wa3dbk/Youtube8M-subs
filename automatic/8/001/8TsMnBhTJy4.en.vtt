00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.900
 there's something that probably a lot of people 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:09.780
 lest you have not thought about is that 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.480
 things we do with everything sure of the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.690
 parboiled the vegetables that were left over 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 we liquefy the potatoes 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.110
 mixed a little bit of carrot a little 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 a lot of dust and makes a creampie 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.650
 it is impossible that I can tell you in this 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.740
 case a recipe because 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.140
 I do not know what vegetables are left over and how 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.910
 has left over salt dating choose from the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.200
 sauces that I think more will 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.200
 is going to be very good 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:48.019
 think with a little cup of the channel 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.019
 Milk shakes and the matter is over 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.740
 let's take part of the meat by 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.930
 example the chicken we mix it with a 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.570
 little bit of alcohol with a little bit of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.510
 white sauce 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.090
 cool we went through flour egg and bread 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.150
 grated and the famous frying 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.410
 I think that you remove from parboiled 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.410
 of the 200 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.900
 one let 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.710
 for example 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.710
 with the south 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:39.110
 of sancochado we already have two small plates 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.289
 without many but if I have left chicken 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 the two are left over two vegetables and not over 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.510
 a little white sauce to make 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.910
 the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.410
 and we mix everything we have a new 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.270
 Fill to which we add a little 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.520
 liquefied yellow sauce that we 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.220
 It was left over and we have a filling to make 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.140
 empanadas the dough do not worry the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.430
 sold in the market in supermarkets 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.690
 discs of dough and makes some breaded 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.690
 parboiled and fry 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.810
 good look 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.510
 everything that can be done with what 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.510
 over the cut ones 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.370
 i 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.269
 third dish and we can still be one 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.269
 plus 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.550
 the last dish left me a piece of 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.500
 rib 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.250
 let's put a little garlic a 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.250
 little bit of ajÃ­ onion panca 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.410
 I left over and in this piece of ribs 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.410
 for God 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.050
 study that already undoes already 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:10.570
 has how it falls apart and we're going to be a 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.570
 so many different let's see this 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.770
 let's throw a little bit of 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.220
 boiled broth 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.540
 and we found a little bit of draining 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.140
 little 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.510
 coconut milk a little bit 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.420
 and grass luisa a little backing off that is 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.310
 own to ours as well and we're going to 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.030
 let cook this 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.530
 what it takes for the meat to suck everything 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.390
 flavor 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.240
 and we're ready because we're going to 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.000
 accompany with a rice 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.000
 to which we have to add coconuts 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
 almonds 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.920
 and you do not even have to pass it 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.920
 to another 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.319
 we have finished 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.780

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.270

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.920
 which we accompany with this landmark rice 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.400
