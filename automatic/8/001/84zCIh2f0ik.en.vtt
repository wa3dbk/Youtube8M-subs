 wash their hands or wipe them with a 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.840
 cloth so they can continue cooking

 they are going to put olive oil 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.250
 I'm going to put 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.780
 little by little 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.780
 the thighs the legs 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.830

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.830
 Pepper 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.700
 we need the design has the chicken 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.159
 because that we're going to leave it on low heat 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.229
 this recipe is ideal but when it comes 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.219
 one of the friends at home because she is 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.920
 very fresh and the taste of mandarin is 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:46.960
 public is a different recipe is not the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.450
 typical grilled person 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.960
 to surprise your families you know 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.960
 this recipe 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.700
 h 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.090
 We are going to take about ten minutes 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.090
 no more 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.739
 we leave you is already golden chicken 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.739
 we create sand that more white wine 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.849
 the juice of 4 tangerines 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.470
 they have to pretty much cover the chicken 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.520
 I'm going to put 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.520
 these segments of tangerine 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.340
 and onion again is the onion 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.220
 because the onion is not fried 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.570
 some way inside the stew I want 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.960
 that is soft, I do not want it to be 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.960
 golden 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.610
 to incorporate all this 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.530
 and the value and specifically I found 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.430
 laurel marjoram 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.830
 a little parsley can do 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.260
 although they have at hand 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.280
 and that I'm going to also put two or three 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.290
 tablespoons of honey 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.260
 do not worry because I do not know 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.959
 is integrated now at the end like this is 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.580
 of low cooking are going to integrate very 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.550
 well the flavors 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.550
 I'm going to put a little pepper 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.970
 I'm going to mix what I'm going to leave 20-25 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.810
 minutes because the neck is already sealed 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.880
 they are legs and thighs then 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.760
 rectify as I want to I do not like 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.740
 chicken dry I like to be 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.430
 of pierre half then I would tell them 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.530
 maximum 25 minutes leave it there if you 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.230
