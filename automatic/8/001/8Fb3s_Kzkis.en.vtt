that's such just kind of stack them
around<00:03:07.840> here<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.609> nice<00:03:09.900> angle<00:03:10.900> the

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
around here I like to do nice angle the

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.800 
around here I like to do nice angle the
bias<00:03:11.319> cuts<00:03:11.739> so<00:03:12.549> they<00:03:12.670> kind<00:03:12.910> of<00:03:12.970> stand<00:03:13.299> up<00:03:13.569> and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
bias cuts so they kind of stand up and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.009 
bias cuts so they kind of stand up and
stand<00:03:14.049> out<00:03:15.269> another<00:03:16.269> piece<00:03:16.510> of<00:03:16.810> our<00:03:17.049> yeah<00:03:19.019> and

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
stand out another piece of our yeah and

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.379 
stand out another piece of our yeah and
then<00:03:20.170> we<00:03:20.290> have<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.889> really<00:03:21.400> nice<00:03:21.579> tempura
