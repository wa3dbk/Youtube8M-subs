00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
kill switch somewhere else if you

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.120 
kill switch somewhere else if you
already<00:01:26.079> know<00:01:26.380> what<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.560> volume<00:01:26.770> one's<00:01:26.950> going

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
already know what the volume one's going

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.819 
already know what the volume one's going
to<00:01:27.159> be<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:28.000> can<00:01:28.030> whack<00:01:28.390> it<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:29.380> get<00:01:29.530> your<00:01:29.649> kill

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
to be you can whack it and get your kill

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.460 
to be you can whack it and get your kill
so<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.729> just<00:01:30.909> makes<00:01:31.030> perfect<00:01:31.539> sense<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:32.020> make

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470

going and I found that really intuitive
and<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:42.280> first<00:01:42.460> started<00:01:42.549> using<00:01:42.880> something

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
and I first started using something

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:44.940 
and I first started using something
quite<00:01:43.720> cool<00:01:43.929> about<00:01:44.110> this<00:01:44.259> kill<00:01:44.470> switch<00:01:44.500> other

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
quite cool about this kill switch other

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.310 
quite cool about this kill switch other
than<00:01:45.159> the<00:01:45.220> fact<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.399> it<00:01:45.549> kills<00:01:45.759> is<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:47.079> it's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
than the fact that it kills is that it's

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.649 
than the fact that it kills is that it's
got<00:01:47.409> a<00:01:47.470> very<00:01:47.530> slight<00:01:48.399> lock<00:01:48.789> when<00:01:49.240> you<00:01:49.329> bring<00:01:49.509> it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
got a very slight lock when you bring it

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.020 
got a very slight lock when you bring it
to<00:01:49.750> ten<00:01:49.990> now<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.009> really<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.399> lock<00:01:51.729> it's

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
to ten now this is really a lock it's

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.180 
to ten now this is really a lock it's
more<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.390> sort<00:01:52.569> of<00:01:52.630> magnetic<00:01:52.840> pull<00:01:53.409> towards

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
more of a sort of magnetic pull towards

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.300 
more of a sort of magnetic pull towards
ten<00:01:54.490> towards<00:01:55.119> infinity<00:01:55.420> so<00:01:56.200> as<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.799> roll<00:01:57.069> the

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
ten towards infinity so as you roll the

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.820 
ten towards infinity so as you roll the
volume<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.850> it's<00:01:58.390> got<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.630> tiny<00:01:58.959> little<00:01:59.470> click

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
volume in it's got a tiny little click

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.980 
volume in it's got a tiny little click
and<00:02:00.069> it<00:02:00.369> sort<00:02:00.520> of<00:02:00.549> locks<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:01.000> in<00:02:01.090> place<00:02:01.119> but

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
and it sort of locks it in place but

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.960 
and it sort of locks it in place but
it's<00:02:02.140> so<00:02:02.380> subtle<00:02:02.709> that<00:02:03.429> you<00:02:03.520> could<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:03.819> can

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
it's so subtle that you could you can

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.149 
it's so subtle that you could you can
