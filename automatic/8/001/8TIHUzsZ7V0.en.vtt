mock-up but the size and the look and
weight<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:43.960> this<00:03:44.350> is<00:03:44.620> exactly<00:03:45.400> as<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.970> would<00:03:46.150> be

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
weight of this is exactly as it would be

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.200 
weight of this is exactly as it would be
on<00:03:47.110> the<00:03:47.350> aircraft<00:03:47.740> so<00:03:48.430> again<00:03:48.610> this<00:03:48.790> is<00:03:49.030> how<00:03:49.060> the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
we talked about this is the fairing of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.810 
we talked about this is the fairing of
the<00:04:01.540> structure<00:04:02.230> with<00:04:02.680> the<00:04:02.830> radome<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.580> piece

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
the structure with the radome this piece

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.590 
the structure with the radome this piece
here<00:04:04.200> this<00:04:05.200> is<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.470> new<00:04:05.620> technology<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:09.600> XM

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
here this is the new technology the XM

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.260 
here this is the new technology the XM
antenna<00:04:11.250> VHF<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.460> then<00:04:12.730> our<00:04:12.880> Waddle

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
antenna VHF and then our Waddle

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.480 
antenna VHF and then our Waddle
technology<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.380> takes<00:04:14.860> all<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.070> aircraft

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
technology that takes all the aircraft

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.650 
technology that takes all the aircraft
off<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.910> aircraft<00:04:16.770> when<00:04:17.770> landing<00:04:18.390> so<00:04:19.390> as<00:04:19.510> we

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
off the aircraft when landing so as we

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.360 
off the aircraft when landing so as we
were<00:04:19.780> just<00:04:19.810> up<00:04:20.140> on<00:04:20.260> top<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.770> aircraft<00:04:20.920> now

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
were just up on top of the aircraft now

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.890 
were just up on top of the aircraft now
what<00:04:21.550> I<00:04:21.580> want<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.880> show<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.390> a<00:04:22.420> truck<00:04:22.870> that

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
what I want to show you is a truck that

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.790 
what I want to show you is a truck that
we've<00:04:23.350> had<00:04:23.610> specifically<00:04:24.610> designed<00:04:25.030> for

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
we've had specifically designed for

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.170 
we've had specifically designed for
maintaining<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:27.100> antenna<00:04:27.640> that<00:04:27.790> won't<00:04:28.000> have

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
maintaining the antenna that won't have

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.330 
maintaining the antenna that won't have
on<00:04:28.390> top<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.870> aircraft<00:04:29.020> but<00:04:29.830> you<00:04:29.920> can<00:04:30.100> see

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
on top of the aircraft but you can see

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.790 
on top of the aircraft but you can see
that<00:04:30.700> this<00:04:31.000> truck<00:04:31.390> has<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.230> capability<00:04:32.770> to

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
that this truck has the capability to

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.700 
that this truck has the capability to
extend<00:04:33.430> up<00:04:33.670> and<00:04:33.940> over<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:35.200> top<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.470> the

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
extend up and over the top of the

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.530 
extend up and over the top of the
fuselage<00:04:36.160> so<00:04:36.580> that<00:04:36.730> we<00:04:36.850> can<00:04:37.000> get<00:04:37.090> access<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
fuselage so that we can get access to

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.370 
fuselage so that we can get access to
the<00:04:37.840> antenna<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.860> actually<00:04:39.220> pull<00:04:39.460> it<00:04:39.580> off<00:04:39.670> for

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
the antenna to actually pull it off for

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.600 
the antenna to actually pull it off for
regular<00:04:41.380> maintenance<00:04:41.590> or<00:04:42.010> should<00:04:42.460> there<00:04:42.580> be

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
regular maintenance or should there be

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.970 
regular maintenance or should there be
any<00:04:42.850> reason<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.360> get<00:04:43.630> underneath<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.260> radome

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
any reason to get underneath the radome

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.100 
any reason to get underneath the radome
to<00:04:45.340> look<00:04:45.490> at<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.730> antennas<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.780> will<00:04:46.960> give

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
to look at the antennas this will give

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.170 
to look at the antennas this will give
us<00:04:47.200> the<00:04:47.350> ability<00:04:47.440> this<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.640> specifically

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
us the ability this is specifically

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.420 
us the ability this is specifically
needed<00:04:49.510> because<00:04:49.720> not<00:04:50.020> every<00:04:50.290> airport<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.040> not

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
needed because not every airport and not

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.610 
needed because not every airport and not
every<00:04:51.700> airline<00:04:52.060> has<00:04:52.330> access<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:53.080> hangar<00:04:53.470> and

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
every airline has access to a hangar and

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.680 
every airline has access to a hangar and
this<00:04:54.490> will<00:04:54.700> give<00:04:54.820> us<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:55.120> ability<00:04:55.330> to

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
this will give us the ability to

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.720 
this will give us the ability to
maintain<00:04:55.900> the<00:04:56.350> fleet<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:57.370> much<00:04:57.520> more

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
maintain the fleet and a much more

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.330 
maintain the fleet and a much more
responsive<00:04:58.390> manner<00:04:58.710> once<00:04:59.710> we<00:04:59.890> deploy<00:05:00.160> the

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
responsive manner once we deploy the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.760 
responsive manner once we deploy the
solution<00:05:00.460> system
