00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.270
 Hello and welcome to the tutorial coke 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.280
 collection on a soft volume of 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.469
 flutes for cupcakes where I'm going to 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.780
 show how to achieve this finish in your 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.060
 cupcakes with a beautiful took in fondant 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.130
 or in chocolate to mold utensils 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.080
 equipment and ingredients to achieve it 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.000
 we have some cornstarch also 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.070
 They can use powdered sugar or sugar 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.440
 glas I like it in this sprinkler 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.720
 so that it is distributed evenly I have 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.879
 a circular cookie cutter the 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.070
 size of this cutter varies according to the 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.930
 size of your cupcake just grab 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.300
 your cupcake and make sure that the 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.340
 cutter is larger than the size of the 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.190
 able and I what will allow to achieve a 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.410
 dome raised on the glaze here I have 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.360
 a little glaze can also use 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.090
 desire or glaze bought in a store 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.860
 or can they make their own glaze I have 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.050
 a roll for fondant but any 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.120
 roll serves a knife to spread with 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.890
 a good against straight hair we can use 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.630
 chocolate for molding or fondant 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.509
 either of the two works 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.690
 perfectly I will start preparing 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.610
 my cupcake with the glaze 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.520
 that the glaze does not fall on the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.950
 castle if this happens they can clean it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.780
 with a try in or dry soft cloth but 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.300
 do everything possible to maintain the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.670
 frosting over the cupcake because once 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.910
 put the fondant dome they want it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.190
 look as clean as possible and 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.500
 you can see that I carry the glaze up 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.130
 the edge of the k cupcake aisle but 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.700
 not about it 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.950
 I work with the icing on the cupcake 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.020
 I add a little more and I move my knife 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.520
 back and forth having 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.230
 careful not to dirty the sides 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.690
 and I make a dome shape here 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.140
 can soften it but do not worry 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.560
 if they do not fit 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.630
 that they stay like that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.790
 well now we take the fondant or the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 chocolate to mold we have a 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.590
 phenomenal recipe for making chocolate 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.259
 to mold in our channel if they wish 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.899
 check it but as I said the fondant 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.509
 it's perfect we also spray a little 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.489
 cornstarch or powdered sugar we put on top 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.890
 of the fondant and stretch it with the 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.080
 roller I like to move my fondant 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.720
 as you see here he passed the roller to a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.480
 couple of times he turned it over he passed the 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.580
 roll again and flipped it over too 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.100
 I try that the fondant does not stay 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.019
 thick because united to the cream icing 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.269
 of butter and the other details 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.910
 that they add may end up being 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.040
 too sweet so I make my fondant 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.290
 very thin and when I feel 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.870
 satisfied with the thickness of my fondant 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.000
 You can see how thin I am, I choose 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.730
 the part that looks cleaner with the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.920
 minor layer of cornstarch and cut a cute 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.349
 circle with my cookie cutter 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.360
 now I grab it and put it on the 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.599
 butter cream frosting this 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.300
 way they put it right in the center and with 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.670
 his fingers gently push him towards 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.670
 k corridor edge trying not 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.130
 press or push the glaze only the 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.220
 fondant because they do not want it to come out 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.739
 on the sides if they can avoid it they can 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.590
 see that a little bit is coming out here 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:17.110
 but there is no problem as I mentioned 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.380
 you just have to avoid messing up the 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.709
 castle and carry their pnc sleeve to the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.709
 edge 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.200
 then clean the excess glaze with 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.200
 your fingers 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.099
 once they have cleaned the glaze 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.069
 the edges are going to use the palm of your 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:45.080
 hand and in circular motion soften 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.080
 your fondant dome in this way 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.489
 and here they have their fondant dome 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.799
 finished here you can see some 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.510
 cupcakes with this fondant finish and 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.749
 I think you'll agree that it gives you the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.430
 cupcake a clean and smooth cute finish 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.769
 it requires a little more time than 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.540
 simply put cream glaze 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.030
 butter but I think it's worth it 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.459
