00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.559
 received from asus this headset volcano 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.769
 about 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.190
 under the brand republic u in gamer did 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.260
 small boxing's look at what's inside 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.189
 end of the video will do a little test 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 microphone well, let's go very 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.769
 weighty box on the back cover 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.660
 written equipment that is themselves 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.040
 headphones 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:43.649
 microphone wiring and branded 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:47.129
 asusovskie sound card's what that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:52.140
 let's see here as 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:58.039
 Case looks with headphones themselves so 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.039
 it opens here 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:13.050
 special place for which you can 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.050
 it's all about pulling out papers like 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.000
 remove the top 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:27.580
 drowns the case so pretty 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:32.740
 iron cap 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:35.950
 republic of games does not concern good 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.899
 quality is very nice to look at and in 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.960
 it will be convenient to take the road for now 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:45.640
 postpone here too, here we have a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.380
 quick start guide 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:59.399
 as well as that equipment 2 wires ulta 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.399
 we read that with vip member 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.420
 warning 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.549
 and roughly speaking and 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.549
 now you can proceed to this 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:19.260
 that's how it is all so complicated pretty 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.110
 so hard to cover again 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:31.849
 some kind of caution here it is 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:35.670
 This is a sound card from asus specifically for 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:38.459
 enable sorrow presser and m p mode and 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.280
 for shooters mode so it all looks 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.459
 it will be hard to see well here 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.720
 I'll show you better 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:50.430
 fps mode i.e. 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.900
 Separately include or all together fps 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:00.569
 mode increases the sound of a shot of explosions 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:04.459
 walk shit here and so it is clear Olympia 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.459
 frequency gain as I remember 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:17.000
 disconnect wiring 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:21.720
 microphone volume switch all in 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.769

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.769

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.540

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.250
 everyone could listen in the headphones 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.250

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:50.790
