00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
just like any other star you can do the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.850 
just like any other star you can do the
Jay<00:02:04.680> Leno<00:02:04.920> Show<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> end<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.649> I'm<00:02:07.649> just

I'm<00:02:08.459> sort<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.209> surprised<00:02:09.720> not<00:02:10.050> more<00:02:10.259> was<00:02:10.410> done

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
I'm sort of surprised not more was done

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.240 
I'm sort of surprised not more was done
with<00:02:10.739> number<00:02:11.009> four

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
with number four

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.910 
with number four
and<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:11.940> guess<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.570> sort<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.230> hope<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and I guess I sort of hope that in the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.860 
and I guess I sort of hope that in the
future<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.520> see<00:02:14.760> more<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.510> sort<00:02:15.720> of

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
future we see more of this sort of

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
future we see more of this sort of
character<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.550> they<00:02:17.700> they<00:02:18.120> don't

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
character and and that they they don't

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.020 
character and and that they they don't
stop<00:02:18.750> there<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.800> they<00:02:19.950> get<00:02:20.100> him<00:02:20.190> out<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.550> meet

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
stop there that they get him out to meet

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.150 
stop there that they get him out to meet
his<00:02:21.270> fans<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.470> think<00:02:22.890> he'd<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.130> really

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
his fans and I think he'd be really

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.970 
his fans and I think he'd be really
well-received
