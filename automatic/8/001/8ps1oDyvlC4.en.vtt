00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.770
 hello guys but leaving morals of the rose 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.130
 I am very happy to be able to participate 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.440
 channel 6 criminal with many friends 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.330
 many partners and the invitation was 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.980
 was meant to talk about the book 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.249
 theory of games applied to the process 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.939
 that recently in Portugal 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:24.009
 discussion that promotes the inter- 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.559
 between game theory 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.359
 thought adapted to prosecution 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:31.269
 precisely in the interrelationship between 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.489
 people but we have structured 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.440
 theoretically who are the characters of the 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.690
 criminal proceedings or that we have 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.250
 police officer 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.719
 the first moment and then the 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.539
 participation of defense lawyers 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.609
 public judges and prosecutors we have 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.949
 At first I thought of a logic of 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.289
 these chairs are formed are occupied 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.989
 by natural persons persons with a 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:55.359
 formation of subjectivity and that, for 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.999
 that we do not have the possibility to 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:01.059
 to think that they can separate their 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:03.129
 individuality of his or her role in the 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.170
 current context as well denounced by 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.990
 he delivered from among others we have a 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.390
 very great confusion regarding what 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.640
 which is your individual design 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.899
 hence we intend to show that the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.729
 Game theory 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.490
 a branch of mathematics and we do not want 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.710
 that no one goes by the math to 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.869
 But I can understand that many times 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.649
 the past relations between subjects 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.380
 between individuals is due to interests 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.780
 others we can motivate them 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.579
 other interests range from your 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.530
 your rewards in this 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.780
 process but fundamentally by the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.759
 construction of a structure that can 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.439
 help us think and the expectation of 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.180
 behavior of each of the 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.340
 actors in criminal proceedings 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.500
 we put this in the judge's chairs 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.880
 promoter defense counsel of the accused 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.280
 that is 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.960
 Who are we? We have to know the people. 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.210
 physicists who are still with 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.649
 theoretical conformation that thinks about crime 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.450
 theory of crime if they think like 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.490
 causes risk finishes exemption from 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.799
 objective imputation which is the object of 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.420
 criminal procedure the crime of three good 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.100
 services does not have this part of the imputation 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.289
 objective we have to adapt the 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.270
 language the way he thinks he does not 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.610
 of course we want to put a pen 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.750
 drive on the head of the prosecuting judge everything 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.070
 defender each 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.050
 this part of its coordinates 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.160
 symbolic of the way a beautiful 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.750
 How is it in the world? 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.340
 hence someone who has only studied the party 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.690
 we end up thinking from the 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.790
 functionalism categories 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.070
 there we can establish how is the 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.420
 mental map this person and other side we 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.580
 Can we think about your training? 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.590
 theory of criminal procedure 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.050
 he thinks the criminal park bill bilou 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.610
 he thinks share with his team think 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.470
 from doing it he does not think 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.240
 This is important because 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.070
 from that process girl in the 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.300
 we can understand how your 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.220
 understanding of presumption of innocence 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.100
 how will your understanding in 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.620
 for example the production of evidence 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.810
 and proof by the judge of his notion of 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.910
 system is an accounting system 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.910
 inquisitorial his constitutional system 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.720
 a from the conventionality 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.400
 we find that the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.810
 conventionality no space too much 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.060
 fundamentally from the 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.190
 our great discussed ones in audience 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.080
 of custody in a match of each 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.110
 of your motions that we can get 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.820
 who for the books that the judges use for 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.320
 their training for teachers who 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.170
 were we can have the expectation 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.260
 of their behavior in an environment 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.030
 the accused can not 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.489
 somehow be thought of with a 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.200
 figure and I need an object and need 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.690
 participate and this participation in a 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.910
 series of elements that psychology 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.470
 makes us aware of the way in which 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.510
 should behave as it should be 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.790
 present the way in which he 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.670
 sit in the chair and accuse 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.130
 we can then think of 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.190
 places of the player which players 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.930
 it will be the strategy the promoter always wants 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.790
 conviction in the proceeding may be 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.769
 used for other purposes may 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.810
 ask more than you want to be able to 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.790
 eventually making a concession in the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.860
 hearing a grant on time 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.480
 of judgment we have to look for which 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.130
 is the rate used at each moment 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.350
 strategy was what we 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.090
 we want long-term and attack 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.220
 design on every tenth in each question 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.630
 we can know if the promoter is that 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.700
 someone who thinks from false 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.670
 memories if a clean throwing promoter is 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.620
 a defender plays lipsy to fair play if it is 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.959
 in previous games we have this 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:20.019
 circumstance or a series we deny 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.150
 that we can get information 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.130
 qualified to better prepare 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.020
 no use leaving the courtroom 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.040
 thinking why should I have done 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.500
 that question 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.330
 this question is alli luck 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.150
 that we have to prepare ourselves with the 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.210
 adequate techniques for this there is the book 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.590
 therefore seeks from a structure that 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.060
 It is not essential that I will not give 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.710
 new essence the work process 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.110
 process I 'm going to work with the 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.300
 existing interrelationship possibilities 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.700
 in each of these subjects searches in the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.110
 cognitive psychology 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.640
 from Daniel Cana is a book that 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.810
 have at any bookstore called 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.090
 slow fast 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.130
 the book taleb in which we can can 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.960
 realize how to build the maps 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.630
 mental factors and how the factors 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.550
 influence the probative dynamics as 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.330
 those factors may influence the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.120
 decision 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.850
 hence we think this way 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.640
 putting some new ones some new 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.160
 significant in the procedural structure and 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.300
 we seek to understand what all 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.130
 we have a feeling that the books 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.230
 alone can not describe the 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.270
 phenomenon and much more to prepare us 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.760
 increasingly more and more 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.460
 the need not surprise us in 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.870
 audiences with here with 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.080
 behaviors of procedural subjects 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.660
 and if we had information 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.790
 qualified in each of them we can 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:46.120
 act more effectively so 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.430
 that the book seeks to give this dimension of 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.250
 play and then the game is important to 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.830
 tell a Christian country the game is had 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.470
 with something dirty like something 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.330
 second level and the game here is thought 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.220
 and a logic of ilsinho ie we 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.110
 we played from the beginning we played with 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.230
 our with our family relationships 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.600
 and in the criminal process understood as game 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.270
 we have this concern our only 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.610
 warning that the game for more 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.670
 that we have read and acted from 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:18.340
 of this game model we defend a 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.450
 game is a game that is not dirty 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.820
 fair play game 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.650
 so much that the accusation against defense and 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.620
 fundamentally a game in which we 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.290
 we have a judge and not someone who paid 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.750
 for prosecution against the defense the judge 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.210
 in this place can not make brother all 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.220
 we know that maradona scored a goal in the 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.440
 world cup 2016 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.240
 the goal was good but somehow it became 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.210
 the victory 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.220
 nothing was the argentina went ahead like 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.919
 all procedural games the important 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.419
 however, we reconstruct the categories of 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.740
 criminal proceedings to understand that 

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.110
 some moments the judge will want 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.240
 put your hand on the ball is going to bum us 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.759
 which from the most critical theory does not 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.789
 It's worth and we can not lose our 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:04.720
 if that this prospect becomes 

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:07.150
 therefore more agile and we 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.729
 therefore we can establish the trees 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.530
 the decisions of these structures 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.960
 decisions to understand the most 

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.120
 qualified what is a strategy what 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.789
 it is an effective practice 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.340
 I wish you all a great 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.449
 success I thank a colleague for the 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.449
 invitation and a big hug
