00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
Stony Brook University is research

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.610 
Stony Brook University is research
university<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:07.080> has<00:00:07.230> been<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.500> existence

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
university that has been in existence

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.350 
university that has been in existence
for<00:00:08.130> about<00:00:08.429> 50<00:00:08.910> years

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
for about 50 years

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.600 
for about 50 years
what's<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.110> young<00:00:10.290> University<00:00:10.740> but<00:00:11.340> sunny

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
what's a young University but sunny

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.910 
what's a young University but sunny
Brook<00:00:11.820> from<00:00:12.210> my<00:00:12.389> view<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.960> really<00:00:13.440> quite

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
Brook from my view is really quite

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.550 
Brook from my view is really quite
unique<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.580> offers<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.389> emphasizes<00:00:16.350> research

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
unique it offers and emphasizes research

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.160 
unique it offers and emphasizes research
in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.520> curriculum<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.840> really

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
in the curriculum so it really

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.769 
in the curriculum so it really
encourages<00:00:19.680> students<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> get<00:00:20.850> engaged<00:00:21.359> in

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
encourages students to get engaged in

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.220 
encourages students to get engaged in
research<00:00:22.320> because<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.460> reality<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
research because in reality it is the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320 
research because in reality it is the
research<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.310> confronting<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.300> challenges

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
research and confronting the challenges

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.290 
research and confronting the challenges
of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> bench<00:00:28.380> stuff<00:00:28.650> which<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.269> forces<00:00:30.269> a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
of the bench stuff which really forces a

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.089 
of the bench stuff which really forces a
student<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.929> understand<00:00:31.410> why<00:00:31.830> they're

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
student to understand why they're

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
student to understand why they're
learning<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.940> things<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.329> they<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.809> part

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
learning the things that they are a part

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
learning the things that they are a part
of<00:00:34.559> engineering<00:00:35.180> program<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> every

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
of engineering program is that every

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.889 
of engineering program is that every
student<00:00:37.410> does<00:00:37.620> junior<00:00:38.430> design<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.360> senior

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
student does junior design and senior

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
student does junior design and senior
design<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> an<00:00:41.579> extensive

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
design and so this is an extensive

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.000 
design and so this is an extensive
opportunity<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.110> do<00:00:43.260> something<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.980> a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
opportunity to do something that is a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.180 
opportunity to do something that is a
practical<00:00:44.610> interest<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> student<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:49.190> work

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
practical interest to the student I work

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
practical interest to the student I work
on<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.640> Stony<00:00:51.210> Brook<00:00:51.360> motor<00:00:51.600> sports<00:00:51.809> team<00:00:52.079> and

on the Stony Brook motor sports team and

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.069 
on the Stony Brook motor sports team and
my<00:00:52.770> design<00:00:53.100> project<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.730> rear<00:00:54.329> suspension<00:00:54.870> for

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
my design project is rear suspension for

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.350 
my design project is rear suspension for

projects<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.699> I've<00:00:59.850> worked<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.329> campus

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
projects that I've worked on on campus

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.009 
projects that I've worked on on campus
have<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.820> kind<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.940> given<00:01:03.210> me<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
have really kind of given me that that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
have really kind of given me that that
extra<00:01:04.350> edge<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.280> learn<00:01:05.460> things<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
extra edge you learn things and you

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
extra edge you learn things and you
experience<00:01:06.570> things<00:01:06.780> outside<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
experience things outside of the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
experience things outside of the
classroom<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:07.979> makes<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.250> huge<00:01:08.280> difference

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
classroom which makes a huge difference

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.070 
classroom which makes a huge difference
when<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.119> working<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> field<00:01:09.900> because

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
when you're working in the field because

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.990 
when you're working in the field because
you<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> deeper<00:01:10.890> understanding<00:01:10.920> of<00:01:11.729> what

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you have a deeper understanding of what
