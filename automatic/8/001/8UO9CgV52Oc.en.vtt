00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.950
 because everything is music 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.469
 with youtube friends, well, right now 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.480
 I bring you the video of how to do the 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.920
 marker that the other day them in another 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.420
 video I showed them the good video look at 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.470
 the first step what we have to do 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.700
 It is to buy a marker around the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.830
 marker 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.079
 is a proofreader I bought it right now 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.089
 a stationery 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.700
 even those of plastic 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:40.400
 can squeeze good that already with this 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.280
 we are going to 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.090
 we are going to empty it there, I empty it and 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.790
 on a surface that absorbs and good 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.310
 what we are not going to remove that is not 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.580
 a marble what is inside is like 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.560
 a metal stick and that serves to make 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.170
 always moving the paint or the 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.120
 corrector or what they are going to put me 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.010
 in this case I'm going to put paint 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.740
 comex and chrome to hold the color well 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.130
 like the mane type the first few times 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.040
 I saw in youtube videos and the smart ones 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.230
 grint cards 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.740
 in the color chrome and the truth looks very 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.030
 chida the first thing we have to do 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.840
 as they are taught in the other video 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.479
 we have to empty the paint 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.390
 in some boat somewhere not what 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.250
 we can put direct because then for the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.979
 gas and for all those things is not going to 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.219
 power but good now I'm emptying 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.189
 so that I can fill it and good 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.020
 I'm going to empty it right now 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.939
 here 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.070
 water a bit because the truth where 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.380
 good ink comes in more in the paint 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.579
 in this case the hole is very small 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.359
 that's why it dries and so much but good 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.950
 joke is that between 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.500
 First do not make the mistake that I made 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.450
 first metals 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.720
 the metal stick so that it moves 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.660
 all the painting before that because if 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.630
 they do not become real 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.510
 and good what we do will put the 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.510
 top with what we are going to paint 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.230
 it's more or less like a slosher and 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.040
 Well now let's see the 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.040
 show this look 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.260
 Drains more than the other that teaches 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.360
 with flexo ink because flexo ink 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.720
 like he did a little 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.280
 not so liquid the chrome drains very 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.260
 cool and the truth seems the strokes that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.630
 do marqueses kring yes yes we 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.910
 it serves to make tags as you see it is a 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.410
 bit complicated but I can 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.550
 the material that I'm doing 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.940
 right now it's a canvas 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.310
 because you lived no longer no I can not 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.460
 complain is a marker that cost me 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.730
 four pesos or that corrector costs 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.950
 four pesos you empty it and good you 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.220
 you buy your boat with this right now 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.390
 commerce is with 40 pesos but then 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.920
 it's worth it because it's enough for you 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.330
 fill a lot of times they look there 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.220
 as in that text is increasing 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.430
 as it was more controlled the ink and we 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.430
 it drained so much 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.859
 and it looks very cool but in other tags 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.850
 as right now look there is all that 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.890
 they can drain 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.720
 is similar to what the king does 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.420
 maybe if they want more fluids you 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.280
 they can inflate big bucks 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.750
 to chrome and it's going to be stiffer but 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.750
 Well, I think that's enough with that 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.800
 visit my facebook against gallardo and 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:52.380
 Well, there I am going to stop to put more 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.390
 yes 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.390
 samples come out fire 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.910
 and repeat again
