00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.100
 here is the verse and I played like this 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:12.240

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.820
 and 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.330
 understandable with this fight and in the refrain I played 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.789
 like this 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.789

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.300
 and 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.160
 understandably 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.050
 you can also play it 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.060
 here 3 2 1 3 2 1 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:50.569
 at your discretion and let's get one more 

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.550
 the moment will be there the songs with C major 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.259
 and 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.789
 here will be such a transition transition 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:58.789
 through bass note si 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.090

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.840
 There are no songs anymore I told everything 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:28.250
