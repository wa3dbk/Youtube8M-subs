anna has an artificial intelligence
program<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.910> spectres<00:01:29.360> worse<00:01:29.630> than<00:01:29.870> we

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
program the spectres worse than we

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.720 
program the spectres worse than we
thought<00:01:29.990> we<00:01:30.710> have<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.950> deactivate<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.550> tower

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
thought we have to deactivate the tower

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.590 
thought we have to deactivate the tower
immediately<00:01:33.640> if<00:01:34.640> zanuck<00:01:35.120> keeps<00:01:35.330> getting

immediately if zanuck keeps getting

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.270 
immediately if zanuck keeps getting
stronger<00:01:35.870> and<00:01:36.170> take<00:01:36.530> control<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.980> entire

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
stronger and take control the entire

stronger and take control the entire
network<00:01:39.820> all<00:01:40.820> right<00:01:41.060> handle<00:01:41.330> this<00:01:41.420> thing<00:01:41.600> off

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
network all right handle this thing off

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.300 
network all right handle this thing off
much<00:01:41.870> longer<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.500> is<00:01:42.560> gonna<00:01:42.770> be<00:01:42.980> harder<00:01:43.280> than

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
much longer this is gonna be harder than

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.130 
much longer this is gonna be harder than
I<00:01:43.460> thought<00:01:43.520> Santa<00:01:44.300> must<00:01:44.510> have<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.750> reason<00:01:44.990> for

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
I thought Santa must have a reason for

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.650 
I thought Santa must have a reason for
doing<00:01:45.410> all<00:01:45.680> this<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.190> have<00:01:46.400> to<00:01:46.610> attack<00:01:46.940> whoa<00:01:47.390> I

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
doing all this we have to attack whoa I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.350 
doing all this we have to attack whoa I
guess<00:01:47.840> we're<00:01:48.050> back<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.260> action<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:49.490> who's<00:01:50.150> the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
guess we're back in action so who's the

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.650 
guess we're back in action so who's the
best<00:01:50.600> psycho<00:01:51.229> on<00:01:51.850> next<00:01:52.850> time<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:53.060> can<00:01:53.450> take

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
best psycho on next time you can take

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.990 
best psycho on next time you can take
the<00:01:53.780> bus
