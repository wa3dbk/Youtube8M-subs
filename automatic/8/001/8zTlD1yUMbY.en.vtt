00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
really kind of blew me away at first I

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.029 
really kind of blew me away at first I
wasn't<00:00:25.390> sure<00:00:25.539> what<00:00:25.720> to<00:00:25.780> make<00:00:25.930> of<00:00:26.110> it<00:00:26.380> and<00:00:26.590> then

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
wasn't sure what to make of it and then

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.070 
wasn't sure what to make of it and then
as<00:00:27.190> I<00:00:27.369> wore<00:00:27.640> and<00:00:27.940> use<00:00:28.150> it<00:00:28.390> this<00:00:28.690> thing<00:00:28.930> really

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
as I wore and use it this thing really

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.230 
as I wore and use it this thing really
became<00:00:29.470> one<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:29.680> my<00:00:29.860> favorite<00:00:30.280> watches<00:00:30.460> this

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
became one of my favorite watches this

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.209 
became one of my favorite watches this
is<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.949> c600<00:00:33.000> tritek<00:00:34.000> diver<00:00:34.719> elite<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.920> this

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
is the c600 tritek diver elite and this

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:37.470 
is the c600 tritek diver elite and this
is<00:00:36.370> obviously<00:00:36.489> in<00:00:36.819> their<00:00:36.969> diver<00:00:37.179> collection

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
is obviously in their diver collection

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.630 
is obviously in their diver collection
so<00:00:38.199> what's<00:00:38.379> going<00:00:38.679> on<00:00:38.769> here<00:00:38.890> we<00:00:39.010> have<00:00:39.100> a<00:00:39.129> 43

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
so what's going on here we have a 43

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.540 
so what's going on here we have a 43
millimeter<00:00:40.030> wide<00:00:40.350> steelcase<00:00:41.350> PVD<00:00:42.190> coated

millimeter wide steelcase PVD coated
black<00:00:42.760> black<00:00:43.600> dial<00:00:44.019> and<00:00:44.379> it's<00:00:45.190> it's<00:00:45.489> no<00:00:45.789> kind

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
black black dial and it's it's no kind

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.630 
black black dial and it's it's no kind
of<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.179> matte<00:00:46.420> black<00:00:47.289> look<00:00:47.890> to<00:00:48.069> it<00:00:48.219> same<00:00:48.489> thing

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
of a matte black look to it same thing

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.660 
of a matte black look to it same thing
with<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.789> dial<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:50.530> sapphire<00:00:51.010> crystal<00:00:51.489> here

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
with the dial the sapphire crystal here

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.689 
with the dial the sapphire crystal here
is<00:00:51.819> very<00:00:52.269> highly<00:00:52.780> domed<00:00:53.170> part<00:00:54.069> of<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.370> has<00:00:54.399> to

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
is very highly domed part of it has to

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.219 
is very highly domed part of it has to
do<00:00:54.819> with<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.030> fact<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.389> this<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.809> a<00:00:55.989> water

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
do with the fact that this is a water

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.950 
do with the fact that this is a water
resistant<00:00:56.769> to<00:00:56.859> 500<00:00:57.370> meters<00:00:57.429> and<00:00:57.909> doming<00:00:58.870> the

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
resistant to 500 meters and doming the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.360 
resistant to 500 meters and doming the
crystal<00:00:59.379> really<00:00:59.530> really<00:00:59.829> helps<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.280> that

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
crystal really really helps and that

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.279 
crystal really really helps and that
creates<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.609> little<00:01:00.729> bit<00:01:00.879> of<00:01:00.969> distortion<00:01:01.359> but

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
creates a little bit of distortion but

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.719 
creates a little bit of distortion but
in<00:01:02.409> this<00:01:02.559> watch<00:01:02.829> that<00:01:03.069> doesn't<00:01:03.339> really<00:01:03.429> matter

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:03.729 
in this watch that doesn't really matter

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.810 
in this watch that doesn't really matter
because<00:01:03.999> the<00:01:04.269> dial<00:01:04.600> is<00:01:04.930> still<00:01:05.530> so<00:01:06.310> easy<00:01:06.640> to

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
because the dial is still so easy to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.420 
because the dial is still so easy to
read<00:01:07.030> because<00:01:07.150> of<00:01:07.420> those<00:01:07.570> giant<00:01:07.930> green<00:01:08.799> hands

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
read because of those giant green hands

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.490 
read because of those giant green hands
and<00:01:09.579> green<00:01:10.149> hour<00:01:10.420> markers<00:01:11.020> and<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.350> addition

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
and green hour markers and in addition

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.889 
and green hour markers and in addition
to<00:01:11.950> them<00:01:12.100> being<00:01:12.310> so<00:01:12.579> big<00:01:12.850> they<00:01:13.390> also<00:01:13.570> have

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
to them being so big they also have

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.170 
to them being so big they also have
tritium<00:01:14.469> gas<00:01:14.710> tubes<00:01:15.100> in<00:01:15.310> them<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:15.939> you<00:01:16.000> get

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
tritium gas tubes in them so you get

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.859 
tritium gas tubes in them so you get
about<00:01:16.360> 25<00:01:16.869> years<00:01:17.229> of<00:01:17.640> illumination<00:01:18.640> and<00:01:19.119> you

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
about 25 years of illumination and you

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.149 
about 25 years of illumination and you
don't<00:01:20.109> need<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.289> charge<00:01:20.560> it<00:01:20.740> with<00:01:20.799> light<00:01:21.039> or

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
don't need to charge it with light or

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.039 
don't need to charge it with light or
anything<00:01:21.430> like<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.579> and<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.909> color<00:01:22.210> of<00:01:22.539> the

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
anything like that and the color of the

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.709 
anything like that and the color of the
training<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.409> gas<00:01:23.560> tubes<00:01:23.950> is<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.460> blue<00:01:24.969> so<00:01:25.570> it's

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
training and gas tubes is a blue so it's

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.840 
training and gas tubes is a blue so it's
very<00:01:25.840> very<00:01:26.170> nice<00:01:26.350> it's<00:01:26.649> not<00:01:26.799> super<00:01:27.520> super

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
very very nice it's not super super

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.420 
very very nice it's not super super
bright<00:01:28.119> but<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.840> dark<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.950> works<00:01:30.189> very

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
bright but in the dark it works very

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.459 
bright but in the dark it works very
very<00:01:30.759> well<00:01:30.969> helium<00:01:31.689> release<00:01:31.990> valve<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:32.409> you

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
very well helium release valve and you

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.139 
very well helium release valve and you
can<00:01:32.619> see<00:01:32.740> there's<00:01:32.920> a<00:01:33.009> little<00:01:33.159> green<00:01:33.460> accent

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
can see there's a little green accent

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.120 
can see there's a little green accent
right<00:01:34.329> there<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:35.229> movement<00:01:35.500> inside<00:01:35.920> the

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
right there the movement inside the

look not a lot of sharp edges and that

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.569 
look not a lot of sharp edges and that
tends<00:01:58.479> to<00:01:58.630> not<00:01:58.749> signify<00:01:59.409> I<00:01:59.890> guess<00:02:00.310> you<00:02:00.460> could

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579
