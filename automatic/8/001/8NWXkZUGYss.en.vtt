poor quality dry food if you have
kittens<00:04:43.740> my<00:04:44.159> best<00:04:44.520> suggestion<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.509> get

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
kittens my best suggestion is to get

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.089 
kittens my best suggestion is to get
them<00:04:45.810> off<00:04:45.900> of<00:04:45.960> dry<00:04:46.289> food<00:04:46.470> very<00:04:46.680> very<00:04:46.860> quickly

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
them off of dry food very very quickly

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.670 
them off of dry food very very quickly
because<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:48.030> longer<00:04:48.569> your<00:04:48.750> cats<00:04:49.050> eat<00:04:49.319> a

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
because the longer your cats eat a

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.369 
because the longer your cats eat a
grocery<00:04:50.460> store<00:04:50.490> brand<00:04:51.120> dry<00:04:51.479> food<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.960> harder

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
grocery store brand dry food the harder

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:53.809 
grocery store brand dry food the harder
it's<00:04:52.500> going<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.800> be<00:04:53.069> to<00:04:53.340> wean<00:04:53.490> them<00:04:53.669> onto

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
it's going to be to wean them onto

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.820 
it's going to be to wean them onto
better<00:04:54.090> quality<00:04:54.419> foods<00:04:54.599> you<00:04:54.840> can<00:04:55.020> do<00:04:55.139> it<00:04:55.289> but

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
better quality foods you can do it but

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.230 
better quality foods you can do it but
it<00:04:55.949> takes<00:04:56.129> a<00:04:56.280> lot<00:04:56.430> of<00:04:56.580> time<00:04:56.789> and<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.000> lot<00:04:57.090> of
