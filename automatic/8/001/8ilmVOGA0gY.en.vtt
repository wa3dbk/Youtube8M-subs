preassembled<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:16.020> all<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> rest<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
preassembled but all the rest of the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.350 
preassembled but all the rest of the
stuff<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.369> package<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.150> build

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
stuff in the package you have to build

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.420 
stuff in the package you have to build
there<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.990> about<00:01:19.170> 200<00:01:19.650> pieces<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
there are about 200 pieces and like I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.429 
there are about 200 pieces and like I
say<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.729> took<00:01:20.850> us<00:01:20.939> about<00:01:21.119> two<00:01:21.180> hours<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.290> can

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
say it took us about two hours you can

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
say it took us about two hours you can
build<00:01:22.619> them<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> three<00:01:23.490> different

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
build them in one of three different

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
build them in one of three different
configurations<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.380> he's<00:01:25.530> also<00:01:25.710> compatible

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
configurations but he's also compatible

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
configurations but he's also compatible
with<00:01:26.460> all<00:01:26.729> other<00:01:26.909> Makano<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.689> erector<00:01:28.439> set

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
with all other Makano or erector set

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
with all other Makano or erector set
pieces<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.820> can<00:01:30.000> actually<00:01:30.150> completely

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
pieces so you can actually completely

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.740 
pieces so you can actually completely
customize<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.470> spiky<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.070> wanted<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.750> so

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
customize your spiky if you wanted to so

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.359

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
optic cables actually plug into the back

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.420 
optic cables actually plug into the back
where<00:01:51.600> there<00:01:51.780> are<00:01:51.869> some<00:01:52.020> LEDs<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
where there are some LEDs and it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730 
where there are some LEDs and it
actually<00:01:53.610> carries<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.390> color<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.170> red<00:01:55.409> for

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
actually carries the color so red for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.830 
actually carries the color so red for
charging<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.399> example<00:01:56.790> green<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.270> ready<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
charging for example green for ready it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
charging for example green for ready it
actually<00:01:58.140> runs<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> way<00:01:58.920> through<00:01:59.219> his

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
actually runs it all the way through his

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.420 
actually runs it all the way through his
arm<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.540> through<00:02:01.079> this<00:02:01.259> body<00:02:01.740> portion<00:02:02.219> here

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
arm and through this body portion here

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.700 
arm and through this body portion here
so<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.899> say<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.320> build<00:02:04.469> them<00:02:04.590> in

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so you like I say you can build them in

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.170 
so you like I say you can build them in
one<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:04.950> three<00:02:05.070> different<00:02:05.369> configurations

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
one of three different configurations

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.940 
one of three different configurations
and<00:02:06.390> we're<00:02:06.990> actually<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.500> enamored<00:02:07.710> with

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and we're actually really enamored with

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.979 
and we're actually really enamored with
this<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.280> guy<00:02:08.489> after<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> two-hour<00:02:09.690> build

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this little guy after the two-hour build

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.540 
this little guy after the two-hour build
process<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.470> guess<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.770> was<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> bit<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.370> labor

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
process I guess it was a bit of a labor

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.830 
process I guess it was a bit of a labor
of<00:02:11.640> love<00:02:11.760> but<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:12.959> actually<00:02:13.200> control<00:02:13.530> him

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
of love but you can actually control him

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.259 
of love but you can actually control him
from<00:02:14.080> your<00:02:14.230> computer<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.489> can<00:02:15.610> interface

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
from your computer so you can interface

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.030 
from your computer so you can interface
directly<00:02:16.450> with<00:02:16.810> spikey<00:02:17.410> he<00:02:17.560> works<00:02:17.739> over<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
directly with spikey he works over the

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.890 
directly with spikey he works over the
Wi-Fi<00:02:18.190> network<00:02:18.760> if<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.569> don't<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
Wi-Fi network if you don't have a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.089 
Wi-Fi network if you don't have a

network in your home you can still
connect<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.519> them<00:02:21.610> from<00:02:21.790> any<00:02:21.940> Wi-Fi<00:02:22.810> ready

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
connect to them from any Wi-Fi ready

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.190 
connect to them from any Wi-Fi ready
laptop<00:02:23.530> he'll<00:02:23.769> show<00:02:23.950> up<00:02:24.069> as<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> Wi-Fi<00:02:24.790> device<00:02:25.200> a

laptop he'll show up as a Wi-Fi device a

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.020 
laptop he'll show up as a Wi-Fi device a
little<00:02:27.069> bit<00:02:27.160> more<00:02:27.310> advanced<00:02:27.610> than<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.879> is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
little bit more advanced than that is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.520 
little bit more advanced than that is
getting<00:02:28.239> him<00:02:28.450> on<00:02:28.569> your<00:02:28.690> home<00:02:28.750> network<00:02:28.900> so

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
getting him on your home network so

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.089 
getting him on your home network so
adding<00:02:30.010> in<00:02:30.129> all<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.459> appropriate<00:02:31.830> codes<00:02:32.830> that

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
adding in all the appropriate codes that

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.190 
adding in all the appropriate codes that
you<00:02:33.220> need<00:02:33.400> your<00:02:33.940> passphrase<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.720> actually

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
you need your passphrase to actually

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
you need your passphrase to actually
connect<00:02:35.560> spikey<00:02:35.980> with<00:02:36.129> your<00:02:36.280> network<00:02:36.580> and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
connect spikey with your network and

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.339 
connect spikey with your network and
once<00:02:37.330> you've<00:02:37.450> done<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.629> you<00:02:37.900> can<00:02:37.930> control

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
once you've done that you can control

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:39.780 
once you've done that you can control
them<00:02:38.410> from<00:02:38.709> any<00:02:38.830> computer<00:02:39.040> that's<00:02:39.730> connected

to that network in the home and cooler
still<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:43.629> can<00:02:43.780> actually<00:02:43.900> control

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
still is that you can actually control

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.110 
still is that you can actually control
him<00:02:44.560> from<00:02:44.739> any<00:02:44.890> remote<00:02:45.250> computer<00:02:45.819> which<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.000> a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
little bit more advanced you have to set

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.539 
little bit more advanced you have to set

mac address it's all it's all detailed
in<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.970> instruction<00:02:55.510> manual<00:02:55.540> which<00:02:56.019> which<00:02:56.590> is

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
in the instruction manual which which is

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.280 
in the instruction manual which which is
pretty<00:02:57.160> well<00:02:57.430> pretty<00:02:58.000> well<00:02:58.209> documented<00:02:58.540> so

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
pretty well pretty well documented so

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.860 
pretty well pretty well documented so
you<00:02:59.349> shouldn't<00:02:59.620> have<00:02:59.739> too<00:02:59.860> much<00:02:59.890> trouble<00:03:00.870> so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you shouldn't have too much trouble so

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.360 
you shouldn't have too much trouble so
like<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.019> say<00:03:02.230> budget<00:03:02.560> about<00:03:02.769> two<00:03:02.980> hours<00:03:03.129> for

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
like I say budget about two hours for

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.949 
like I say budget about two hours for
the<00:03:03.489> build<00:03:03.670> process<00:03:03.819> at<00:03:04.410> $215<00:03:05.670> online<00:03:06.959> it's

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
the build process at $215 online it's

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.539 
the build process at $215 online it's
pretty<00:03:08.349> reasonable<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.069> if<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.370> have<00:03:09.519> a

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
pretty reasonable if you if you have a

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.030 
pretty reasonable if you if you have a
mechanically<00:03:10.120> inclined<00:03:10.629> child<00:03:10.989> or<00:03:11.769> you're

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
mechanically inclined child or you're

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.309 
mechanically inclined child or you're
mechanically<00:03:13.000> inclined<00:03:13.569> kid<00:03:14.049> at<00:03:14.170> heart

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
mechanically inclined kid at heart

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.900 
mechanically inclined kid at heart
definitely<00:03:15.129> something<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.489> might<00:03:15.640> want<00:03:15.849> to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
definitely something you might want to

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.140 
definitely something you might want to
check<00:03:15.940> out<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:17.379> fact<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:17.829> can<00:03:18.150> record

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
check out the fact that you can record

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.580 
check out the fact that you can record
what's<00:03:19.569> happening<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.019> your<00:03:20.139> house<00:03:20.290> he'll
