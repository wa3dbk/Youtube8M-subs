of his character from the trailers and
the<00:01:16.789> songs<00:01:17.060> is<00:01:17.869> I'm<00:01:18.560> people<00:01:18.890> are<00:01:19.039> reacting<00:01:19.429> to

for Salman but I think ultimately it's

that's<00:02:16.099> my<00:02:16.250> feeling<00:02:16.550> as<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> director

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100

that's my feeling as a director
I<00:02:20.010> think<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.520> a<00:02:21.610> process<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:22.300> really<00:02:22.600> don't

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
I think it's a process you really don't

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.590 
I think it's a process you really don't
say<00:02:23.320> what<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.590> me<00:02:23.740> both<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.160> size<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.610> would

were working together but by the end of
tiger<00:03:09.250> I<00:03:09.280> think<00:03:09.550> we<00:03:09.700> both<00:03:09.880> understood<00:03:10.330> each

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
tiger I think we both understood each

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.630 
tiger I think we both understood each
other<00:03:11.260> very<00:03:11.830> well<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.070> that's<00:03:12.400> why<00:03:12.580> the

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
other very well and that's why the

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.750 
other very well and that's why the
second<00:03:13.120> collaboration<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:15.280> second

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
second collaboration and this second

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.340 
second collaboration and this second
collaboration<00:03:15.940> also<00:03:16.720> came<00:03:16.900> out<00:03:17.020> of<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.170> fact

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
collaboration also came out of the fact

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.900 
collaboration also came out of the fact
that<00:03:17.470> because<00:03:17.740> we<00:03:18.130> understood<00:03:18.520> each<00:03:18.640> other

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
that because we understood each other

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.430 
that because we understood each other
and<00:03:19.210> I<00:03:19.480> realize<00:03:19.780> there<00:03:19.930> are<00:03:19.960> certain<00:03:20.290> things

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440

shooting<00:03:30.430> this<00:03:30.550> film<00:03:30.940> it's<00:03:31.180> been<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.390> very

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
shooting this film it's been a very

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.020 
shooting this film it's been a very
positive<00:03:31.870> journey<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.580> think<00:03:33.610> ultimately

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
positive journey and I think ultimately

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.560 
positive journey and I think ultimately
that<00:03:34.600> positivity<00:03:35.470> shows<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.100> on-screen<00:03:36.670> I

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.000 

don't<00:03:40.570> call<00:03:40.930> their<00:03:41.080> difficulties<00:03:41.650> yeah<00:03:41.800> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
don't call their difficulties yeah the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.980 
don't call their difficulties yeah the
logistical<00:03:42.550> issues<00:03:42.820> because<00:03:43.780> we<00:03:43.900> were

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
logistical issues because we were

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.920 
logistical issues because we were
shooting<00:03:44.200> at<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:45.150> location<00:03:46.150> which<00:03:46.270> was<00:03:46.420> high<00:03:46.600> in

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
shooting at a location which was high in

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.750 
shooting at a location which was high in
altitude<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.590> was<00:03:47.770> at<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.130> base<00:03:48.280> of<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.550> Taj

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
altitude it was at the base of the Taj

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520 
altitude it was at the base of the Taj
was<00:03:48.970> glacier<00:03:49.450> which<00:03:49.690> extends<00:03:50.350> from<00:03:50.440> about

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
was glacier which extends from about

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.800 
was glacier which extends from about
10,000<00:03:51.340> feet<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.700> 11,000<00:03:52.240> feet<00:03:52.360> above<00:03:52.420> sea

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
10,000 feet to 11,000 feet above sea

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.590 
10,000 feet to 11,000 feet above sea
level<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:53.230> yes<00:03:53.770> it<00:03:53.950> was<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.640> know<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> sort

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
level so yes it was and you know I sort

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.810 
level so yes it was and you know I sort
of<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.930> guess<00:03:55.960> it's<00:03:56.230> because<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.620> my

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
of I guess it's because of my

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.100 
of I guess it's because of my
documentary<00:03:57.820> days<00:03:57.970> or<00:03:58.240> my<00:03:58.330> trekking<00:03:58.570> days<00:03:58.870> but

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
documentary days or my trekking days but

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.290 
documentary days or my trekking days but
I'm<00:03:59.230> always<00:03:59.380> looking<00:03:59.830> out<00:03:59.950> for<00:04:00.030> much<00:04:01.030> to

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
I'm always looking out for much to

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.030 
I'm always looking out for much to
servants<00:04:01.900> displeasure<00:04:02.260> locations<00:04:02.920> it

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
servants displeasure locations it

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.880 
servants displeasure locations it
inaccessible<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.750> was<00:04:04.960> about<00:04:05.200> an<00:04:05.320> ass<00:04:05.470> trek

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
inaccessible so it was about an ass trek

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.240 
inaccessible so it was about an ass trek
away<00:04:06.130> from<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.610> nearest<00:04:06.820> road<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:09.010> used

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
away from the nearest road so that used

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.710 
away from the nearest road so that used
to<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.490> but<00:04:09.850> I<00:04:09.910> guess<00:04:10.090> it's<00:04:10.270> all<00:04:10.360> part<00:04:10.570> of<00:04:10.630> the

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
to be but I guess it's all part of the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.090 
to be but I guess it's all part of the
game<00:04:10.870> that's<00:04:11.080> what<00:04:11.200> makes<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:11.620> special<00:04:11.740> and

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
game that's what makes it special and

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.530 
game that's what makes it special and
that's<00:04:12.250> that's<00:04:12.610> how<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.850> reach<00:04:13.120> special

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
that's that's how you reach special

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.420 
that's that's how you reach special
locations<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:14.200> ultimately<00:04:14.890> when<00:04:15.100> you<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.370> it

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
locations and ultimately when you see it

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.030 
locations and ultimately when you see it
on<00:04:15.550> screen<00:04:15.900> all<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:16.960> trouble<00:04:17.470> taken<00:04:17.770> to<00:04:17.890> reach
