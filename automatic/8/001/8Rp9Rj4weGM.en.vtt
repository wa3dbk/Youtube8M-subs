children so we just thought about it and
we<00:01:49.170> came<00:01:49.290> up<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.740> idea<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.610> doing

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
we came up with this idea of doing

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.210 
we came up with this idea of doing
everything<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.930> stroller<00:01:52.200> getting<00:01:52.890> under

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and unknown usage occasions and then

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.170 
and unknown usage occasions and then
designing<00:01:58.710> solutions<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.549> them<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.850> one

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
designing solutions for them is one

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.870 
designing solutions for them is one
thing<00:02:01.040> translating<00:02:02.040> an<00:02:02.130> innovative<00:02:02.670> design
