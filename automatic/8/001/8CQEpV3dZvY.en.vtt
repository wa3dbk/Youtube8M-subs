which we started this year in 2010 so

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.130 
which we started this year in 2010 so
it's<00:00:20.760> been<00:00:20.880> running<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.780> in<00:00:21.870> the<00:00:21.930> middle<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
it's been running it's in the middle of

it's been running it's in the middle of
its<00:00:22.260> first<00:00:22.410> year<00:00:22.650> present<00:00:23.360> so<00:00:24.360> the<00:00:24.480> program

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870 
its first year present so the program

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.770 
its first year present so the program
lasts<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:26.130> year<00:00:26.240> from<00:00:27.240> late<00:00:27.600> September

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.209 
MSC level mathematics modules there's
also<00:00:54.589> an<00:00:55.589> English<00:00:55.949> language<00:00:56.249> qualification

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
also an English language qualification

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.889 
also an English language qualification
for<00:00:59.219> example<00:00:59.609> IELTS<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.300> level<00:01:00.539> six<00:01:00.719> point

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
for example IELTS at level six point

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.979 
for example IELTS at level six point
five<00:01:01.109> around<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.329> but<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.389> focus<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
five around that but the focus of this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.830 
five around that but the focus of this
course<00:01:04.190> it's<00:01:05.190> interdisciplinary<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.780> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
course it's interdisciplinary so it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690 
course it's interdisciplinary so it
involves<00:01:07.259> both<00:01:07.469> math<00:01:07.770> etics<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> computer

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
involves both math etics and computer

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.999 
involves both math etics and computer
science<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:10.590> key<00:01:11.189> feature<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.600> 60<00:01:13.590> credits

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
science a key feature is the 60 credits

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.200 
science a key feature is the 60 credits
so<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> third<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.750> whole<00:01:16.020> programme

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
so it's a third of the whole programme

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.389 
so it's a third of the whole programme

more<00:01:31.259> supervisors<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.009> period<00:01:32.299> so

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
more supervisors for that period so

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.039 
more supervisors for that period so
that's<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.829> dissertation<00:01:35.750> for<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> rest

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
that's the the dissertation for the rest

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109 
that's the the dissertation for the rest
of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.289> program<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.609> collection<00:01:38.909> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
computer science I think the particular

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.289 
computer science I think the particular
focus<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:52.979> are<00:01:53.070> two<00:01:53.250> main<00:01:53.579> themes<00:01:53.969> running

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

possibly<00:03:09.480> that's<00:03:09.600> one<00:03:09.780> option<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:11.070> also<00:03:11.330> both

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
possibly that's one option but also both

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.720 
possibly that's one option but also both
