 whenever the red rooster the color 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.309
 this one is able to keep his spermatozoa for ten 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.620
 days in a tank located in the shape of a man 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.040
 our cock 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 it is to make understand his intentions 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.320
 if the female is receptive they put themselves in position for mating 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.720
 you may sometimes notice this behavior when you go near 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.580
 of your hens 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580

 starting signal 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 There you go 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.080
 whatever happens 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.720
 a poor hen 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.130
 even if there is no fertilization 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.130
 and did not even cocks the chicken coop 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.980
 as she gets older the frequency of rosaries 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.490
 as well as the number of follicles by schaeffler all will decrease small to 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 small until the final interruption of the skin 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.340

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.480
 and 95% limestone 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.200
 calcium carbonate if necessary to the composition of this protection 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.410
 natural and conveyed by the sense of the hen 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.019
 if the latter at mans 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.299
 the well will be directly in his reserve in this sense 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.610
 to avoid any risk of deficiency 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.710
 hens must therefore have access to sources of calcium does it have that 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.679
 it's alain mayor 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.199
 a mixture of sand and seaweed very rich in unforgettable appointment

 dry areas

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.139
 and of course all your copies of the same common crush mix 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.139
 then food 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.659
 if you pick up these sources of calcium yourself on the French coastline at 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:08.000
 the mind 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 13 hours 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.319
 we are sometimes brought by amassed city which inevitably attracts your 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.279
 Warning 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:29.299
 and perhaps arouses your concern too much 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.299
 here are some of the most common examples 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.569
 blood stain 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.479
 it often happens that the first doors of a young hen causes 

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.479
 some internal lesions that cause bleeding 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.239
 small games 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.999
 it is not uncommon to find a few towards the end of the season. 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.489
 lay before winter rest 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.719
 more exceptionally it is also possible that the presence of an organism 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.719
 alien as a worm in either the origin 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.059
 in general they only contain white 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:11.119
 the blur 

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:13.799
 without shell 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.709
 it can have several causes 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.039
 to a lack of calcium 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.289
 a malformation of the genital system 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.389
 poorly programmed spawning cycle 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.080
 or result from a previous disease such as bronchitis 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.080
 infectious or lyme disease the only 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.130
 opa continue malformed incomplete account his bag placed in the same 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.860
 category 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.860
 the double yellow egg 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.080
 two yellows at the same time entering the process of making the egg 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:55.550
 even though very rare duplicate births can be observed this is 

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:58.549
 of two different embryos and not twins 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.610
 in all cases it is the repetitiveness and the frequency of these 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.159
 phenomena that will determine if you are dealing with a 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:12.099
 incident that may be considered normal or a larger problem 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.080
 that you will need to deepen
