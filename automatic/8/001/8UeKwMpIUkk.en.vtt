00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.500
 hello and welcome to the guides of 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.240
 protein for a hostess product then 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.640
 in this test I told you about shaker 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.010
 the pro shaker here emblazoned with the brand 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.699
 of the train then the pro shaker is a 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.589
 shaker that separates the water and the 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.880
 powder and emergence 8 to last 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.210
 moment so I 'm going to explain how that's 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.220
 market 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.949
 you have here for sure to have in 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.710
 which you put your skin over 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.960
 here you can put your powder 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:36.210
 so everything is smooth and two parts is 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.559
 here if you see your your party 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.359
 is bleached it contains the powder and in 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.590
 bones and against each is closed so there 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.829
 you have no risk that the mixture 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.570
 is done then you add your 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.149
 powder at that place you can 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.109
 put 50 1 60 g of powder relax 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.890
 a little bit near the density of your 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:01:00.059
 produced then and finally the cork with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.980
 beautiful destiny for me here you read and 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.660
 on top then that's where it takes 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.730
 be careful because we live this is 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.030
 easy but at least that's really it 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.310
 blocked 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.350
 when it stops we stop it means 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.360
 that the shaker is ready and that all 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.680
 compartments are waterproof so you 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.970
 have your gym and when you 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.100
 want to see the shaker at that time 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 you keep doing but here and there 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.939
 we feel that his saddle and now the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.549
 tank below opens so you 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.430
 have more than to mix and have then 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.170
 I make them without the low part 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.460
 just to show a little bit of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.710
 common powder the time of which there you 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.219

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.939

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.340
 so I can open 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.520

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.810
 screw the top 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.280
 his strength I stop and if I force a 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.360
