going to look at enhancing that's HDRI
for<00:00:26.810> more<00:00:27.020> dynamic<00:00:27.910> resorts<00:00:28.910> in<00:00:29.029> our<00:00:29.180> render

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
for more dynamic resorts in our render

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.440 
for more dynamic resorts in our render
so<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.680> backplate<00:00:31.130> is<00:00:31.160> already<00:00:31.669> loaded<00:00:31.910> and

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
so the backplate is already loaded and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.060 
so the backplate is already loaded and
I'm<00:00:33.410> going<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:33.980> load<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:34.579> HDRI<00:00:35.270> image<00:00:36.070> which

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
I'm going to load the HDRI image which

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.410 
I'm going to load the HDRI image which
is<00:00:37.280> here<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:39.399> there<00:00:40.399> we<00:00:40.520> go<00:00:40.700> that's<00:00:40.969> what<00:00:41.239> our

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
is here and there we go that's what our

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.209 
is here and there we go that's what our
that's<00:00:41.989> what<00:00:42.170> our<00:00:42.289> rendering<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:42.890> actually

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
that's what our rendering it actually

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.529 
that's what our rendering it actually
looks<00:00:43.430> like<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:45.879> but<00:00:46.879> I<00:00:46.940> want<00:00:47.149> to<00:00:47.239> make<00:00:47.359> this<00:00:47.480> a

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
looks like and but I want to make this a

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.500 
looks like and but I want to make this a
bit<00:00:47.809> more<00:00:47.989> dynamic<00:00:48.879> and<00:00:49.879> get<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.089> bit<00:00:50.329> more

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.009 
bit more dynamic and get a bit more
control<00:00:50.899> over<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.949> shot<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:53.510> I<00:00:53.600> want<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.870> do

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
control over the shot and I want to do

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.610 
control over the shot and I want to do
this<00:00:54.140> by<00:00:54.319> adding<00:00:54.559> some<00:00:55.010> additional<00:00:55.550> lighting

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
this by adding some additional lighting

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.860 
this by adding some additional lighting
so<00:00:57.640> I'm<00:00:58.640> just<00:00:58.999> going<00:00:59.239> to<00:01:01.569> place<00:01:02.569> a<00:01:02.600> light

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
so I'm just going to place a light

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.620 
so I'm just going to place a light
source<00:01:04.810> directly<00:01:05.810> in<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.590> cello<00:01:07.040> studio<00:01:07.460> on<00:01:07.790> top

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
source directly in a cello studio on top

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:16.120 
source directly in a cello studio on top
of<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:10.420> HDRI<00:01:12.400> and<00:01:13.400> as<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.120> can<00:01:14.270> see<00:01:15.130> already

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
of this HDRI and as you can see already

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.720 
of this HDRI and as you can see already
just<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:18.380> single<00:01:18.800> light<00:01:18.980> source<00:01:19.010> I've<00:01:19.550> been

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
just that single light source I've been

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.120 
just that single light source I've been
able<00:01:19.790> to<00:01:19.970> pick<00:01:20.210> out<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:20.690> edge<00:01:20.930> here<00:01:21.040> bring<00:01:22.040> it

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
able to pick out this edge here bring it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.030 
able to pick out this edge here bring it
out<00:01:22.310> from<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.610> background<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.180> little<00:01:23.210> and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
out from the background a little and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.200 
out from the background a little and
I'll<00:01:25.040> just<00:01:25.220> go<00:01:27.190> come<00:01:28.190> around<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:28.610> front<00:01:29.030> of

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
I'll just go come around the front of

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.540 
I'll just go come around the front of
the<00:01:29.390> car<00:01:29.600> here<00:01:30.050> and<00:01:32.050> we<00:01:33.050> can<00:01:33.290> turn<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.190> process

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
the car here and we can turn the process

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:43.770 
the car here and we can turn the process
up

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:52.609

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
can see how just boosted the front of

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.349 
can see how just boosted the front of
the<00:01:57.990> car<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:59.159> bit<00:02:00.229> now<00:02:01.969> coming<00:02:02.969> down<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 
the car a little bit now coming down the

the car a little bit now coming down the
side<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:05.189> let's<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.789> tires<00:02:06.119> also<00:02:06.539> I'd

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
side here well let's the tires also I'd

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:08.300 
side here well let's the tires also I'd
like<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.109> get<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> bit<00:02:07.560> more<00:02:07.710> life<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.190> those

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
like to get a bit more life in those

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.869 
like to get a bit more life in those
tires<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.019> produce<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:13.549> nice<00:02:14.549> and

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
tires so I'm going to produce a nice and

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:29.620 
tires so I'm going to produce a nice and
scale<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.599> down<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.730> little<00:02:17.730> bit

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.550 

so<00:02:30.290> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.650> painting<00:02:31.160> with<00:02:31.370> light<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:32.350> top<00:02:33.350> of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so kind of painting with light on top of

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.740 
so kind of painting with light on top of
our<00:02:35.620> HDR<00:02:36.620> here

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.290 

and<00:02:42.380> just<00:02:42.620> change<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:43.400> height<00:02:43.640> oh<00:02:43.670> that's<00:02:44.090> a

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
and just change the height oh that's a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.660 
and just change the height oh that's a
little<00:02:44.390> bit<00:02:44.740> so<00:02:45.740> just<00:02:45.920> pause<00:02:46.100> a<00:02:46.130> little<00:02:46.370> bit

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
little bit so just pause a little bit

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.720 
little bit so just pause a little bit
brightness<00:02:47.240> in<00:02:47.480> into<00:02:48.140> those<00:02:48.290> tires<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:49.520> if<00:02:49.610> I

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
brightness in into those tires so if I

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.800 
brightness in into those tires so if I
just<00:02:49.970> click<00:02:50.210> on<00:02:50.390> background<00:02:50.630> at<00:02:50.990> zone<00:02:51.490> before

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
just click on background at zone before

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.940 
just click on background at zone before
and<00:02:53.890> after<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.190> we're<00:02:55.340> kind<00:02:55.520> of<00:02:55.580> able<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.120> boost

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
and after so we're kind of able to boost

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.010 
and after so we're kind of able to boost
boost<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.280> scene<00:02:58.670> I<00:02:59.680> get<00:03:00.680> another<00:03:00.890> light<00:03:02.020> and

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
boost this scene I get another light and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.800 
boost this scene I get another light and
the<00:03:03.170> side<00:03:03.590> here<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:05.890> this<00:03:06.890> will<00:03:07.209> cut<00:03:08.209> foliage

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
the side here and this will cut foliage

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.380 
the side here and this will cut foliage
and<00:03:08.959> stuff<00:03:09.260> down<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.590> side<00:03:09.830> here

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
and stuff down the side here

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:18.610 
and stuff down the side here
ridiculously<00:03:11.390> bright<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:17.060> fact<00:03:17.360> I<00:03:17.620> can

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
ridiculously bright in fact I can

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:32.030 
ridiculously bright in fact I can
actually<00:03:19.070> make<00:03:19.250> this<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.430> bit<00:03:19.700> of<00:03:19.790> a<00:03:19.880> blue<00:03:20.150> color

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:47.040 

just<00:03:32.879> blew<00:03:33.239> up<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.750> area<00:03:35.750> but

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.110 

just<00:03:47.680> make<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:47.950> quite<00:03:48.310> subtle<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.970> it'd<00:03:52.090> be

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
just make it quite subtle and it'd be

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.510 
just make it quite subtle and it'd be
nice<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.540> get<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.170> bit<00:03:53.440> of<00:03:53.500> blue<00:03:53.920> we're<00:03:54.280> kind<00:03:54.490> of

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
nice to get a bit of blue we're kind of

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.360 
nice to get a bit of blue we're kind of
in<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.760> bonnet<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.450> up<00:03:55.690> here<00:03:56.080> so<00:03:56.950> if<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.130> just

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
in the bonnet and up here so if I just

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.580 
in the bonnet and up here so if I just
duplicate<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:58.360> bring<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:59.460> up<00:04:00.460> there

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
duplicate that and bring it up there

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.059 
duplicate that and bring it up there
increase<00:04:02.590> the

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.130 

opacity<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.220> somewhat

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:19.420 

so<00:04:12.890> if<00:04:13.280> we<00:04:13.520> have<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:14.470> before<00:04:15.470> shot<00:04:18.010> key<00:04:19.010> shot<00:04:19.250> is

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
so if we have a before shot key shot is

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.720 
so if we have a before shot key shot is
so<00:04:19.609> fast<00:04:19.970> it's<00:04:20.410> updating<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.620> view<00:04:22.550> it's

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
so fast it's updating the view it's

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.460 
so fast it's updating the view it's
really<00:04:23.060> great<00:04:23.330> if<00:04:23.510> it's<00:04:23.690> kind<00:04:23.900> of<00:04:23.990> looking<00:04:24.350> at

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
really great if it's kind of looking at

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.020 
really great if it's kind of looking at
your<00:04:24.560> before<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:25.250> your<00:04:26.180> after<00:04:26.660> now<00:04:27.880> not<00:04:28.880> only

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
your before and your after now not only

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.180 
your before and your after now not only
can<00:04:29.210> we<00:04:29.540> increase<00:04:30.170> the<00:04:30.440> brightness<00:04:30.650> we<00:04:31.070> can

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
can we increase the brightness we can

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.150 
can we increase the brightness we can
actually<00:04:31.520> add<00:04:32.170> areas<00:04:33.170> of<00:04:33.350> darkness<00:04:33.890> if<00:04:34.040> we

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
actually add areas of darkness if we

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.250 
actually add areas of darkness if we
want<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.880> we<00:04:35.000> could<00:04:36.040> kind<00:04:37.040> of<00:04:37.070> in<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:38.260> side

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
want to so we could kind of in the side

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.350 
want to so we could kind of in the side
of<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:40.130> reflects<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.730> the<00:04:40.850> body<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.240> the

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:10.009 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:12.100 

you<00:05:10.610> know<00:05:10.699> we<00:05:10.819> can<00:05:11.029> actually<00:05:11.389> sucks<00:05:11.779> if<00:05:11.990> I

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
you know we can actually sucks if I

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.350 
you know we can actually sucks if I
brighten<00:05:12.529> this<00:05:12.740> whole<00:05:12.889> thing<00:05:13.099> up<00:05:13.279> you<00:05:13.999> can<00:05:14.150> see

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
brighten this whole thing up you can see

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.749 
brighten this whole thing up you can see
that<00:05:14.389> actually<00:05:14.779> that<00:05:14.930> light<00:05:15.259> is<00:05:15.759> actually

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
that actually that light is actually

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.719 
that actually that light is actually
sucking<00:05:17.150> light<00:05:17.509> away<00:05:18.169> from<00:05:18.729> what's

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
sucking light away from what's

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:20.859 
sucking light away from what's
underneath<00:05:20.029> now

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:20.869 
underneath now

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:28.600 
underneath now
I<00:05:21.309> actually<00:05:22.309> don't<00:05:22.669> think<00:05:26.949> it's<00:05:27.949> amazingly

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
I actually don't think it's amazingly

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.950 
I actually don't think it's amazingly
successful

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.689 

in<00:05:35.080> doing<00:05:35.919> that<00:05:37.320> if<00:05:38.320> anything<00:05:39.070> it's<00:05:39.310> probably

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
in doing that if anything it's probably

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.830 
in doing that if anything it's probably
better<00:05:40.000> just<00:05:41.880> without<00:05:42.880> anything<00:05:43.570> so<00:05:43.750> I'll

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
better just without anything so I'll

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.090 
better just without anything so I'll
just<00:05:43.960> delete<00:05:44.139> that<00:05:44.289> but<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.680> just<00:05:44.830> shows<00:05:45.070> you

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100 
just delete that but it just shows you

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.460 
just delete that but it just shows you
can<00:05:45.400> take<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.150> bit<00:05:46.360> of<00:05:46.389> lights<00:05:46.720> out<00:05:46.990> if<00:05:47.169> you<00:05:47.289> want

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
can take a bit of lights out if you want

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.820 
can take a bit of lights out if you want
I<00:05:47.650> think<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.910> this<00:05:49.030> front<00:05:49.449> corner<00:05:50.080> here<00:05:50.620> as

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
I think of this front corner here as

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.749 
I think of this front corner here as
well<00:05:51.160> it<00:05:51.370> might<00:05:51.610> be<00:05:51.759> nice<00:05:51.940> to<00:05:51.970> get<00:05:52.240> a<00:05:52.300> light

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
well it might be nice to get a light

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.700 
well it might be nice to get a light
there<00:05:54.759> also<00:05:55.570> at<00:05:55.690> any<00:05:55.810> point<00:05:56.199> we<00:05:56.410> can<00:05:56.560> isolate

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
there also at any point we can isolate

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.510 
there also at any point we can isolate
the<00:05:57.280> like<00:05:57.430> each<00:05:57.610> light<00:05:57.910> and<00:05:59.220> by<00:06:00.220> clicking

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
the like each light and by clicking

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.020 
the like each light and by clicking
control<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.810> visibility<00:06:02.820> button<00:06:03.820> at<00:06:03.940> the

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
control and the visibility button at the

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.330 
control and the visibility button at the
side<00:06:04.300> to<00:06:04.690> see<00:06:04.990> the<00:06:05.199> effect<00:06:06.009> of<00:06:06.220> each

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
side to see the effect of each

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.210 
side to see the effect of each
particular<00:06:06.789> light<00:06:07.180> source<00:06:07.770> it's<00:06:08.770> having<00:06:09.130> on

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
particular light source it's having on

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.029 
particular light source it's having on
the<00:06:09.340> scene<00:06:09.720> which<00:06:10.720> can<00:06:10.870> be<00:06:10.960> really<00:06:11.289> useful<00:06:11.800> so

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
the scene which can be really useful so

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.909 
the scene which can be really useful so
I'll<00:06:12.190> just<00:06:12.840> ctrl<00:06:13.840> click<00:06:14.259> on<00:06:14.530> one<00:06:14.710> that's

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
I'll just ctrl click on one that's

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:16.140 
I'll just ctrl click on one that's
already<00:06:15.280> on<00:06:15.759> it

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
already on it

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.629 
already on it
puts<00:06:16.330> them<00:06:16.449> all<00:06:16.570> back<00:06:16.690> on<00:06:16.750> again<00:06:16.990> so<00:06:17.410> I<00:06:18.310> think

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
puts them all back on again so I think

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:27.260 
puts them all back on again so I think
we<00:06:18.759> just<00:06:19.620> duplicate<00:06:20.620> that<00:06:23.639> bring<00:06:24.639> it<00:06:25.020> up<00:06:26.020> here

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
we just duplicate that bring it up here

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.939 
we just duplicate that bring it up here
get<00:06:28.270> a<00:06:28.300> bit<00:06:28.630> of<00:06:28.780> a<00:06:29.430> bit<00:06:30.430> of<00:06:30.460> a<00:06:31.800> bit<00:06:32.800> more

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
get a bit of a bit of a bit more

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:43.450 
get a bit of a bit of a bit more
intensity<00:06:35.580> in<00:06:37.139> this<00:06:38.139> front<00:06:38.410> surface<00:06:39.010> here

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.030 

just<00:06:44.360> scale<00:06:44.810> that<00:06:44.990> up<00:06:45.110> a<00:06:45.259> little<00:06:45.440> bit

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.190 

and<00:06:49.460> not<00:06:49.970> the<00:06:50.120> brightness<00:06:50.540> down<00:06:50.570> a<00:06:50.810> bit

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.200 
and not the brightness down a bit

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.170 
and not the brightness down a bit
through<00:06:51.410> the<00:06:51.530> opacity<00:06:54.100> so<00:06:55.100> let's<00:06:55.340> say<00:06:55.520> yes<00:06:55.850> a

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
through the opacity so let's say yes a

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.120 
through the opacity so let's say yes a
happy<00:06:56.540> with<00:06:56.660> that<00:06:56.840> results<00:06:57.380> so<00:06:57.650> what<00:06:57.860> we<00:06:57.980> can

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
happy with that results so what we can

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.100 
happy with that results so what we can
do<00:06:58.280> now<00:06:58.580> is<00:06:58.880> just<00:06:59.720> render<00:07:00.260> HDR<00:07:00.890> file<00:07:01.280> and<00:07:02.110> we'll

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
do now is just render HDR file and we'll

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:12.360 
do now is just render HDR file and we'll
call<00:07:03.350> it<00:07:03.500> fast<00:07:03.980> street<00:07:04.400> lighting<00:07:07.690> adjusted

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370
