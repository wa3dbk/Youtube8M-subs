step with you so a couple of weeks back
I<00:00:37.190> posted<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.790> time<00:00:37.970> step<00:00:38.390> video<00:00:38.720> and<00:00:39.200> Anthony

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
I posted a time step video and Anthony

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.160 
I posted a time step video and Anthony
asked<00:00:39.830> me<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.280> a<00:00:40.310> breakdown<00:00:40.640> of<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.270> so<00:00:41.540> here's

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
asked me to a breakdown of it so here's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.410 
asked me to a breakdown of it so here's
a<00:00:42.260> video<00:00:42.380> of<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.800> time<00:00:43.010> step<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:43.550> then<00:00:44.210> here's

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
a video of the time step and then here's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:54.220 
a video of the time step and then here's
a<00:00:44.510> video<00:00:44.720> of<00:00:44.840> the<00:00:44.960> breakdown

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.319 

so<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> way<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:56.129> count<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.670> step<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.180> in

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so the way that we count the step is in

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.889 
so the way that we count the step is in
triplets<00:00:57.870> triplets<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.760> minute<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.600> when

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
triplets triplets are one minute to when

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.979 
triplets triplets are one minute to when
the<00:01:01.140> trick<00:01:01.469> bullet<00:01:02.010> bullet<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.629> back

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the trick bullet bullet up at the back

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.410 
the trick bullet bullet up at the back
of<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.100> step<00:01:05.339> starts<00:01:05.759> with<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> cramproll

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
of the the step starts with a cramproll

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:20.180 
of the the step starts with a cramproll
so<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.440> say<00:01:12.649> 1<00:01:13.649> 2<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:15.270> got<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:19.190> from

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
so we say 1 2 just got here we go from

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:27.350 
so we say 1 2 just got here we go from
here<00:01:24.979> adding<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.130> from<00:01:26.399> the<00:01:26.520> top<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:27.000> slow

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
here adding that from the top one slow

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.490 
here adding that from the top one slow
one<00:01:27.630> two<00:01:28.610> ready<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.270> said<00:01:35.509> from<00:01:36.509> here<00:01:37.050> we're

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
one two ready we said from here we're

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.050 
one two ready we said from here we're
going<00:01:37.679> to<00:01:37.800> say<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.979> drop<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.490> opposite

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
going to say it's you drop the opposite

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:50.930 
going to say it's you drop the opposite
heel<00:01:42.330> left<00:01:42.810> heel<00:01:43.020> right<00:01:43.470> heel<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.920> then<00:01:49.940> back

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
heel left heel right heel and then back

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.969 
heel left heel right heel and then back
to<00:01:51.149> 1<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.600> prepares<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.289> for<00:01:52.319> the<00:01:52.649> left<00:01:52.860> side

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
to 1 and prepares you for the left side

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.870 
to 1 and prepares you for the left side
so<00:01:53.759> from<00:01:53.940> the<00:01:54.119> top<00:01:54.330> going<00:01:54.630> slow<00:01:54.899> 1<00:01:55.319> 2<00:01:56.220> from<00:01:56.580> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so from the top going slow 1 2 from the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:18.260 
so from the top going slow 1 2 from the
top<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.690> we<00:01:57.899> go<00:02:07.009> do<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> again<00:02:08.250> here<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:09.000> go<00:02:17.270> 1

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
top here we go do it again here we go 1

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.330 
top here we go do it again here we go 1
is<00:02:18.480> on<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.690> left<00:02:18.870> so<00:02:19.470> now<00:02:19.500> we're<00:02:19.830> able<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.160> do

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
is on the left so now we're able to do

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.100 
is on the left so now we're able to do
the<00:02:20.550> whole<00:02:20.790> step<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> left<00:02:21.660> side<00:02:21.900> let's

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
the whole step on the left side let's

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:39.740 
the whole step on the left side let's
slowly<00:02:22.560> reverse<00:02:23.129> it<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:39.239> gets<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.720> back

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
slowly reverse it and that gets you back

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.650 
slowly reverse it and that gets you back
on<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.470> right<00:02:40.680> side<00:02:41.010> so<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.610> step<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.000> 3

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
on to the right side so this step is 3

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.140 
on to the right side so this step is 3
in<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> break<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.680> do<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:43.950> once<00:02:44.160> on<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.670> right<00:02:44.879> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
in a break we do it once on the right a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.869 
in a break we do it once on the right a
second<00:02:45.780> time<00:02:45.959> on<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.349> left<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.890> third<00:02:47.340> time<00:02:47.670> on

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
second time on the left a third time on

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.220 
second time on the left a third time on
the<00:02:48.000> right<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.450> then<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.660> prepare<00:02:48.900> ourselves

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
the right and then we prepare ourselves

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.380 
the right and then we prepare ourselves
for<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.769> break<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.459> let's<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:50.970> get<00:02:51.120> those

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
for the break so let's just get those

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.930 
for the break so let's just get those
three<00:02:51.750> days<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.379> row<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.010> right<00:02:53.519> left<00:02:53.819> right

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
three days in a row so right left right

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:20.390 
three days in a row so right left right
from<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.420> top<00:02:54.629> 1<00:02:55.260> 2<00:02:56.099> from<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.730> top<00:02:57.060> going<00:02:57.420> slow

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.369 

one<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.549> on<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.760> left<00:03:21.879> foot<00:03:22.329> for<00:03:22.870> our<00:03:23.019> break

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
one is on the left foot for our break

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.789 
one is on the left foot for our break
we're<00:03:23.709> going<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.220> say<00:03:28.500> those<00:03:29.500> are<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
we're going to say those are the

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.979 
we're going to say those are the
opposite<00:03:30.370> heels<00:03:30.640> again<00:03:31.120> doing<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.690> again

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
opposite heels again doing that again

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:45.420 
opposite heels again doing that again
that's<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.720> do<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:43.989> on<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.290> right<00:03:44.530> foot<00:03:44.859> so

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that's to do it on the right foot so

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:58.349 
that's to do it on the right foot so
doing<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.849> again<00:03:56.430> that<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.819> end<00:03:58.000> of<00:03:58.180> your

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
doing that again that is the end of your

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.800 
doing that again that is the end of your
break<00:03:58.629> doing<00:03:58.989> your<00:03:59.170> breaks<00:03:59.409> slow<00:03:59.939> one<00:04:00.939> two

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
break doing your breaks slow one two

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:13.250 
break doing your breaks slow one two
just<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.560> break<00:04:02.980> here<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.699> go

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.649 

putting<00:04:14.260> all<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.799> them<00:04:14.980> together<00:04:15.389> three<00:04:16.389> and<00:04:16.570> a
