so guys not trying to fortress super
here<00:00:02.610> um<00:00:02.840> I<00:00:04.160> previously<00:00:05.160> just<00:00:05.819> uploaded<00:00:06.420> this

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
here um I previously just uploaded this

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.140 
here um I previously just uploaded this
video<00:00:06.750> it<00:00:07.080> took<00:00:07.259> like<00:00:07.470> two<00:00:07.740> hours<00:00:08.150> because

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
video it took like two hours because

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.940 
video it took like two hours because
when<00:00:09.450> internet<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.280> dumb<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:12.559> they<00:00:13.559> just

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
when internet is dumb and they just

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.380 
when internet is dumb and they just
cancel<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:16.250> I'll<00:00:17.250> start<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.609> articulation

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
cancel it so I'll start the articulation

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.670 
cancel it so I'll start the articulation
off<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> head<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.760> it<00:00:20.760> moves<00:00:21.359> around

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
off with the head it it moves around

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.580 
off with the head it it moves around
really<00:00:22.680> well

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
really well

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.290 
really well
you<00:00:25.590> can<00:00:25.859> do<00:00:26.359> 360<00:00:27.359> if<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.599> want<00:00:27.810> but<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.830> mean

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
you can do 360 if you want but I mean

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.740 
you can do 360 if you want but I mean
what's<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.720> what's<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.199> point

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
what's like what's the point

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.069 
what's like what's the point
let's<00:00:33.750> see<00:00:33.870> if<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:35.840> all<00:00:36.840> right<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
let's see if I can do it all right I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.010 
let's see if I can do it all right I
guess<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.890> can't<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.340> move<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.670> little<00:00:39.020> joint

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
guess you can't the move to little joint

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.510 
guess you can't the move to little joint
where<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> sits<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.719> for<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> little<00:00:42.930> bit<00:00:43.110> um<00:00:43.520> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
where that sits on for a little bit um I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.590 
where that sits on for a little bit um I
see<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> little<00:00:45.989> bit<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.410> side<00:00:46.739> shot

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
see it's get a little bit of a side shot

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.979 
see it's get a little bit of a side shot
just<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.050> arm<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:53.629> pretty<00:00:54.629> it's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
just a bit so the arm it's pretty it's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.869 
just a bit so the arm it's pretty it's
it's<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.680> articulation<00:00:56.010> it's<00:00:56.640> got

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
it's good articulation it's got

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.569 
it's good articulation it's got
basically<00:00:57.840> all<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:58.980> almost<00:00:59.129> like<00:00:59.280> three

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
basically all it's almost like three

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.260 
basically all it's almost like three
joints<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.710> got<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.520> typical<00:01:02.760> tube

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
joints so it's got the typical tube

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
joints so it's got the typical tube
joints<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:03.899> it's<00:01:04.049> got<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.320> extra<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
joints and then it's got this extra to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.310 
joints and then it's got this extra to
the<00:01:05.010> forearm<00:01:05.430> moves<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.990> like

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the forearm moves like a little bit like

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.980 
the forearm moves like a little bit like
that<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.890> it's<00:01:08.880> almost<00:01:09.060> like<00:01:09.240> three<00:01:09.510> joints

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that so it's almost like three joints

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.710 
that so it's almost like three joints
you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:11.700> pretty<00:01:11.880> good<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.390> give

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you know it's it's pretty good I give

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.910 
you know it's it's pretty good I give
pretty<00:01:12.960> good<00:01:13.049> articulation<00:01:14.000> I<00:01:15.560> feel<00:01:16.560> she's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
pretty good articulation I feel she's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.390 
pretty good articulation I feel she's
like<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.299> weasel<00:01:18.299> over<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:18.900> bit

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like a weasel over a little bit

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.289 
like a weasel over a little bit
so<00:01:21.400> here's<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.880> legs<00:01:23.100> legs<00:01:24.100> are<00:01:24.310> have<00:01:25.000> pretty

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
so here's the legs legs are have pretty

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.730 
so here's the legs legs are have pretty
good<00:01:25.450> articulation<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:29.380> all<00:01:29.470> little

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
good articulation to see all little

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.690 
good articulation to see all little
things<00:01:30.780> moving<00:01:31.780> as<00:01:31.960> leg<00:01:32.409> goes<00:01:32.710> that's

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
things moving as leg goes that's

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.620 
things moving as leg goes that's
basically<00:01:34.320> an<00:01:35.320> articulation<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.130> leg<00:01:36.630> legs

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
basically an articulation of leg legs

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.230 
basically an articulation of leg legs
and<00:01:37.990> whatever<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:41.189> okay<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.429> back<00:01:42.640> down<00:01:43.000> back

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
and whatever and okay and back down back

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.969 
and whatever and okay and back down back
up<00:01:43.450> normal<00:01:43.840> again<00:01:47.939> okay<00:01:48.939> so<00:01:49.000> now<00:01:49.360> for<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.979> led

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
up normal again okay so now for the led

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.380 
up normal again okay so now for the led
is<00:01:51.880> back<00:01:52.119> as<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.360> head<00:01:53.039> basically<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:55.780> is

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
is back as a head basically there is

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.719 
is back as a head basically there is
three<00:01:58.390> pieces<00:01:58.569> in<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.899> back<00:01:59.080> of<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.319> head<00:01:59.729> one

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
three pieces in the back of the head one

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.999 
three pieces in the back of the head one
little<00:02:01.299> vamp<00:02:01.659> a<00:02:03.000> second<00:02:04.470> little<00:02:05.470> vent<00:02:05.679> with

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
little vamp a second little vent with

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.830 
little vamp a second little vent with
the<00:02:06.659> square<00:02:07.659> back<00:02:07.869> piece<00:02:08.130> it's<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.840> little

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
the square back piece it's a little

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.530 
the square back piece it's a little
cartridge<00:02:11.470> with<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.459> that<00:02:12.760> just<00:02:13.150> holds<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
cartridge with it that just holds the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.440 
cartridge with it that just holds the
battery<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.230> strengthen<00:02:14.769> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:16.090> cartridge

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
battery to strengthen a little cartridge

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.229 
battery to strengthen a little cartridge
that<00:02:16.540> holds<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> battery<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.860> led<00:02:18.280> it's

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
that holds the battery the led it's

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.740 
that holds the battery the led it's
pretty<00:02:19.480> simple<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:20.580> little<00:02:21.580> package<00:02:22.330> thing<00:02:22.569> you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
pretty simple a little package thing you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.730 
pretty simple a little package thing you
just<00:02:23.519> turn<00:02:24.519> on<00:02:25.019> again

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.170 

so<00:02:30.050> let's<00:02:31.050> put<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.320> back<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:31.950> there<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.970> I

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
so let's put that back in there and I

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.530 
so let's put that back in there and I
can<00:02:33.770> turn<00:02:34.770> on<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.760> guys<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:36.150> see<00:02:36.180> what

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
can turn on and you guys can see what

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.990 
can turn on and you guys can see what
that<00:02:37.160> looks<00:02:38.160> like<00:02:40.160> how<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.220> cool<00:02:41.520> shot<00:02:41.820> right

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that looks like how the cool shot right

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.260 
that looks like how the cool shot right
there

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
there

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.580 
there
but<00:02:43.230> um<00:02:44.210> yeah<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.300> think<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.810> nice<00:02:46.110> touch<00:02:46.350> I

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
but um yeah I think is a nice touch I

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
but um yeah I think is a nice touch I
think<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.830> looks<00:02:47.010> really<00:02:47.250> good<00:02:47.460> and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
think it looks really good and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.600 
think it looks really good and
definitely<00:02:50.690> pretty<00:02:51.690> cool<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.290> on

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
definitely pretty cool to have on

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.160 
definitely pretty cool to have on
whenever<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:53.850> like<00:02:54.120> dark<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.750> your<00:02:54.870> room<00:02:55.050> or
