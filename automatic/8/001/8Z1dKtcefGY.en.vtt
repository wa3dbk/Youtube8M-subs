00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.199
 We need the program PSCP for Windows 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.400
 Let's download it first 

00:00:19.817 --> 00:00:22.806
 IMPORTANT! Save in the system folder (eg C: \ WINDOWS)! 

00:00:22.807 --> 00:00:28.718
 Otherwise we have to mention the program in PATH system variable extra 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.599
 Or always manually write the entire path 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 But we are programmers. And programmers are lazy;) 

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:52.035
 Now we open the console 

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:58.157
 Go to the folder with our C source code 

00:01:07.613 --> 00:01:09.323
 This one is in it 

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.926
 And even contains something 

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:36.192
 What is the right format for PSCP? 

00:01:45.624 --> 00:01:48.122
 It is important that the SOURCE is specified first 

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:50.963
 Only then comes the GOAL 

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:56.878
 Now we can enter everything 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.335
 source 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.490
 And goal 

00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:15.938
 The addresses of the RBI computers can be called up in the network 

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:27.825
 Copy 

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:31.717
 And paste 

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:38.615
 Do not forget semicolon! 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:52.010
 If there is no semicolon, the file is copied to the home directory 

00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:59.571
 Let's start PUTTY so that we can check if the file is being copied 

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:07.848
 Now myCFile.c is not on it yet 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.639
 Execute the copy process 

00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:23.331
 Voila! 

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:28.823
 The content is also correct
