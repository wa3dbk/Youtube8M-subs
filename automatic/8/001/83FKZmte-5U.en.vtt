fan on the backside then looking at the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.870 
fan on the backside then looking at the
back<00:02:34.620> side<00:02:34.650> there's<00:02:35.310> nothing<00:02:35.670> too

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
back side there's nothing too

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.760 
back side there's nothing too
spectacular<00:02:36.150> here<00:02:36.900> we<00:02:37.050> do<00:02:37.200> got<00:02:37.380> some<00:02:37.620> more

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
spectacular here we do got some more

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.850 
spectacular here we do got some more
mesh<00:02:38.070> here<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.970> expansion<00:02:39.630> Bay's<00:02:40.050> also<00:02:40.650> have

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
mesh here the expansion Bay's also have

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.420 
mesh here the expansion Bay's also have
mesh<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.880> for<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> covers<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:44.070> do<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.400> a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
mesh on it for the covers we do have a

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.430 
mesh on it for the covers we do have a
punch<00:02:44.790> out<00:02:45.000> hole<00:02:45.240> up<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.870> two<00:02:46.080> over<00:02:46.110> here

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
punch out hole up here and two over here

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.490 
punch out hole up here and two over here
for<00:02:46.920> cable<00:02:47.490> routing<00:02:47.880> liquid<00:02:48.660> setups<00:02:49.230> those

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
for cable routing liquid setups those

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.560 
for cable routing liquid setups those
sources<00:02:49.800> get<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> better<00:02:50.460> look<00:02:50.790> at<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.000> spacing

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
sources get a better look at the spacing

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.740 
sources get a better look at the spacing
here<00:02:51.780> there<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:53.190> think<00:02:53.790> they<00:02:54.120> said<00:02:54.360> twenty

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
here there is I think they said twenty

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.630 
here there is I think they said twenty
millimeters<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.470> space<00:02:55.800> right<00:02:56.070> here<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.400> nice

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
millimeters of space right here a nice

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.330 
millimeters of space right here a nice
little<00:02:56.970> gap<00:02:57.180> for<00:02:57.480> cable<00:02:57.810> routing<00:02:58.710> which<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.040> is

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
little gap for cable routing which is is

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.980 
little gap for cable routing which is is
very<00:02:59.730> nice<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.210> can<00:03:00.360> fit<00:03:00.570> some<00:03:00.780> thicker

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
very nice you can fit some thicker

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.320 
very nice you can fit some thicker
cables<00:03:01.500> back<00:03:01.740> here<00:03:02.040> we<00:03:02.580> can<00:03:02.760> see<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.090> punch

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
cables back here we can see the punch

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.630 
cables back here we can see the punch
outs<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.990> they<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.440> here<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.920> nice<00:03:05.130> CPU

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
outs that they have here the nice CPU

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.850 
outs that they have here the nice CPU
cutout<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.330> then<00:03:06.780> there's<00:03:06.990> also<00:03:07.170> some<00:03:07.560> room

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
cutout and then there's also some room

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.060
