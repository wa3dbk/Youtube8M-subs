00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.170
 the he sometimes requires that the 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.660
 candidate to know substantially how to put 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.430
 set of information a little bit 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.289
 also using knowledge 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:26.500
 mathematical a little reasoning that 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:32.739
 they may be given in a non-way 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:35.449
 I'll do this private event right away 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.300
 la luiss sometimes requires that the 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.950
 candidate to know substantially how to put 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.100
 set of information that comes 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.780
 in a disorganized way maybe working or 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.030
 with their own knowledge if there 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.550
 mathematics or point or with reasoning 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.200
 logical to get to deduce something 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.040
 that the text does not say so 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.840
 explicit 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.219
 to do this use for example the 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.649
 exchange rate exercises 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.110
 look at this Egyptian in Saudi Arabia 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.989
 the currency is real which is divided into 20 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.360
 coach or in 100 anas the questions that 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.880
 I ask you, for example, Mr. 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.310
 Mars pays a book 180 runs to how many 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.590
 alas correspond or Mr. 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.560
 mante receives 167 races before and 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.479
 subsequently the former 315 anas quanti 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.760
 reality in everything with the rest expressed 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.200
 in all anas how they are done there 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.600
 well the most important thing is to 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.430
 immediately register the different ones 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:32.990
 relations 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:36.500
 I know that unreal is equal to 20 runs 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:41.659
 I use only the initials or 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.810
 so it is also equal to one hundred to ass 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.060
 because I write the report because this 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.650
 it also allows me to find let's say 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.689
 those relationships that are not 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.470
 expressly not written in the text 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.320
 year 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.810
 I know that a riazlo equal to 20 and kursk 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.610
 or even a hundred to the ass 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.380
 but from this report I can find 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.130
 even no 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.290
 the relationship between cus and ass if 20 cusi 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:13.809
 are equal to one hundred all us means that 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:16.309
 a shell corresponds to 5 a ras 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:18.830
 at this point 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:21.980
 let's try these clear relationships 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.890
 to solve the exercises the first I 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.380
 says Mr. mortar pays a book 180 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.540
 kusha asks me how many alas 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.010
 match well I will use this mine 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.980
 second information 180 runs I know that 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:44.120
 each curcio is five alas must 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:46.880
 multiply 180 by 5 or nine hundred ok 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.140
 this is his consideration I remind you 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.720
 that in these exercises you cannot use i 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.460
 so maybe calculators 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.380
 simple multiplications, however, you can 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.810
 I also do n't know how to help 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.400
 multiplication by saying let's say 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.550
 per step 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.970
 if I have to do 180 x 5 I can do it first 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.870
 one hundred for 5 which makes 500 then 80 for 5 that 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.910
 he sleeps 400 and nine hundred comes out 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.950
 we see the second Mr. Mars 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:18.560
 first receives 167 kush and later 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.890
 315 anas asks me how many rials to in 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.910
 all with the rest expressed in all ass 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.560
 then let 's see what happens to the 167 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.910
 curcio if I have to express the real 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.709
 how many rials i will have well i know every 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:43.730
 up a 20 runs so if I split for 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:46.280
 20 I will have what I will have 8 rial more in 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.030
 I advance seven races 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.360
 no because I know that 160 curcio are authors 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.290
 all 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.110
 and then the seven coors and aj e advance me 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.600
 subsequently 315 to the ass 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.640
 I know that every 100 to las henry to the per 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:08.950
 which in these 315 all ass 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:08.950
 I have three rial plus 15 on the rest axis 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.890
 at this point how many rial or sky 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.419
 because 8 rial peuterey rice or 11 rial 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.460
 here is already this information for 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.880
 example I notice that the solutions 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:29.240
 they can now be the same as the others 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.039
 certainly I can discard them 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.060
 how many to the abs 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:39.800
 I also well here I have 15 and then I have 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.250
 these seven runs to be translated into 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.949
 all ass 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.800
 I know that every ride equals five 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:53.250
 anas means that seven trips are 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:54.270
 seven for 5 35 anas 7q are equal to 35 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.250
 h 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.889
 at 35 a las coeli or with the first 167 cus 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.520
 that I changed 15 to ascom and the rest 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.909
 in the exchange of the following 30 100 315 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.300
 an AAS 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:12.689
 in total or 50 all 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.590
 so you find that the solution does not 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.590
 may be that
