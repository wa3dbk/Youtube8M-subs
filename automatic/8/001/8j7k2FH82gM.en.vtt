first devices that supports USB type-c
as<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.780> guys<00:01:48.930> already<00:01:49.110> probably<00:01:49.439> know<00:01:49.680> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
as you guys already probably know this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
as you guys already probably know this
means<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.450> reversible<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.619> what's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
means that this is reversible but what's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530 
means that this is reversible but what's
interesting<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.729> some<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.210> may<00:01:54.390> not

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
interesting and what some of you may not

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.990 
interesting and what some of you may not
know<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> USB<00:01:56.189> side<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.729> also

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
know is that the USB side is also

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.060 
know is that the USB side is also
reversible<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> side<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.680> goes

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
reversible so this is a side that goes

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
reversible so this is a side that goes
into<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.610> AC<00:01:59.939> adapter<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.840> put<00:02:01.110> it

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
into your AC adapter you can put it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.139 
into your AC adapter you can put it
either<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> very<00:02:02.670> nice<00:02:02.880> touch

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
either way and this is a very nice touch

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.060 
either way and this is a very nice touch
and<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.750> don't<00:02:03.840> think<00:02:03.990> I've<00:02:04.229> seen<00:02:04.259> others<00:02:04.829> cover

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and I don't think I've seen others cover

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.069 
and I don't think I've seen others cover
this<00:02:05.250> but<00:02:05.729> anyway<00:02:05.909> let's<00:02:06.509> get<00:02:06.719> straight<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
this but anyway let's get straight to

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.260 
this but anyway let's get straight to
the<00:02:07.170> device<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.500> we'll<00:02:08.190> remove<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.970> outer

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the device so we'll remove this outer

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.969 
the device so we'll remove this outer
packaging<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.440> here

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
packaging on here

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.500 
packaging on here
and<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.580> see<00:02:11.760> here<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.360> is

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and as you can see here because this is

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.770 
and as you can see here because this is

finally on the left hand side you have
your<00:03:10.060> alert<00:03:10.660> switch<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> physical

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
your alert switch so this is a physical

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.890 
your alert switch so this is a physical
switch<00:03:12.340> similar<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.300> what<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.540> have<00:03:13.690> on<00:03:13.720> the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
switch similar to what you have on the

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.350 
switch similar to what you have on the
iPhone<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:14.560> this<00:03:14.769> has<00:03:15.069> three<00:03:15.370> stages<00:03:15.670> once

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
iPhone but this has three stages once

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.789 
iPhone but this has three stages once
again<00:03:16.630> we'll<00:03:16.900> look<00:03:17.050> at<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.350> more<00:03:17.410> in<00:03:17.709> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
again we'll look at this more in the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.039 
again we'll look at this more in the
full<00:03:17.920> review<00:03:18.220> so<00:03:18.910> let's<00:03:18.940> go<00:03:19.180> ahead<00:03:19.299> and<00:03:19.630> give

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
full review so let's go ahead and give

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.600 
full review so let's go ahead and give
this<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.380> first<00:03:20.680> boot<00:03:20.920> will<00:03:21.130> speed<00:03:21.340> this<00:03:21.489> up

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
this a first boot will speed this up

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.030 
this a first boot will speed this up
slightly<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.360> we<00:03:23.079> can<00:03:23.230> go<00:03:23.380> through<00:03:23.769> the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
slightly and we can go through the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.160 
slightly and we can go through the
settings<00:03:24.340> screens<00:03:24.790> you'll<00:03:25.540> notice<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:26.140> that

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
settings screens you'll notice here that

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.710 
settings screens you'll notice here that
it<00:03:26.560> says<00:03:26.590> insert<00:03:27.340> sim<00:03:27.670> cards<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.600> is

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
it says insert sim cards and that is

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.690 
it says insert sim cards and that is
because<00:03:29.079> this<00:03:29.320> has<00:03:29.380> dual<00:03:29.860> SIM<00:03:30.070> card<00:03:30.310> support

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
because this has dual SIM card support

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.300 
because this has dual SIM card support
