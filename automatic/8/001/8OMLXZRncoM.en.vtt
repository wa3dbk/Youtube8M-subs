00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
guys that brought us dead island which I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.490 
guys that brought us dead island which I
like<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.030> first<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.510> island<00:00:36.840> didn't<00:00:37.410> so

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
like the first that island didn't so

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.680 
like the first that island didn't so
much<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> second<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:39.180> wasn't<00:00:39.540> real

quite<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.530> fluid<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:50.610> mirrors<00:01:50.939> edge<00:01:51.119> but<00:01:51.149> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
quite as fluid as mirrors edge but it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.420 
quite as fluid as mirrors edge but it
works<00:01:51.659> really<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:52.049> surprisingly<00:01:52.770> far

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
works really well surprisingly far

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
works really well surprisingly far
better<00:01:53.640> than<00:01:53.700> brink<00:01:54.119> better<00:01:54.840> than<00:01:55.020> most<00:01:55.229> games

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
better than brink better than most games

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
better than brink better than most games

what<00:02:02.040> i<00:02:02.070> was<00:02:02.159> looking<00:02:02.219> for<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> word

um<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.469> graphics<00:02:04.979> way<00:02:05.610> better<00:02:05.850> than<00:02:05.969> dead

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
um the graphics way better than dead

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.490 
um the graphics way better than dead

then<00:02:08.130> again<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.490> a<00:02:08.520> next-gen<00:02:09.000> game

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
then again it is a next-gen game

then again it is a next-gen game
next-gen<00:02:09.690> tech<00:02:09.929> so<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.470> expected<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
next-gen tech so it's expected to up the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.730 
next-gen tech so it's expected to up the
ante<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> did<00:02:12.060> play<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.390> pc<00:02:12.780> version<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.290> don't

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
this kind of open world segment where I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.000 
this kind of open world segment where I
bash<00:02:26.250> faces<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.270> zombies<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.350> you<00:02:28.920> know

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.699 
bash faces in on zombies and you know
pick<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.400> lutes<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.170> jump<00:02:31.170> across<00:02:31.350> rooftops

like I said there were some bosses it
seems<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.650> zombie<00:02:35.490> variants<00:02:35.940> are<00:02:36.030> all

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
seems like the zombie variants are all

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.690 
seems like the zombie variants are all
very<00:02:36.540> dead<00:02:36.780> island<00:02:37.170> ish<00:02:37.350> there's<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.430> really

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
all the ones that we saw in that island

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.229 
all the ones that we saw in that island
previously<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:52.320> dying<00:02:52.590> light<00:02:52.970> much<00:02:53.970> better

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
previously but dying light much better

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.900 
previously but dying light much better
looking<00:02:54.450> much<00:02:55.440> better<00:02:55.709> as<00:02:56.070> far<00:02:56.310> as<00:02:56.430> mechanics

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
looking much better as far as mechanics

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.790 
looking much better as far as mechanics
go<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.420> know<00:02:57.510> kicking<00:02:57.780> them<00:02:58.020> back<00:02:58.230> bashing

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
go you know kicking them back bashing

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.920 
go you know kicking them back bashing
their<00:02:58.920> heads<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.310> its<00:02:59.580> way<00:03:00.180> more<00:03:00.209> developed

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
their heads in its way more developed

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.910 
their heads in its way more developed
than<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.500> island<00:03:01.920> was<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:03.650> seriously<00:03:04.650> fuck

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
than that island was and seriously fuck

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.479 
than that island was and seriously fuck
these<00:03:05.100> guys<00:03:05.160> they're<00:03:05.910> really<00:03:06.270> annoying<00:03:07.489> did

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
these guys they're really annoying did

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.400 
these guys they're really annoying did
they<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:08.790> turn<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> volume<00:03:09.360> up<00:03:10.790> fuckers

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
they just turn the volume up fuckers

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.520 
they just turn the volume up fuckers
anyways<00:03:14.840> honestly<00:03:15.840> I'd<00:03:16.140> probably<00:03:16.320> recommend

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
anyways honestly I'd probably recommend

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.560 
anyways honestly I'd probably recommend
that<00:03:16.980> uh<00:03:17.040> they're<00:03:17.700> dying<00:03:18.060> light<00:03:18.299> at<00:03:18.420> this

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
that uh they're dying light at this

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.479 
that uh they're dying light at this
point<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.470> seems<00:03:19.769> like<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.920> huge<00:03:20.100> step<00:03:20.370> up

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
point it it seems like a huge step up

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.650 
point it it seems like a huge step up
from<00:03:20.610> dead<00:03:20.820> island<00:03:21.180> seems<00:03:21.360> like<00:03:21.510> they're

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
from dead island seems like they're

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.539 
from dead island seems like they're
stepping<00:03:21.840> up<00:03:22.080> their<00:03:22.170> game<00:03:22.280> probably<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.310> good

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
stepping up their game probably a good

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.300 
stepping up their game probably a good
next-gen<00:03:24.030> game<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.360> have<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:25.500> same<00:03:25.920> or<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.160> it

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
next-gen game to have all same or is it

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.920 
next-gen game to have all same or is it
develops<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:26.910> i'll<00:03:27.000> definitely<00:03:27.510> reveal<00:03:27.750> when

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
develops and i'll definitely reveal when

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.690 
develops and i'll definitely reveal when
it<00:03:28.019> comes<00:03:28.170> out<00:03:28.320> or<00:03:28.620> at<00:03:28.920> least<00:03:29.190> take<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.400> look<00:03:29.580> at

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
it comes out or at least take a look at

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.910 
it comes out or at least take a look at
the<00:03:29.790> demo<00:03:29.970> when<00:03:30.600> they<00:03:30.720> release<00:03:31.049> demo<00:03:31.410> once<00:03:31.769> the
