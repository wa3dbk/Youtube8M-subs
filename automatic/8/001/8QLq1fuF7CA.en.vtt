00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.460 

kind<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.330> coming<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.690> on<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.110> ramps<00:01:52.440> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
kind of coming up on one of the ramps a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.100 
kind of coming up on one of the ramps a
little<00:01:52.680> bit<00:01:52.770> too<00:01:52.920> fast<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:54.690> tapping<00:01:54.930> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
little bit too fast and just tapping the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.990 
little bit too fast and just tapping the
brakes<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.890> little<00:01:56.220> too<00:01:56.340> much<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.790> locked

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
brakes just a little too much and locked

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.580 
brakes just a little too much and locked
it<00:01:57.180> up<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.510> I<00:01:57.540> want<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.750> cross<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.170> second

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
it up so I want to cross that second

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.399 
it up so I want to cross that second
jump<00:01:58.830> little<00:01:59.070> sideways<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.390> once<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.110> stays

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
jump little sideways and once it stays

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
jump little sideways and once it stays
sideways<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.460> figured<00:02:02.759> about<00:02:02.880> staying<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> gas

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
sideways I figured about staying the gas

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.880 
sideways I figured about staying the gas
to<00:02:03.600> try<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.900> keep<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> rotate<00:02:04.470> on<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
to try and keep it to rotate on the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.540 
to try and keep it to rotate on the
rally<00:02:05.009> at<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.430> ground<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.909> luckily<00:02:06.150> it<00:02:06.300> did

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
rally at the ground and luckily it did

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.639 
rally at the ground and luckily it did
it<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:09.209> awesome<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.869> had<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> blast<00:02:10.350> my
