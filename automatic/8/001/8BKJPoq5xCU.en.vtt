and now I'm saying do not store in the
place<00:03:44.280> where<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.640> becomes<00:03:45.000> humid<00:03:45.630> moist<00:03:46.170> blah

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
place where it becomes humid moist blah

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.400 
place where it becomes humid moist blah
see<00:03:46.890> blah<00:03:47.299> it's<00:03:48.299> called<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.600> bathroom<00:03:49.230> scale

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
see blah it's called a bathroom scale

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.470 
see blah it's called a bathroom scale
when<00:03:49.829> people<00:03:50.070> shower<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.670> gets<00:03:50.820> moist<00:03:51.090> gets

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
when people shower it gets moist gets

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.840 
when people shower it gets moist gets
misty<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.170> therefore<00:03:52.890> saying<00:03:53.250> that<00:03:53.640> could

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
misty and therefore saying that could

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.670 
misty and therefore saying that could
affect<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:55.400> scale<00:03:57.019> so<00:03:58.019> now<00:03:58.200> I<00:03:58.230> don't<00:03:58.560> really

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
affect the scale so now I don't really

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.330 
affect the scale so now I don't really
have<00:03:58.799> any<00:03:59.160> other<00:03:59.250> place<00:03:59.609> in<00:04:00.170> this<00:04:01.170> house<00:04:02.069> I

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
have any other place in this house I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.830 
have any other place in this house I
could<00:04:02.519> actually<00:04:02.700> store<00:04:03.239> it<00:04:03.420> where<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:03.720> not

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
could actually store it where it's not

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.870 
could actually store it where it's not
getting<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.290> way<00:04:05.810> lod<00:04:07.430> but<00:04:08.430> what<00:04:08.579> it<00:04:08.700> says

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
getting in the way lod but what it says

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.550 
getting in the way lod but what it says
it<00:04:09.030> always<00:04:09.269> had<00:04:09.359> to<00:04:09.480> recalibrate<00:04:09.840> every<00:04:10.410> time

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
it always had to recalibrate every time

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.050 
it always had to recalibrate every time
I<00:04:10.620> carry<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:11.160> so<00:04:11.370> I'll<00:04:11.459> just<00:04:11.519> store<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:11.880> in<00:04:12.030> my

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
I carry it so I'll just store it in my

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.930 
I carry it so I'll just store it in my
room<00:04:12.209> and<00:04:12.600> then<00:04:13.410> I'll<00:04:13.620> recalibrate<00:04:14.010> it<00:04:14.459> I'll

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
room and then I'll recalibrate it I'll

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.090 
room and then I'll recalibrate it I'll
recalibrate<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.019> every<00:04:16.410> time<00:04:16.650> I<00:04:16.680> put<00:04:17.070> it

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
recalibrate it every time I put it

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.300 
recalibrate it every time I put it
inside<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.729> bathroom<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:19.109> guess<00:04:20.100> have<00:04:20.220> to

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
inside the bathroom so I guess have to

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.159 
inside the bathroom so I guess have to
step<00:04:20.519> on<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.789> scale<00:04:21.060> should<00:04:21.690> calibrate<00:04:21.900> I

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
step on the scale should calibrate I

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.860 
step on the scale should calibrate I
stuff<00:04:22.470> off<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:23.010> turn<00:04:23.280> off<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.669> then

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
stuff off that turn off and then

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.780 
stuff off that turn off and then
I weigh<00:04:24.169> myself<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:24.830> let's<00:04:25.010> see<00:04:25.160> how<00:04:25.340> much<00:04:25.520> I
