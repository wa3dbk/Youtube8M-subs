one<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.009> don't<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.960> my<00:01:51.960> opinion<00:01:52.140> there's<00:01:52.920> no

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
one I don't know my opinion there's no

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.760 
one I don't know my opinion there's no
listen<00:01:53.579> fuck<00:01:53.789> so<00:01:53.969> I<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.600> on<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.409> next<00:01:55.590> we

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
listen fuck so I can go up on so next we

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.029 
listen fuck so I can go up on so next we
got<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> there<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.909> 270<00:01:57.600> not<00:01:58.020> X<00:01:58.289> now

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039 
got is there are not in 270 not X now

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.069 
got is there are not in 270 not X now
Ruiz<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.369> don't<00:01:59.579> pick<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> X<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> excess

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
Ruiz I don't pick the X is that excess

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
Ruiz I don't pick the X is that excess
about<00:02:01.259> 20<00:02:01.469> miles<00:02:01.590> more<00:02:02.249> expensive<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
about 20 miles more expensive so you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.099 
about 20 miles more expensive so you
could<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.359> but<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.320> but<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:06.020> difference<00:02:07.020> is

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
could get but but but the difference is

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.290 
could get but but but the difference is
not<00:02:07.289> too<00:02:07.469> much<00:02:07.679> so<00:02:08.610> let's<00:02:08.729> look<00:02:08.880> really<00:02:09.149> up<00:02:09.210> too

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
not too much so let's look really up too

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.060 
not too much so let's look really up too

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.550 
a gas card is the HD 7 7 plus it's a 90
so<00:02:48.980> 7070<00:02:49.980> gigahertz<00:02:50.250> edition<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:51.440> that's<00:02:52.440> a

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
so 7070 gigahertz edition and that's a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.260 
so 7070 gigahertz edition and that's a
really<00:02:52.740> good<00:02:52.830> graphics<00:02:53.130> card<00:02:53.340> it's<00:02:53.970> possible

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
really good graphics card it's possible

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.770 
really good graphics card it's possible
the<00:02:54.360> gtx<00:02:54.720> 680<00:02:56.030> they<00:02:57.030> speak<00:02:57.300> better<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.690> time

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
the gtx 680 they speak better this time
