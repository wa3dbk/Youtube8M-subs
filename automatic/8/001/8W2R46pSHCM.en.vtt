and<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.509> said<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:46.020> think<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.439> said<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.799> at

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and like I said I think I said it at

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.319 
and like I said I think I said it at
least<00:01:47.210> once<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:50.610> should<00:01:50.640> go<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
least once you do this you should go to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.120 
least once you do this you should go to
a<00:01:52.729> registry<00:01:53.729> cleaner<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.890> some<00:01:55.890> type<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
a registry cleaner or some type of a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.850 
a registry cleaner or some type of a
program<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.670> does<00:01:56.880> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
program that does that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.940 
program that does that
but<00:01:59.670> even<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.330> you<00:02:00.450> don't<00:02:00.690> it'll<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.170> fine<00:02:01.440> and

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
but even if you don't it'll be fine and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.390 
but even if you don't it'll be fine and
run<00:02:02.340> faster<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.530> it's<00:02:04.530> pretty<00:02:04.860> it's<00:02:05.160> really

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
run faster and it's pretty it's really

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.610 
run faster and it's pretty it's really
simple<00:02:05.730> to<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.150> and<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:07.230> you're<00:02:07.380> not<00:02:07.500> really

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
simple to do and if you're not really

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.360 
simple to do and if you're not really
comfortable<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.140> should<00:02:10.830> look

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
comfortable with this you should look

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.850 
comfortable with this you should look
doing<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.850> you<00:02:12.120> should<00:02:12.500> create<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> windows

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
doing this you should create a windows

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.520 
doing this you should create a windows
restore<00:02:14.070> point<00:02:14.900> just<00:02:15.900> in<00:02:15.990> case<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.320> mess

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
restore point just in case you mess

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.520 
restore point just in case you mess
something<00:02:16.560> up<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:18.750> program<00:02:19.140> doesn't<00:02:19.380> work

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
something up and a program doesn't work

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.310 
something up and a program doesn't work
after<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.280> do<00:02:20.460> this<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:23.510> it's<00:02:24.510> really<00:02:24.810> easy

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
after you do this but it's really easy

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.930 
after you do this but it's really easy
to<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:27.000> anyway<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.840> will<00:02:27.959> make<00:02:28.290> some<00:02:28.940> more

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
to do but anyway I will make some more

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.360 
to do but anyway I will make some more
