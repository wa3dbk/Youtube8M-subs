started<00:03:15.730> building<00:03:16.090> this<00:03:16.150> computer<00:03:16.569> in<00:03:16.750> 2006

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
started building this computer in 2006

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.080 
started building this computer in 2006
and<00:03:17.829> then<00:03:17.980> just<00:03:18.129> add<00:03:18.310> new<00:03:18.489> parts<00:03:18.790> every<00:03:18.970> now

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
and then just add new parts every now

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.559 
and then just add new parts every now
and<00:03:19.209> then<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:19.569> the<00:03:19.720> case<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.370> original<00:03:21.370> and

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
and then so the case is original and

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.629 
and then so the case is original and
that<00:03:22.919> might<00:03:23.919> be<00:03:24.069> it<00:03:24.160> everything<00:03:24.459> else<00:03:24.549> has

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
that might be it everything else has

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.270 
that might be it everything else has
been<00:03:24.730> changed<00:03:25.120> out<00:03:25.299> since<00:03:25.569> then<00:03:26.069> alright<00:03:27.069> and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
been changed out since then alright and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.140 
been changed out since then alright and
then<00:03:27.430> i<00:03:27.459> have<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.790> slot<00:03:28.480> fan<00:03:28.780> right<00:03:29.620> here<00:03:30.150> that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
then i have a slot fan right here that

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.030 
then i have a slot fan right here that
is<00:03:31.329> because<00:03:31.629> i<00:03:31.720> took<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:32.079> shrouding<00:03:32.590> or<00:03:32.739> the

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
is because i took the shrouding or the

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.449 
is because i took the shrouding or the
black<00:03:33.340> part<00:03:33.699> off<00:03:33.879> this<00:03:34.720> graphics<00:03:35.260> card<00:03:35.500> so

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
black part off this graphics card so

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.430 
black part off this graphics card so
it's<00:03:36.699> blowing<00:03:36.970> cool<00:03:37.750> air<00:03:37.930> right<00:03:38.199> up<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.409> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
it's blowing cool air right up on the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.589 
it's blowing cool air right up on the
heatsink<00:03:38.949> and<00:03:39.129> it<00:03:39.430> performs<00:03:40.180> much<00:03:40.569> better

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
heatsink and it performs much better

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.589 
heatsink and it performs much better
than<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.260> stock<00:03:41.590> shrouding<00:03:42.220> or<00:03:42.370> fan<00:03:42.639> pretty

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
than the stock shrouding or fan pretty

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.420 
than the stock shrouding or fan pretty
much<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.810> same<00:03:43.959> thing<00:03:44.199> at<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.409> point<00:03:44.680> and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
much the same thing at that point and

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.899 
much the same thing at that point and
then<00:03:45.609> i<00:03:45.819> usually<00:03:46.180> just<00:03:46.209> blows<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.799> some<00:03:47.909> heat

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
then i usually just blows a some heat

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.409 
then i usually just blows a some heat
out<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.120> back<00:03:49.709> yeah<00:03:50.709> works<00:03:51.099> pretty<00:03:51.250> nice<00:03:51.549> fans

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
out the back yeah works pretty nice fans

does<00:05:21.470> plenty<00:05:21.860> of<00:05:21.949> work<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.310> then<00:05:22.460> my<00:05:22.639> a<00:05:22.940> little

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
does plenty of work and then my a little

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.180 
does plenty of work and then my a little
bit<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:23.810> cable<00:05:24.139> management<00:05:24.350> all<00:05:24.800> kind<00:05:25.130> of

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
bit of cable management all kind of

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.180 
bit of cable management all kind of
bundled<00:05:25.580> up<00:05:25.699> there<00:05:25.940> that<00:05:26.720> way<00:05:27.100> plenty<00:05:28.100> of

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190

bundled up there that way plenty of
breathing<00:05:28.550> room<00:05:28.580> I<00:05:29.139> mean<00:05:30.139> this<00:05:30.289> is<00:05:30.500> a

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
breathing room I mean this is a

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.190 
breathing room I mean this is a
literally<00:05:31.760> along<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.570> going<00:05:32.750> put<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:32.960> camera

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200 
literally along to going put the camera

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.290 
literally along to going put the camera
down<00:05:33.229> here<00:05:33.590> literally<00:05:34.550> the<00:05:34.729> back<00:05:34.910> of<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.120> case

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
down here literally the back of the case

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.950 
down here literally the back of the case
so<00:05:36.139> I<00:05:36.169> can't<00:05:36.880> like<00:05:37.880> tuck<00:05:38.120> cables<00:05:38.570> really

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
so I can't like tuck cables really

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.110 
so I can't like tuck cables really
anywhere<00:05:39.349> as<00:05:39.620> basically<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.610> mean<00:05:41.030> I<00:05:41.060> can't

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
anywhere as basically I mean I can't

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.640 
anywhere as basically I mean I can't
kind<00:05:41.450> of<00:05:41.570> slide<00:05:41.810> them<00:05:41.960> up<00:05:42.020> in<00:05:42.169> there<00:05:42.320> so<00:05:42.560> that's

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
kind of slide them up in there so that's

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.730 
kind of slide them up in there so that's
that's<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.340> best<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.669> can<00:05:43.700> do<00:05:43.970> with<00:05:44.330> what<00:05:44.539> I<00:05:44.570> got
