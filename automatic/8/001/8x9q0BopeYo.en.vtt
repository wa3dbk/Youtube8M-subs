00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.700
 After the welcome, you will enter the hangar via take-off and landing sites

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.049

 Alexander goes to the start 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.130
 there is still a problem 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.270
 the copilot's helmet must fit Alexander well if he is too tall 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.620

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.240
 but Alexander did not care 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.200
 he really floated above the clouds and so to describe a flight feeling 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.200
