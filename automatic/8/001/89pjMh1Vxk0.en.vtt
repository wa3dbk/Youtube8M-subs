00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.720 
here's what texture does what you do is
you<00:00:25.170> cut<00:00:25.380> short<00:00:25.710> little<00:00:25.859> bits<00:00:26.160> inside<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
you cut short little bits inside of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.790 
you cut short little bits inside of
existing<00:00:27.240> lengths<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:28.109> come<00:00:28.349> back<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.740> they

need to be careful and understand that
if<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.540> go<00:00:39.690> back<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.440> texture<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.520> top<00:00:41.550> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
if we go back in on texture on top of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
if we go back in on texture on top of
texture<00:00:42.420> then<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.200> difficult<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:43.950> me<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
texture then I it's difficult for me to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.040 
texture then I it's difficult for me to
pick<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> same<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.390> hairs<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.840> cut

in<00:00:46.289> size<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.520> come<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.180> retexturize<00:00:49.020> you

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in size so we come in we retexturize you

three concept of spacing where you
reversed<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:21.650> for<00:01:22.650> spacing<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.850> time<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
reversed it for spacing this time you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960 
reversed it for spacing this time you
bring<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> put<00:01:26.070> your<00:01:26.250> middle<00:01:26.400> finger<00:01:26.759> down

inside this way bring it and weave back

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.969 
inside this way bring it and weave back
through<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> opposite<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.439> come

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
through the opposite way and come

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.249 
through the opposite way and come
through<00:01:32.009> guess<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.210> friends<00:01:33.630> this

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
through guess what my friends this

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.109 
through guess what my friends this
technique<00:01:34.710> comes<00:01:34.860> from<00:01:35.070> beauty<00:01:35.400> school<00:01:35.700> when

watch this as I slide up I use my little
finger<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.240> guess<00:01:42.720> what<00:01:43.020> look<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.740> pops<00:01:43.979> out

now<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.399> come<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.790> take<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.630> shorter<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
now we can come in take that shorter and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.069 
now we can come in take that shorter and
you've<00:01:49.979> recut<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.880> same<00:01:51.210> hair<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.810> cut

you want to grow the texture out take

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.820 
you want to grow the texture out take
the<00:02:32.130> blending<00:02:32.640> shear<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.390> come<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.230> close

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
the blending shear and come in and close

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.040 
the blending shear and come in and close
that<00:02:35.700> way<00:02:35.940> you're<00:02:36.120> starting<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.510> let<00:02:36.660> some<00:02:36.930> of

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
that way you're starting to let some of

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.040 
that way you're starting to let some of
this<00:02:37.200> go<00:02:37.290> out<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.420> maintaining<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.540> small

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
this go out and maintaining a small

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.740 
this go out and maintaining a small
amount<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.440> texture<00:02:40.800> inside<00:02:41.300> great<00:02:42.300> technique

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
amount of texture inside great technique

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.840 
amount of texture inside great technique
to<00:02:42.780> cross-check<00:02:43.140> your<00:02:43.530> texture<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.160> control

to cross-check your texture and control

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.990 
to cross-check your texture and control
the<00:02:45.120> amount<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.570> weight<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.410> take<00:02:46.710> out<00:02:47.000> that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
the amount of weight you take out that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.640 
the amount of weight you take out that
is<00:02:48.440> cross-checking

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
is cross-checking

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.820 
is cross-checking
