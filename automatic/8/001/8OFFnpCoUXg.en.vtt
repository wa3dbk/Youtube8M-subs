basics to cover all your bases let's
talk<00:00:13.710> about<00:00:13.860> some<00:00:14.130> of<00:00:14.219> them<00:00:14.309> first<00:00:14.910> your

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
talk about some of them first your

talk about some of them first your
shaker<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.839> one<00:00:15.990> probably<00:00:16.289> everyone<00:00:16.619> is

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
shaker the one probably everyone is

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.019 
shaker the one probably everyone is
familiar<00:00:16.890> with<00:00:17.160> there<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:17.609> two<00:00:17.760> types

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
familiar with there are two types

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.990 
familiar with there are two types
there's<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.859> two-piece<00:00:19.859> shaker<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.520> then

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
there's the two-piece shaker and then

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.849 
there's the two-piece shaker and then
there's<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> three-piece<00:00:21.720> shaker<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.350> like

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
there's the three-piece shaker I like

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:23.450 
there's the three-piece shaker I like
this<00:00:23.010> one

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
this one

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.340 
this one
just<00:00:23.820> because<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> ice<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.720> travel<00:00:25.050> more

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
just because the ice can travel more

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.900 
just because the ice can travel more
gives<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> better<00:00:26.099> texture<00:00:26.460> makes<00:00:26.789> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
gives it a better texture makes it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.060 
gives it a better texture makes it
colder<00:00:27.269> also<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.140> really<00:00:28.380> get<00:00:28.619> into<00:00:28.800> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
colder also you can really get into it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.759 
colder also you can really get into it
give<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.179> whatever<00:00:31.170> rhythm<00:00:31.650> you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
give it a you know whatever rhythm you

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.100 
give it a you know whatever rhythm you
want<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> add<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.309> your<00:00:32.399> shake<00:00:32.669> up<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.450> this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
want to add to your shake up to you this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.209 
want to add to your shake up to you this
one<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.350> feel<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:34.590> has<00:00:34.739> three<00:00:34.980> pieces

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
one I just feel like has three pieces

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.040 
one I just feel like has three pieces
and<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.640> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.030> constrained<00:00:36.600> with<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> ice

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and is kind of constrained with the ice

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.869 
and is kind of constrained with the ice
you<00:00:37.530> also<00:00:37.680> want<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> have<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> mixing<00:00:38.399> glass<00:00:38.460> for

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
you also want to have a mixing glass for

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.940 
you also want to have a mixing glass for
stirring<00:00:39.329> cocktails<00:00:39.840> something<00:00:40.590> nice<00:00:40.739> and

stirring cocktails something nice and
heavy<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.570> won't<00:00:42.690> tip<00:00:43.200> over

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
heavy so that you know it won't tip over

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.590 
heavy so that you know it won't tip over
when<00:00:43.620> you're<00:00:43.739> stirring<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.510> speaking<00:00:45.510> of

when you're stirring and speaking of
stirring<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.170> transitions<00:00:46.710> nicely<00:00:46.890> into

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
stirring that transitions nicely into

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220 
stirring that transitions nicely into
bars<00:00:47.489> spoons<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.510> come<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.989> lot<00:00:49.110> of

most important two are the two one

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.160 
most important two are the two one
jigger<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.860> 2<00:01:11.040> ounces<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.490> one<00:01:11.640> ounce<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
jigger so it's 2 ounces in one ounce and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.859 
jigger so it's 2 ounces in one ounce and
the<00:01:13.170> half<00:01:13.920> ounce<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.369> 3/4<00:01:14.909> ounce<00:01:15.060> jigger<00:01:15.330> they

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the half ounce in 3/4 ounce jigger they

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.810 
the half ounce in 3/4 ounce jigger they
also<00:01:15.990> make<00:01:16.610> 3/4<00:01:17.610> ounce<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> half<00:01:18.650> 1/2
