here<00:00:47.280> kind<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> our<00:00:48.600> location<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.289> find<00:00:49.550> I've

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
here kind of our location to find I've

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
here kind of our location to find I've
done<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.000> glitch<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.510> know<00:00:51.629> scraping

once you get in the right spot you'll

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.539 
once you get in the right spot you'll
know<00:01:15.320> where<00:01:15.530> it's<00:01:15.680> at<00:01:15.830> I'm<00:01:16.190> not<00:01:16.340> two<00:01:16.520> hundred

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
know where it's at I'm not two hundred

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.280 
know where it's at I'm not two hundred
percent<00:01:17.330> sure<00:01:17.540> where<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:17.810> at<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.140> it's

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
percent sure where it's at but it's

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.710

right<00:01:18.500> here<00:01:18.710> it's<00:01:19.640> right<00:01:19.760> where<00:01:20.240> i<00:01:20.270> set<00:01:20.570> the

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
right here it's right where i set the

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.930 
right here it's right where i set the
waypoint<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.650> you're<00:01:21.979> basically<00:01:22.520> just<00:01:22.610> going

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
waypoint and you're basically just going

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.719 
waypoint and you're basically just going
to<00:01:23.000> fly<00:01:23.479> down<00:01:24.040> it's<00:01:25.040> right<00:01:25.310> here<00:01:25.369> on<00:01:25.460> my<00:01:25.610> way

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
to fly down it's right here on my way

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.899 
to fly down it's right here on my way
point<00:01:26.000> so<00:01:26.450> if<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:26.600> do<00:01:26.659> exactly<00:01:26.840> there<00:01:27.880> or<00:01:28.880> a

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
point so if you do exactly there or a

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.100 
point so if you do exactly there or a
little<00:01:29.060> bit<00:01:29.270> in<00:01:29.390> front<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.720> where<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.960> way

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
little bit in front of where the way

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.920 
little bit in front of where the way
point<00:01:30.380> is<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.619> set<00:01:30.830> it<00:01:30.950> exactly<00:01:31.520> there<00:01:31.820> that<00:01:32.750> is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
point is to set it exactly there that is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.980 
point is to set it exactly there that is
exactly<00:01:33.110> where<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:34.009> glitch<00:01:34.220> will<00:01:34.250> be<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.659> now

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
exactly where the glitch will be so now

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.300 
exactly where the glitch will be so now
basically<00:01:36.500> what<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:37.970> do<00:01:38.270> is<00:01:38.720> swim<00:01:39.500> all

the way under these rocks and bam you're
into<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:47.539> map<00:01:47.780> of<00:01:48.020> dying<00:01:48.259> light<00:01:48.500> at<00:01:49.070> least<00:01:49.280> old

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
into the map of dying light at least old

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.960 
into the map of dying light at least old
town<00:01:49.700> so<00:01:50.539> now<00:01:50.929> basically<00:01:51.429> you<00:01:52.429> can<00:01:52.610> see<00:01:52.820> the
