00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.870
 Then I feel like it's totally summer 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.840
 On the other side of the sea , mixed with the voice of the warlord 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:20.550
 You can also hear 22 roars 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:24.789
 There is a lot of cloudy water today, because it was raining until yesterday 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.170
 The surface is beckoning How is this going after ? 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.120
 I am crowded Axane face 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.120
 It's not catch the squid are herd eyebrows 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.579
 It's still home faster time 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.480
 Do something with bait fishing 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.480
 I will try to aim 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.410
 It is a one-year-old Oikawa who is about Wakasagi, who is somewhat out of the ordinary 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 I was caught fish 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.900
 It is one of the best Oikawa 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.950
 Today's my next partner is from this guy 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.470
 Well I Nedemo 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.040
 It is not so bad because it is a delicious size 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.830
 I was caught again 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.480
 It is Oikawa of about smelt again 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:29.120
 Because Oikawa who brings is only as small as Wakasagi, it brings me 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:33.590
 Needle now I used it a has a little cut for smelt 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:38.909
 Bali's when the food was like not come eat Yappa does not seem and useless put 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.960
 The snow is on this tiny ball Uki The shop is already so 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.250
 Is it about 80 centimeters ? 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:51.060
 It is about 70 cm to 80 cm , but I'm sticking in a fairly shallow place 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.060
 Well I can catch again or it's about the size of Oikawa. 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.319
 I came fishing again, and I visited it . It is a guy from Pisa about wakasagi . 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:08.660
 But I I think that it is such a thing is not Toka say engaged because they use the tension of smelt 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.660
 I feel it is the mood Well 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:22.650
 The sun has sunk, so I will try to fish something using this bait 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.650
 I caught was caught something 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:32.720
 I was free and I was able to catch 5 cm early 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.720
 I kun moving 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.530

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.340
 I caught this time today 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.160
 in this way 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.840
 It is love Oikawa and part every day 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.840
 Hey I have become small fishing today 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.350
 I did not catch the big deal 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.870
 It is a kind of feeling that is there well also say 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:11.730
 However, the next surprise this time is just in June 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:13.790
 It would be that I could hear the two kinds of roar of the evening sun, the nightfall 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790
 Or 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:26.480
 Yes this time fishing result is this 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:29.690
 It was pretty shabby even though it was early summer when the voice of the semi was also heard 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.720
 Chibikko any good Partners 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.870
 It and small Ugui 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.780
 I can't help you 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.280
 I'm going to make this a tempura today 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.140
 This time this tempura this 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.440
 Now is the season 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.990
 Blue miso 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.920
 Using this 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.530
 Execute this deliciousization plan to try to make it a Delhi shirt 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.220
 I will try 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.880
 Eikawa Ne this is really soft but it is small to be caught this time 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.180
 I just put out my lauter and put it on my head with tempura 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:10.750
 And here is this early but this is small 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:16.030
 This is because one bone is hard, so I take the head and try to make tempura in the state I also take the middle bone 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.209
 I think you So this cooking shears When was the cuisine of about this time can only do what this 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.859
 I think 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.689
 First of all 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.689
 I put out the intestine of Oikawa 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.270
 Oh, it looks like this 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:46.020
 I was cleanly washed to the inside 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.020
 Next, I will take this head out of the intestines. 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.810
 The 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.790
 Oh, it looks like this 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.550
 Is now also beautiful in their 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.550
 It is And then this will also Hasameru do I take a medium bone 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.860
 At first I open it like this 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:06:01.819
 So I was able to shoot the bone with this I thought that I was ready for the Constitution with this kind of feeling 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.360
 What Well I'm a low-cost Tteyuu And then I ne delicious and so with this I Perilla 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.990
 Never 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.480
 It's easy 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:12.950
 Aoji Oh, I'm Komaki to this 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.000
 But it's a thing say cormorants Iuko trying to tempura and I was just just wound Nekohhana dignified 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.190
 You can take it 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.170
 Attach a thing to be glued like a serpentine to a cat and glue it 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.100
 I will try to tempura after making it impossible to take off So well this time glue strongly 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.880
 This is because 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:32.490
 I'm wondering bond g and this will be used to 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:37.790
 I This is keep in quit Well this time 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:42.080
 I think I will use this umeboshi as a glue instead. 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.260
 Well I ne This Nechanecha I finger value I Koume star is First 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.920
 that 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:51.129
 Take out the seeds in the direction of 3 more than nechon 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:59.939
 Bonding water condition I will bond g condition 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:59.939
 Then you line up this blue implementation on the cutting board and paint the plum meat instead of this glue 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:16.140
 It's like this , and plum meat instead of glue has become accustomed to it 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.140
 Then I will open this somehow 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:25.639
 In the adhesive force of it is like this small plum meat 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:28.400
 Blue miso is perfectly attached to the bag 

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:32.900
 For example I of the cat people here of early 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.110
 3 If you are exposed to Kanekawa, this is a cat petatsu 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.580
 It also Toka stick 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.310
 In this way 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.810
 Because it's like sticking 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.810
 I will stick together quite nicely 

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.180
 Attached 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:50.550
 I like this 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.550
 Adhesion of blue shiso is over 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:55.580
 After that, I put on the cloth normally and make it tempura 

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:06.020
 It is a glue shop to go on the small fish and aoji that I met 

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.020
 The food naming is industrial but the place is miso
