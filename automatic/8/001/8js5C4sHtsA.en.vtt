working<00:01:23.460> load<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.020> able<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> handle<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.650> I

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
working load to be able to handle this I

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.510 
working load to be able to handle this I
went<00:01:26.189> with<00:01:26.840> rope<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.990> had<00:01:28.140> 110<00:01:28.740> pound<00:01:29.009> load<00:01:29.310> I

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
went with rope that had 110 pound load I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.090 
went with rope that had 110 pound load I
don't<00:01:29.729> know<00:01:29.850> how<00:01:29.970> much<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> top<00:01:30.450> ways<00:01:31.100> by

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
don't know how much the top ways by

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.460 
don't know how much the top ways by
itself<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.240> figured<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.990> probably<00:01:34.290> doesn't

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
itself but I figured it probably doesn't

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.700 
itself but I figured it probably doesn't
weigh<00:01:34.680> more<00:01:34.890> than<00:01:35.040> 440<00:01:35.729> pounds<00:01:36.470> since<00:01:37.470> there's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
weigh more than 440 pounds since there's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.210 
weigh more than 440 pounds since there's
four<00:01:37.799> ropes<00:01:38.689> so<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.049> got

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409

by<00:02:23.400> fours<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> ceiling<00:02:24.420> where<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.010> into<00:02:26.010> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
by fours to the ceiling where the into a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.430 
by fours to the ceiling where the into a
rafter<00:02:26.580> that's<00:02:27.360> one<00:02:27.810> thing<00:02:27.989> you<00:02:28.080> got<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.320> make

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
rafter that's one thing you got to make

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.340 
rafter that's one thing you got to make
sure<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.769> bolt<00:02:29.489> him<00:02:29.640> into<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> rafter<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.480> I

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
sure you do bolt him into a rafter and I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
sure you do bolt him into a rafter and I
just<00:02:31.590> spaced<00:02:31.860> them<00:02:32.070> out<00:02:32.450> back<00:02:33.450> up<00:02:33.720> here<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.370> just

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
just spaced them out back up here I just

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.160 
just spaced them out back up here I just
spaced<00:02:35.790> them<00:02:36.030> out<00:02:36.120> where<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:36.660> thought<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.959> would

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
spaced them out where I thought I would

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.490 
spaced them out where I thought I would
need<00:02:37.260> them<00:02:37.380> for<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> top<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.070> I<00:02:38.340> did<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.730> rough

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
need them for the top and I did a rough

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.720 
need them for the top and I did a rough
estimate<00:02:40.500> of<00:02:40.530> about<00:02:40.860> 59<00:02:41.519> inches<00:02:41.880> square<00:02:42.380> for

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
estimate of about 59 inches square for

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.430 
estimate of about 59 inches square for
my<00:02:44.730> top<00:02:45.000> ISKCON<00:02:45.660> obviously<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.170> going<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.350> be

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
my top ISKCON obviously it's going to be

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.120 
my top ISKCON obviously it's going to be
shorter<00:02:46.800> for<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.400> regular-sized<00:02:48.090> Wrangler<00:02:48.510> but

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
shorter for a regular-sized Wrangler but

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.810 
shorter for a regular-sized Wrangler but
that's<00:02:50.130> nighted<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:51.660> I<00:02:52.160> ran<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.310> ropes<00:02:53.519> I

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
that's nighted so then I ran the ropes I

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.940 
that's nighted so then I ran the ropes I
ran<00:02:54.000> four<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.450> them<00:02:54.600> I<00:02:54.810> ran<00:02:55.530> them<00:02:55.620> up<00:02:55.739> through

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
ran four of them I ran them up through

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.030 
ran four of them I ran them up through
the<00:02:56.040> eyelets<00:02:57.049> back<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.320> wall<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.829> two

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
the eyelets back to the wall and the two

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.449 
the eyelets back to the wall and the two
eyelets

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.250 

down<00:03:01.970> into<00:03:02.269> one<00:03:02.420> eyelet<00:03:02.840> so<00:03:03.019> they're<00:03:03.140> all<00:03:03.230> in

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
down into one eyelet so they're all in

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.520 
down into one eyelet so they're all in
the<00:03:03.409> same<00:03:03.590> spot<00:03:04.659> and<00:03:05.659> then<00:03:05.870> to<00:03:06.049> a<00:03:06.079> ratchet

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
the same spot and then to a ratchet

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.380 
the same spot and then to a ratchet
strap<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.620> then<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:10.250> lag<00:03:10.519> bolt<00:03:10.819> it<00:03:10.970> goes<00:03:11.150> into

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
strap and then to lag bolt it goes into

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.979 
strap and then to lag bolt it goes into
a<00:03:12.049> stud<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.760> just<00:03:13.970> use<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.299> ratchet<00:03:14.480> strap

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
a stud and I just use the ratchet strap

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.420 
a stud and I just use the ratchet strap
to<00:03:15.730> pull<00:03:16.730> down<00:03:17.000> on<00:03:17.329> the<00:03:17.450> Rope<00:03:17.599> this<00:03:18.560> way<00:03:18.799> and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
to pull down on the Rope this way and

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.059 
to pull down on the Rope this way and
then<00:03:20.060> turn<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:20.299> left<00:03:20.599> is<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.840> hot<00:03:20.989> hot<00:03:21.349> excuse

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
then turn it left is the hot hot excuse

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.839 
then turn it left is the hot hot excuse
me<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.640> hard<00:03:22.879> top<00:03:23.180> off<00:03:24.549> actually<00:03:25.549> worked<00:03:25.700> out

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
me the hard top off actually worked out

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.099 
me the hard top off actually worked out
better<00:03:26.120> than<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.390> thought<00:03:26.540> it<00:03:26.689> was<00:03:26.750> going<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.989> be

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
better than I thought it was going to be

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.890 
better than I thought it was going to be
but<00:03:27.409> at<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.620> same<00:03:27.799> time<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:29.150> top<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.629> lot

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
but at the same time that top is a lot

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.449 
but at the same time that top is a lot
heavier<00:03:30.409> than<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.799> thought<00:03:30.829> it<00:03:31.099> was<00:03:31.189> going<00:03:31.370> to

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
heavier than I thought it was going to

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.660 
heavier than I thought it was going to
be<00:03:31.579> at<00:03:32.540> first<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:33.049> tried<00:03:33.109> just<00:03:33.560> pulling<00:03:33.920> where's

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
be at first I tried just pulling where's

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.089 
be at first I tried just pulling where's
the<00:03:34.730> focus<00:03:35.060> here<00:03:35.239> at<00:03:36.230> first<00:03:36.500> I<00:03:36.650> just<00:03:36.859> tried

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
the focus here at first I just tried

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.430 
the focus here at first I just tried
pulling<00:03:37.310> on<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.670> rope<00:03:37.849> and<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.180> I<00:03:38.540> couldn't<00:03:39.019> get

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
pulling on the rope and I I couldn't get

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.839 
pulling on the rope and I I couldn't get
it<00:03:39.620> thing<00:03:39.829> probably<00:03:40.190> weighs<00:03:40.310> more<00:03:40.549> than<00:03:40.609> I<00:03:40.790> do

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:40.849 
it thing probably weighs more than I do

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.240 
it thing probably weighs more than I do
but<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.980> second<00:03:43.340> thing<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.519> I<00:03:43.700> tried<00:03:44.000> was<00:03:44.299> I

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
but the second thing that I tried was I

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.470 
but the second thing that I tried was I
looked<00:03:47.200> this<00:03:48.200> rope<00:03:48.500> here<00:03:49.299> straight<00:03:50.299> out<00:03:50.450> from

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
looked this rope here straight out from

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.270 
looked this rope here straight out from
this<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.109> look<00:03:51.670> to<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.790> trailer<00:03:53.120> hiss<00:03:53.379> and<00:03:54.379> I

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
this I look to the trailer hiss and I

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.009 
this I look to the trailer hiss and I
put<00:03:55.639> a<00:03:55.670> ratchet<00:03:55.879> strap<00:03:56.180> on<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.689> trailer<00:03:57.019> hitch

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
put a ratchet strap on the trailer hitch

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.330 
put a ratchet strap on the trailer hitch
connect<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.139> to<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.349> rope<00:04:00.530> that<00:04:00.980> was<00:04:01.099> right

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
connect it to the rope that was right

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.240 
connect it to the rope that was right
here<00:04:01.670> so<00:04:02.599> as<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.319> drove<00:04:03.680> away<00:04:04.370> from<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.870> Iowa

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
here so as I drove away from the Iowa

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.470 
here so as I drove away from the Iowa
the<00:04:07.250> ropes<00:04:07.489> would<00:04:07.760> pull<00:04:08.090> tight<00:04:08.359> you<00:04:08.959> know<00:04:09.049> they

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
the ropes would pull tight you know they

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.820 
the ropes would pull tight you know they
we'll<00:04:09.680> pull<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:10.890> way<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.720> as<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.440> drove<00:04:13.709> away

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
we'll pull this way and as I drove away

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.530 
we'll pull this way and as I drove away
from<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.250> wall<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.849> would<00:04:15.030> lift<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.300> hardtop

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
from the wall it would lift the hardtop

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.390 
from the wall it would lift the hardtop
off<00:04:15.930> well<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.410> worked<00:04:16.709> fine<00:04:16.980> until<00:04:17.340> I

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
off well that worked fine until I

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.210 
off well that worked fine until I
noticed<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:19.079> was<00:04:19.139> actually<00:04:19.470> bowing<00:04:20.190> my

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
noticed that it was actually bowing my

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.720 
noticed that it was actually bowing my
wall<00:04:20.609> out<00:04:20.940> this<00:04:21.269> way<00:04:21.530> my<00:04:22.530> kind<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.340> an<00:04:23.460> older

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
wall out this way my kind of an older

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.950 
wall out this way my kind of an older
house<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.120> built<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.450> 76<00:04:26.030> May<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.060> was<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.570> noticed

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
house is built in 76 May I was I noticed

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.780 
house is built in 76 May I was I noticed
this<00:04:28.560> pulling<00:04:29.010> away<00:04:29.160> I<00:04:29.250> could<00:04:29.460> see<00:04:29.610> this

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
this pulling away I could see this

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.190 
this pulling away I could see this
eyelet<00:04:30.330> moving<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:32.580> high<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.240> back<00:04:33.690> back<00:04:33.930> down

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
eyelet moving so high I back back down

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.780 
eyelet moving so high I back back down
and<00:04:34.550> now<00:04:35.550> it's<00:04:35.729> got<00:04:35.910> more<00:04:36.150> lateral<00:04:37.790> or

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
and now it's got more lateral or

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.300 
and now it's got more lateral or
vertical<00:04:39.360> force<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.590> way<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:40.770> have<00:04:41.040> it<00:04:41.070> now

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
vertical force the way I have it now

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.210 
vertical force the way I have it now
than<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.729> does<00:04:41.910> lateral<00:04:42.600> force<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.139> I<00:04:43.470> haven't

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
than it does lateral force so I haven't

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.860 
than it does lateral force so I haven't
had<00:04:44.340> any<00:04:44.490> bowing<00:04:44.790> issues<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.330> ones<00:04:45.510> up<00:04:45.690> at<00:04:45.810> the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
had any bowing issues the ones up at the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.560 
had any bowing issues the ones up at the
top<00:04:46.080> there<00:04:46.380> are<00:04:46.650> close<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:48.120> a-frame

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
top there are close to the a-frame

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.090 
top there are close to the a-frame
that's<00:04:48.840> above<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.229> ceiling<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.830> keeps

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
that's above the ceiling so that keeps

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.230 
that's above the ceiling so that keeps
the<00:04:50.340> wall<00:04:50.520> from<00:04:51.450> bowing<00:04:51.810> out<00:04:51.930> up<00:04:52.139> there<00:04:52.350> and

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
the wall from bowing out up there and

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.030 
the wall from bowing out up there and
nothing<00:04:54.240> seems<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.900> have<00:04:55.050> been<00:04:55.260> bending<00:04:55.740> or

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
nothing seems to have been bending or

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.540 
nothing seems to have been bending or
anything<00:04:56.729> like<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:58.280> that's<00:04:59.280> an<00:04:59.430> easy

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
anything like that so that's an easy

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.360 
anything like that so that's an easy
idea

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
what time it is probably took me about

two and a half hours just to rig it all
up<00:05:08.040> by<00:05:08.340> hand<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:11.600> probably<00:05:12.600> about<00:05:12.750> 50<00:05:13.260> bucks

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
up by hand and probably about 50 bucks

my total bill at Menards was like $63

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.070 
my total bill at Menards was like $63
but<00:05:18.180> I<00:05:18.210> bought<00:05:18.419> some<00:05:18.600> other<00:05:18.720> stuff<00:05:19.050> that

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
but I bought some other stuff that

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.810 
but I bought some other stuff that
didn't<00:05:19.410> have<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:19.620> do<00:05:19.740> with<00:05:19.860> this<00:05:20.010> project<00:05:20.460> so

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
didn't have to do with this project so

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.870 
didn't have to do with this project so
about<00:05:21.389> fifty<00:05:21.750> bucks<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.430> you<00:05:23.610> could<00:05:23.760> probably

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
about fifty bucks and you could probably

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.740 
about fifty bucks and you could probably
skim<00:05:24.300> by<00:05:24.479> about<00:05:24.720> 40<00:05:25.289> because<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:25.620> bought<00:05:25.860> more

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
skim by about 40 because I bought more

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.020 
skim by about 40 because I bought more
lag<00:05:27.750> bolts<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.410> more<00:05:28.830> washers<00:05:29.340> than<00:05:29.520> I<00:05:29.639> needed

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
in fact I bought about twice as much

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.140
