00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.080 

oK<00:00:16.170> we've<00:00:16.260> worked<00:00:16.470> up<00:00:16.619> half<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> palm<00:00:17.250> cutting

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
oK we've worked up half the palm cutting

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.970 
oK we've worked up half the palm cutting
method<00:00:18.420> through<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> side<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.740> what<00:00:19.890> we're

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
method through the side now what we're

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.220 
method through the side now what we're
going<00:00:20.099> to<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.279> now<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.880> obviously<00:00:21.539> finish<00:00:21.989> this

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
going to do now is obviously finish this

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740 
going to do now is obviously finish this
and<00:00:22.470> refine<00:00:22.919> this<00:00:23.189> I'm<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.239> to<00:00:24.300> use<00:00:24.509> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
and refine this I'm going to use a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.499 
and refine this I'm going to use a
scissor<00:00:25.020> over<00:00:25.199> comb<00:00:25.349> method<00:00:25.919> now<00:00:26.759> when<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.239> use

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:27.509 
scissor over comb method now when I use

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:29.420 
scissor over comb method now when I use
this<00:00:27.660> method<00:00:27.989> of<00:00:28.079> cutting<00:00:28.290> what<00:00:29.009> I<00:00:29.040> want<00:00:29.309> to

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
this method of cutting what I want to

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.790 
this method of cutting what I want to
ensure<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.419> I<00:00:30.599> focus<00:00:31.110> on<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.379> sits<00:00:31.649> on

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
ensure is that I focus on what sits on

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.340 
ensure is that I focus on what sits on
the<00:00:31.919> spine<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.550> comb<00:00:32.879> just<00:00:33.570> what<00:00:33.960> sits

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
the spine of the comb just what sits

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.350 
the spine of the comb just what sits
here<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.399> think<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.700> sits<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> top

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
here and I think that sits on the top

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.979 
here and I think that sits on the top
only<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.289> spine<00:00:37.620> as<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:39.030> take<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.239> section<00:00:39.840> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
only on the spine as I take my section I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.950 
only on the spine as I take my section I
lift<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.770> my<00:00:40.920> comb<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.480> then<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.660> just

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
lift up with my comb and then I just

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
lift up with my comb and then I just
literally<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.590> what's<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
literally see what's it's just there and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
literally see what's it's just there and
focus<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.960> cutting<00:00:46.200> there<00:00:46.560> only<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> as<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
focus on cutting there only so as you

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
focus on cutting there only so as you
can<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> very<00:00:53.310> slow<00:00:53.910> method<00:00:54.180> of

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
can see it's a very slow method of

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.940 
can see it's a very slow method of
cutting<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:54.930> all<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.350> doing<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.739> ensuring

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
cutting but all I'm doing is ensuring

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.180 
cutting but all I'm doing is ensuring
that<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.270> line<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.660> I've<00:00:57.809> cut<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.320> polished

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
that that line that I've cut is polished

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.660 
that that line that I've cut is polished
and<00:00:59.430> clean<00:01:03.739> once<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> cross-check<00:01:05.519> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and clean once I have a cross-check this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.209 
and clean once I have a cross-check this
way<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.509> I<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.469> a<00:01:07.500> more<00:01:07.860> mobile

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
way then I can go with a more mobile

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:14.660 
way then I can go with a more mobile
technique<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.780> refinement<00:01:13.189> as<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.460> see

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
technique for refinement as you can see

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.539 
technique for refinement as you can see
spine<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.719> comb<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> previous<00:01:17.159> uncut

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
spine of the comb and the previous uncut

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.760 
spine of the comb and the previous uncut
hair<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:17.909> here<00:01:18.179> and<00:01:18.420> I'm<00:01:19.020> only<00:01:19.229> focused<00:01:19.740> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
hair is here and I'm only focused on

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
hair is here and I'm only focused on
what<00:01:19.920> sits<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.459> spine

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.540 

so<00:01:35.790> I'll<00:01:36.780> bring<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.140> section<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.950> my<00:01:38.100> fingers

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
so I'll bring this section to my fingers

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:46.490 
so I'll bring this section to my fingers
and<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.940> can<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.920> refined<00:01:41.430> shape<00:01:45.500> like

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
and we can see that refined shape like

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.760 
and we can see that refined shape like
so<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.030> continue<00:01:48.660> this<00:01:48.780> method<00:01:49.230> right

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so so now I continue this method right

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:42.860 
so so now I continue this method right
through<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> back<00:01:50.550> on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.790> sides

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.360 

they<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:44.049> at<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.260> back<00:02:44.409> we<00:02:44.590> can<00:02:44.620> present<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
they here at the back we can present the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.509 
they here at the back we can present the
comb<00:02:45.640> direc<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.390> on<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.629> spine<00:02:47.370> directly<00:02:48.370> on

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
comb direc it on the spine directly on

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.750 
comb direc it on the spine directly on
the<00:02:48.670> scalp<00:02:48.970> we<00:02:49.420> bevel<00:02:49.810> outwards<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:51.340> maintain

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
the scalp we bevel outwards to maintain

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.740 
the scalp we bevel outwards to maintain
the<00:02:51.940> tapered<00:02:52.480> feel<00:02:52.750> towards<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> neckline

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the tapered feel towards a neckline

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:09.440 
the tapered feel towards a neckline
bearing<00:02:55.750> outwards<00:02:57.959> softening<00:02:58.959> their<00:02:59.109> client

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.130 

we're<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.599> working<00:03:10.840> up<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> head<00:03:11.440> shape<00:03:11.709> a

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
we're just working up the head shape a

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.830 
we're just working up the head shape a
previous<00:03:14.790> cut<00:03:15.790> guide<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.660> we're

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
previous cut guide is there and we're

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:32.510 
previous cut guide is there and we're
working<00:03:16.959> across<00:03:17.200> our<00:03:17.590> comb

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.880 

we're<00:03:33.520> just<00:03:33.760> cutting<00:03:34.270> up<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.780> where<00:03:35.769> we've

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
we're just cutting up to where we've

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.300 
we're just cutting up to where we've
gone<00:03:36.040> in<00:03:36.220> with<00:03:36.580> our<00:03:36.730> fingers<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:38.800> it<00:03:38.980> just<00:03:39.220> to

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
gone in with our fingers is it just to

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:46.050 
gone in with our fingers is it just to
taper<00:03:39.640> down<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:41.019> behind<00:03:41.349> the<00:03:41.470> ears<00:03:44.879> we<00:03:45.879> have<00:03:46.030> a

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
taper down to behind the ears we have a

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.839 
taper down to behind the ears we have a
very<00:03:46.300> smooth<00:03:46.810> transition<00:03:47.080> into<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.739> top<00:03:47.950> pin

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
very smooth transition into the top pin

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.360 
very smooth transition into the top pin
in<00:03:48.970> back<00:03:49.090> our<00:03:49.269> ear<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:50.050> can<00:03:50.230> see<00:03:50.530> that's<00:03:51.190> a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
in back our ear you can see that's a

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.850 
in back our ear you can see that's a
previous<00:03:51.790> cut<00:03:51.970> guide<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.560> hair<00:03:53.739> that

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
previous cut guide this is the hair that

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.539 
previous cut guide this is the hair that
needs<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.130> come<00:03:54.280> off<00:03:54.900> lifting<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:55.959> hair<00:03:56.140> out

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
needs to come off lifting the hair out

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.820 
needs to come off lifting the hair out
we'll<00:03:57.549> just<00:03:57.700> focus<00:03:57.910> on<00:03:58.209> that

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
we'll just focus on that

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.420 
we'll just focus on that
so<00:03:59.830> we<00:03:59.950> tape<00:04:00.190> her<00:04:00.340> into<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.700> air<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:03.310> we're

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
so we tape her into the air and we're

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.130 
so we tape her into the air and we're
going<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.640> move<00:04:04.269> up<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.540> head<00:04:04.690> shape<00:04:04.959> we're

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
going to move up the head shape we're
