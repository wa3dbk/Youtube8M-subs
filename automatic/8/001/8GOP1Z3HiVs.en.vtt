00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
is okay that's perfect instead of having

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.249 
is okay that's perfect instead of having
to<00:01:35.070> go<00:01:35.280> into<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.000> sides<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:36.900> tweezers

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
recharging dock is actually now on the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.649 
recharging dock is actually now on the
back<00:01:52.770> instead<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.220> other<00:01:53.430> sides<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.180> has<00:01:54.630> a

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
back instead of other sides it has a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.620 
back instead of other sides it has a
nice<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.229> curved<00:01:55.680> design<00:01:56.479> somewhat<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
nice little curved design somewhat of a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
nice little curved design somewhat of a
curve<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.710> much<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.130> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> lot

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
curve it's not that much but it's a lot

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.520 
curve it's not that much but it's a lot
better<00:01:59.670> than<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.969> original<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:01.140> feel

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
better than the original one and I feel

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
better than the original one and I feel
like<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.159> fit<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> lot<00:02:02.790> easier<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.299> my

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
like this will fit a lot easier on my

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.170 
like this will fit a lot easier on my
wrist<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.649> also<00:02:04.890> has<00:02:05.310> something<00:02:06.000> else

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
wrist and this also has something else

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.490 
wrist and this also has something else
that<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.570> original<00:02:06.719> strap<00:02:07.140> didn't<00:02:07.350> have

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
that the original strap didn't have

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.639 
that the original strap didn't have
which<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.670> two<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.840> uh<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
which are actually two of these uh I

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.890 
which are actually two of these uh I
guess<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.640> should<00:02:11.670> call<00:02:12.060> them<00:02:12.180> flanges<00:02:12.750> so

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
guess you should call them flanges so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.770 
guess you should call them flanges so
that<00:02:13.050> you<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.319> have

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
that you can have

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.470 
that you can have
physicians<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:15.370> hook<00:02:15.550> your<00:02:15.819> other<00:02:16.209> side<00:02:16.450> of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
physicians to to hook your other side of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.090 
physicians to to hook your other side of
your<00:02:16.630> wrist<00:02:16.840> wrapped<00:02:17.080> on<00:02:17.260> since<00:02:17.560> my<00:02:17.680> wrist<00:02:17.950> is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
your wrist wrapped on since my wrist is

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.470 
your wrist wrapped on since my wrist is
somewhat<00:02:18.520> small<00:02:18.850> even<00:02:19.150> though<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.300> looks

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
somewhat small even though it looks

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.390 
somewhat small even though it looks
humongous<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.110> video<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.100> lot<00:02:21.370> of

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
humongous in this video I have a lot of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.030 
humongous in this video I have a lot of
extra<00:02:21.850> strap<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:22.959> just<00:02:23.620> one<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.520> these<00:02:24.880> little

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
extra strap so just one of these little

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.650 
extra strap so just one of these little
flanges<00:02:27.040> wasn't<00:02:27.550> able<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.850> do<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.330> me<00:02:28.450> so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
flanges wasn't able to do it for me so

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.390 
flanges wasn't able to do it for me so
this<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.410> actually<00:02:29.800> really<00:02:29.830> nice<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.459> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
this this is actually really nice I the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.860 
this this is actually really nice I the
buckle<00:02:33.400> here<00:02:33.670> actually<00:02:33.940> feels<00:02:34.420> a<00:02:34.569> little<00:02:34.600> bit

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
buckle here actually feels a little bit

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.080 
buckle here actually feels a little bit
more<00:02:34.989> plasticky<00:02:35.680> than<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.950> original<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.670> I'm

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
more plasticky than the original and I'm

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.670 
more plasticky than the original and I'm
really<00:02:37.360> hoping<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:38.050> not<00:02:38.230> actual

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
really hoping that it's not actual

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.620 
really hoping that it's not actual
plastic<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.340> mean<00:02:39.520> it<00:02:39.670> doesn't<00:02:39.940> feel<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.239> it's

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
plastic I mean it doesn't feel like it's

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.900 
plastic I mean it doesn't feel like it's
gonna<00:02:40.810> break<00:02:41.110> on<00:02:41.319> me<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:41.590> as<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.860> squeeze<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.430> so

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
gonna break on me and as I squeeze it so

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.150 
gonna break on me and as I squeeze it so
I<00:02:42.940> believe<00:02:43.510> it<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.230> very<00:02:45.450> very<00:02:46.450> lightweight

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
I believe it is a very very lightweight

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.979 
I believe it is a very very lightweight
metal<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.459> I'm<00:02:48.910> hoping<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.480> that's<00:02:49.630> going<00:02:49.870> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
metal so I'm hoping that that's going to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.930 
metal so I'm hoping that that's going to
you<00:02:50.709> know<00:02:50.830> withstand<00:02:51.340> some<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.580> the<00:02:51.640> stuff<00:02:51.820> but

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
you know withstand some of the stuff but

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.040 
you know withstand some of the stuff but
I<00:02:52.000> am<00:02:52.180> looking<00:02:52.540> into<00:02:52.780> getting<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.820> leather
