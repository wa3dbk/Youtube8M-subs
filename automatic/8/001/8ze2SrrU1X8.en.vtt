seventy-five<00:00:19.330> thousand<00:00:19.990> both<00:00:20.320> direction

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.380 

together

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.929 

we'll<00:00:27.599> remove<00:00:27.930> that

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
we'll remove that

00:00:28.939 --> 00:01:09.340 
we'll remove that
in<00:00:29.300> our<00:00:29.419> crazy

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.620 

one<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.620> things<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.100> didn't<00:01:11.400> talk<00:01:11.550> about

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
one of the things we didn't talk about

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:22.430 
one of the things we didn't talk about
was<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:15.750> tubing<00:01:16.910> it<00:01:17.910> has<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> welded<00:01:18.840> seam<00:01:21.440> you

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
was on tubing it has a welded seam you

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.010 
was on tubing it has a welded seam you
never<00:01:22.740> want<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.190> place<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.760> welded<00:01:24.180> seam<00:01:24.510> on<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
never want to place the welded seam on a

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.060 
never want to place the welded seam on a
register<00:01:25.740> area<00:01:26.120> which<00:01:27.120> is<00:01:27.480> either<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.770> top<00:01:29.040> or

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
register area which is either the top or

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.590 
register area which is either the top or
the<00:01:29.570> side<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:31.700> t-square<00:01:34.040> registers<00:01:35.040> on

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
the side that the t-square registers on

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.560 
the side that the t-square registers on
they<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.870> wavy<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:38.070> straight<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.540> a

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
they can be wavy not straight and have a

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.460 
they can be wavy not straight and have a
lot<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> different<00:01:40.440> issues<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> always<00:01:42.930> use

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
lot of different issues so always use

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.650 
lot of different issues so always use
that<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.040> bottom<00:01:44.670> or<00:01:44.850> away<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.450> where

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
that on the bottom or away from where

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.310 
that on the bottom or away from where
you're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.440> be<00:01:47.450> trying<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.780> use<00:01:48.990> your

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
you're going to be trying to use your

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.380 
you're going to be trying to use your
fence<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.320> tap<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.979> holes<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.300> our

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
fence we have to tap the holes in our

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.600 
fence we have to tap the holes in our
tube<00:01:54.690> now<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.380> we<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> both<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.130> down<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
tube now so we can both it down to the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.359 
tube now so we can both it down to the
angle<00:01:57.560> to<00:01:58.560> do<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
angle to do that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.550 
angle to do that
freehand<00:01:59.940> tapping<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:01.700> dangerous<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.880> best<00:02:03.560> if

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
freehand tapping is dangerous at best if

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.670 
freehand tapping is dangerous at best if
a<00:02:04.890> tap<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.580> so<00:02:05.790> brittle<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.930> move

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
a tap is so brittle that if move

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.300 
a tap is so brittle that if move
sideways<00:02:08.070> at<00:02:08.610> all<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.600> snap<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.100> best

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
sideways at all it will snap so the best

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.949 
sideways at all it will snap so the best
thing<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.610> do<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:14.430> one<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.730> these<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.660> a

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
thing to do is get one of these it's a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.580 
thing to do is get one of these it's a
tabletop<00:02:16.940> tapper<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.810> holds<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> tap

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
tabletop tapper it holds the tap

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.100 
tabletop tapper it holds the tap
straight<00:02:20.040> there's<00:02:20.550> no<00:02:20.760> side<00:02:21.060> forces<00:02:21.510> put<00:02:21.900> on

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
straight there's no side forces put on

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
straight there's no side forces put on
it<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:23.060> makes<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.269> job<00:02:24.299> much<00:02:24.870> easier<00:02:26.030> this

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
it so it makes the job much easier this

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.920 
it so it makes the job much easier this
is<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.330> quarter<00:02:27.780> twenty<00:02:27.989> tap<00:02:29.420> we<00:02:30.420> want<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.750> put<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
is a quarter twenty tap we want to put a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:44.770 
is a quarter twenty tap we want to put a
little<00:02:31.140> oil<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:35.030> start<00:02:36.440> come<00:02:37.440> back

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.460 

then<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.650> have<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> tapped<00:02:46.280> hole<00:02:50.110> move<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.380> our

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
then you have a tapped hole move to our

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:17.370 
then you have a tapped hole move to our
next<00:02:51.709> one

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.320 

it's<00:03:18.380> also<00:03:18.530> very<00:03:18.920> important<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.700> make<00:03:20.060> sure

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
it's also very important to make sure

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.770 
it's also very important to make sure
that<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.750> get<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.820> hole<00:03:22.820> right<00:03:23.300> underneath

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
that you get the hole right underneath

00:03:23.780 --> 00:04:25.480 
that you get the hole right underneath
the<00:03:24.110> tab

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.480 

I<00:04:28.479> used<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:29.660> tap<00:04:29.930> holes<00:04:30.319> quite<00:04:30.800> a<00:04:30.830> bit<00:04:32.410> freehand

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
I used to tap holes quite a bit freehand

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.890 
I used to tap holes quite a bit freehand
and<00:04:35.740> snapped<00:04:36.740> a<00:04:37.069> few<00:04:37.849> taps<00:04:38.150> off

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
and snapped a few taps off

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.129 
and snapped a few taps off
I<00:04:39.280> bought<00:04:40.280> this<00:04:40.520> hand<00:04:40.880> tapper<00:04:41.419> several<00:04:41.870> years

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
I bought this hand tapper several years

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.270 
I bought this hand tapper several years
ago<00:04:42.349> and<00:04:43.160> haven't<00:04:43.729> busted<00:04:43.970> a<00:04:44.270> tap<00:04:44.509> since<00:04:44.930> then

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
ago and haven't busted a tap since then

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.930 
ago and haven't busted a tap since then
yet<00:04:46.419> it's<00:04:47.419> really<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.990> only<00:04:48.139> way<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.440> do<00:04:48.710> this

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
yet it's really the only way to do this

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.790 
yet it's really the only way to do this
they're<00:04:49.940> not<00:04:49.970> that<00:04:50.449> expensive<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:51.410> was

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.629 

around<00:04:54.970> $75<00:04:55.970> as<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.300> remembered<00:04:56.900> and<00:04:57.159> have<00:04:58.159> all

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
around $75 as I remembered and have all

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.240 
around $75 as I remembered and have all
the<00:04:58.849> tap<00:04:59.060> holders<00:04:59.539> with<00:04:59.840> it<00:05:01.720> which<00:05:02.720> is<00:05:03.250> another

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
the tap holders with it which is another

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:22.420 
the tap holders with it which is another
plus

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.550 

and<00:05:23.430> that's<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:23.910> way<00:05:24.030> we<00:05:24.210> do<00:05:24.360> it<00:05:24.540> it<00:05:25.320> works

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
and that's the way we do it it works

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.860 
and that's the way we do it it works
well
