presets<00:00:19.640> you<00:00:20.640> know<00:00:20.760> because<00:00:21.330> really<00:00:21.630> the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
presets you know because really the

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
presets you know because really the
thing<00:00:22.140> with<00:00:22.289> presets<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.039> they<00:00:23.519> are<00:00:23.699> simply<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
thing with presets is they are simply a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.230 
thing with presets is they are simply a
tool<00:00:24.390> they're<00:00:24.689> simply<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.050> starting<00:00:25.470> point<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
tool they're simply a starting point and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.000 
tool they're simply a starting point and
although<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.599> certainly<00:00:28.170> other<00:00:28.439> place<00:00:28.769> and

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
although they certainly other place and

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.450 
although they certainly other place and
I've<00:00:29.099> used<00:00:29.400> them<00:00:29.640> for<00:00:29.699> years<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:31.460> depending

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
I've used them for years now depending

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.010 
I've used them for years now depending
if<00:00:32.610> you're<00:00:32.790> shooting<00:00:33.059> style<00:00:33.510> may<00:00:33.690> change

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
if you're shooting style may change

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.370 
if you're shooting style may change
maybe<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:34.860> purchase<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.579> presets

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
maybe you actually purchase some presets

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.450 
maybe you actually purchase some presets
it's<00:00:37.380> impossible<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.399> presets<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.390> work

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
it's impossible for presets to work

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.190 
it's impossible for presets to work
perfectly<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:42.030> everyone<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.719> simply

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
perfectly for everyone because simply

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.830 
perfectly for everyone because simply
everyone<00:00:43.770> has<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.250> different<00:00:44.910> starting<00:00:45.450> point

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
everyone has a different starting point

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
everyone has a different starting point
so<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.649> makes<00:00:46.860> sense<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:47.399> now

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so that all makes sense right now now

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
so that all makes sense right now now
what<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.780> show<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> though<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> how

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
what I want to show you though is how

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.560 
what I want to show you though is how
you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.850> starting<00:00:51.539> point

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
you can take that starting point

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
you can take that starting point
especially<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.590> are<00:00:52.620> purchased<00:00:53.219> presets

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
especially if they are purchased presets

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.689 
especially if they are purchased presets
or<00:00:53.820> freebies<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.510> whatever<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.949> adapt

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
or freebies or whatever and really adapt

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.360 
or freebies or whatever and really adapt
them<00:00:57.030> easily<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.410> own<00:00:58.590> shooting<00:00:59.100> style

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
them easily to your own shooting style

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.130 
them easily to your own shooting style
so<00:00:59.789> then<00:01:00.000> they<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:00.750> become

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so then they are then they become

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.939 
so then they are then they become
perfect<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:03.080> it's<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.530> really

and that's the whole point but um let's
say<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> let's<00:01:46.170> pretend<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> wanted

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979

example you know what happens I think a

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.520 
example you know what happens I think a
lot<00:02:34.079> of<00:02:34.260> times<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:35.780> let's<00:02:36.780> go<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.049> reset<00:02:37.379> this

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
lot of times is let's go and reset this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.000 
lot of times is let's go and reset this
again<00:02:37.829> so<00:02:38.790> let's<00:02:39.000> pretend<00:02:39.389> that<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.780> is<00:02:40.019> your

hit the crisping Claire and you and for
you<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.489> it's<00:02:48.329> too<00:02:48.540> let's<00:02:49.319> pretend

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
it started like this right so it's way

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:55.399

collection<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:53.060> let's<00:03:54.060> pretend<00:03:54.720> that<00:03:54.959> we

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
collection and let's pretend that we

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.629 
collection and let's pretend that we
wanted<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.739> work<00:03:56.519> on<00:03:56.759> the<00:03:57.060> teeth<00:03:57.540> whitening<00:03:57.959> it

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.160 

okay<00:04:06.890> so<00:04:07.670> let's<00:04:08.330> pretend<00:04:08.840> that<00:04:10.840> this<00:04:11.840> teeth

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
okay so let's pretend that this teeth

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.250 
okay so let's pretend that this teeth
whitening<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.420> know<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:14.599> got<00:04:14.840> some<00:04:15.050> of<00:04:15.140> her

whitening and I know I got some of her
lips<00:04:16.900> just<00:04:17.900> part<00:04:18.260> of<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.410> example<00:04:19.130> here<00:04:19.519> so

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
lips just part of the example here so

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.370 
lips just part of the example here so
let's<00:04:20.720> erase<00:04:21.019> that<00:04:21.290> off<00:04:22.180> ok<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.169> teeth
