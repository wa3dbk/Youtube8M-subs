be<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.390> bug<00:00:27.810> update<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.260> they<00:00:28.410> are<00:00:28.529> working

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
be a bug update because they are working

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.040 
be a bug update because they are working
on<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> bug<00:00:29.250> now<00:00:29.400> they<00:00:29.609> count<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> tu<00:00:30.599> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
on a bug now they count that as a tu and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.479 
on a bug now they count that as a tu and
I<00:00:31.170> guess<00:00:31.349> that's<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.279> next

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
I guess that's going to be the the next

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.709 
I guess that's going to be the the next
updates<00:00:32.759> on<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:32.910> bug<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.360> then<00:00:33.450> after<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719

what<00:00:33.960> is<00:00:34.140> coming<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.710> tu<00:00:35.070> 21<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:35.910> that's<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
what is coming in tu 21 now that's the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880 
what is coming in tu 21 now that's the
question<00:00:36.450> everybody's<00:00:37.079> asking<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.590> mean<00:00:37.620> like

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
question everybody's asking I mean like

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.830 
question everybody's asking I mean like
you<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.879> could<00:00:39.120> guess<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.660> stuff

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you know you could guess and all stuff

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.139 
you know you could guess and all stuff
but<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.469> as<00:00:40.710> my<00:00:41.010> guess<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.820> thinking

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but you know as my guess I'm thinking

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
but you know as my guess I'm thinking
command<00:00:42.480> blocks<00:00:42.690> man<00:00:42.989> blocks<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.469> maybe<00:00:43.770> if

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
command blocks man blocks and maybe if

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.410 
command blocks man blocks and maybe if
we're<00:00:44.129> lucky<00:00:44.190> we're<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:44.579> get<00:00:44.760> some<00:00:45.000> color

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
we're lucky we're gonna get some color

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.850 
we're lucky we're gonna get some color

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
command like that you know like it's few

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
command like that you know like it's few
basically<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> pc<00:01:03.270> version<00:01:03.600> it'll<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
basically on a pc version it'll be a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
basically on a pc version it'll be a
command<00:01:04.439> back<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.769> early<00:01:05.100> version<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
command back on an early version that it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070 
command back on an early version that it
would<00:01:05.729> be<00:01:05.820> from<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> pc<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:06.750> it'll<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:06.990> an

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
would be from the pc but it'll be an

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
would be from the pc but it'll be an
early<00:01:07.200> version<00:01:07.470> version<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.220> command<00:01:08.520> blocks

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
early version version of command blocks

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.490 
early version version of command blocks
now<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.689> difficult<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
now not so difficult it will have the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
now not so difficult it will have the
basic<00:01:10.950> options<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> teleport<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
basic options of teleport this and that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.289 
basic options of teleport this and that
this<00:01:13.080> net<00:01:13.350> i<00:01:13.380> mean<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.890> daylight<00:01:14.299> sensor

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
this net i mean like daylight sensor

this net i mean like daylight sensor
daylight<00:01:15.869> change<00:01:16.170> maybe<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.280> know<00:01:17.400> so

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
daylight change maybe or you know so

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.490 
daylight change maybe or you know so
forth<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.000> all<00:01:18.180> stuff<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.110> stuff<00:01:19.320> not
