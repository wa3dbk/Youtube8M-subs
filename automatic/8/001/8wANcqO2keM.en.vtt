this<00:00:08.820> machine<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.360> very<00:00:09.420> easy<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.469> maintain

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
this machine is very easy to maintain

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.740 
this machine is very easy to maintain
troubleshooting<00:00:12.120> can<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> little<00:00:12.630> bit

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
troubleshooting can be a little bit

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.810 
troubleshooting can be a little bit
harder<00:00:13.080> based<00:00:13.440> on<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> fact<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.250> most<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
harder based on the fact that most of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.150 
harder based on the fact that most of
the<00:00:14.940> clogged<00:00:15.210> points<00:00:15.660> are<00:00:15.809> hidden<00:00:16.320> away<00:00:16.410> but

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the clogged points are hidden away but

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.560 
the clogged points are hidden away but
don't<00:00:17.369> worry<00:00:17.520> we<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.029> make<00:00:18.180> sure<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.449> this

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
don't worry we can make sure that this

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.240 
don't worry we can make sure that this
machine<00:00:18.960> stays<00:00:19.320> great<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:19.949> if<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.130> have

machine stays great and if you have

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.090 
machine stays great and if you have
problems<00:00:20.670> we<00:00:21.119> can<00:00:21.240> get<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.510> fixed<00:00:21.920> so<00:00:22.920> let's

go now let's talk about troubleshooting
troubleshooting<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> machine<00:01:34.220> sort<00:01:35.220> of

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
troubleshooting on this machine sort of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.050 
troubleshooting on this machine sort of
get<00:01:35.490> started

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
get started

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.170 
get started
first<00:01:36.479> let's<00:01:37.020> start<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> top<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
first let's start at the top now if you

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.539 
first let's start at the top now if you
can<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.509> here<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.470> machine<00:01:40.860> has<00:01:41.100> separate

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
can see here this machine has separate

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.249 
can see here this machine has separate
buttons<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> power<00:01:42.450> switch<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.140> the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
something and push through the clog the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.770 
something and push through the clog the
easiest<00:03:09.100> way<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:10.210> with<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.480> broom

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
easiest way to do this is with a broom

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.020 
easiest way to do this is with a broom
handle<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:11.320> start<00:03:11.620> at<00:03:11.710> one<00:03:11.740> end<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.220> push<00:03:12.910> it

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
handle just start at one end and push it

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.370 
handle just start at one end and push it
all<00:03:13.150> the<00:03:13.180> way<00:03:13.270> through<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.990> clog<00:03:14.230> will

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
all the way through and the clog will

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.920 
all the way through and the clog will
come<00:03:14.560> out<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.830> other<00:03:14.980> end<00:03:15.630> when<00:03:16.630> you're<00:03:16.780> done

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
come out the other end when you're done

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.400 
come out the other end when you're done
with<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:19.150> put<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> hose<00:03:19.810> right<00:03:20.200> back

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
with that just put the hose right back

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.020 
with that just put the hose right back
in<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.600> is<00:03:22.780> notched<00:03:23.290> with<00:03:24.040> different

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
in and it is notched with different

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.420 
in and it is notched with different
sized<00:03:25.270> notches<00:03:26.200> so<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.470> will<00:03:26.590> only<00:03:26.770> go<00:03:27.100> one<00:03:27.400> way

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
sized notches so it will only go one way

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.810 
sized notches so it will only go one way
so<00:03:28.420> if<00:03:28.480> it's<00:03:28.600> not<00:03:28.720> going<00:03:29.080> in<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.260> first<00:03:29.470> way

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
so if it's not going in the first way

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.390 
so if it's not going in the first way
try<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.930> again<00:03:31.930> by<00:03:32.110> flipping<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.650> over<00:03:32.740> 180

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
try it again by flipping it over 180

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.630 
try it again by flipping it over 180
degrees<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:35.170> there<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.470> go<00:03:36.600> next<00:03:38.610> make<00:03:39.610> sure

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
degrees and there you go next make sure

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.940 
degrees and there you go next make sure

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
nothing right here and try pulling out

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.600 
nothing right here and try pulling out
this<00:03:49.390> filter<00:03:49.860> sometimes<00:03:50.860> things<00:03:51.250> will<00:03:51.430> get

a little bit of suction but it just
