00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello I'm julia and now welcome to be 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.480
 woman today I want to give you some tips milestones 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.389
 so that your trip by plane is 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.650
 unforgettable I know that some know 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.410
 but others I know that they are going to do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.780
 very much the first always carries a 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.480
 puppy a vacated thermos because 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 when you go to do the customs normally 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.710
 makes you find everything you are 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
 carrying base liquid like that and in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.789
 almost all the knowledge points except 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.769
 Water successes where they can be good 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.480
 where you can come back to your term 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.890
 and always have fresh water with you in 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.890
 airlines to the water then then 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.410
 always keep small samples 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.750
 that they give you because you can 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.230
 carry your luggage in your trip 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.540
 by the by the size it is possible to pass them 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.310
 and it's always delicious to be cool to carry 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.710
 a wet wipe to clean the 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.720
 face a toothpaste with brushing the 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.610
 teeth before landing a bear 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.500
 a creampie that refreshes you and makes you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.590
 feel free does not always carry a Band-Aid 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.170
 very light or a page because you're going to 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.050
 normally need the planes you get 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.600
 a rich little blanket but sometimes not 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.820
 there are some times you do not get two and I 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.340
 I do something that is very funny to heal from 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.530
 me but I hate people when they 're 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.570
 asleep and open your mouth I think 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.150
 very funny then what I do 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.690
 so that it does not happen to me that is that I stop 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.430
 in this way and I stay in life like this 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.110
 that air conditioning does not make me 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.240
 damage and if I open my mouth when I 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.240
 asleep nobody 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.310
 just arrive at an airport 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 identify what is the free wifi and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.500
 always I have an extra battery because 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.780
 you never know if normally those 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.939
 contact lenses just for the trip 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.310
 forgotten for because to refresh 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.289
 have planes made difficult if you 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.619
 it arrives that one is going to be very complicated 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.630
 then forget the aesthetics that you 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.399
 gives contact lenses and australia 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.219
 remember that in the air conditioning 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.170
 of the plane reserves a lot of eyes and 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.269
 base that have annoyance that are much 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.190
 more tired then they prefer their 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.019
 glasses always remember to take your 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.690
 own snacks in some opportunities 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.510
 even though you've asked for the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.000
 vegetarian menu is not available or it 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.860
 you forget it's the worst thing in the world when you 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.080
 you are vegetarian just follow you with 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.580
 pork ham sandwich 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.860
 then remember to always carry your 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.370
 own little things a way to release 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.040
 space in your suitcase is that you carry what 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.590
 heavier opposite is to say 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.140
 jim if you have big boots and maybe 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.080
 you bought a very short jacket very 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.060
 powerful it does not matter if you have two or 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.430
 three times when you're on the plane 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.230
 the fifth is already always leads us is 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.799
 a very comfortable little suitcase where you go to 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.140
 charge your computer normally 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.849
 authorities makes you take them out and they 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.769
 they carry many more things there you go to 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.430
 carry then arrives at a suitcase very 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.319
 simple where only 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.209
 computer in such a way that when 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.219

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.280
 only that opens up they take it out and turned the 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.829

 They are very useful and also underwear 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.500
 because sometimes you have a trip or it happens 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.030
 some accident or you have to stay 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.709
