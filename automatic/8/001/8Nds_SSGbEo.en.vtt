the legs treble the cross body jab so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.640 
the legs treble the cross body jab so
you<00:03:08.580> name<00:03:08.820> this<00:03:09.000> move<00:03:09.180> thus<00:03:09.720> second<00:03:10.530> two

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
you name this move thus second two

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.320 
you name this move thus second two

variations as I show it border between
the<00:03:12.540> legs<00:03:12.690> let's<00:03:12.960> let<00:03:13.080> me<00:03:13.230> show<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.590> this

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
the legs let's let me show you in this

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.200 
the legs let's let me show you in this
it's<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.160> little<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.460> more<00:03:14.610> difficult<00:03:15.030> of<00:03:15.150> the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
it's a little bit more difficult of the

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.330 
it's a little bit more difficult of the
two<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.530> want<00:03:16.740> you<00:03:16.860> could<00:03:16.950> start<00:03:17.190> off

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
two but if you want you could start off

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.270 
two but if you want you could start off
by<00:03:17.490> learning<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.570> regular<00:03:18.930> one<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.920> regular

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
by learning the regular one the regular

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.560 
by learning the regular one the regular
one<00:03:20.460> basically<00:03:20.880> you're<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.180> gonna<00:03:21.270> come<00:03:21.480> in

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
one basically you're just gonna come in

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.270 
one basically you're just gonna come in
front<00:03:21.720> instead<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.110> crossing<00:03:22.350> over<00:03:22.650> with<00:03:22.920> to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
front instead of crossing over with to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.010 
front instead of crossing over with to
the<00:03:23.400> other<00:03:23.520> hand<00:03:23.790> you're<00:03:24.540> gonna<00:03:24.660> do<00:03:24.840> like<00:03:24.960> a

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
the other hand you're gonna do like a

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.990 
the other hand you're gonna do like a
crossover<00:03:25.500> but<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.130> same<00:03:26.370> hands<00:03:26.610> gonna<00:03:26.820> come

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
crossover but that same hands gonna come

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.250 
crossover but that same hands gonna come
back<00:03:27.120> over<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.420> top<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.840> Sham<00:03:28.050> guide

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
back over the top of the Sham guide

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.500 
back over the top of the Sham guide
motion<00:03:28.680> across<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.460> body<00:03:29.580> kind<00:03:30.240> of<00:03:30.330> in<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
motion across your body kind of in a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.300 
motion across your body kind of in a
weird<00:03:30.630> twisting<00:03:31.170> motion<00:03:31.470> here<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:32.070> pull<00:03:32.220> the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
weird twisting motion here and pull the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.720 
weird twisting motion here and pull the
ball<00:03:32.400> back<00:03:32.460> to<00:03:32.940> do<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.960> between<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.320> legs

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
ball back to do it between the legs

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.410 
ball back to do it between the legs
makes<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:35.910> little<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.150> difficult

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
makes it a little more difficult

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.570 
makes it a little more difficult
especially<00:03:37.260> if<00:03:37.770> you're<00:03:37.920> doing<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.280> dribble

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
especially if you're doing that dribble

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.730 
especially if you're doing that dribble
and<00:03:39.120> pulling<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.540> back<00:03:39.570> towards<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.290> opposite

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
and pulling it back towards the opposite

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.530 
and pulling it back towards the opposite
side<00:03:40.950> like<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.400> should<00:03:41.670> if<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.180> do<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.420> this

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
side like you should if you do it this

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.200 
side like you should if you do it this
way<00:03:42.740> more<00:03:43.740> to<00:03:43.830> the<00:03:43.950> side<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.030> little

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
way more to the side it's a little

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.570 
way more to the side it's a little
easier<00:03:45.570> it's<00:03:46.230> pulling<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.710> ball<00:03:46.830> back<00:03:47.280> more

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
easier it's pulling the ball back more

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.490 
easier it's pulling the ball back more
back<00:03:47.820> towards<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.210> left<00:03:48.810> leg<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> left

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
back and that's kind of throw defender

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.990 
back and that's kind of throw defender
for<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.270> loop<00:04:23.420> a<00:04:23.510> little<00:04:23.630> bit<00:04:24.820> like<00:04:25.820> coming

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
for a loop a little bit like coming

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.310 
for a loop a little bit like coming
forward<00:04:26.480> like<00:04:26.510> this<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:26.750> pulling<00:04:27.080> the<00:04:27.200> ball
