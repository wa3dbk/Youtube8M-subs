industry and in building high quality
precision<00:01:34.750> boats<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.530> starts<00:01:35.950> with<00:01:36.250> the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
precision boats it starts with the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.430 
precision boats it starts with the
quality<00:01:36.910> of<00:01:37.000> tooling<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.450> you<00:01:37.570> have<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.259> the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
quality of tooling that you have and the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.490 
quality of tooling that you have and the
better<00:01:38.649> tool<00:01:39.009> that<00:01:39.910> has<00:01:40.149> very<00:01:40.899> few<00:01:41.200> or<00:01:41.380> no

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
better tool that has very few or no

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.560 
better tool that has very few or no
ripples<00:01:41.920> or<00:01:42.039> imperfections<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.940> is<00:01:43.300> very

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
ripples or imperfections and is very

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.480 
ripples or imperfections and is very
closely<00:01:43.869> tolerance<00:01:44.470> at<00:01:44.619> all<00:01:44.740> measurements<00:01:45.340> is

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
closely tolerance at all measurements is

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.910 
closely tolerance at all measurements is
going<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.759> build<00:01:45.910> you<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.090> better<00:01:46.300> product<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
going to build you a better product and

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.560 
going to build you a better product and
we<00:01:48.100> want<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.369> point<00:01:48.580> out<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.210> our<00:01:49.330> shop

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
we want to point out that in our shop

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.320 
we want to point out that in our shop
here<00:01:49.840> we<00:01:49.990> have<00:01:50.110> very<00:01:50.619> few<00:01:51.130> white<00:01:51.610> boats<00:01:52.000> we<00:01:52.240> are

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
here we have very few white boats we are

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.999 
here we have very few white boats we are
one<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.539> few<00:01:52.810> builders<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.289> build<00:01:53.709> with

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
one of the few builders that build with

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.389 
one of the few builders that build with
Joe<00:01:54.849> code<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.360> we<00:01:56.229> will<00:01:56.440> do<00:01:56.560> colored<00:01:56.950> gel<00:01:57.160> code

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
Joe code and we will do colored gel code

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.130 
Joe code and we will do colored gel code
and<00:01:57.759> that<00:01:57.940> reason<00:01:58.149> is<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.509> because<00:01:58.539> we<00:01:58.959> use<00:01:59.110> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
and that reason is is because we use a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.650 
and that reason is is because we use a
very<00:01:59.440> high<00:01:59.530> quality<00:01:59.830> gel<00:02:00.550> coat<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:01.270> costs

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
very high quality gel coat it costs

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.540 
very high quality gel coat it costs
about<00:02:01.750> twice<00:02:02.200> as<00:02:02.410> much<00:02:02.560> as<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:02.800> normal<00:02:02.950> gel<00:02:03.310> code

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
about twice as much as a normal gel code

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.520 
about twice as much as a normal gel code
and<00:02:03.759> it<00:02:04.239> has<00:02:04.360> three<00:02:04.750> times<00:02:05.020> or<00:02:05.319> four<00:02:05.500> times

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
and it has three times or four times

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.070 
and it has three times or four times
more<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.369> UV<00:02:06.729> resistant<00:02:07.330> materials<00:02:07.840> in<00:02:07.959> it

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
more of the UV resistant materials in it

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.620 
more of the UV resistant materials in it
it's<00:02:08.649> a<00:02:08.860> hybrid<00:02:09.340> if<00:02:09.459> it's<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.670> part<00:02:10.149> urethane

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
it's a hybrid if it's a part urethane

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:23.250 
it's a hybrid if it's a part urethane
and<00:02:10.660> part<00:02:11.069> polyester

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
just don't have those we've gone to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.730 
just don't have those we've gone to
