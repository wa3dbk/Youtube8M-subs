underground near an active volcano but

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.150 
underground near an active volcano but
there<00:04:09.000> are<00:04:09.239> massive<00:04:09.810> power<00:04:09.989> spikes<00:04:10.379> unrelated

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
there are massive power spikes unrelated

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.000 
there are massive power spikes unrelated
to<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.340> magma<00:04:11.700> flow<00:04:11.900> if<00:04:12.900> there<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> source

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
to the magma flow if there is a source

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.219 
to the magma flow if there is a source
of<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.400> seismic<00:04:14.640> instability<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.720> should<00:04:16.049> be

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
of the seismic instability it should be

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.830 
of the seismic instability it should be
there<00:04:16.530> we<00:04:17.430> would<00:04:17.669> have<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:18.090> send<00:04:18.299> down<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.510> team

there we would have to send down a team
to<00:04:19.019> investigate<00:04:19.139> though<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.549> is<00:04:20.760> quite

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
to investigate though and it is quite

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.020 
to investigate though and it is quite
dangerous<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:22.100> wouldn't<00:04:23.100> send<00:04:23.280> anyone<00:04:23.820> down

that was here before them and you know
that<00:06:56.449> civilization<00:06:57.139> could<00:06:57.319> have<00:06:57.409> developed

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650 
that civilization could have developed

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.059 
that civilization could have developed
spaceflight<00:06:58.370> and<00:06:58.759> all<00:06:58.909> that<00:06:59.090> junk<00:06:59.330> and<00:07:00.069> what's

even<00:07:01.190> more<00:07:01.370> mysterious<00:07:01.789> than<00:07:02.030> that<00:07:02.210> is<00:07:02.539> that

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:02.750 
even more mysterious than that is that

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.330 
even more mysterious than that is that

there seemed to be another civilization
before<00:07:04.669> them<00:07:05.470> and<00:07:06.470> even<00:07:06.710> more<00:07:06.979> ancient<00:07:07.250> one

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:07.699 
before them and even more ancient one

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:11.260 
before them and even more ancient one
and<00:07:08.409> that<00:07:09.409> is<00:07:09.710> really<00:07:10.220> interesting<00:07:10.340> but<00:07:11.150> then

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
and that is really interesting but then

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.839 
and that is really interesting but then
something<00:07:11.720> happened<00:07:12.169> all<00:07:12.740> the<00:07:13.069> volcanoes<00:07:13.250> on

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:13.849 
something happened all the volcanoes on

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:16.240 
something happened all the volcanoes on
the<00:07:13.879> planet<00:07:14.030> erupted<00:07:14.930> they<00:07:15.500> all<00:07:15.650> had<00:07:15.889> to<00:07:16.039> leave

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
the planet erupted they all had to leave

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.589 
the planet erupted they all had to leave
or<00:07:16.520> do<00:07:16.639> whatever<00:07:16.940> and<00:07:17.419> the<00:07:18.259> planet<00:07:18.800> is<00:07:19.599> still

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 
or do whatever and the planet is still

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:22.899 
or do whatever and the planet is still
recovering<00:07:21.199> from<00:07:21.500> all<00:07:21.919> that<00:07:22.130> but<00:07:22.520> it<00:07:22.729> is

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:22.909 
recovering from all that but it is

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:26.350 
recovering from all that but it is
livable<00:07:23.690> now<00:07:24.130> so<00:07:25.130> a<00:07:25.159> very<00:07:25.490> interesting<00:07:25.580> past

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
livable now so a very interesting past

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.129 
livable now so a very interesting past
on<00:07:26.630> this<00:07:26.750> planet<00:07:27.229> and<00:07:28.360> very<00:07:29.360> very<00:07:29.599> cool<00:07:29.840> stuff

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.139 
on this planet and very very cool stuff

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:31.960 
on this planet and very very cool stuff
and<00:07:30.409> we're<00:07:30.770> going<00:07:30.949> to<00:07:31.039> find<00:07:31.280> out<00:07:31.490> all<00:07:31.520> those

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:31.970 
and we're going to find out all those

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:36.070 
and we're going to find out all those
secrets<00:07:33.849> literally<00:07:34.849> in<00:07:35.389> the<00:07:35.539> mission<00:07:35.870> that's

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
secrets literally in the mission that's

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.719 
secrets literally in the mission that's
called<00:07:36.319> secrets<00:07:36.770> of<00:07:36.889> the<00:07:37.009> Ancients<00:07:37.400> which<00:07:37.550> we

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:37.729 
called secrets of the Ancients which we

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:41.350 
called secrets of the Ancients which we
will<00:07:37.849> do<00:07:38.000> next<00:07:38.740> so<00:07:39.740> that<00:07:40.039> was<00:07:40.280> really<00:07:40.849> short

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 
will do next so that was really short

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.089 
will do next so that was really short
that<00:07:41.690> was<00:07:41.870> latest<00:07:42.259> findings<00:07:42.710> but<00:07:43.009> it

00:07:43.089 --> 00:07:43.099 
that was latest findings but it

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.070 
that was latest findings but it
basically<00:07:43.190> just<00:07:43.759> prepares<00:07:44.330> us<00:07:44.539> for<00:07:44.599> what

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 
basically just prepares us for what

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.649 
basically just prepares us for what
we're<00:07:45.229> about<00:07:45.259> to<00:07:45.680> hit<00:07:45.830> up<00:07:45.949> next<00:07:46.370> so<00:07:47.330> I'll<00:07:47.509> go

00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:47.659 
we're about to hit up next so I'll go

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:49.390 
we're about to hit up next so I'll go
ahead<00:07:47.960> I'll<00:07:48.110> stop<00:07:48.379> the<00:07:48.500> video<00:07:48.620> I<00:07:48.830> will<00:07:49.159> upload

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400 
ahead I'll stop the video I will upload

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.459 
ahead I'll stop the video I will upload
this<00:07:49.669> as<00:07:49.940> a<00:07:49.969> separate<00:07:50.300> video<00:07:50.449> because<00:07:50.870> it<00:07:51.020> is<00:07:51.169> a

00:07:51.459 --> 00:07:51.469 
this as a separate video because it is a

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:54.580 
this as a separate video because it is a
separate<00:07:52.009> tier<00:07:52.310> 4<00:07:52.580> mission<00:07:53.030> and<00:07:53.500> secrets<00:07:54.500> of

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.590 
separate tier 4 mission and secrets of

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.040 
separate tier 4 mission and secrets of
ancients<00:07:55.069> doesn't<00:07:55.490> unlock<00:07:55.759> until<00:07:56.180> tier<00:07:56.389> 5<00:07:56.659> so

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.050 
ancients doesn't unlock until tier 5 so

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.399 
ancients doesn't unlock until tier 5 so
I'll<00:07:57.560> make<00:07:57.710> a<00:07:57.740> new<00:07:57.979> video<00:07:58.130> just<00:07:58.849> for<00:07:59.090> that<00:07:59.210> one

00:07:59.399 --> 00:07:59.409 
I'll make a new video just for that one

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:03.010 
I'll make a new video just for that one
