tripod<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:22.420> while<00:03:22.600> holding<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.260> then

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
tripod like while holding it and then

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.830 
tripod like while holding it and then
one<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.860> legs<00:03:24.070> got<00:03:24.340> stuck<00:03:24.400> in<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.950> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
one of the legs got stuck in the in the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.860 
one of the legs got stuck in the in the
spokes<00:03:28.840> of<00:03:29.019> my<00:03:29.200> bike<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.709> then<00:03:30.540> they<00:03:31.540> broke

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
spokes of my bike and then they broke

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.180 
spokes of my bike and then they broke
one<00:03:32.140> of<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.350> lakes<00:03:32.560> because<00:03:32.830> its<00:03:32.980> carbon

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
one of the lakes because its carbon

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.729 
one of the lakes because its carbon
fiber<00:03:33.459> so<00:03:33.790> it's<00:03:33.910> not<00:03:34.030> that<00:03:34.090> strong<00:03:34.540> really<00:03:34.930> and

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
fiber so it's not that strong really and

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.820 
fiber so it's not that strong really and
it<00:03:36.400> snapped<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.000> so<00:03:37.239> I<00:03:37.269> have<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.570> baby<00:03:38.470> splint

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
it snapped it so I have a baby splint

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.910 
it snapped it so I have a baby splint
out<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.100> some<00:03:39.220> extra<00:03:39.519> spokes<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.180> I<00:03:40.920> guess

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
out of some extra spokes and I guess

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.710 
out of some extra spokes and I guess
it's<00:03:42.340> doing<00:03:42.610> fine<00:03:42.790> right<00:03:42.850> now<00:03:43.030> cuz<00:03:43.420> it's<00:03:43.570> hold

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
it's doing fine right now cuz it's hold

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.710 
it's doing fine right now cuz it's hold
up<00:03:44.910> don't<00:03:45.910> they<00:03:46.000> ever<00:03:46.030> meet<00:03:46.360> again<00:03:46.390> your

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720
