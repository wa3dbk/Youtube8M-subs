00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
this would also apply to using weight

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.370 
this would also apply to using weight
training<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.750> fat<00:01:30.960> loss<00:01:31.110> goal

and it's not what you're trying to do
you're<00:02:15.629> trying<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:16.050> contract<00:02:16.650> your<00:02:16.890> muscle

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
you're trying to contract your muscle

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.350 
you're trying to contract your muscle
against<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.769> given<00:02:20.129> weight<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:21.239> you're

against the given weight that you're
lifting<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.930> curl<00:02:23.720> is<00:02:24.720> one<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.110> nice<00:02:25.290> easy

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
lifting a curl is one of the nice easy

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.979 
lifting a curl is one of the nice easy
wants<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:25.920> contemplate<00:02:26.220> or<00:02:26.670> push<00:02:26.849> down<00:02:27.120> pull

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
wants to contemplate or push down pull

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.080 
wants to contemplate or push down pull
down<00:02:28.260> your<00:02:28.830> compound<00:02:29.280> movements<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:29.819> press

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
down your compound movements of press

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.180 
down your compound movements of press
for<00:02:30.300> your<00:02:30.450> chest<00:02:30.750> what<00:02:31.500> are<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.650> trying<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.920> do

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
for your chest what are you trying to do

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.479 
for your chest what are you trying to do
you<00:02:32.700> are<00:02:32.880> basically<00:02:34.130> stretching<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
you are basically stretching and

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.820 
you are basically stretching and
squeezing<00:02:36.030> against<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> weight<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.800> are

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
squeezing against the weight you are

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.240 
squeezing against the weight you are
flexing<00:02:38.489> your<00:02:38.519> muscle<00:02:39.769> against<00:02:40.769> weight<00:02:41.010> so

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
flexing your muscle against weight so

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.160 
flexing your muscle against weight so
you're<00:02:41.430> using<00:02:42.060> load<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:45.180> enable<00:02:45.660> yourself<00:02:45.750> to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
you're using load to enable yourself to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.680 
you're using load to enable yourself to
get<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.319> harder<00:02:46.680> contraction<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.580> what<00:02:48.540> you're

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
get a harder contraction and what you're

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.350 
get a harder contraction and what you're
doing<00:02:48.989> stretch<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.620> squeeze<00:02:50.209> so<00:02:51.209> you're

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
doing stretch and squeeze so you're

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.569 
doing stretch and squeeze so you're
lengthening<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.170> muscle<00:02:52.530> if<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.220> a<00:02:53.310> strip

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
lengthening the muscle if it's a strip

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.759 
lengthening the muscle if it's a strip
if<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.940> press<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.720> as<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> come<00:02:55.590> up

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
if it's a press here and as you come up

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.800 
if it's a press here and as you come up
you<00:02:56.250> want<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.459> maximally<00:02:57.269> shorten<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> muscle

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
you want to maximally shorten the muscle

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.710 
you want to maximally shorten the muscle
it's<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.590> same<00:02:58.829> with<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.069> curl<00:02:59.400> all<00:03:00.390> the<00:03:00.599> way

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
it's the same with a curl all the way

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.199 
it's the same with a curl all the way
down<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:02.040> will<00:03:02.190> flex<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.459> triceps<00:03:02.970> at<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
down you will flex the triceps at the

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.550 
down you will flex the triceps at the
bottom<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.750> movement<00:03:03.900> because<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.410> want

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
bottom of the movement because you want

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.740 
bottom of the movement because you want
to<00:03:04.620> stretch<00:03:04.950> out<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.220> biceps<00:03:05.730> and<00:03:06.000> then<00:03:06.660> you

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
to stretch out the biceps and then you

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.000 
to stretch out the biceps and then you
would<00:03:06.870> come<00:03:07.049> all<00:03:07.430> the<00:03:08.430> way<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:10.319> maximally

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
would come all the way up to maximally

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.160 
would come all the way up to maximally
shorten<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.579> muscle<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.180> what<00:03:12.930> you're

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
shorten the muscle and what you're

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.339 
shorten the muscle and what you're
really<00:03:13.500> doing<00:03:14.180> you<00:03:15.180> got<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.599> get<00:03:15.780> out<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.200> this

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
really doing you got to get out of this

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.500 
really doing you got to get out of this

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.960 
properly make sure the dips aren't too
hard<00:05:58.800> because<00:05:59.009> if<00:05:59.220> the<00:05:59.520> weight<00:05:59.639> is<00:05:59.669> too<00:05:59.940> heavy

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
hard because if the weight is too heavy

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.270 
hard because if the weight is too heavy
and<00:06:00.330> it's<00:06:00.659> hard<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:01.080> get<00:06:01.229> that<00:06:01.380> neurological

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
and it's hard to get that neurological

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.450 
and it's hard to get that neurological
connection<00:06:02.639> until<00:06:02.789> you're<00:06:03.180> well<00:06:03.419> trained<00:06:04.460> go

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
connection until you're well trained go

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.390 
connection until you're well trained go
down<00:06:05.639> slowly<00:06:06.030> contract<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:07.080> triceps<00:06:07.199> then<00:06:08.190> do

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
down slowly contract the triceps then do

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.249 
down slowly contract the triceps then do

a rep where you do the same range of
motion<00:06:10.620> you<00:06:10.680> do<00:06:10.770> the<00:06:10.889> same<00:06:11.039> tempo<00:06:11.460> but<00:06:11.970> you're

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
motion you do the same tempo but you're

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.870 
motion you do the same tempo but you're
not<00:06:12.210> clean<00:06:12.690> you're<00:06:12.900> heading<00:06:13.110> to<00:06:13.199> triceps<00:06:13.880> it

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
not clean you're heading to triceps it

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.600 
not clean you're heading to triceps it
makes<00:06:15.330> a<00:06:15.479> huge<00:06:15.840> difference<00:06:16.099> it<00:06:17.099> makes<00:06:17.340> a<00:06:17.460> huge

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
makes a huge difference it makes a huge

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.950 
makes a huge difference it makes a huge
