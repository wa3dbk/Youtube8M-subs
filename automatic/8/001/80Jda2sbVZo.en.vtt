to<00:00:06.629> 5<00:00:06.899> life<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.589> without<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> flywheel<00:00:08.880> puller

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.810 

there's<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.440> I've<00:00:13.560> already<00:00:13.800> done<00:00:14.010> just<00:00:14.670> to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
there's one I've already done just to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.990 
there's one I've already done just to
make<00:00:14.850> sure<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.150> could<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:16.460> off<00:00:17.460> anyway

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
make sure I could do it off anyway

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.510 
make sure I could do it off anyway
so<00:00:18.750> pretty<00:00:19.350> much<00:00:19.550> you<00:00:20.550> take<00:00:20.820> off<00:00:21.030> top<00:00:21.420> nut

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
so pretty much you take off top nut

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.359 
so pretty much you take off top nut
there<00:00:23.520> wasn't<00:00:23.789> any<00:00:24.060> washes<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.660> under<00:00:25.050> mine

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
there wasn't any washes and under mine

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.800 
there wasn't any washes and under mine
so<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.760> don't<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.150> there'll<00:00:27.300> be<00:00:27.330> any<00:00:27.420> under

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so I don't think there'll be any under

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.700 
so I don't think there'll be any under
yours<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.550> then<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.910> do<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.440> a
