00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
well not too bad actually it's been

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.560 
well not too bad actually it's been
lovely<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.699> set<00:00:20.850> over<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> last<00:00:21.240> week<00:00:21.449> well

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
lovely and set over the last week well

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.519 
lovely and set over the last week well
and<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:21.840> because<00:00:22.140> we've<00:00:22.289> had<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and that's because we've had this

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.830 
and that's because we've had this
dominant<00:00:23.220> high<00:00:23.430> pressure<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.420> look<00:00:24.630> at<00:00:24.750> this

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
dominant high pressure but look at this

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.990 
dominant high pressure but look at this
low<00:00:25.019> pressure<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.070> Atlantic<00:00:26.580> now

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
low pressure in the Atlantic now

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.670 
low pressure in the Atlantic now
normally<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.539> would<00:00:27.810> swing<00:00:28.170> along<00:00:28.470> our

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
normally that would swing along our

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.470 
normally that would swing along our
shores<00:00:28.710> but<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:29.849> going<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.119> do<00:00:30.269> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
shores but what it's going to do is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.160 
shores but what it's going to do is
actually<00:00:31.019> move<00:00:31.590> steadily<00:00:32.309> northwards<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.570> for

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
actually move steadily northwards so for

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.780 
actually move steadily northwards so for
many<00:00:34.440> parts<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.920> Europe<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> looking
