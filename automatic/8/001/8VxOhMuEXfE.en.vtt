00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
space for the bee to move around in then

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.460 
space for the bee to move around in then
just<00:01:34.520> take<00:01:34.940> your<00:01:34.970> dotting<00:01:35.450> tool<00:01:35.690> or<00:01:35.930> pencil

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
and use it to shape the eye pin to make

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.870 
and use it to shape the eye pin to make
a<00:01:38.360> hook<00:01:38.600> type<00:01:38.900> shape<00:01:39.220> it's<00:01:40.220> kind<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.640> hard<00:01:40.820> to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
a hook type shape it's kind of hard to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.370 
a hook type shape it's kind of hard to
explain<00:01:41.030> but<00:01:41.450> all<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:41.690> have<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.930> do<00:01:42.080> is<00:01:42.200> just

hook

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.270 

you<00:01:53.869> just<00:01:54.110> need<00:01:54.289> to<00:01:54.410> make<00:01:54.560> four<00:01:54.830> or<00:01:54.920> five<00:01:55.100> of

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
you just need to make four or five of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.529 
you just need to make four or five of
these<00:01:55.369> depending<00:01:55.729> on<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.119> length<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.420> your

these depending on the length of your
hand<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:56.930> then<00:01:57.050> just<00:01:57.320> attach<00:01:57.470> them<00:01:57.890> together

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.800 

once<00:02:01.760> you've<00:02:01.970> attached<00:02:02.270> all<00:02:02.510> of<00:02:02.660> them

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
once you've attached all of them

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.060 
once you've attached all of them
together<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.350> should<00:02:03.500> look<00:02:03.620> something<00:02:03.890> like

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
together it should look something like

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.889 
together it should look something like
this<00:02:06.370> take<00:02:07.370> one<00:02:07.610> end<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:08.000> this<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.420> attach<00:02:08.720> it

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
this take one end of this and attach it

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.540 
this take one end of this and attach it
to<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.170> jump<00:02:09.380> ring<00:02:09.590> though<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.800> touch<00:02:10.130> to<00:02:10.429> do

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
to the jump ring though you touch to do

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.690 
to the jump ring though you touch to do
chain<00:02:10.789> before<00:02:14.620> use<00:02:15.620> your<00:02:15.830> tweezers<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.460> just

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
chain before use your tweezers to just

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.890 
chain before use your tweezers to just
close<00:02:16.880> everything<00:02:17.270> up<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.450> far<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.870> should

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
close everything up so far it should

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.510 
close everything up so far it should
look<00:02:21.170> something<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.250> we're

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
look something like this and we're

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.160 
look something like this and we're
almost<00:02:22.670> finished<00:02:23.000> just<00:02:23.360> one<00:02:23.540> more<00:02:23.690> step<00:02:23.930> left

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
almost finished just one more step left

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.530 
almost finished just one more step left
last<00:02:25.130> thing<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.490> do<00:02:25.640> is<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.940> make<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.240> bracelet

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
last thing to do is to make the bracelet

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.080 
last thing to do is to make the bracelet
part<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.920> take<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.400> chain<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.640> measure<00:02:28.940> it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
part so take the chain and measure it

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.699 
part so take the chain and measure it
around<00:02:29.330> your<00:02:29.570> wrist<00:02:29.720> make<00:02:30.200> sure<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.500> pretty

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
around your wrist make sure it's pretty

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.560 
around your wrist make sure it's pretty
tight<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.220> not<00:02:31.370> too<00:02:31.430> loose<00:02:31.640> as<00:02:32.180> we're<00:02:32.420> going

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
tight and not too loose as we're going

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.890 
tight and not too loose as we're going
to<00:02:32.720> add<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.020> hooks<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.590> jump<00:02:33.830> rings<00:02:34.900> cut

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
to add the hooks and the jump rings cut

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.340 
to add the hooks and the jump rings cut
off<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.200> excess<00:02:36.530> chain<00:02:36.800> using<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.310> pliers

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.930 

apply<00:02:44.350> one<00:02:44.560> jump<00:02:44.860> ring<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.100> both<00:02:45.400> ends<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.790> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
apply one jump ring to both ends of the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.840 
apply one jump ring to both ends of the
tune<00:02:46.210> but<00:02:46.240> only<00:02:46.600> apply<00:02:47.020> one<00:02:47.260> hook<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.710> one<00:02:47.890> end

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.950 

use<00:02:51.850> your<00:02:52.030> tweezers<00:02:52.240> to<00:02:52.600> make<00:02:52.750> sure

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
use your tweezers to make sure

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.260 
use your tweezers to make sure
everything's<00:02:53.440> securely<00:02:53.800> closed

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.770 

so<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.480> should<00:03:00.660> look<00:03:00.750> like<00:03:00.810> this<00:03:01.110> now<00:03:02.570> so<00:03:03.570> the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
so it should look like this now so the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.720 
so it should look like this now so the
last<00:03:03.960> thing<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.320> do<00:03:04.440> now<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.070> attach<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.550> jump

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
last thing to do now is to attach a jump

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.310 
last thing to do now is to attach a jump
ring<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.180> middle<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.750> chain<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.170> then

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
ring to the middle of the chain and then

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.790 
ring to the middle of the chain and then
attach<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.100> rest<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.580> bracelet

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.260 

use<00:03:13.800> your<00:03:13.980> tweezers<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.580> close<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.970> up<00:03:15.090> and

use your tweezers to close it up and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.120 
use your tweezers to close it up and
then<00:03:15.540> make<00:03:15.750> sure<00:03:15.780> everything<00:03:16.410> else<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.800> closed

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
then make sure everything else is closed

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.080 
then make sure everything else is closed
up<00:03:17.310> properly<00:03:17.640> as<00:03:17.850> well<00:03:19.670> once<00:03:20.670> you're<00:03:20.910> done<00:03:21.030> it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
up properly as well once you're done it

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.160 
up properly as well once you're done it
should<00:03:21.390> look<00:03:21.450> something<00:03:21.780> like<00:03:21.960> this<00:03:23.870> so<00:03:24.870> now

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
should look something like this so now

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.480 
should look something like this so now

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
I'm going to show you how I made this

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.530 
I'm going to show you how I made this
other<00:03:26.730> one<00:03:28.520> so<00:03:29.520> for<00:03:29.760> this<00:03:29.850> you<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.330> same

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
other one so for this you do the same

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.980 
other one so for this you do the same
thing<00:03:30.780> as<00:03:30.900> before<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.440> make<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.740> ring<00:03:31.890> pop

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 
thing as before to make the ring pop

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.480 
thing as before to make the ring pop
measure<00:03:33.990> it<00:03:34.200> around<00:03:34.500> your<00:03:34.709> middle<00:03:34.860> finger<00:03:35.310> and

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
measure it around your middle finger and

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:42.770 
measure it around your middle finger and
cut<00:03:35.670> off<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.970> excess<00:03:36.270> chain

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.180 

thread<00:03:43.780> both<00:03:44.020> ends<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.650> chain<00:03:44.680> through<00:03:45.160> a

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
thread both ends of the chain through a

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.510 
thread both ends of the chain through a
jump<00:03:45.490> ring

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
jump ring

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.170 
jump ring

[Music]

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.770 
[Music]
I<00:03:54.489> used<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.670> same<00:03:55.700> method<00:03:55.939> as<00:03:56.420> I<00:03:56.450> showed

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
I used the same method as I showed

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.550 
I used the same method as I showed
before<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:57.319> make<00:03:57.500> this<00:03:57.680> green<00:03:57.980> beaded<00:03:58.459> ITIN<00:03:59.560> so

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
before to make this green beaded ITIN so

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.080 
before to make this green beaded ITIN so
I<00:04:00.590> thought<00:04:01.040> it'd<00:04:01.189> that<00:04:01.340> through<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.819> jump

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
I thought it'd that through the jump

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.759 
I thought it'd that through the jump
ring<00:04:02.299> as<00:04:02.450> well<00:04:02.659> making<00:04:02.959> sure<00:04:03.109> it<00:04:03.409> wasn't<00:04:03.560> in

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
ring as well making sure it wasn't in

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.250 
ring as well making sure it wasn't in
between<00:04:04.189> the<00:04:04.310> two<00:04:04.519> chains<00:04:04.900> then<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:06.049> just

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
between the two chains then I just

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.750 
between the two chains then I just
closed<00:04:06.500> up<00:04:06.650> my<00:04:06.829> jump<00:04:07.069> ring<00:04:07.219> with<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.459> pair<00:04:07.730> of

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
closed up my jump ring with a pair of

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.569 
closed up my jump ring with a pair of
tweezers<00:04:08.079> and<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.980> should<00:04:10.189> look<00:04:10.280> something

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
tweezers and it should look something

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.349 
tweezers and it should look something
like<00:04:10.819> this

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
like this

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.770

I<00:04:12.159> already<00:04:13.159> attached<00:04:13.790> another<00:04:14.209> jump<00:04:14.540> ring<00:04:14.659> to

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
I already attached another jump ring to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.020 
I already attached another jump ring to
the<00:04:14.900> other<00:04:15.139> end<00:04:15.349> of<00:04:15.469> the<00:04:15.590> eye<00:04:15.620> pin<00:04:16.009> then<00:04:16.880> I

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
the other end of the eye pin then I

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.520 
the other end of the eye pin then I
threaded<00:04:17.299> one<00:04:17.539> end<00:04:17.780> of<00:04:17.900> the<00:04:18.079> chain<00:04:18.289> through

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
threaded one end of the chain through

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
the jump rings as you can see it took

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.900 
the jump rings as you can see it took
ages<00:04:21.049> to<00:04:21.079> do<00:04:21.410> because<00:04:22.190> it<00:04:22.370> was<00:04:22.460> one<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.759> those

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
ages to do because it was one of those

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.300 
ages to do because it was one of those
twisty<00:04:23.449> jump<00:04:23.750> rings<00:04:24.020> I<00:04:24.259> do<00:04:24.380> not<00:04:24.919> recommend

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
twisty jump rings I do not recommend

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.310 
twisty jump rings I do not recommend
these<00:04:25.639> just<00:04:26.120> use<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.479> other<00:04:26.660> type<00:04:26.960> of<00:04:26.990> ones

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
these just use the other type of ones

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.040 
these just use the other type of ones
they're<00:04:27.710> much<00:04:28.099> more<00:04:28.340> balanced<00:04:28.870> once<00:04:29.870> you're

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
they're much more balanced once you're

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.150 
they're much more balanced once you're
done<00:04:30.169> it<00:04:30.229> should<00:04:30.380> look<00:04:30.590> something<00:04:30.919> like<00:04:31.130> this

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
done it should look something like this

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.560 
done it should look something like this
measure<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.400> chain<00:04:34.639> down<00:04:34.849> to<00:04:35.060> your<00:04:35.210> wrist<00:04:35.389> and

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
measure the chain down to your wrist and

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.310 
measure the chain down to your wrist and
cut<00:04:35.750> off<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.020> excess

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320

so I already measured out a piece of

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.750 
rings and a hook to it then I attached a
jump<00:04:58.470> ring<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:58.980> bottom<00:04:59.280> of<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.520> chain

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
jump ring to the bottom of the chain

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.700 
jump ring to the bottom of the chain
that<00:04:59.940> I<00:05:00.000> already<00:05:00.210> cut<00:05:00.570> out<00:05:00.690> before<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.410> to<00:05:01.590> the

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
that I already cut out before and to the

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.180 
that I already cut out before and to the
middle<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.130> bracelet<00:05:03.620> once<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.770> close<00:05:04.950> up

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
middle of the bracelet once you close up

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.500 
middle of the bracelet once you close up
the<00:05:05.370> jump<00:05:05.580> ring<00:05:05.700> it<00:05:05.970> should<00:05:06.150> look<00:05:06.240> something

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
the jump ring it should look something

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.079 
the jump ring it should look something
like<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.960> so<00:05:07.020> far

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:13.089 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:15.639 

after<00:05:14.089> that<00:05:14.299> take<00:05:14.629> the<00:05:14.689> chain<00:05:15.079> and<00:05:15.109> measure<00:05:15.499> it

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:15.649 
after that take the chain and measure it

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.529 
after that take the chain and measure it
from<00:05:15.799> the<00:05:15.889> bead<00:05:16.159> to<00:05:16.399> the<00:05:16.489> bottom<00:05:16.789> of<00:05:16.939> bracelet

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
from the bead to the bottom of bracelet

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:26.000 
from the bead to the bottom of bracelet
it<00:05:17.899> should<00:05:18.499> form<00:05:18.739> a<00:05:18.859> triangle<00:05:19.099> type<00:05:19.549> of<00:05:19.729> shape

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.380 

then<00:05:27.010> just<00:05:27.220> cut<00:05:27.460> it<00:05:27.580> often<00:05:27.880> attached<00:05:28.180> it

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
then just cut it often attached it

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.200 
then just cut it often attached it
together
