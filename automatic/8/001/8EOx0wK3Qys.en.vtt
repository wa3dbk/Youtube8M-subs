the use of which craftsmen title anyway

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.569 
the use of which craftsmen title anyway
uh<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.469> randomly<00:02:05.159> while<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.490> were

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
uh I was just randomly while we were

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.679 
uh I was just randomly while we were
running<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> episode<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.180> still<00:02:06.390> needed<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
running the episode we still needed a

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.139 
running the episode we still needed a
title<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.649> was<00:02:07.829> just<00:02:08.099> sort<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.910> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
title and I was just sort of like I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.460 
title and I was just sort of like I
thought<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.420> would<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:09.690> funny<00:02:10.020> if<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.349> was

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
thought it would be funny if it was

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.080 
thought it would be funny if it was
friendship<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.979> witchcraft<00:02:11.160> because<00:02:11.910> that's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
friendship is witchcraft because that's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.160 
friendship is witchcraft because that's
like<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
like in it

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.690 
like in it
it<00:02:13.380> kind<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> goes<00:02:13.740> back<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.099> us<00:02:14.190> being<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.490> weird

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
it kind of goes back to us being a weird

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.449 
it kind of goes back to us being a weird
surrealist<00:02:15.090> alternate<00:02:15.810> reality<00:02:16.530> thing<00:02:16.770> like

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
surrealist alternate reality thing like

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.430 
surrealist alternate reality thing like
it<00:02:17.790> means<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.360> same<00:02:18.540> thing<00:02:18.599> as<00:02:18.810> friendship<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
it means the same thing as friendship is

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.949 
it means the same thing as friendship is
magic<00:02:19.860> but<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:20.610> wouldn't<00:02:20.880> call<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.180> kids<00:02:21.569> show

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that because it's strange and it would

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.330 
that because it's strange and it would
put<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> pair's<00:02:24.599> off<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.959> little<00:02:25.319> like<00:02:25.920> it's

put the pair's off a little like it's

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.850 
put the pair's off a little like it's
not<00:02:26.489> overtly<00:02:26.970> bad<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:27.900> if<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.380> heard<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.709> as<00:02:28.830> a
