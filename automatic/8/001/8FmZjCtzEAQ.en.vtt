00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:05.299 
this evening I'm doing a quick review of

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.320 
this evening I'm doing a quick review of
the<00:00:06.299> early<00:00:07.049> type<00:00:07.529> gun<00:00:08.280> tank<00:00:08.610> from<00:00:08.970> Mobile<00:00:09.210> Suit

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the early type gun tank from Mobile Suit

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.490 
the early type gun tank from Mobile Suit
Gundam<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.750> origin<00:00:10.700> this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.200> Hg

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
Gundam the origin this is the Hg

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.599 
Gundam the origin this is the Hg
the<00:00:13.980> origin<00:00:14.580> edition<00:00:15.179> from<00:00:16.580> Gundam<00:00:17.580> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the origin edition from Gundam the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.970 
the origin edition from Gundam the
origin<00:00:17.730> episode<00:00:18.539> one<00:00:18.720> blue-eyed<00:00:19.109> casval<00:00:19.320> okay

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
origin episode one blue-eyed casval okay

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.830 
origin episode one blue-eyed casval okay
yeah<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.510> it's<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.590> pretty<00:00:22.740> good<00:00:22.920> build<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.939> may

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
yeah so it's a pretty good build I may

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.460 
yeah so it's a pretty good build I may
be<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.800> costly<00:00:26.130> for<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.470> it's

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
be a little costly for what it is it's

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.439 
be a little costly for what it is it's
an<00:00:28.619> hg<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.279> there's<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.519> lot<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.670> limitations<00:00:30.300> on

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
an hg so there's a lot of limitations on

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
an hg so there's a lot of limitations on
what<00:00:30.599> they<00:00:30.750> could<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.800> course<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
what they could do like of course the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.780 
what they could do like of course the
treads<00:00:32.399> cannot<00:00:32.820> move<00:00:33.090> they<00:00:33.450> are<00:00:33.570> solid<00:00:34.050> pieces

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
treads cannot move they are solid pieces

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.400 
treads cannot move they are solid pieces
however<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.840> couple<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.260> neat

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
however they do have a couple of neat

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.830 
however they do have a couple of neat
gimmicks<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.980> make<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.450> get<00:00:39.780> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
gimmicks to make up for it you get a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.389 
gimmicks to make up for it you get a
little<00:00:40.110> bit<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.980> bit<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> movement

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
little bit of a little bit of movement

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.290 
little bit of a little bit of movement
here<00:00:41.910> with<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.989> fuel<00:00:43.320> tank<00:00:44.300> propeller

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
here with this some fuel tank propeller

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.340 
here with this some fuel tank propeller
thing<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.020> don't<00:00:46.079> know<00:00:47.930> you<00:00:48.930> get<00:00:49.079> waist

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
thing I don't know you get waist

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.189 
thing I don't know you get waist
movement<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.399> get<00:00:50.520> full<00:00:50.760> arm<00:00:51.030> movement<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
movement you get full arm movement the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:59.569 
movement you get full arm movement the
handguns<00:00:53.070> rotates<00:00:56.059> head<00:00:57.059> rotates<00:00:58.430> he<00:00:59.430> has<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
handguns rotates head rotates he has a

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.510 
handguns rotates head rotates he has a
little<00:00:59.910> bit<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.239> tilt<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> him<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.930> very<00:01:01.199> much

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
little bit of tilt to him not very much

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.080 
little bit of tilt to him not very much
his<00:01:02.520> cannons<00:01:03.030> both<00:01:03.359> lift<00:01:04.189> they<00:01:05.189> also<00:01:05.309> have

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
his cannons both lift they also have

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
his cannons both lift they also have
these<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.810> don't<00:01:06.990> even<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.500> are

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
these I don't even know what they are

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.020 
these I don't even know what they are
braces<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.090> sort<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:10.700> but<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:11.880> an

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
braces of some sort but it's but like an

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.469 
braces of some sort but it's but like an
mg<00:01:12.510> kit<00:01:12.890> they<00:01:13.890> actually<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.610> these<00:01:15.210> pieces

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
mg kit they actually have these pieces

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.590 
mg kit they actually have these pieces
of<00:01:15.780> tubing<00:01:16.400> with<00:01:17.400> these<00:01:17.850> pipes<00:01:18.270> these

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
of tubing with these pipes these

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.440 
of tubing with these pipes these
pneumatics<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.100> those<00:01:20.220> pump<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.030> out<00:01:21.210> as

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
pneumatics and those pump in and out as

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630 
pneumatics and those pump in and out as
you<00:01:21.689> turn<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.400> neat<00:01:23.549> effect

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
you turn it I'm it's just a neat effect

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.340 
you turn it I'm it's just a neat effect
it<00:01:23.970> doesn't<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.299> add<00:01:24.600> anything<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.170> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it doesn't actually add anything to it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
it doesn't actually add anything to it
physically<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.790> looks<00:01:26.970> nice<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:28.200> of

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
physically but it looks nice but one of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.450 
physically but it looks nice but one of
the<00:01:28.350> things<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.619> thought<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.799> kind<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.100> neat<00:01:29.250> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the things I thought was kind of neat is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.010 
the things I thought was kind of neat is
the<00:01:30.079> treads<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.829> arms<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.420> they'll<00:01:33.570> pop

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the treads are on arms so they'll pop

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.760 
the treads are on arms so they'll pop
out<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.939> they're<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.090> ball<00:01:36.420> joint<00:01:36.689> sockets<00:01:37.200> so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
out and they're on ball joint sockets so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.260 
out and they're on ball joint sockets so
you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.189> pull<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.579> both<00:01:38.729> out<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you can actually pull them both out and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.530 
you can actually pull them both out and
they<00:01:39.900> will<00:01:40.049> both<00:01:40.229> tip<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.070> fully<00:01:41.820> rotate<00:01:42.360> if

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
they will both tip and fully rotate if

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.810 
they will both tip and fully rotate if
you<00:01:42.659> need<00:01:42.810> them<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.070> I'm<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.700> know

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you need them to I'm so I can you know

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.490 
you need them to I'm so I can you know
theoretically<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.110> climb<00:01:46.439> up

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
theoretically it could climb up

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.319 
theoretically it could climb up
mountains<00:01:47.130> or<00:01:47.430> some<00:01:47.899> yeah<00:01:50.000> yes<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.210> is

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
mountains or some yeah yes it is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.270 
mountains or some yeah yes it is
that<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> definitely<00:01:52.079> above<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.890> Dalek

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that is definitely above on Dalek

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.620 
that is definitely above on Dalek
technology<00:01:54.710> okay<00:01:55.710> okay<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:57.240> far<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.540> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
technology okay okay so as far as that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.980 
technology okay okay so as far as that
goes

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
goes

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.190 
goes
it's<00:01:58.500> pretty<00:01:58.770> neat<00:02:02.509> yes<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.810> about<00:02:04.140> a

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's pretty neat yes it is about a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.899 
it's pretty neat yes it is about a
million<00:02:04.530> times<00:02:04.770> cooler<00:02:05.009> than<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.430> universal

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
million times cooler than the universal

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.459 
million times cooler than the universal
century<00:02:06.270> version<00:02:06.509> of<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> gun<00:02:06.899> tank<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
century version of the gun tank but the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.119 
century version of the gun tank but the
gun<00:02:07.619> tank<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.129> um<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:09.179> pretty<00:02:09.330> dumb

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
gun tank is um it's pretty dumb

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.619 
gun tank is um it's pretty dumb
another<00:02:11.129> little<00:02:11.370> gripe<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
another little gripe I have with this

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.760 
another little gripe I have with this
but<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.260> slightly

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
but it's slightly

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
but it's slightly
mitigated<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.760> it's<00:02:14.880> pretty<00:02:15.060> much<00:02:15.210> all

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
mitigated is that it's pretty much all

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.570 
mitigated is that it's pretty much all
gray<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.230> get<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.470> couple<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.830> pieces<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.250> are

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
gray you get a couple of pieces that are

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.700 
gray you get a couple of pieces that are
not<00:02:17.850> like<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.360> arms<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.350> have<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.500> couple

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
not like the arms here you have a couple

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.100 
not like the arms here you have a couple
of<00:02:19.830> pieces<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.130> are<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.490> sort<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.630> goldish

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
of pieces that are this sort of goldish

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.260 
of pieces that are this sort of goldish
brown<00:02:22.560> color<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.970> course<00:02:24.150> you've

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
brown color and then of course you've

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.450 
brown color and then of course you've
got<00:02:24.300> your<00:02:24.540> cannons<00:02:25.110> but<00:02:25.860> by<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.190> large<00:02:26.220> most

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
got your cannons but by and large most

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.940 
got your cannons but by and large most
of<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.000> body<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.330> solid<00:02:27.810> gray<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.740> could

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
of the body is solid gray you could

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.250 
of the body is solid gray you could
probably<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> lot<00:02:30.120> out<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.360> panel<00:02:30.900> lining

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
probably get a lot out of panel lining

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.570 
probably get a lot out of panel lining
this<00:02:31.440> there's<00:02:31.770> plenty<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.640> panel<00:02:33.240> lining

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
this there's plenty to be panel lining

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.360 
this there's plenty to be panel lining
but<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:36.170> lot<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.200> these<00:02:37.350> pieces<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.950> mean<00:02:38.070> this<00:02:38.250> is

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
but a lot of these pieces I mean this is

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.260 
but a lot of these pieces I mean this is
this<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.670> all<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:39.030> piece<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.580> front

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
this is all one piece you know the front

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.150 
this is all one piece you know the front
comes<00:02:42.570> off<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.320> all<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.830> that's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
comes off but like all of that that's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.010 
comes off but like all of that that's
all<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.520> piece<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.420> it'll<00:02:45.600> be<00:02:45.690> very<00:02:45.720> difficult

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
all one piece so it'll be very difficult

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.810 
all one piece so it'll be very difficult
to<00:02:46.380> paint<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> lot<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.370> good<00:02:47.490> detail

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
to paint and get a lot of good detail

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.460 
to paint and get a lot of good detail
out<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.330> you'd<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.750> do<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.870> lot<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.230> hand

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
out of it you'd have to do a lot of hand

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.320 
out of it you'd have to do a lot of hand
detailing<00:02:50.160> or<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> lot<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.850> really<00:02:51.090> solid

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
detailing or a lot of really solid

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.780 
detailing or a lot of really solid
masking<00:02:52.050> oh<00:02:52.830> also<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.800> hatch<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:56.490> comes

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
masking oh also the the hatch here comes

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.030 
masking oh also the the hatch here comes
up<00:02:59.240> and<00:03:00.240> bike<00:03:00.390> comes<00:03:00.600> up<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:00.900> mean<00:03:01.050> pops<00:03:01.290> off<00:03:01.560> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
up and bike comes up I mean pops off it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.950 
up and bike comes up I mean pops off it
actually<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.460> actually<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> hinge<00:03:03.150> but

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
actually it's actually on a hinge but

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.240 
actually it's actually on a hinge but
it's<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.140> really<00:03:04.770> tiny<00:03:05.490> hinge<00:03:06.800> so<00:03:07.800> dijah

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it's a really tiny hinge so dijah

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.010 
it's a really tiny hinge so dijah
basically<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.360> crime<00:03:09.660> against<00:03:09.960> humanity

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
basically it's crime against humanity

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.750 
basically it's crime against humanity
that<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.710> doesn't<00:03:10.950> come<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.220> cost<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.670> all

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
that it doesn't come with a cost of all

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:26.180 
that it doesn't come with a cost of all
and<00:03:12.000> artesia<00:03:12.770> tiny<00:03:13.770> tiny<00:03:14.930> hg<00:03:15.930> size<00:03:19.130> yes<00:03:25.190> so

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
and artesia tiny tiny hg size yes so

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.070 
and artesia tiny tiny hg size yes so
that<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.760> hinge<00:03:27.060> doesn't<00:03:27.450> really<00:03:27.660> do<00:03:27.959> a<00:03:27.990> very

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
that that hinge doesn't really do a very

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.900 
that that hinge doesn't really do a very
good<00:03:28.290> job<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.620> opening<00:03:28.800> it<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.459> kind<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.670> pops

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
good job of opening it just kind of pops

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.670 
good job of opening it just kind of pops
off<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.360> you<00:03:30.420> can<00:03:30.540> pop<00:03:30.690> it<00:03:30.840> back<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.620> the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
off and you can pop it back on in the

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.680 
off and you can pop it back on in the
position<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.370> want<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.760> but<00:03:33.420> it's<00:03:33.570> very

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
position that you want to but it's very

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.490 
position that you want to but it's very
tiny<00:03:34.020> so<00:03:34.410> it's<00:03:34.590> not<00:03:34.770> that<00:03:35.070> very<00:03:35.280> strong<00:03:36.500> these

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
tiny so it's not that very strong these

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.630 
tiny so it's not that very strong these
cannons<00:03:37.950> here<00:03:38.400> they<00:03:39.240> are<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.750> separate<00:03:40.200> piece

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
cannons here they are a separate piece

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.280 
cannons here they are a separate piece
the<00:03:41.640> front<00:03:41.970> bumper<00:03:42.209> and<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.570> rear<00:03:42.750> bumper<00:03:42.959> are

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
the front bumper and the rear bumper are

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.740 
the front bumper and the rear bumper are
separate<00:03:43.770> pieces<00:03:43.920> so<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.970> can<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.510> some

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
separate pieces so you you can do some

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.820 
separate pieces so you you can do some
painting<00:03:45.990> with<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.970> these<00:03:47.970> bits<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.170> ammo<00:03:49.620> or

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
painting with it these bits of ammo or

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.820 
painting with it these bits of ammo or
guns<00:03:50.130> or<00:03:50.310> whatever<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.820> they<00:03:51.030> are<00:03:51.830> those

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
guns or whatever the they are those

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.360 
guns or whatever the they are those
are<00:03:52.980> separate<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.690> enables<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.740> the<00:03:56.190> one

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
are separate so it enables you the one

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.180 
are separate so it enables you the one
thing<00:03:56.520> that<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.730> will<00:03:56.880> say<00:03:57.120> though<00:04:00.950> just<00:04:01.950> like

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
thing that I will say though just like

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.600 
thing that I will say though just like
the<00:04:02.400> char's<00:04:02.730> zaku<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.950> comes<00:04:05.160> with<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.370> really

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
the char's zaku it comes with a really

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.650 
the char's zaku it comes with a really
elaborate<00:04:06.270> sticker<00:04:07.050> style<00:04:07.560> decal<00:04:08.340> kit<00:04:08.730> with

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.899 
stickers yeah yeah it's actually
it's<00:04:27.379> pretty<00:04:27.590> much<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.860> opposite<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.340> like

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
it's pretty much the opposite of like

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.640 
it's pretty much the opposite of like
America<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.479> America<00:04:29.870> you<00:04:29.990> find<00:04:30.169> hobby<00:04:30.349> shops

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
America in America you find hobby shops

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.409 
America in America you find hobby shops
and<00:04:30.860> they're<00:04:30.949> full<00:04:31.129> of<00:04:31.280> military<00:04:31.550> paints

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
and they're full of military paints

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.270 
and they're full of military paints
military<00:04:33.139> models<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.710> sort<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:33.919> stuff

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
military models and that sort of stuff

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.040 
military models and that sort of stuff
I'm<00:04:34.520> here<00:04:35.090> you<00:04:35.240> kind<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.479> have<00:04:35.539> to<00:04:35.629> look<00:04:35.840> for

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
I'm here you kind of have to look for

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.899 
I'm here you kind of have to look for
that<00:04:36.169> stuff<00:04:36.500> but<00:04:36.770> Gundams<00:04:37.250> are<00:04:37.490> everywhere

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
that stuff but Gundams are everywhere

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.920 
that stuff but Gundams are everywhere
yeah<00:04:38.300> yeah<00:04:39.289> so<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.580> think<00:04:41.120> it's<00:04:41.330> a<00:04:41.360> good<00:04:41.479> kid<00:04:41.689> I

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
yeah yeah so I think it's a good kid I

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.140 
yeah yeah so I think it's a good kid I
think<00:04:42.439> it<00:04:42.530> retails<00:04:43.129> for<00:04:43.340> two<00:04:43.729> thousand<00:04:44.060> three

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
think it retails for two thousand three

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.429 
think it retails for two thousand three
hundred<00:04:44.300> yen<00:04:44.629> I<00:04:44.810> think<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.169> might<00:04:45.289> be<00:04:45.409> a

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:45.439 
hundred yen I think that might be a

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.809 
hundred yen I think that might be a
little<00:04:45.710> bit<00:04:45.830> much<00:04:46.009> for<00:04:46.280> it<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:46.580> it's<00:04:46.699> still

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
little bit much for it but it's still

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.129 
little bit much for it but it's still
pretty<00:04:47.030> cool<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.539> like<00:04:47.900> it

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
pretty cool I like it

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.320 
pretty cool I like it
um<00:04:48.409> it's<00:04:49.009> way<00:04:49.189> better<00:04:49.310> than<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.639> gun<00:04:49.789> tank<00:04:50.090> and

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
um it's way better than the gun tank and

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.350 
um it's way better than the gun tank and
or<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:51.289> gun<00:04:51.439> yeah<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.800> gun<00:04:51.919> tank<00:04:52.099> and<00:04:52.490> it's<00:04:52.969> I

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
or the gun yeah the gun tank and it's I

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.659 
or the gun yeah the gun tank and it's I
don't<00:04:53.689> know<00:04:53.810> it's<00:04:53.870> a<00:04:54.080> good<00:04:54.229> complement<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.099> the

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
don't know it's a good complement to the

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.480 
don't know it's a good complement to the
origin<00:04:56.150> line<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:56.750> far<00:04:56.990> I'm<00:04:57.409> eager<00:04:58.039> for<00:04:58.069> some<00:04:58.280> of

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
origin line so far I'm eager for some of

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.550 
origin line so far I'm eager for some of
the<00:04:58.580> other<00:04:58.699> kids<00:04:59.030> but<00:04:59.539> so<00:04:59.840> far<00:05:00.080> most<00:05:00.349> of<00:05:00.440> the

the other kids but so far most of the
announced<00:05:00.800> stuff<00:05:01.099> is<00:05:01.280> like<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.969> black

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
announced stuff is like the black

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.619 
announced stuff is like the black
Tristar<00:05:02.900> zaku<00:05:03.500> and<00:05:03.830> of<00:05:04.669> course<00:05:04.909> we<00:05:05.509> already

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:05.629 
Tristar zaku and of course we already

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.119 
Tristar zaku and of course we already
have<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:05.870> Zaku<00:05:06.319> so<00:05:06.620> there's<00:05:06.800> not<00:05:06.889> a<00:05:06.949> lot<00:05:07.009> of

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:07.129 
have a Zaku so there's not a lot of

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.999 
have a Zaku so there's not a lot of
variety<00:05:07.610> there<00:05:08.530> we<00:05:09.530> are<00:05:09.560> gonna<00:05:09.770> get<00:05:09.919> the

really excited yeah
yeah<00:05:16.940> I<00:05:17.360> mean<00:05:17.840> and<00:05:18.050> this<00:05:18.169> is<00:05:18.229> an<00:05:18.469> evolution

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
yeah I mean and this is an evolution

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.159 
yeah I mean and this is an evolution
this<00:05:19.129> is<00:05:19.279> this<00:05:19.490> is<00:05:19.669> before<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.509> gun<00:05:20.719> tank<00:05:20.990> and

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
this is this is before the gun tank and

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.040 
this is this is before the gun tank and
the<00:05:21.229> gun<00:05:21.349> tanks<00:05:21.650> technically<00:05:22.069> important<00:05:23.050> so

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
the gun tanks technically important so

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.730 
the gun tanks technically important so
you<00:05:24.289> know<00:05:24.379> there's<00:05:24.680> that<00:05:26.379> that's<00:05:27.379> it<00:05:27.529> it's<00:05:27.710> a

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
you know there's that that's it it's a

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.189 
you know there's that that's it it's a
pretty<00:05:27.860> pretty<00:05:28.279> simple<00:05:28.460> kit<00:05:28.810> not<00:05:29.810> a<00:05:29.870> lot<00:05:30.169> of

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
pretty pretty simple kit not a lot of

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.200 
pretty pretty simple kit not a lot of
articulation<00:05:31.069> I've<00:05:31.279> showed<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.520> literally

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
articulation I've showed you literally

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.950 
articulation I've showed you literally
everything<00:05:32.509> that<00:05:32.690> the<00:05:32.840> kit<00:05:33.020> can<00:05:33.199> do<00:05:34.270> but<00:05:35.270> it's

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
everything that the kit can do but it's

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.869 
everything that the kit can do but it's
a<00:05:36.080> good<00:05:36.229> little<00:05:36.349> piece<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.710> put<00:05:36.830> up<00:05:36.949> there<00:05:37.099> also

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:37.879 
a good little piece to put up there also

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.519 
a good little piece to put up there also
I<00:05:37.909> mean<00:05:38.150> it's<00:05:38.360> a<00:05:38.449> silly<00:05:38.659> point<00:05:38.930> you<00:05:39.169> it's

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:39.529 
I mean it's a silly point you it's

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:41.019 
I mean it's a silly point you it's
probably<00:05:39.770> pretty<00:05:40.190> obvious<00:05:40.279> but<00:05:40.699> you<00:05:40.849> can't

00:05:41.019 --> 00:05:41.029 
probably pretty obvious but you can't

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:42.579 
probably pretty obvious but you can't
put<00:05:41.180> it<00:05:41.270> on<00:05:41.330> an<00:05:41.449> action<00:05:41.750> base<00:05:41.960> there's<00:05:42.289> no<00:05:42.409> real

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:42.589 
put it on an action base there's no real

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:44.469 
put it on an action base there's no real
place<00:05:42.770> to<00:05:42.830> do<00:05:43.099> that<00:05:43.129> so<00:05:44.060> you<00:05:44.089> can't<00:05:44.330> have<00:05:44.389> a

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
place to do that so you can't have a

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:57.070 
place to do that so you can't have a
flying<00:05:44.779> gun<00:05:45.080> tank<00:05:49.839> yeah<00:05:50.839> yeah<00:05:51.289> well<00:05:55.569> I<00:05:56.569> guess

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
flying gun tank yeah yeah well I guess

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.170 
flying gun tank yeah yeah well I guess
maybe<00:05:57.259> you<00:05:57.440> could<00:05:57.650> I<00:05:57.680> don't<00:05:57.830> know<00:05:57.979> but<00:05:58.460> but<00:05:59.089> it

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
maybe you could I don't know but but it

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.640 
maybe you could I don't know but but it
is<00:05:59.330> it<00:05:59.539> is<00:05:59.569> sort<00:05:59.870> of<00:05:59.930> important<00:06:00.319> because<00:06:00.409> it's

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
is it is sort of important because it's

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.040 
is it is sort of important because it's
very<00:06:00.710> low<00:06:00.979> to<00:06:01.039> the<00:06:01.159> ground<00:06:01.690> so<00:06:02.690> depending<00:06:03.020> on

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
very low to the ground so depending on

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.600 
very low to the ground so depending on
you<00:06:03.319> you'd<00:06:03.860> have<00:06:03.979> to<00:06:04.069> think<00:06:04.250> about<00:06:04.310> it<00:06:04.520> if

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
you you'd have to think about it if

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.860 
you you'd have to think about it if
you're<00:06:04.729> displaying<00:06:05.120> it<00:06:05.240> on<00:06:05.300> a<00:06:05.360> shelf<00:06:05.719> or

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
you're displaying it on a shelf or

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.480 
you're displaying it on a shelf or
something<00:06:06.259> um<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.860> is<00:06:06.949> something<00:06:07.129> worth

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
something um it is something worth

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.779 
something um it is something worth
considering<00:06:07.969> so<00:06:08.599> but<00:06:09.379> there<00:06:09.889> you<00:06:10.039> go<00:06:10.219> there's

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
considering so but there you go there's
