00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
example of how the Stars kind of

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.100 
example of how the Stars kind of
knowledge<00:01:14.110> based<00:01:14.530> on<00:01:14.619> customer<00:01:14.979> feedback<00:01:16.110> so

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
you stores that are opening after this

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.410 
you stores that are opening after this
will<00:01:19.690> really<00:01:20.020> all<00:01:20.140> have<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.470> same<00:01:20.680> layout

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
will really all have the same layout

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.969 
will really all have the same layout
they're<00:01:22.420> pretty<00:01:22.810> similar<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.680> think<00:01:23.860> different

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
they're pretty similar I think different

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.210 
they're pretty similar I think different
sizes<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:25.479> know<00:01:25.840> some<00:01:26.110> may<00:01:26.290> be<00:01:26.350> narrower<00:01:26.890> and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
sizes you know some may be narrower and

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.520 
sizes you know some may be narrower and
longer<00:01:27.490> than<00:01:28.000> this<00:01:28.630> but<00:01:28.689> they<00:01:28.990> typically<00:01:29.290> have

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
longer than this but they typically have

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.880 
longer than this but they typically have
all<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.770> same<00:01:29.979> types<00:01:30.970> of<00:01:31.119> stations<00:01:31.890> same

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
all the same types of stations same

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.469 
all the same types of stations same
basically<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.729> experience<00:01:34.119> would<00:01:34.210> be<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
basically the experience would be the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:42.270 
basically the experience would be the
same<00:01:34.750> someone<00:01:35.350> who<00:01:35.439> visits<00:01:35.799> difference<00:01:36.189> yes
