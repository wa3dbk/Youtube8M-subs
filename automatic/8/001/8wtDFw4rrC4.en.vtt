way scan that QR code love it so moving

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.560 
way scan that QR code love it so moving
on<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> unboxing<00:01:45.659> i<00:01:47.240> can<00:01:48.240> figure<00:01:48.479> out

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
on with the unboxing i can figure out

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.920 
on with the unboxing i can figure out
exactly<00:01:49.470> how<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.509> okay<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.689> slides

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
exactly how to do this okay just slides

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.889 
exactly how to do this okay just slides
out<00:01:52.110> nice<00:01:52.560> design<00:01:54.710> moving<00:01:55.710> further<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.899> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
out nice design moving further and the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.399 
out nice design moving further and the
case<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.490> now<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.790> i<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.869> say<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.200> feels

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
case is now here i have to say it feels

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.280 
case is now here i have to say it feels
very<00:02:01.500> sturdy<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.310> mean<00:02:02.579> I'm<00:02:03.479> really<00:02:03.869> pushing<00:02:04.079> on

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
very sturdy I mean I'm really pushing on

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
very sturdy I mean I'm really pushing on
that<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.710> see<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.070> sorta<00:02:05.340> like

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
that you can see it just sorta like

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.869 
that you can see it just sorta like
flexing<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> ends<00:02:06.590> very<00:02:07.590> hard<00:02:08.039> material<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
flexing the ends very hard material and

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.510 
flexing the ends very hard material and
so<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.440> definitely<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> go

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
so I this is definitely not going to go

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.920 
so I this is definitely not going to go
anywhere<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.910> know<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.270> not<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> flimsy

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
anywhere you know it's not like a flimsy

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.309 
anywhere you know it's not like a flimsy
silk

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
silk

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.589 
silk
case<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.769> is<00:02:13.920> definitely<00:02:14.280> high<00:02:14.370> quality<00:02:14.819> one

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
case this is definitely high quality one

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.089 
case this is definitely high quality one
thing<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:15.870> tap<00:02:16.140> with<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:16.499> case<00:02:16.739> is<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
thing they tap with this case is the

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.830 
thing they tap with this case is the
ends<00:02:17.430> here<00:02:17.549> as<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.209> see<00:02:18.420> they<00:02:18.540> have<00:02:18.689> like

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
ends here as you can see they have like

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.199 
ends here as you can see they have like
an<00:02:18.989> extra<00:02:19.290> layer<00:02:19.499> here<00:02:19.859> it<00:02:20.670> kind<00:02:20.939> of<00:02:20.969> sticks

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
an extra layer here it kind of sticks

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.910 
an extra layer here it kind of sticks
out<00:02:21.389> but<00:02:21.810> they<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.049> that<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.409> each<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.829> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
out but they have that on each of the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.170 
out but they have that on each of the
corners<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.609> thing<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.760> meant<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.150> be

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
corners so this thing is meant to be

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.209 
corners so this thing is meant to be
dropped<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.689> know<00:02:24.810> right<00:02:25.079> on<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> corner<00:02:25.620> as

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.219 
dropped you know right on the corner as

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.599 
dropped you know right on the corner as
I<00:02:26.459> hate<00:02:26.639> plastic<00:02:27.709> anyway<00:02:28.709> it's<00:02:29.219> meant<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.579> be

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
I hate plastic anyway it's meant to be

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.690 
I hate plastic anyway it's meant to be
dropped<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.329> corner<00:02:30.689> and<00:02:30.859> this<00:02:31.859> will<00:02:32.099> come

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
dropped on the corner and this will come

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.220 
dropped on the corner and this will come
up<00:02:32.730> over<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.329> screen<00:02:33.569> so<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.900> drop<00:02:34.079> it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
up over the screen so if you drop it

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.789 
I have my phone I'll move all this
clutter<00:02:41.849> semi<00:02:42.689> out<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.019> way<00:02:43.109> so<00:02:43.530> here's<00:02:43.739> my

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
clutter semi out of the way so here's my

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.209 
clutter semi out of the way so here's my
iphone<00:02:44.249> 4s<00:02:44.639> 32<00:02:45.480> gigabyte<00:02:45.900> model<00:02:46.079> I'm<00:02:46.829> gonna<00:02:47.040> go

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:47.219 
iphone 4s 32 gigabyte model I'm gonna go

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.509 
iphone 4s 32 gigabyte model I'm gonna go
and<00:02:47.430> put<00:02:47.639> this<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.659> the<00:02:48.840> case<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.459> as

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
and put this in to the case and so as

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.199 
and put this in to the case and so as
you<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:51.000> if<00:02:51.120> it's<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.419> very<00:02:51.599> snug<00:02:53.000> so<00:02:54.000> it

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
you see if it's in very snug so it

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.970 
you see if it's in very snug so it
actually<00:02:54.449> doesn't<00:02:54.750> add<00:02:54.959> as<00:02:55.169> much<00:02:55.379> bulk<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.949> the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
actually doesn't add as much bulk to the

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.890 
actually doesn't add as much bulk to the
Cathars<00:02:56.699> I<00:02:56.819> thought<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.209> would<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.540> definitely

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
Cathars I thought it would it definitely

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.659 
Cathars I thought it would it definitely
adds<00:02:57.930> some<00:02:58.199> but<00:02:58.919> the<00:02:59.069> protection<00:02:59.549> that<00:02:59.579> you

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
adds some but the protection that you

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:00.949 
adds some but the protection that you
get<00:02:59.879> with<00:02:59.939> this<00:03:00.060> case<00:03:00.269> is<00:03:00.510> worth<00:03:00.689> it<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.930> know

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
get with this case is worth it you know

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.659 
get with this case is worth it you know
this<00:03:01.230> isn't<00:03:01.530> like<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.829> clear<00:03:02.069> case<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.459> have

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
this isn't like the clear case I have

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.119 
this isn't like the clear case I have
which<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:04.049> found<00:03:04.260> right<00:03:04.530> here<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:05.069> is

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
which can be found right here this is

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.129 
which can be found right here this is
just<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.489> flimsy<00:03:05.939> little<00:03:06.060> thing<00:03:06.359> but<00:03:06.569> it<00:03:06.989> just

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
just a flimsy little thing but it just

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.409 
just a flimsy little thing but it just
it's<00:03:07.409> mainly<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.769> scratch<00:03:08.250> protector<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.150> you

it's mainly a scratch protector and you

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.209 
it's mainly a scratch protector and you
can<00:03:09.599> really<00:03:09.750> still<00:03:10.019> see<00:03:10.199> the<00:03:10.319> phone<00:03:10.560> which<00:03:11.099> is

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
something I like to go for but that does

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.599 
something I like to go for but that does
not<00:03:12.900> offer<00:03:13.199> any<00:03:13.469> protection<00:03:14.159> whereas<00:03:14.370> this

not offer any protection whereas this

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.339 
not offer any protection whereas this
this<00:03:15.090> does<00:03:15.329> cover<00:03:15.569> up<00:03:15.689> the<00:03:15.810> look<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.079> the<00:03:16.169> phone

which I'm not the biggest fan of however
it<00:03:18.209> is<00:03:18.359> worth<00:03:18.659> it<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.079> i<00:03:19.169> said<00:03:19.349> if<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.560> take
