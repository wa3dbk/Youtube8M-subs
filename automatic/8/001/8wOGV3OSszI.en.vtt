without soccer power taste like six or

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.530 
without soccer power taste like six or

I saw it has an exploding tip on it I

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.970 
I saw it has an exploding tip on it I
hope<00:04:25.780> they<00:04:25.930> don't<00:04:26.140> have<00:04:26.260> an<00:04:26.380> exploding<00:04:26.800> tip

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.290 
hope they don't have an exploding tip
and<00:04:27.130> multiplayer<00:04:27.550> if<00:04:27.700> they<00:04:27.790> plan<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.060> putting

an advantageous position enough so I

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.070

feel that they should be exposed so they

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.450 
feel that they should be exposed so they
can<00:05:26.230> be<00:05:26.350> shot<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:26.860> like<00:05:26.920> in<00:05:27.190> any<00:05:27.310> other
