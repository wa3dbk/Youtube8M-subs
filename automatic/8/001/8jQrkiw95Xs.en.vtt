00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.329
 favorite in the hangar 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 on these tanks in the first place easy 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.410
 play and get not only mass 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.800
 enjoyment of the game but also bring 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 the use of their statistics and the team thats not 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.440
 there will be bush pits and arts only 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 e100 and everyone can choose a tank 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.140
 to the soul 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:58.649
 so go the fifth place of our top is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 t110 e5 american tenth level 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.680
 this tank for most of the players has become 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.570
 top ten and for many years is 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.670
 he has a favorite of extras 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 when tyazh dynamics excellent exactly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.979
 Punchy high-speed weapons chic 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.470
 frontal armor that does not even pay 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.040
 a huge commander's pinnacle target for 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.280
 all kinds of cluster translations t110 and 5 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.229
 bravely thin forehead and tower 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.750
 able to twist awkward 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.659
 Fri-shki and tyazh as if I'm in a hurry 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.180
 the tower at up to 110 5 also spin very 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.340
 quickly so if you put on 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 guslya you can shoot at the offender 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.579
 even being immobilized and so we go 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.579
 farther 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:49.420
 fourth place and this is i-7 Soviet heavy 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.520
 level ten mass of players who are not 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.450
 are ardent Germans forces shook 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 exactly seven 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.070
 like your first tank top for not 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.860
 discharged bend it is important to understand that 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.650
 tanks level 10 excluding of course 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.200
 ribbons on the base shells do not break through 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.100
 we are not in the forehead of the tower is not in the upper frontal 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.410
 detail 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.670
 however, the lower frontal part makes its way 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.160
 every hit 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.260
 excellent dynamics and speed allow 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.500
 take first advantageous positions or 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.420
 quickly change the direction of attack gun 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.160
 has good armor penetration 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.200
 allowing you to confidently hit 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.630
 almost any opponent of ours 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.450
 level with proper aiming 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.550
 also a bonus is the type of premium 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.070
 shells they are sabling so 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.550
 fly fast and do not burn into the screen and 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.160
 armor 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.630
 negative side is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.680
 mediocre accuracy extremely long 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.870
 gun information 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.570
 which make it difficult to shoot on 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.880
 long distance seven tank sick 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.590
 his battlefield excellent booking allows 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.350
 he has to restrain his superior powers 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.660
 adversary or push direction 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.630
 this is the most effective 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.430
 tactic for sevens allowing to put 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.540
 damage to opponents and make significant 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.540
 contribution to the victory of the team 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.569
 third place is a soviet middle tank 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.090
 tenth level object 140 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.170
 Object 40 in style of the game is similar to its 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.489
 predecessor t-54 good dynamics 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.159
 maximum speed and permeability 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.870
 weak soils in a compartment with a great tool 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:24.019
 makes it possible to cause damage 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.480
 the enemy and quickly move away from the response 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.579
 fire not all players know something tank 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.829
 has a better level of accuracy 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:33.049
 on the go tank is suitable for lovers 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.599
 active fights but it is worth remembering that 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.239
 the hull reservation is weak and the tower is 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.699
 two large hatches which fall 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.859
 simple enough but if you twitch 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:45.919
 the enemy is very hard to hit and 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.689
 stations from 100 to 200 meters and ideally 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:49.189
 on this tank you need to fight not on 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.590
 very long distances 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:53.569
 do not be lazy to change positions retreat to 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.000
 one hundred two hundred meters from rush tanks 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.829
 put on a skating rink and then gently 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.560
 disassemble the enemy is the most 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:03.019
 effective reception on this technique 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.299
 low silhouette and y better at something 62 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.699
 allow you to play from small folds 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.889
 terrain a strong tower sometimes even 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:13.569
 able to ricochet enemy shells 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.569
 tyazhey and even toes 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.880
 the second place of our top is e50m 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.370
 which is modernized 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.860
 option and ST-shki ninth level E50 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.720
 tank got a new swear exact gun 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.180
 its such a flight speed of the projectile 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.880
 which is great for shooting at 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.889
 long distance in favor 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.990
 sniper tactics testify and not 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.630
 high rate of fire most 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.570
 opponents replay E50m damage 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.020
 minute however, significantly improving 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.580
 compared with the E50 tank maneuverability 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.680
 positive effect on performance 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.950
 traditional medium tank functions 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.750
 twist hesitate revive zigzag walk 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.840
 under shelling compared to 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:00.180
 predecessor has become much easier 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.040
 frontal armor e50m holds a great kick 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.890
 under standard projectiles medium and 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.470
 heavy tanks of the tenth level but against 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.780
 pd10 shells even she have to 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.600
 turn the hull or run away 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.010
 shelter at the tank good dynamics that in 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.930
 combined with excellent armor 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.419
 allows in some cases successfully 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.650
 act in the conditions of the city and in 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:27.250
 open cards 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:29.620
 and the first place of our top is t57 heavy 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.110
 the main advantage of this tank 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.270
 is a powerful weapon and very fast 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.590
 reloading the drum that allows 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.919
 do huge damage only 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.389
 think about the 1600s from one drum to 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.570
 the enemy in the shortest possible time 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:45.880
 just less than 10 seconds 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.530
 good accuracy allows you to confidently 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.440
 hit the target and on the middle and far 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.360
 distance however armor penetration base 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.050
 projectile at such a distance is not enough 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.530
 always especially when shooting for tyazh 9 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.630
 and level 10 t57 heavy tank has 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.199
 good speed by the standards 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.389
 tyazha 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.199
 however, the turning speed and maximum 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:07.150
 speed low 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.510
 which makes it very difficult 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.190
 output t57 heavy fire 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.729
 among dignity high 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.979
 among the best armor penetration, etc. 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.660
 pierceability premium shells 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:22.330
 fast drum recharge good 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.430
 dynamics and even the presence of armor 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.669
 but besides all these other 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.240
 the merits of this car has 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.900
 wonderful vertical angles 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.020
 crosstalk that allow you to work from 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.840
 shelters and behind the folds of the area yes and 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.909
 do not bathe at all about the fact that the gun is not 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.659
 will rise or not fall on 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:46.510
 the enemy here is such he is the top 5 tanks on 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:49.270
 which is easy to raise statistics with 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.789
 You were Eustace, see our channel is not 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:54.010
 forget to put your finger up and 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:56.080
 subscribe to my channel which 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.710
 is in the description to new meetings

 bye Bye
