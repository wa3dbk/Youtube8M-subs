the future since it is open-source

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.310 
the future since it is open-source
there's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.630> cool<00:00:27.779> things<00:00:27.990> about<00:00:28.109> this

there's a lot of cool things about this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.189 
there's a lot of cool things about this
controller<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.279> without<00:00:29.580> further<00:00:29.820> ado<00:00:30.240> let's

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
controller so without further ado let's

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.749 
controller so without further ado let's
begin<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> review<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.610> drone

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
begin with the review so the drone

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
begin with the review so the drone
controller<00:00:33.180> comes<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:33.750> nice<00:00:33.960> box<00:00:34.350> as

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
controller comes in a really nice box as

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.139 
controller comes in a really nice box as
you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.190> opening<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.120> has

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
you can see opening it up it has

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.080 
you can see opening it up it has
evolution<00:00:37.020> controllers<00:00:37.469> written<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:37.800> back

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
evolution controllers written on back

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.010 
evolution controllers written on back
indicating<00:00:39.090> those<00:00:39.210> are<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> eyes<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.570> made

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
indicating those are the eyes that made

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.619 
indicating those are the eyes that made
it<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.160> taking<00:00:41.550> out<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.760> controller<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.480> can

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it so taking out the controller you can

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.900 
it so taking out the controller you can
see<00:00:42.960> it's<00:00:43.200> right<00:00:43.440> there<00:00:43.800> very<00:00:44.430> small

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
see it's right there very small

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.299 
see it's right there very small
form-factor<00:00:45.360> I'll<00:00:46.020> put<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.590> aside<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
form-factor I'll put that aside and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.369 
form-factor I'll put that aside and
underneath<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.480> comes<00:00:48.690> with<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> user<00:00:49.140> manual

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
underneath it comes with the user manual

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.920 
underneath it comes with the user manual
in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.649> form<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.250> card<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> basically

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
in the form of a card so it basically

taking<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> look<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> drone<00:01:10.049> controller

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
taking a look at the drone controller

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.109 
taking a look at the drone controller
first<00:01:10.770> thing<00:01:10.950> you'll<00:01:11.070> notice<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.610> size

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
first thing you'll notice is the size

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.490 
first thing you'll notice is the size
it's<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.659> very<00:01:12.810> small<00:01:12.960> controller

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it's actually a very small controller

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
it's actually a very small controller
it's<00:01:13.740> meant<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.159> super<00:01:14.670> compact<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.479> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it's meant to be super compact so you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's meant to be super compact so you
can<00:01:15.689> take<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.200> wherever<00:01:16.590> you're

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
can take it with you wherever you're

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.010 
can take it with you wherever you're
going<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:18.119> way<00:01:18.299> doesn't<00:01:18.540> take<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.869> too<00:01:18.900> much

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
going that way doesn't take up too much

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.429 
going that way doesn't take up too much
space<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.799> also<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.610> portable<00:01:21.270> now<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.290> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
space and also it's portable now this is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.690 
space and also it's portable now this is
the<00:01:22.619> great<00:01:22.710> thing<00:01:22.920> with<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.130> controller<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
the great thing with this controller it

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
the great thing with this controller it
is<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:24.210> small<00:01:24.450> controller<00:01:24.869> but<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.229> also

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
is a very small controller but it's also

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.289 
is a very small controller but it's also
fully<00:01:25.740> fledged<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.310> terms<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
fully fledged in terms of it has all the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.149 
fully fledged in terms of it has all the
buttons<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.110> you'd<00:01:28.259> find<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.860> normal

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
buttons that you'd find on a normal

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.850 
buttons that you'd find on a normal
conventional<00:01:29.549> sized<00:01:30.470> controller<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> can

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
conventional sized controller as you can

so<00:03:10.740> one<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:11.010> coolest<00:03:11.220> things<00:03:11.370> about<00:03:11.460> this

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
so one of the coolest things about this

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.850 
so one of the coolest things about this
controller<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.450> it's<00:03:12.600> open<00:03:12.960> source<00:03:13.260> they

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
controller is that it's open source they

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
and modify the code to make it work or

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.870 
and modify the code to make it work or
be<00:03:19.140> compatible<00:03:19.740> with<00:03:20.190> any<00:03:20.400> device<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.700> you

something<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.740> control<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.190> functions<00:03:26.700> it's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
something in control of functions it's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.970 
something in control of functions it's
actually<00:03:27.420> very<00:03:27.870> cool<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.410> possibilities
