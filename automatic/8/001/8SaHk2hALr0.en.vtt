00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
at four or five in the end but they're
all<00:01:23.820> pretty<00:01:24.030> straightforward<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.439> trick<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
all pretty straightforward the trick is

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.580 
all pretty straightforward the trick is
preparation<00:01:26.990> so<00:01:27.990> I'm<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.229> mark<00:01:28.439> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
preparation so I'm going to mark this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.719 
preparation so I'm going to mark this
one<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> head<00:01:29.640> towards

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
one and then I'm going to head towards

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.450 
one and then I'm going to head towards
it<00:01:30.000> now<00:01:30.180> as<00:01:31.140> you're<00:01:31.470> running<00:01:31.590> towards<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> make

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it now as you're running towards it make

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789 
it now as you're running towards it make
note<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.509> marker<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.259> there's<00:01:34.530> an<00:01:34.590> arrow

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
note of the marker if there's an arrow

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.109 
note of the marker if there's an arrow
pointing<00:01:35.159> up<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.430> means<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.700> above<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.030> if

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
pointing up that means it's above you if

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.429 
pointing up that means it's above you if
there's<00:01:36.299> an<00:01:36.360> arrow<00:01:36.570> pointing<00:01:36.930> down<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.350> means

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
there's an arrow pointing down it means

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.230 
there's an arrow pointing down it means
it's<00:01:37.860> Billy<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.549> might<00:01:38.729> seem<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.119> common

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
it's Billy now might seem like common

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
it's Billy now might seem like common
sense<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.930> took<00:01:40.020> me<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.200> while<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> actually

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
sense but it took me a while to actually

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.649 
sense but it took me a while to actually
realize<00:01:41.250> when<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.030> get<00:01:42.150> close<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> scout

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
realize when you get close to scout

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.270 
realize when you get close to scout
around<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.530> where<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.829> those<00:01:44.070> about

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
around and see where it is those about

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.560 
around and see where it is those about
to<00:01:44.340> climb<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> building<00:01:44.939> here<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:45.509> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to climb the building here but then I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
to climb the building here but then I
noticed<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> post<00:01:46.500> here<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.460> simply

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
noticed it's on a post here so I simply

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
noticed it's on a post here so I simply
ran<00:01:47.970> along<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.570> grabbed<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
ran along here and grabbed it and that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.609 
ran along here and grabbed it and that
was<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.340> easy<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:52.079> one<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> pop

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
was a really easy one I this one is pop

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
was a really easy one I this one is pop
high<00:01:53.000> you'll<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.960> about

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
high you'll see up here and it's about

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.749 
high you'll see up here and it's about
50<00:01:55.439> meters<00:01:55.710> away<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> other<00:01:56.280> side<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
50 meters away it's the other side of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.840 
50 meters away it's the other side of
this<00:01:57.119> building<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.710> drop<00:01:59.280> down<00:01:59.310> into<00:01:59.640> here

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
this building so I drop down into here

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.300 
this building so I drop down into here
and<00:02:00.030> run<00:02:00.149> around<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.860> want<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.100> get

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and run around and then you want to get

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.620 
and run around and then you want to get
up<00:02:02.399> high<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> spot<00:02:03.600> it

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
up high so that you can spot it

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.209 
up high so that you can spot it
effectively<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.380> see<00:02:04.530> where<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.799> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
effectively and see where it is and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.859 
effectively and see where it is and
whichever<00:02:05.759> way<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:05.939> cover<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.390> it'll<00:02:06.630> blow

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
whichever way you cover it it'll blow

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.710 
whichever way you cover it it'll blow
off<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.409> opposite<00:02:07.770> direction<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.420> here<00:02:09.450> we

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
off in the opposite direction so here we

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.940 
off in the opposite direction so here we
are<00:02:09.750> it's<00:02:09.929> done<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.289> move<00:02:10.440> already<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.890> you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
are it's done to move already and you

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.950 
are it's done to move already and you
only<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> run<00:02:11.550> into

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
only have to run into

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.320 
only have to run into
don't<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.350> push<00:02:12.500> up<00:02:12.650> up<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:13.090> mean<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.180> can

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
don't have to push up up I mean you can

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.040 
don't have to push up up I mean you can
take<00:02:14.480> your<00:02:14.600> time

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
take your time

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.630 
take your time
they'll<00:02:15.440> be<00:02:15.590> around<00:02:15.830> for<00:02:16.040> about<00:02:16.220> 10<00:02:16.430> or<00:02:16.520> 15

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
they'll be around for about 10 or 15

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.940 
they'll be around for about 10 or 15
seconds<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.450> don't<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.290> afraid<00:02:18.560> of<00:02:18.680> jumping

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
seconds and don't be afraid of jumping

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.350 
seconds and don't be afraid of jumping
in<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.250> air<00:02:19.280> to<00:02:19.580> grab<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:19.940> right<00:02:20.150> though

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
in the air to grab it right though

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.730 
in the air to grab it right though
you'll<00:02:20.630> see<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.840> couple<00:02:21.050> where<00:02:21.410> it's<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
you'll see a couple where it's in the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.190 
you'll see a couple where it's in the
street<00:02:22.070> above<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.490> house<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:23.960> have<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
street above the house and I have to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.600 
street above the house and I have to
jump<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.470> get<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.770> though<00:02:25.010> one<00:02:25.280> was<00:02:25.400> pretty

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
jump to get it though one was pretty

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.990 
jump to get it though one was pretty
easy<00:02:26.350> just<00:02:27.350> remember<00:02:27.680> stay<00:02:28.220> high<00:02:28.460> if<00:02:28.760> they're

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
easy just remember stay high if they're

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.960 
easy just remember stay high if they're
high<00:02:29.770> for<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.920> next<00:02:31.250> one<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:34.340> one<00:02:34.400> is<00:02:34.580> also

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
high for the next one this one is also

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.910 
high for the next one this one is also
pretty<00:02:35.270> high<00:02:35.360> up<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.900> scale<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> building

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
pretty high up so I scale the building

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.700 
pretty high up so I scale the building
and<00:02:37.250> covered<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.730> from<00:02:38.000> an<00:02:38.420> angle<00:02:38.750> it's<00:02:39.260> there

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
and covered it from an angle it's there

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.750 
and covered it from an angle it's there
on<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.220> Ledge

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
on a Ledge

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.330 
on a Ledge
so<00:02:40.910> hop<00:02:41.240> across<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.690> that<00:02:41.840> side<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.920> then<00:02:43.280> I

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
so hop across to that side and then I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.700 
so hop across to that side and then I
just<00:02:43.700> run<00:02:44.180> down<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.780> chase<00:02:45.200> it<00:02:45.350> this<00:02:45.440> way<00:02:45.650> but

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
just run down and chase it this way but

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.830 
just run down and chase it this way but
it'll<00:02:46.220> blow<00:02:46.550> up<00:02:46.880> across<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.510> street

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
it'll blow up across the street

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.390 
it'll blow up across the street
unfortunately<00:02:48.680> I<00:02:48.710> think<00:02:48.770> yeah<00:02:49.070> there<00:02:49.310> we<00:02:49.370> go

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
unfortunately I think yeah there we go

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.670 
unfortunately I think yeah there we go
but<00:02:50.120> that's<00:02:50.270> easy<00:02:50.540> enough<00:02:50.630> because<00:02:51.050> I<00:02:51.260> can

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
but that's easy enough because I can

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.060 
but that's easy enough because I can
just<00:02:52.070> scale<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.880> building<00:02:53.240> here<00:02:53.950> scale<00:02:54.950> the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
just scale the building here scale the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.410 
just scale the building here scale the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
that that are nearby then I could just

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.970 
that that are nearby then I could just
jump<00:03:02.210> off<00:03:02.390> wait<00:03:02.810> here<00:03:03.080> and<00:03:03.320> it<00:03:03.410> blew<00:03:03.590> into<00:03:03.770> me

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
high up it's on top of the chimney and I

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.910 
high up it's on top of the chimney and I

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
kind of make a mistake here you don't

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.620 
kind of make a mistake here you don't
need<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.430> climb<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.820> chimney<00:03:17.150> see<00:03:17.330> it's<00:03:17.480> off

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
need to climb the chimney see it's off

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.780 
need to climb the chimney see it's off
already<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.770> jump<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.460> then<00:03:19.550> climb

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
already and I jump here and then climb

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.340 
already and I jump here and then climb
up<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.090> waste<00:03:20.240> a<00:03:20.390> little<00:03:20.480> bit<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.780> time<00:03:20.960> but<00:03:21.230> I

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
up and waste a little bit of time but I

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.740 
up and waste a little bit of time but I
should<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.620> just<00:03:21.740> run<00:03:21.890> around<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.370> chimney

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
should have just run around the chimney

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
should have just run around the chimney
anyway<00:03:23.750> you'll<00:03:23.900> see<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.140> blows<00:03:24.380> across<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
anyway you'll see it blows across the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.530 
anyway you'll see it blows across the
street<00:03:25.160> here<00:03:25.400> but<00:03:25.580> just<00:03:25.730> leap<00:03:25.910> towards<00:03:26.300> it<00:03:26.390> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
street here but just leap towards it and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.330 
street here but just leap towards it and
not<00:03:26.690> snag<00:03:26.990> and<00:03:27.230> litter<00:03:27.380> again<00:03:28.190> not<00:03:28.760> a<00:03:28.790> problem

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.420 

this<00:03:34.340> one<00:03:34.610> is<00:03:34.880> pretty<00:03:35.240> high<00:03:35.480> up<00:03:35.510> as<00:03:35.780> well<00:03:35.960> so

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
this one is pretty high up as well so

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.690 
this one is pretty high up as well so
come<00:03:37.430> at<00:03:37.550> it<00:03:37.610> from<00:03:37.670> an<00:03:38.270> angle<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:39.220> I'm<00:03:40.220> getting

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
come at it from an angle and I'm getting

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.820 
come at it from an angle and I'm getting
it<00:03:40.790> here<00:03:41.150> from<00:03:41.420> behind<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.350> sort<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.530> blows

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
it here from behind so it sort of blows

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.980 
it here from behind so it sort of blows
down<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.250> street<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:43.820> it<00:03:44.360> will<00:03:44.510> generally

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
down the street and it will generally

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.500 
down the street and it will generally
try<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.470> match<00:03:45.740> the<00:03:46.640> height<00:03:46.820> of<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.210> area

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
try and match the height of the area

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.600 
try and match the height of the area
it's<00:03:47.660> at<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.110> I<00:03:48.140> leap<00:03:48.470> across<00:03:48.710> here<00:03:49.010> completely

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
it's at so I leap across here completely

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.580 
it's at so I leap across here completely
miss<00:03:49.820> and<00:03:50.450> this<00:03:50.540> is<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.720> great<00:03:50.960> example<00:03:51.500> of<00:03:51.530> how

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
miss and this is a great example of how

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.320 
miss and this is a great example of how
even<00:03:52.010> if<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:52.190> don't<00:03:52.370> have<00:03:52.550> much<00:03:52.730> or<00:03:53.000> even<00:03:53.240> if

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
even if you don't have much or even if

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:54.670 
even if you don't have much or even if
you<00:03:53.420> make<00:03:53.570> a<00:03:53.600> few<00:03:53.810> mistakes<00:03:53.900> you've<00:03:54.320> still<00:03:54.530> got

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
you make a few mistakes you've still got

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.920 
you make a few mistakes you've still got
plenty<00:03:54.860> of<00:03:55.040> time<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:56.210> I<00:03:56.240> just<00:03:56.330> kind<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.660> chase

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
plenty of time so I just kind of chase

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.960 
plenty of time so I just kind of chase
it<00:03:57.080> down<00:03:57.110> here<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.770> snag<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.340> off<00:03:58.430> there<00:03:58.670> that

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
it down here and snag it off there that

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.500 
it down here and snag it off there that
was<00:03:59.060> an<00:03:59.150> easy<00:03:59.270> one<00:03:59.480> and<00:04:01.060> then<00:04:02.060> go<00:04:02.180> away<00:04:02.300> from

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
was an easy one and then go away from

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.900 
was an easy one and then go away from
the<00:04:02.600> gods<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.050> then<00:04:03.890> finally<00:04:04.370> if<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:04.700> miss

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
the gods and then finally if you miss

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.600 
the gods and then finally if you miss
one<00:04:04.940> it's<00:04:05.630> really<00:04:06.050> not<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.260> big<00:04:06.470> deal<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.490> you're

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
one it's really not a big deal so you're

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.550 
one it's really not a big deal so you're
going<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.790> see<00:04:07.910> this<00:04:08.120> one<00:04:08.330> here<00:04:08.600> in<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.230> north

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
going to see this one here in the north

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.500 
going to see this one here in the north
I'm<00:04:09.740> chasing<00:04:09.770> down<00:04:10.250> now<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:10.970> I'm<00:04:11.270> not<00:04:11.390> even

I'm chasing down now and I'm not even
going<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.720> make<00:04:11.840> an<00:04:11.960> effort<00:04:12.110> to<00:04:12.290> grab<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.620> I'm

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
going to make an effort to grab it I'm

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.710 
going to make an effort to grab it I'm
just<00:04:13.460> kind<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.700> walking<00:04:13.850> after<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.390> you'll<00:04:14.570> see
