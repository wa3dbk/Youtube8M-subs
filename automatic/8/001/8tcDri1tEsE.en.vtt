00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.630
 this is the third generation of the smart 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.639
 you can already buy it in germany 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.609
 new now the double-clutch transmission 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.050
 that the automatic transmission replaces that 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.270
 dual-clutch transmission is the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.699
 significantly increase ride comfort and how 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.619
 that feels like this for today 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.910
 the double- clutch transmission trainer mick 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.949
 is stronger for the two 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.770
 Motorizations available and intended by 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.690
 gear changes in seconds 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 accelerate without traction interruption 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 we convey a new driving experience 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.399
 test that in four-seater forfour in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.960
 the 66 kg strongest version in 11 9 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.329
 seconds he accelerates the places 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.030
 from zero to 100 km h and should be mixed 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.030
 Consume 4.2 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.010
 the gears sometimes change like that 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.430
 imperceptible that you can not do it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.690
 realize 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.590
 the storm founder becomes that one has however 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.910
 unfortunately with the 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.040
 dual clutch transmission and the 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.920
 strongest engine is not there he is in 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900
 compared to the manual gear 0.7 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.780
 seconds slower in sprint from zero 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.610
 at 100 km / h on the consumer that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.710
 dual-clutch transmission, however, no 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.000
 influence and who can do the sport 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.640
 order with package 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.080
 there you can switch to sports mode 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.770
 and the corridors via the rocker switches 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770
 switch 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.140
 with the new generation has its 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:39.450
 also get a new look 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.090
 cheaper is the front at 2 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.799
 and 4 seater hardly different 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.170
 a collaboration between daimler and renault 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.509
 share the smart forfour and the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.880
 Twingo and 70 percent of the technical 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.189
 Components with both the engine sits 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 now in the back the backrest can be 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.020
 fold in two parts so remains the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.429
 smart nevertheless very flexible and offers 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 enough space for luggage 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.780
 the challenge for us was 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.579
 priority that in principle it was about 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.009
 a double-clutch transmission from the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.019
 usual front wheel drive applications in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.000
 implement the rear-wheel drive concept 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.890
 and that we try at the same time 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.720
 also had the vehicle segment 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.400
 Appropriately a piece-wide weight 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.470
 optimize and that's why we have 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.110
 really put a lot of energy into it 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.390
 and realizing the theme in the smart too 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.340
 can 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.140
 in the small car segment that is 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.660
 dual clutch transmission a novelty and 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.209
 costs the forfour in Germany one 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.220
 additional charge of 1425 euro 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.540
 but the driving comfort will also be 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.530
 through further structural innovations 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.530
 increased 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.340
 there the new smart is simply a 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.170
 piece has become far broader yes it 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.690
 gave us the possibility that we 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.400
 on the chassis make improvements 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.230
 we could have more spring path at the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.790
 front axle and you notice it more clearly 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.650
 so we have a much higher one 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.190
 fahrkomfort 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.170
 because the customer has definitely felt after 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.420
 there is the smart eight-year break 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.380
 now again with more than two 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.540
 The new smart seats again 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.100
 as a four-door because you are in everyday life 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.500
 but maybe children or 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.420
 would like to take friends when boarding 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.490
 you have to pay a little bit attention to that 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.490
 not a bit head on the holm pen 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.470
 but once you're in there it is 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.420
 It is not unpleasant for adults either 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.610
 the place for the head is okay and 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.380
 because the backs are soft 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.880
 is that on short distances in the city 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:37.650
 also for the knee similarly unpleasant 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.930
 Inside, the smart should be the highest 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.920
 satisfy and at the same time should 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.210
 he also different generations 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.940
 speak to 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.100
 There are three equipment lines from 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.320
 elegant elegant over colorful 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.420
 extroverted to teen 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.370
 Sporty that's the proxy outfit 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.420
 this is indicated by white and 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.400
 blue accents 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.380
 a small disadvantage is that yourself 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.880
 this colorful contrast program 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.340
 formally in the windshield 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.870
 reflects depending on the incidence of light and the 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.870
 driving can distract a bit 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.629
 unsurpassed is the smart in one 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.120
 its fundamental virtues 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.010
 through the engine placed in the rear 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.220
 larger link stops possible thereby 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:27.070
 the turning circle of the forfour has opened up 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:28.419
 865 decreases with its extremely small 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.729
 turning circle and the smooth-running 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.620
 Steering is also a four-door car 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.910
 perfect for the city again 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.370
 and with the new one 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.750
 dual-clutch transmission will drive 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.750
 adapted to the children's game
