00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
it doesn't catch so this is the bit that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.030 
it doesn't catch so this is the bit that
you<00:01:03.629> can't<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> kids<00:01:07.040> takes

you can't really do with the kids takes

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
you can't really do with the kids takes
a<00:01:08.130> while<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.479> bubbling<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> out<00:01:13.080> let's

a while so it's bubbling the out let's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.539 
a while so it's bubbling the out let's
give<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> stir<00:01:13.860> might<00:01:14.159> turn<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.490> a

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
give it a stir might turn it down a

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
give it a stir might turn it down a
little<00:01:14.670> bit<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.240> just<00:01:15.420> pick<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.750> arm<00:01:16.189> yes

done what you can do is let the answer

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.039 
done what you can do is let the answer
to<00:01:32.369> some<00:01:32.520> catch<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> glass<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.570> water<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
to some catch get a glass of water and a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
to some catch get a glass of water and a
teaspoon<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> tiny<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.340> amount

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
teaspoon just get a tiny little amount

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.069 
teaspoon just get a tiny little amount
okay

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
okay

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.600 
okay
you<00:01:37.380> see<00:01:37.650> soon<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.070> hits<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> water<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
you see soon as it hits the water it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
you see soon as it hits the water it
films<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.119> little<00:01:39.299> baubles<00:01:39.810> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
films and do this little baubles of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.590 
films and do this little baubles of
sugar<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.400> makes<00:01:41.670> me<00:01:41.939> realise<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.270> it's

back to it so the honeycomb has cool
here<00:02:52.430> we<00:02:52.459> have<00:02:52.730> perfect<00:02:53.450> honeycomb<00:02:53.810> Krispies

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
here we have perfect honeycomb Krispies

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.440 
here we have perfect honeycomb Krispies
wow<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:55.160> looks<00:02:55.370> like<00:02:55.519> molten<00:02:55.760> lava<00:02:55.970> or

chocolate layer but why bother you could

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.360 
chocolate layer but why bother you could
bash<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.470> up<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.590> bit<00:03:09.650> more<00:03:09.920> like<00:03:10.099> these<00:03:10.220> are

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
bash it up a bit more like these are

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.729 
bash it up a bit more like these are
gonna<00:03:10.459> find<00:03:10.670> bits<00:03:10.879> here<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:12.140> mix<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.620> through

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
gonna find bits here and mix it through
