00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.639
 Hello, I'm here and this is Mr. 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.630
 panda we continue to collect today 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.969
 arcade machine 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.400
 as you remember in the past video we are all 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.770
 already cut and today we will twist 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.180
 actually a box of parts 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.180
 that were cooked 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.240
 alita 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.240
 das licht 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.710
 of those. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.769
 in fact, this is the case with us 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.230
 It turned out here it is the front panel but it 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.409
 while we have done it here on scotch tape 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.739
 marked out for the exit of all who will 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.530
 there for joystick cartridges 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.740
 so far my work is finished 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.390
 then the whole thing is passing the baton to seryoga 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.399
 because here already strictly speaking 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 need electronic soldering to 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.680
 I didnâ€™t collect it all 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.780
 shoot the very process of soldering this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.610
 adapter which now lies out on 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.460
 the table because it is very long and very 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.460
 chore I find now explain that where 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.050
 soldered here are these two bells 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.050
 the main bells that will be 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.520
 fit the cord from the TV that is here 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.850
 video signals will be suitable here 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 hence the audio signal these two here 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.740
 the lace will be inserted in yes go here 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.659
 this lace all these two pairs 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.770
 bells are designed for 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.350
 so that in one pair here in this connect 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.759
 sony here in this pair to connect 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.320
 any other device they will 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.000
 seen the front panel and that is, you can 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.860
 will connect the VCR or else 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.820
 anything 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.119
 naturally all this switches here 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.119
 this toggle switch 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.410
 now I will explain where to solder on this 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.739
 bells as you can see here 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.049
 here the earth will go 1 foot that is closer to 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:21.430
 finisher and the far leg is 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:24.080
 center respectively 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.660
 if we understand this guy 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.269
 which we have already prepared that is 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.190
 will be the TV we need from every 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.950
 outputs that is from these wires from these 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:45.800
 from these solder the audio signal 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:47.209
 audio and grow alo body te pidaras for 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.690
 to make it all work for us 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.819
 you need to wire the signal here 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.140
 with this wires these here all these 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.670
 that is, respectively, the signal 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.340
 audio audio 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.140
 land audio to land audio signal video 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.910
 from the final video winter video land video 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.250
 without it how does this switch work 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.340
 we stand here to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.660
 choose mode between video tape recorder 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.400
 or some other device 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.709
 which is connected and the front panel and 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.560
 sony playstation which wires which 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.329
 They will have tripe look here in this 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.930
 the position is closed and this one this 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.760
 legs extremely here in this position 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.940
 closed first leg and middle 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.970
 that is 12 or 13 also we will be these 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.590
 two use in order that you can 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.940
 It was at the mass of the front panel to include 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.459
 Prefixes such buttons are not without 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.200
 fixing is the usual button that is it 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.000
 not fixed on as simple as rice and only 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.079
 on will be used for rice this 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.970
 prefixes recognized neighbors and the final 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.959
 Our old point will be built in 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.829
 switch apparently it is 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.079
 old times glove Soviet which 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.560
 will just supply the total current to the whole 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:03.980
 design either turn it off in 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:07.069
 overall time as I tried to make out 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.079
 You are a slot from here. This is an old one. 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.730
 non-working sega in order for it to be possible 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.250
 there was this slot soldered to the front 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:18.459
 panel and insert it into it more precisely 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.459
 map, I steamed with him for two hours 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.660
 I had to cut it completely started 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.430
 already solder wires to it to 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.770
 could have been on the yagud road to work 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:34.669
 solder open i'll we well 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:41.750
 check all some 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:46.610
 this is this new technology and this is 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:49.789
 here and here it in general I already soldered to and 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.080
 the power button here it is 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.250
 the power button will not constantly 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:05:12.919
 only this one will work actively 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:17.150
 check we are not going to just cut that 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.650
 included in general, I was already a button 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.090
 inclusion or for it for both consoles 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.419
 as you have seen 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:26.930
 san test how this whole thing works 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:31.990
 Now the button looks like this 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.580
 there is a recipe for it conjures the same way 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.830
 it stuck in ceases yet 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.229
 we feed because we have to and 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.130
 arrange the front panel and for this 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.320
 will have all the same 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.729
 drag like this button so 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.550
 supply we will insert this button in 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:51.770
 the hole offered to share also will spawn 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.630
 power supply roughly for the very 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.820
 the machine that will be inside 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.550
 this is dandy and shocked here will be 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.180
 The power supply for the TV is inserted and 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:06.200
 it will also be inserted here on the side . 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:10.099
 but also the on / off button 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.940
 trigger clamp these two wires and a button 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.940
 reset squeeze
