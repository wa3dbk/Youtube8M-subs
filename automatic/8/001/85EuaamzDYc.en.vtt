Assassin's Creed unity Alex I just got

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.359 
Assassin's Creed unity Alex I just got
my<00:00:16.720> hands<00:00:16.990> on<00:00:17.080> unity<00:00:17.410> for<00:00:17.590> the<00:00:17.650> first<00:00:17.830> time<00:00:18.070> and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369 
my hands on unity for the first time and

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.310 
my hands on unity for the first time and
I<00:00:18.490> was<00:00:18.609> blown<00:00:18.939> away<00:00:18.970> about<00:00:19.510> how<00:00:19.810> open<00:00:20.230> the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
I was blown away about how open the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.259 
I was blown away about how open the
missions<00:00:20.650> are<00:00:20.830> how<00:00:21.310> different<00:00:21.699> they<00:00:21.789> feel<00:00:22.029> I

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
missions are how different they feel I

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.089 
missions are how different they feel I
think<00:00:22.749> we<00:00:22.839> call<00:00:23.019> them<00:00:23.169> black<00:00:23.439> box<00:00:23.710> missions

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
think we call them black box missions

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.089 
think we call them black box missions
right<00:00:24.310> what<00:00:25.210> does<00:00:25.300> that<00:00:25.390> mean<00:00:25.599> well<00:00:26.560> black<00:00:26.890> box

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
right what does that mean well black box

is<00:01:29.020> a<00:01:29.049> black<00:01:29.290> box<00:01:29.470> mission<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:29.860> reason<00:01:30.130> we

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
is a black box mission the reason we

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.800 
is a black box mission the reason we
went<00:01:30.369> for<00:01:30.579> this<00:01:30.670> strategy<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.149> because<00:01:31.600> we

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
went for this strategy is because we

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.090 
went for this strategy is because we
really<00:01:32.049> wanted<00:01:32.259> these<00:01:32.409> missions<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.920> be

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
really wanted these missions to be

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.069 
really wanted these missions to be
replayable<00:01:33.790> but<00:01:34.329> it's<00:01:34.450> not<00:01:34.600> just<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:34.899> black

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
replayable but it's not just the black

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.230 
replayable but it's not just the black
