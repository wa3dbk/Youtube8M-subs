00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
swallow up again it's the first time as

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
swallow up again it's the first time as
they<00:01:41.490> were<00:01:41.549> dripped<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.689> stove<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.350> is

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
so I tried it on the scrap piece oh yeah

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.880 
so I tried it on the scrap piece oh yeah
those<00:04:33.310> in<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.880> bottom<00:04:34.240> piece<00:04:34.480> it's<00:04:35.320> two<00:04:35.650> feet

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
those in the bottom piece it's two feet

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.490 
those in the bottom piece it's two feet
by<00:04:36.040> two<00:04:36.100> feet<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.820> then<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.000> had<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.419> cut<00:04:37.690> that

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
by two feet so then I had to cut that

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.890 
by two feet so then I had to cut that
radius<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.250> there<00:04:39.460> in<00:04:39.730> an<00:04:39.970> angle<00:04:40.450> on<00:04:40.600> the<00:04:40.690> back

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
radius in there in an angle on the back

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.409 
radius in there in an angle on the back
and<00:04:41.410> then<00:04:41.500> make<00:04:41.710> it<00:04:41.890> fit<00:04:42.310> I<00:04:42.640> actually<00:04:42.910> managed

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
and then make it fit I actually managed

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.840 
and then make it fit I actually managed
to<00:04:43.480> do<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.780> yeah<00:04:44.410> it<00:04:44.470> looks<00:04:44.620> good<00:04:44.800> there's<00:04:45.790> a

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
to do that yeah it looks good there's a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.270 
to do that yeah it looks good there's a
lot<00:04:45.910> of<00:04:46.150> work<00:04:46.300> it<00:04:47.020> was<00:04:47.140> a<00:04:47.200> whole<00:04:47.350> day<00:04:47.620> now<00:04:48.040> yes

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
lot of work it was a whole day now yes

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.330 
lot of work it was a whole day now yes
once<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.820> granite<00:04:49.360> gets<00:04:49.770> heated<00:04:50.770> up<00:04:51.070> it's

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
once that granite gets heated up it's

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.970 
once that granite gets heated up it's
like<00:04:51.580> a<00:04:51.640> thermal<00:04:52.600> mass<00:04:52.840> probably<00:04:53.680> don't<00:04:53.830> what

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
like a thermal mass probably don't what

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.130 
like a thermal mass probably don't what
if<00:04:54.100> it<00:04:54.220> ever<00:04:54.400> heat<00:04:54.640> it<00:04:54.760> up<00:04:54.910> yeah<00:04:55.570> that<00:04:55.840> thing
