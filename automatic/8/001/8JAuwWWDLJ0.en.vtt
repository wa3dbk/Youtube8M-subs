work in the cloud level that's amazing
clouds<00:00:46.250> are<00:00:46.430> low<00:00:46.850> I<00:00:47.239> think<00:00:48.110> clouds<00:00:48.589> are<00:00:48.799> lower

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
clouds are low I think clouds are lower

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.469 
clouds are low I think clouds are lower
in<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:49.400> winter<00:00:49.670> and<00:00:49.699> higher<00:00:49.970> in<00:00:50.150> the<00:00:50.239> summer

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:50.479
