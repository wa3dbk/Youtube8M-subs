00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.359
 in 2005 and steven spielberg came to 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.330
 an agreement to develop three 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:11.120
 videogames the first one and only 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.160
 that went on sale was the blox boom a 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.530
 puzzle game for wii the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.650
 next that was announced and which 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.720
 we will talk today is the element that most 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.290
 Later it would be known by the name of the 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.190
 skype artist lmno was announced through 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.190
 of the next workshop 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.980
 do not 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.290
 and good at the end of this workshop because we 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.020
 they asked a question and is that if a 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.610
 videogame can get you a lot 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.860
 people will seem foolish this 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.110
 question but you have to see it also for 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.600
 the side of what he wanted to tell us 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.880
 is that this game was going to go more to the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.720
 emotional part of the usual not in the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.950
 video game 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.329
 at least that promised 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.979
 what happens is that after this 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.590
 teaser the next news that came out 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.479
 of the game was its constellation and little 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.909
 more was known until it does a little 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.570
 weather matt lions a journalist 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:44.210
 american bona magazine may have 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.730
 information about what I was going to do 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.590
 this game 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.170
 the first thing is that we the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.320
 programming call lincoln and that had 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.440
 helped to escape to eve 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.160
 of a complex price of 51 like 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 you can see 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.210
 efe does not seem entirely human besides 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.860
 the last in the last technical demo that 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.290
 is the engine of the game had the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.940
 pretty special faculties in 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.310
 our protagonist apart since 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.730
 rescues and has to flee from the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.769
 General and Government of the USA 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.049
 the jove that would be of action and 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.030
 first-person platforms but what 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.430
 more interesting in this section would be 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.620
 go since according to the developers of the 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.709
 title she would have would be something 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.110
 never seen graceling with age I do not know 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.209
 they can communicate verbally since they do not 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.250
 they speak the same language so that 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.519
 will start judging lincoln according to his 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.060
 actions so as the 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.610
 she will have a perception of him and 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.380
 will make decisions from there 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.200
 let's put it to put a little more 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.660
 clear the wives imagine that we 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.070
 ask for something easy like opening a door and 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.000
 that we can not fulfill this 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.030
 task 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.980
 then shift would start to think if 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.420
 we really are useful and can 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.820
 that throughout the game we reached 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.190
 abandon or just do not exist much 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.470
 If this would be because the game 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.500
 I had a lot of probability because between 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.110
 departure and departure everything could change 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.890
 so this concept is so innovative and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.780
 so interesting because it was canceled 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.120
 First I must say that after 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.010
 years of development the team that was 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.080
 in charge of this game the only thing 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.530
 could teach her she was a we will do 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.630
 techniques right now from the cafeteria 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.850
 then many sources indicate that 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.980
 I pretended to have a durability of some 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.920
 three hours relying on its gameplay 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.840
 but this was not entirely clear according to 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.700
 it seems there was an internal discussion about 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.280
 the durability of the fire some wanted 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.840
 three hours as we will say based 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.700
 in the regularity of the game but 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.890
 they just want to do it for 12 hours 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.730
 in normal ways 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.380
 then it must also be said that she 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.000
 neither risk attacking this game since 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.340
 I was about to make a hole 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.100
 playable mechanics very similar as it is 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.319
 my rousset so all this together 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.500
 and made her first that he wants 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.600
 try to change the way games 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.140
 this title when I do it more 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.970
 conventional 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.580
 I hope that in the end directly what 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.579
 tired lapse there are chances that 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.040
 this game come back then not because the 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.560
 mystery of this game I wanted to find out 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.740
 what steve and why is he here in this 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.680
 moment and that has already been revealed I do not 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.390
 I'm going to say in this video that yes 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.040
 nothing of that because the best there is still 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.950
 people who have a hope that 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.540
 this game that this game comes out like this 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.940
 that I'm going to have a little bit of respect for 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.470
 these people I will not say anything too 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.390
 the people who are interested are very 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.449
 easy to search online and 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.120
 find it in a moment 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.740
 but good specifically this game I 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.409
 there seems to be an interesting 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.110
 proposed by eads is a game 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:56.999
 that may have given many many say 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.800
 the truth is that what is the title I 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:01.679
 more reminiscent of a quantic project 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.489
 dream development from fahrenheit 'heavy 

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:07.769
 rain 'more than but good in order that 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:10.769
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:05:07.769 --> 00:05:13.559
 canceled number 2 has canceled a 

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:16.849
 number two and we do not believe in more 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.849
 goodbye videos 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.870
 two
