00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 with the retraction of the real estate market 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.940
 this year the focus of material stores 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.370
 construction will be the small 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.210
 consumers who will be able to count on 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.420
 greater facility in credit lines 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.430
 the expectation of 4 and a half percent more 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.449
 the branch of construction material closed 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.740
 2012 with less than 2% growth 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.180
 according to the Brazilian association of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.580
 industry 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.890
 stores sold less than 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.560
 products in stock which represents 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 retail trade is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.660
 reflecting the slowdown in the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.540
 real estate market according to this economist is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.950
 there was a reduction in supply 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.640
 of construction companies 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.520
 especially since they were not 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 extremely leveraged they were able to 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.300
 sell a lot 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.180
 projects but were not able to 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.309
 deliver your business 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.160
 then they had to retract 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.559
 offering new new buildings 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.899
 flats new developments in 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.150
 2013 focus of material stores 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.700
 construction should no longer be the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
 real estate but the final consumer 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.659
 according to economists 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.030
 for the time being there should be no 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.520
 price of building materials but 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.759
 on the other hand they should increase supply 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 and the credit facility for 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.110
 financing we will have a record 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.189
 of the supply of credit for the 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.380
 construction 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.570
 This is going to be very good for all of us. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.549
 both for the construction of new real estate 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 as for those families that 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.610
 want to make their reforms in their 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.460
 houses 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.310
 and that is what bets the nivaldo and luciana 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.220
 the couple already does difficult price research 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.020
 and tiles intends to seek financing 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.369
 to renovate the kitchen 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.979
 We are really looking forward to doing this. 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.850
 reform and this facility will 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.430
 be easier pannu is a 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.040
 a fee that I have as 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.299
 satisfied is because if it was not for the 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.729
 financing would not be enough to 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.580
 how is it not only totally 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.610
 partially the value would be beyond my 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.610
 and it is not good for us to invade
