00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
 the idea is bold but the effect and 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 set of students are about to 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.700
 but before they do that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.849
 asks the traffic jams oh the cent one last 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.529
 social psychological question suppose there 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 a bunker clips with an atomic waste 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.600
 like LEDs place is for 10 people 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.630
 which 10 people out of 20 students 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.880
 this may in bunker but note so on 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.960
 and what is important and where can you be 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.039
 they also based 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.039
 the philosophers 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.260
 audience 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.260
 for whom it may also 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 the doperse state is pregnant 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.949
 who is not philosophy and 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.120
 you have the operation of the left video 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.329
 like it 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.329
 show 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.440
 in the shop 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.180
 John Hurdles is the director 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.880
 writer and percent of this film 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.830
 John was the last time in 1998 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.340
 bumps and many directed and wrote 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.930
 anyway was in 1998 last time that Jan. 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.810
 sleeve was officially involved in a 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.909
 film project actor james d'arcy who this 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.470
 movie is very play with play the two 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.690
 years ago in the springy domino effect 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.820
 and this was directed by the 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.180
 Dutch director Sarah van der 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.420
 oest 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.149
 wim philosophers with on August 21, 2013 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.310
 smell shows during fantasy 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.200
 film festival in germany and united 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.750
 states or more l'm not called the movie 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.240
 saviors but after the dark 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.310
 and and brazil that kid if through 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.979
 apocalypse in the croatian altogether 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.590
 madhouse and that I can write in particular 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.360
 broke and broke the translation 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.429
 looked up and that was like darkness 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.710
 I don't get two stars for the movie 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.090
 the philosophers was evil movie locations 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.280
 very bold and up to and including the first 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.020
 experiment in the film is also very 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.030
 interesting your brain is stimulated 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.860
 just think what would i do 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.660
 after that is a sort of accumulation of 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.480
 weird plot twists on one 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.970
 game rules when invented and it becomes one 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.849
 a kind of weird brew of all kinds 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.140
 additional things that actually make it 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.510
 entire social experiment 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 interesting is the end with one 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.959
 conclusion on which you are actually sitting 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.730
 waiting was the conclusion of this 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.640
 social psychic 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.910
 experiment then that conclusion is 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.650
 state independent of the social 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.650
 So add the experiment 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.670
 see what is it 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.019
