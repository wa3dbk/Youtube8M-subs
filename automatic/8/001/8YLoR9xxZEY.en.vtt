00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello everyone how good this video 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.340
 wants to do because there has been a 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.600
 Subscriber who asked me a question 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.789
 and it's something that I already took for granted and 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.010
 I noticed that now some people 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.579
 who does not know but of course it is something 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.240
 that I see so simple because there was no 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:31.220
 fallen in to explain it 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.220
 The question is 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.090
 Aitor told me 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.879
 OK 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.909
 an editor tells me hello how good you 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.670
 I asked a question on the channel 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.440
 youtube which I follow but maybe very 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.899
 good by the way how to regulate the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.489
 temperature for Snake will see and 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.050
 long ago I have a ball python and with 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.909
 the thermal plate or plate from which 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.339
 shopping stores the only thing I did 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.260
 was to burn the snake by the way 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.519
 seen a method that is used on people and 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.590
 is to buy the stickers by themselves 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.659
 thermal and do all the assembly 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.979
 especially people who have racks 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.970
 you know where to get those stickers 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.970
 thanks greetings 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.219
 logically you have to have a plate 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.110
 thermal but what you have that needs 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.530
 basically it's a thermostat worth 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.530
 so 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.530
 once you have the thermal plate 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.060
 the technical plate is not going to regulate 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.159
 32 degrees you need with the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.039
 temperature you need by art of 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.409
 magic you need a probe a thermostat 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.170
 as a symptom this car with a probe 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.420
 then he told me okay but like the 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.069
 fudge to put it on the thermostat 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.009
 fudge none if the thermostat itself 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.109
 goes with a plug then this is a 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.429
 internal theme very old treatment 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.959
 I do not use it for the snake what 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.880
 I use for the breeding room of 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:53.549
 rats so that the temperature does not go down 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.829
 too much so they do not get cold 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.079
 then this comes with a probe this 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:01.300
 probe in which it measures the temperature of 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.240
 what they want to measure then 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.310
 you take the plate from the plate you can 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.900
 find different sizes of 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.320
 different powers and different 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.140
 brands with a power of 16 watts that 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.560
 is this kim is enough to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.420
 get to 32 degrees is worth then what 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.580
 place go down the terrarium 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.160
 the plate if it's like a sticker the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.010
 you can hit the base or you can paste it 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.140
 to the work table or to the surface 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.640
 what's below what you want 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.530
 if you stick it the work surface is 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.990
 easier then remove the tupper because 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.380
 you do not take the plate with you 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.640
 so if you are going to measure for example this 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.830
 side place the probe 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.510
 you connect the current with the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.990
 instructions the regular ones at 32 degrees 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.310
 so that it is always at 32 degrees 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.500
 and this what is going to measure you 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.040
 temperature and this is put in the base not 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.760
 put it up on a wall 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.890
 is the base 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.540
 and that's how the temperature regulates the 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.269
 thermostat what you are going to do is plug 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.879
 the plate or turn off the plate so that 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.049
 always be regulating the 32 if you 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.829
 plug the board directly into the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.269
 current 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.129
 the plate will be all the time casting 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.280
 heat and heat heat and at the end normal 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.450
 that I told myself I decided everything in a message 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.510
 it says you could be frying 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.060
 fried eggs clear that if it's 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.709
 plugged in is always acquiring 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.359
 temperature and temperature and at the end 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.590
 This one is going to burn the snake like 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.200
 He said 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.810
 even being this tupper a bit 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.489
 raised without touching the plate arrives 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.980
 perfectly at 32 degrees is to say that 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:40.040
 with a 16 watt plate you come from 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.040
 over to 32 4 the only thing we do not have 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.980
 so much good is not this is a bit 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.739
 antique and of course I'll need it 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.700
 plug in if you put to 32 degrees and already what 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.650
 you have vale 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.810
 Well, actors, but do not go to 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.370
 burn snakes from now on like this 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.810
 what a good greeting and in this video is 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.910
 basically the one to solve that doubt 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.170
 in case someone else doubted how 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.690
 do it because in the tutorial it says 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.400
 of python ball do not explain why 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.569
 I do for fact 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.569
 nothing more and see you later
