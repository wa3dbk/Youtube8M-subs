and<00:03:19.450> a<00:03:20.100> transmitter<00:03:21.300> someone<00:03:22.300> tell<00:03:22.540> us<00:03:24.270> fpv

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
and a transmitter someone tell us fpv

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:32.980 
and a transmitter someone tell us fpv
antenna<00:03:27.420> my<00:03:28.420> transmitter<00:03:29.140> antenna

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:32.990 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:40.600 

and<00:03:34.180> clamps<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.480> charge<00:03:37.960> my<00:03:38.960> batteries<00:03:39.830> that's

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
and clamps to charge my batteries that's

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.060 
and clamps to charge my batteries that's
for<00:03:40.790> my<00:03:40.910> battery<00:03:41.270> charger<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:42.620> is<00:03:42.770> a<00:03:42.800> battery

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
for my battery charger this is a battery

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.630 
for my battery charger this is a battery
charger<00:03:44.590> batteries<00:03:45.590> i<00:03:45.830> could<00:03:46.010> put<00:03:46.220> two<00:03:46.490> in

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
charger batteries i could put two in

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.330 
charger batteries i could put two in
there<00:03:47.260> one<00:03:48.260> that's<00:03:48.800> already<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.160> the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
there one that's already in the

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.310 
there one that's already in the
quadcopter<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.270> that's<00:03:50.480> three<00:03:51.050> you<00:03:51.200> could

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
quadcopter so that's three you could

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.260 
quadcopter so that's three you could
probably<00:03:51.500> fit<00:03:51.950> more<00:03:52.190> depending<00:03:52.790> how<00:03:52.880> you<00:03:52.910> set

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
probably fit more depending how you set

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.570 
probably fit more depending how you set
it<00:03:53.360> up<00:03:53.530> my<00:03:54.530> goggles<00:03:54.980> so<00:03:57.040> that's<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.280> bottom

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
it up my goggles so that's the bottom

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.970 
it up my goggles so that's the bottom
part<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.290> i'm<00:04:00.290> pretty<00:04:00.380> sure<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:00.590> could<00:04:00.740> fit

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
part and i'm pretty sure you could fit

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.740 
part and i'm pretty sure you could fit
more<00:04:01.160> stuff<00:04:01.490> in<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:01.730> it's<00:04:02.090> just<00:04:02.240> this<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.540> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
more stuff in that it's just this is the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.910 
more stuff in that it's just this is the
way<00:04:02.870> i<00:04:02.900> wanted<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.880> and<00:04:04.880> like<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.810> said<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.860> is

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
way i wanted it and like I said this is

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.740 
way i wanted it and like I said this is
from<00:04:07.490> MCS<00:04:08.090> electronics<00:04:08.780> for<00:04:09.850> 44<00:04:10.850> bucks<00:04:11.090> fifty

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
from MCS electronics for 44 bucks fifty

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.740 
from MCS electronics for 44 bucks fifty
dollars<00:04:11.780> shift<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:13.550> it's<00:04:14.090> pretty<00:04:14.270> good<00:04:14.540> it

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
dollars shift and it's pretty good it

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.430 
dollars shift and it's pretty good it
has<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.250> valve<00:04:16.250> right<00:04:16.670> here<00:04:16.730> I<00:04:17.299> don't<00:04:18.200> know<00:04:18.290> what

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
has a valve right here I don't know what

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.960 
has a valve right here I don't know what
this<00:04:18.590> is<00:04:18.650> for<00:04:19.010> i<00:04:19.070> guess<00:04:19.160> that's<00:04:19.280> for<00:04:19.670> pressure

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
this is for i guess that's for pressure

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.580 
this is for i guess that's for pressure
or<00:04:20.270> something<00:04:24.460> comes<00:04:25.460> for<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.700> phone<00:04:26.590> home

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
or something comes for the phone home

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:35.380 
or something comes for the phone home
clock<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.880> looks<00:04:32.150> like<00:04:32.360> it's<00:04:32.570> a<00:04:34.390> water

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
clock it looks like it's a water

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.330 
clock it looks like it's a water
resistant<00:04:36.050> because<00:04:36.170> that's<00:04:36.500> rubber<00:04:36.770> seal

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
resistant because that's rubber seal

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.280 
resistant because that's rubber seal
right<00:04:37.670> there<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:41.510> yep<00:04:41.720> if<00:04:41.900> you're<00:04:42.020> looking<00:04:42.260> for

right there so yep if you're looking for
a<00:04:42.440> quadcopter<00:04:42.830> case<00:04:43.400> go<00:04:44.180> to<00:04:44.210> MCM<00:04:44.660> electronics

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
a quadcopter case go to MCM electronics

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.230 
a quadcopter case go to MCM electronics
they<00:04:45.470> are<00:04:45.770> very<00:04:45.800> cheap<00:04:46.280> they<00:04:46.850> have<00:04:46.970> different

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
they are very cheap they have different

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.450 
they are very cheap they have different
sizes<00:04:47.930> this<00:04:48.230> is<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.500> largest<00:04:48.860> one<00:04:49.130> I<00:04:49.280> could

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
sizes this is the largest one I could

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.120 
sizes this is the largest one I could
find<00:04:49.660> well<00:04:50.660> lengthwise<00:04:51.260> anyway<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.980> like<00:04:54.980> I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
find well lengthwise anyway and like I

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.270 
find well lengthwise anyway and like I
said<00:04:55.190> you<00:04:55.580> would<00:04:55.730> have<00:04:55.910> to<00:04:56.090> have<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.510> folding

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
said you would have to have a folding

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.030 
said you would have to have a folding
quadcopter<00:04:58.280> frame<00:04:58.580> or<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:59.200> 330<00:05:00.200> size<00:05:00.560> frame<00:05:01.010> i

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
quadcopter frame or a 330 size frame i

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.400 
quadcopter frame or a 330 size frame i
believe<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.730> fit<00:05:01.970> in<00:05:02.210> here<00:05:02.510> anything<00:05:02.990> larger

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
believe to fit in here anything larger

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.470 
believe to fit in here anything larger
than<00:05:03.440> that<00:05:03.800> like<00:05:03.980> a<00:05:04.040> 450<00:05:04.790> that<00:05:04.940> doesn't<00:05:05.270> fold

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
than that like a 450 that doesn't fold

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.090 
than that like a 450 that doesn't fold
it's<00:05:05.720> not<00:05:05.930> going<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.170> fan<00:05:06.380> this<00:05:06.650> case<00:05:06.890> is

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
it's not going to fan this case is

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.230 
it's not going to fan this case is
pretty<00:05:07.310> sturdy<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:09.440> as<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.670> handled<00:05:11.120> right

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
pretty sturdy and as I handled right

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.930 
pretty sturdy and as I handled right
there<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.900> nothing<00:05:12.530> moves<00:05:13.240> inside<00:05:15.730> just<00:05:16.730> want

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
there and nothing moves inside just want

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:36.000 
there and nothing moves inside just want
