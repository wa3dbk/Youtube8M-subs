yeah he's kind of a front line kind of

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.079 
yeah he's kind of a front line kind of
you<00:05:03.749> know<00:05:03.779> squid<00:05:04.439> but<00:05:05.159> you<00:05:05.490> know<00:05:05.610> he's<00:05:06.059> just

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:06.089

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:14.999 
because they just blow up everything but

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:17.119 
because they just blow up everything but
still<00:05:15.300> explosive<00:05:16.289> spreads<00:05:16.529> not<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.949> next

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
still explosive spreads not the next

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.260 
still explosive spreads not the next
