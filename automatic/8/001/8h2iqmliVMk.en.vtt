that I saw that engine splits away

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.679 
that I saw that engine splits away
because<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.380> car<00:01:40.770> caught<00:01:40.979> fire<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.509> thing

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.130 
in it I mean it's bit early but you
thinking<00:02:31.880> about<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.240> mindset<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.720> getting

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
thinking about the mindset of getting

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.450 
thinking about the mindset of getting
back<00:02:33.290> into<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.620> these<00:02:33.710> cars<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.070> can<00:02:34.340> do

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
back into one of these cars that can do

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.940 
back into one of these cars that can do
that<00:02:34.670> explain<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.540> I'd<00:02:36.350> get<00:02:36.530> back<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.830> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300

loose um honestly it's just one of those

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.820 
loose um honestly it's just one of those
things<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.780> goes<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.200> show<00:02:45.230> how<00:02:45.410> strong<00:02:45.470> they

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.690 
are yes it was scary and yes that's the
chance<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.470> take<00:02:48.680> when<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.920> Drive<00:02:49.370> one<00:02:49.460> of<00:02:49.580> these

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
chance I take when I Drive one of these

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.970

cars<00:02:49.970> it's<00:02:50.120> what<00:02:50.270> I<00:02:50.300> do<00:02:50.420> and<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.710> know<00:02:51.830> it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
cars it's what I do and you know it's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.470 
cars it's what I do and you know it's
probably<00:02:52.220> more<00:02:52.310> dangerous<00:02:52.730> riding<00:02:52.910> horses<00:02:53.270> or

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
probably more dangerous riding horses or

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.600 
probably more dangerous riding horses or
something<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.870> so<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:55.190> just<00:02:55.220> have<00:02:55.580> to

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
something like that so you just have to

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.980 
something like that so you just have to
put<00:02:55.820> it<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.000> one<00:02:56.120> side<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.720> healthy

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
put it to one side and have a healthy

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.750 
put it to one side and have a healthy
respect<00:02:57.140> for<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:57.680> move<00:02:57.860> on<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.280> keep

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760
