00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.129
 anton 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.030
 and the right to read 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.030
 So 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.690
 he bribe 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.870
 so you 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.870
 experience 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.120
 who is it 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.530
 to come in 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.530
 exhale exhale exhale 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.090
 Alexander i was except 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.790
 It has become a good tradition that we hold 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.590
 twice a year master classes 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.640
 the first workshops that were were 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.400
 master class turbulence 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.780
 perfectionism and the connection between them here 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.320
 such a focus that you show people 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.360
 how I am afraid to fly what are you afraid 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.340
 turbulence tell perfectionist 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.600
 so you have to know people donâ€™t understand 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.610
 how can you bind turbulence and 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.940
 nip tied up a hundred percent you 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.290
 did a master class take off and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.369
 This is today's workshop we decided 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.369
 merge two topics into one 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.990
 workshops are designed for two 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.070
 categories of citizens 1 categories of citizens 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.469
 these are our graduates 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.049
 because graduates master classes 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:25.909
 help even deeper even more serious than 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:29.689
 better understand understand with aviation up understand 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.220
 those things that during normal courses are not 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.470
 understand deep enough 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.840
 that is, for graduates it is good 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.710
 opportunity to meet exchange 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.319
 by some 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.000
 experiences ask some questions and find out 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.979
 even better and deeper then actually 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.229
 saying why we all met 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.270
 the second category is our newcomers immediately 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.399
 I say this is very important for beginners 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.759
 guys these are master classes 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.069
 will not solve the problem aero background. 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.140
 if you were counting on something like that 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.490
 This problem is solved only 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.409
 because you came to the master class 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.849
 just a bunch of water I will explain that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.270
 weather or not dangerous stop fear 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.829
 to fly 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.329
 no I need to understand it now 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.829
 I speak only for beginners for 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.959
 those who have not been on any 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:13.880
 people aerophobia mental disorder 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.950
 no matter how nasty it is to tell me 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 how would you not like to think that 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.579
 it's because the planes are bad pilots 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.350
 drunk just mega wary and just not 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:23.870
 so I'm afraid to fly 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.420
 no aerophobia that mental 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.060
 disorder and as the name suggests 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.970
 this story this aero phobia is not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.560
 called aero logic aero caution 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.030
 or ira common sense is to call names 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.400
 fabi aerophobia is defined as 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.030
 mental disorder any form 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.850
 so mate 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.150
 the only thing that can solve the problem 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.720
 mental disorder is therapy 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.329
 master class therapy 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.350
 not what we call newbies for 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.859
 on these master class 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.750
 we call newbies for one purpose give you 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.000
 opportunity and get involved in the log in process 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.680
 this because this is the biggest 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.480
 problem of all the airports of the world for 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.359
 Information 30 percent of the people in the world 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.430
 suffer aerophobia 30 of them are turning 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.000
 professional help zero, zero 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.799
 zero one percent i.e. the rest all 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.430
 live in captivity 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.359
 beliefs my case is unique to me 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.639
 nothing will help 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.989
 my friends this is one of the problems that 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.699
 were to some and gathered here 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.460
 because i want to end this 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.560
 at the end of this course you might know 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.300
 open the window look say today 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.530
 that will be that that that that that in flight 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.050
 for example 0 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.790
 ok what do we mean by word 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.820
 weather in general what we mean by 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.390
 the word is bad weather or not in aviation 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.160
 bad weather up there is bad weather for 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.100
 and rafo bafta that showed you a picture 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.630
 nice nice wonderful way 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.870
 understand what is it that is very bad 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.630
 weather for and rfog why are aware and so 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.840
 what is the weather like that first 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.580
 precipitation before naturally it is raining and snowing 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.830
 this cloudy clouds are low 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.230
 yard day says there are still high 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.570
 vertical know summer such dishes 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.760
 such threats 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.410
 menacing words thunderstorms problems with 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.980
 all that limits the visibility of the date 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.470
 visibility to the pilot is fog haze smog 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.210
 every year 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.680
 wind them too weather phenomenon wind 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.970
 call which counter passing 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.890
 side there is a terrible thing called 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.970
 venture 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.360
 all immediately alerted yes I will tell 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.780
 about everything 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.490
 nothing I hide the number there are such 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.060
 the rarest phenomenon like hurricanes and tornadoes and 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.310
 tornado volcanic eruption is essentially 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.260
 types of aviation weather which of these 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.320
 weather and dangerous to be Rafo 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.450
 what's dangerous in reality let's share 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.010
 as we always say in the guys courses 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.370
 We start from the fact that we start to divide 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.120
 cutlets separately here I am money because 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.800
 if if 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.870
 if we in the head count count are mixed 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.350
 that is, I'm afraid to fly, which means it 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.870
 dangerous growth look i'm afraid all all 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.280
 mixed oblonskie house all is well 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.410
 such in such condition to fly very 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.060
 difficult really realizing that this is real 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.490
 danger not fig not so much 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.630
 fear 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.130
 cloudiness for the aircraft is of course for 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.580
 Arabs are very dangerous for two reasons 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.320
 firstly the plane does not see where to fly 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.320
 The second reason in the clouds is also a crack 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.230
 this is two factors and shakes and does not see 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:24.500
 where to fly it is completely dangerous 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:26.480
 eyes it is really simple and aviation 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.330
 bombed hello do i want aquarius vodka 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.539
 bullet 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.139
 these red red marks from not that 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.909
 other than 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.909
 gas clouds for now
