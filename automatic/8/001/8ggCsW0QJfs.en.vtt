00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
rigged this past when they when they

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:51.999 
rigged this past when they when they
call<00:01:50.750> for<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:50.989> past<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:51.530> like<00:01:51.679> it's<00:01:51.860> rigged

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
call for the past it's like it's rigged

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.830 
call for the past it's like it's rigged
to<00:01:52.190> go<00:01:52.310> in<00:01:52.459> no<00:01:52.670> one<00:01:52.789> times<00:01:53.000> out<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.179> ten<00:01:53.420> because

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
to go in no one times out of ten because

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.109 
to go in no one times out of ten because
I<00:01:54.050> don't<00:01:54.259> usually<00:01:55.009> point<00:01:55.429> that<00:01:55.610> often<00:01:55.789> but

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
I don't usually point that often but

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.089 
I don't usually point that often but
when<00:01:56.209> they<00:01:56.270> do<00:01:56.420> boy<00:01:57.229> if<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.410> got<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.679> pass<00:01:57.890> it

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
when they do boy if you got a pass it

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:59.979 
when they do boy if you got a pass it
because<00:01:58.340> you'll<00:01:58.670> more<00:01:59.239> than<00:01:59.270> likely<00:01:59.420> score

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
because you'll more than likely score

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.410 
because you'll more than likely score

and in this example I'm gonna zoom in
look<00:02:02.810> at<00:02:02.959> whammies<00:02:03.349> he's<00:02:04.130> halfway<00:02:04.459> there<00:02:04.910> but

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
look at whammies he's halfway there but

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.880 
look at whammies he's halfway there but
it's<00:02:05.330> facing<00:02:05.569> towards<00:02:06.050> go<00:02:06.200> on<00:02:06.319> my<00:02:06.470> opinion
