but<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.239> was<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.720> big<00:02:13.230> fight<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.680> guess

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
but it was a big fight and I guess

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.570 
but it was a big fight and I guess
wanted<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> give<00:02:14.370> him<00:02:14.520> every<00:02:14.700> opportunity<00:02:15.470> so

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
wanted to give him every opportunity so

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.390 
wanted to give him every opportunity so
anyway<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.760> VIP<00:02:18.200> opinion<00:02:19.200> is<00:02:19.290> split<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.800> Lucas

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
anyway the VIP opinion is split on Lucas

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.890 
anyway the VIP opinion is split on Lucas
would<00:02:20.550> see<00:02:20.670> somewhere<00:02:21.120> he<00:02:21.239> can<00:02:21.420> go<00:02:21.599> in<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
would see somewhere he can go in the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.270 
would see somewhere he can go in the
welterweight<00:02:22.110> division<00:02:22.349> a<00:02:22.830> lot<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.040> people

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
who have moved up I think could be okay

who have moved up I think could be okay
but<00:03:39.450> if<00:03:39.959> when<00:03:40.410> Danny<00:03:40.620> Garcia<00:03:40.829> does<00:03:41.220> move<00:03:41.489> up

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
but if when Danny Garcia does move up

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.330 
but if when Danny Garcia does move up
and<00:03:41.910> Adrian<00:03:42.780> Brown<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.079> moving<00:03:43.350> down<00:03:43.560> to<00:03:43.769> 140

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and Adrian Brown is moving down to 140

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.629 
and Adrian Brown is moving down to 140
then<00:03:45.269> him<00:03:45.870> again<00:03:46.590> there<00:03:47.069> is<00:03:47.220> definitely<00:03:47.609> a

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:47.639 
then him again there is definitely a

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.250 
then him again there is definitely a
case<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.970> be<00:03:48.060> made<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.269> it'd<00:03:48.780> be<00:03:48.930> better<00:03:48.959> for

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
case to be made that it'd be better for

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.809 
case to be made that it'd be better for
Lucas<00:03:49.530> Matthysse<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.950> stay<00:03:50.100> at<00:03:50.220> 140<00:03:50.639> because

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
Lucas Matthysse to stay at 140 because

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.460 
Lucas Matthysse to stay at 140 because
oh<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.359> only<00:03:51.569> person<00:03:51.840> that's<00:03:51.989> gonna<00:03:52.049> be<00:03:52.260> there

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
oh the only person that's gonna be there

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.430 
oh the only person that's gonna be there
really<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:54.049> Adrien<00:03:55.049> Broner

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
really is Adrien Broner

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.229 
really is Adrien Broner
and<00:03:55.980> that's<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.549> most<00:03:56.849> people<00:03:57.150> would

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
and that's it and most people would

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.879 
and that's it and most people would
probably<00:03:57.389> pick<00:03:57.750> Lucas<00:03:58.170> would<00:03:58.470> cease<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.650> be<00:03:58.769> a

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
probably pick Lucas would cease to be a

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.289 
probably pick Lucas would cease to be a
jabronis<00:03:59.459> so<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.239> might<00:04:00.450> be<00:04:00.510> wiser<00:04:01.290> for<00:04:02.090> him<00:04:03.090> to

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
jabronis so it might be wiser for him to

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.780 
jabronis so it might be wiser for him to
drop<00:04:03.900> back<00:04:04.019> down<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.410> 140<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.040> try<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.609> be<00:04:05.670> the
