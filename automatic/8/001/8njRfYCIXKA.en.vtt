this is actually bigger than I thought

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.810 
this is actually bigger than I thought
it<00:03:22.280> would<00:03:22.400> be

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
it would be

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.180 
it would be
let<00:03:22.940> me<00:03:23.290> quickly<00:03:24.290> get<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:26.200> we<00:03:27.200> took<00:03:27.380> compared<00:03:27.830> to

let me quickly get a we took compared to

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.479 
let me quickly get a we took compared to
a<00:03:28.570> 747<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:31.280> let<00:03:31.760> me<00:03:31.850> quickly<00:03:32.030> grab<00:03:32.750> a<00:03:32.930> Saab<00:03:33.200> 340

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:47.860 

here<00:03:43.959> okay<00:03:45.519> so<00:03:46.519> there's<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.790> little<00:03:47.120> size

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
here okay so there's a little size

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.710 
here okay so there's a little size
reference<00:03:48.730> um<00:03:50.680> here<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.769> is<00:03:51.890> compared<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.489> a

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
reference um here it is compared to a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.610 
reference um here it is compared to a
747<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.769> compared<00:03:55.070> to<00:03:55.160> yourself<00:03:55.580> 340<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.620> um

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
747 and compared to yourself 340 and um

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.600 
747 and compared to yourself 340 and um
so<00:03:57.830> yeah<00:03:58.250> it's<00:03:58.489> it's<00:03:59.769> actually<00:04:00.769> bigger<00:04:01.400> than<00:04:01.580> I
