questions in regards to duplicating

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.290 
questions in regards to duplicating
scenes<00:00:08.179> as<00:00:09.179> well<00:00:09.389> as<00:00:09.510> your<00:00:09.660> patterns<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.920> um

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
scenes as well as your patterns so um

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.150 
scenes as well as your patterns so um
cuz<00:00:12.300> well<00:00:12.480> sounds<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.620> might<00:00:13.769> as<00:00:13.860> well<00:00:13.980> do

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
cuz well sounds so we might as well do

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.220 
cuz well sounds so we might as well do
it<00:00:14.190> all<00:00:14.429> right<00:00:14.820> quick<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.870> let's<00:00:16.049> say<00:00:16.109> if<00:00:16.170> we

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
it all right quick so let's say if we

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.689 
it all right quick so let's say if we
want<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> duplicate<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.859> scene<00:00:17.070> here's<00:00:17.609> from

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
want to duplicate the scene here's from

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.519 
want to duplicate the scene here's from
the<00:00:17.789> hardware<00:00:18.029> controller<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:19.230> hold<00:00:19.439> down

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the hardware controller if I hold down

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.800 
the hardware controller if I hold down
the<00:00:19.770> scene<00:00:19.980> button<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.570> have

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
the scene button here you see I have

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.300 
the scene button here you see I have
this<00:00:21.930> option<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.320> for<00:00:22.590> my<00:00:22.680> scene<00:00:22.949> banks

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
this option here for my scene banks

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.500 
this option here for my scene banks
here's<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:23.640> scenes<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.090> show<00:00:24.269> up<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.420> your

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
here's your scenes they show up in your

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.810 
here's your scenes they show up in your
pad<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.380> say<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.740> have<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.010> pad<00:00:26.250> selected

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
pad so say if I have this pad selected

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.890 
pad so say if I have this pad selected
you<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> starts<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.199> flash<00:00:28.820> or<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:30.750> might

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
you see it starts to flash or you might

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.359 
you see it starts to flash or you might
not<00:00:31.050> see<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> camera<00:00:31.650> now<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.219> that

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
not see it on the camera now but that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.150 
not see it on the camera now but that
pad<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.790> flashing<00:00:33.200> so<00:00:34.200> now<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.770> duplicate

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
pad is flashing so now we can duplicate

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.290 
pad is flashing so now we can duplicate
a<00:00:35.219> scene<00:00:35.750> okay<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.640> you<00:00:38.640> also<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:39.059> add<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
a scene okay so you also can add a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.270 
a scene okay so you also can add a
pattern<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.290> scene<00:00:40.620> by<00:00:40.800> selecting<00:00:41.190> this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
pattern to that scene by selecting this

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520 
pattern to that scene by selecting this
icon<00:00:41.460> here<00:00:42.000> so<00:00:42.180> I'll<00:00:42.870> say<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.200> hide<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
icon here so I'll say if I hide on

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.700 
icon here so I'll say if I hide on
duplicate<00:00:44.010> scene<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:46.050> highlight<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:46.469> pad

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
duplicate scene and I highlight my pad

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 
duplicate scene and I highlight my pad
it<00:00:46.980> will<00:00:47.100> start<00:00:47.280> flashing<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.660> will

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it will start flashing and then I will

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.240 
it will start flashing and then I will
go<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> another<00:00:49.140> scene<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.829> see<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> says

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
go to another scene you see it says

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.150 
go to another scene you see it says
pattern<00:00:50.550> 1<00:00:51.170> up<00:00:52.170> there<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.620> basically<00:00:52.980> it's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
pattern 1 up there so basically it's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.200 
pattern 1 up there so basically it's
duplicating<00:00:53.760> pattern<00:00:54.570> 1<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.469> undo<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
duplicating pattern 1 so if I undo that

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.549 
duplicating pattern 1 so if I undo that
and<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.719> guy<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> press<00:00:58.289> add<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and I go to this guy and I press add a

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.760 
and I go to this guy and I press add a
pattern<00:00:59.210> ok<00:01:00.210> so<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.230> duplicating<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
pattern ok so now it's duplicating the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
pattern ok so now it's duplicating the
same<00:01:01.980> plus<00:01:02.219> ad<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.670> pattern<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.300> touched

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
same plus ad in the pattern I touched

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.710 
same plus ad in the pattern I touched
the<00:01:04.019> pad<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:05.129> begins<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> light<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.939> okay<00:01:06.659> so

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the pad it begins to light up okay so

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.039 
the pad it begins to light up okay so
now<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.710> simply<00:01:07.950> touch<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> pad<00:01:09.049> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
now I just simply touch the pad that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.840 
now I just simply touch the pad that
were<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.290> scene<00:01:10.560> 2<00:01:11.689> with<00:01:12.689> pattern<00:01:13.170> 2<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:14.220> scene

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
were on scene 2 with pattern 2 or scene

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020 
were on scene 2 with pattern 2 or scene
3<00:01:15.320> with<00:01:16.320> pattern<00:01:16.710> 3<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.610> that's<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> way<00:01:17.939> you

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
3 with pattern 3 so that's the way you

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
3 with pattern 3 so that's the way you
do<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.360> non-destructive<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> UH

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
do that non-destructive of the UH

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.789 
do that non-destructive of the UH
the<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.330> scenes<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.380> let's<00:01:22.590> go<00:01:22.650> ahead<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the other scenes so let's go ahead and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.880 
the other scenes so let's go ahead and
do<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.040> pattern<00:01:23.759> right<00:01:23.939> quick<00:01:24.740> all<00:01:25.740> right

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
do a a pattern right quick all right

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.780 
do a a pattern right quick all right
here's<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> pattern<00:01:26.330> let's<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:27.509> ahead<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:28.790> let

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
here's a pattern let's go ahead in let

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.010 
here's a pattern let's go ahead in let
me<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.939> ahead<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.119> delete<00:01:30.360> those<00:01:30.570> ones<00:01:30.840> off

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
me go ahead and delete those ones off

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.109 
me go ahead and delete those ones off
right<00:01:31.350> quick<00:01:32.720> so<00:01:33.720> let's<00:01:33.750> say<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.020> example<00:01:35.119> if

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
right quick so let's say for example if

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
right quick so let's say for example if
I<00:01:36.270> want<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> duplicate<00:01:36.930> some<00:01:36.990> patterns<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
I want to duplicate some patterns and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
I want to duplicate some patterns and
we'll<00:01:38.850> take<00:01:39.060> three<00:01:39.420> off<00:01:39.720> we'll<00:01:40.020> take<00:01:40.200> two<00:01:40.409> off

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we'll take three off we'll take two off

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960 
we'll take three off we'll take two off
we'll<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.250> we'll<00:01:41.579> start<00:01:41.850> from

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
we'll just do one we'll start from

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.899 
we'll just do one we'll start from
scratch<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.890> I'm<00:01:43.890> holding<00:01:44.189> down<00:01:44.220> pattern

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
scratch so I'm holding down pattern

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.020 
scratch so I'm holding down pattern
I<00:01:45.200> locked<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> pattern<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.850> here

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
I locked a pattern in like so I'm here

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.960 
I locked a pattern in like so I'm here
