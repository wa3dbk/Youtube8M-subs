well<00:03:37.739> we've<00:03:38.160> had<00:03:38.190> an<00:03:38.400> idea<00:03:38.549> of<00:03:38.850> jumping<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
well we've had an idea of jumping the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900 
well we've had an idea of jumping the
brighton<00:03:40.170> pier<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.860> like<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.130> ramp<00:03:41.430> each<00:03:41.640> side

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
brighton pier with like a ramp each side

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.690 
brighton pier with like a ramp each side
and<00:03:42.260> but<00:03:43.260> obviously<00:03:43.980> everything<00:03:44.280> costs<00:03:44.640> a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
and but obviously everything costs a

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.830 
and but obviously everything costs a
little<00:03:44.820> bit<00:03:44.940> more

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
