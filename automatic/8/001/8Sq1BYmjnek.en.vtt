00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.920
Today I will be making creamy spinach pasta.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580
This is a delicious dish.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.680
Pasta with fresh spinach and with rich creamy sauce.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.740
This looks and taste great.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.680
This recipe will serve 2-3.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600
For this recipe we need:

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.600
6 oz or 1.5 cups of penne pasta.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.860
To cook the pasta, we need

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.160
1 tablespoon of oil

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.960
And 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.840
For creamy sauce, we need

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.920
2 tablespoons of olive oil

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.660
2 tablespoons all purpose flour (maida or plain flour)

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.060
1 teaspoon of dry basil

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.280
1 teaspoon of Italian herbs

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.740
1/4 teaspoon of red chilli flakes

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.120
1/8 teaspoon of black pepper

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.240
1/2 teaspoon of salt

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280
1 cup of milk

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.460
1 cup of heavy cream

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.100
1/4 cup of mozzarella cheese

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.380
And 6 oz or 2 cups of chopped spinach.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.260
Before chopping take out all the stems.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.180
Water is boiling on medium high.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.860
I have 6 cups of water here.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.920
Add the oil.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.760
Salt

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.020
And pasta.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.720
As pasta cooks, it increases in volume.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.080
So make sure you are using lot of water.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.420
Pasta has been boiling for 10 minutes.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.320
And it's ready and you can touch

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.320
and see that it should be tender.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.420
Now we will prepare the white creamy sauce.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.220
Heat is on, medium high.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.800
First I will add the oil.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.880
And all purpose flour (maida).

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.720
Stir it.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.440
It should take just 1-1.5 minutes.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.280
So it will get light brown.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.580
Basically, we just want to make sure

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.060
the all purpose flour doesn't have the raw feeling.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.240
It's ready. Now I have to add the herbs.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.680
Basil

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.020
Italian herb

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.060
Red chilli flakes

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.560
Black pepper

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.360
And salt.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.100
Stir it.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.380
And add the milk, slowly.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.000
We want to make sure there is no lumps.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.700
And now I will add the cream.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.340
And let it come to boil.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.860
Make sure you keep stirring it.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.640
This is a very simple recipe.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.680
As milk comes to boil, I will add the spinach.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.500
And let it cook for 2-3 minutes.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.260
And then add the pasta and cheese.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.000
Milk is boiling.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.720
And as it's boiling, you can smell all the herbs.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.220
It's time to add the spinach.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.220
Mix it.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.140
And after it comes to boil

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.740
then let it cook on the low medium for 2-3 minutes.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.020
After sauce came to boil,

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.880
it has been cooking for about 2-2.5 minutes.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.920
So I am going to add the cheese.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.360
And as sauce cools off, it will become thicker in consistency.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.140
It's ready. Turn off the heat.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.680
I will take out the pasta.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.500
And this strainer works really good for this purpose.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.400
Now I am going to pour the sauce over pasta.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.740
This is my version of fettuccine alfredo.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.060
And it looks great.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.700
And give a light mix.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.260
Creamy spinach pasta is ready to serve.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.360
Creamy spinach pasta is looking great.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.380
Today I will be serving this for dinner

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.000
with salad soup and French bread.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.780
Enjoy this delicious pasta.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.700
Thank you.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.980
