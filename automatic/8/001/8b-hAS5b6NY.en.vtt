on a barfly so if you can grab you some

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.880 
on a barfly so if you can grab you some
strength<00:00:23.310> sets<00:00:23.550> if<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.789> do<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.210> a

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
strength sets if you do it on a

butterfly<00:00:26.180> this<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.240> long<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.660> guess<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.439> they

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
butterfly this is long I guess and they

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.749 
butterfly this is long I guess and they
sanded<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.830> poke<00:00:31.830> some<00:00:31.859> holes<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.579> with

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
sanded it and poke some holes in it with

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.380 
sanded it and poke some holes in it with
a<00:00:32.790> drill<00:00:33.500> not<00:00:34.500> nothing<00:00:35.100> spectacular<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:36.270> know

I mean but this board now Sunday and if
I<00:00:40.079> screw<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.280> first<00:00:42.149> thing<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.920> these<00:00:43.920> don't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
I screw so first thing is these don't

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.790 
I screw so first thing is these don't
have<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.610> all<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.180> took<00:00:46.170> those<00:00:46.410> off<00:00:46.680> for

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
have to be all I took those off for

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.900 
have to be all I took those off for
adjusts<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.969> whatever

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
adjusts it whatever

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.760 
adjusts it whatever
talking<00:00:53.910> off<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.870> them<00:00:55.050> came<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.559> pop

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
talking off one of them came on so pop

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.640 
talking off one of them came on so pop
up<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.100> often<00:00:56.460> day<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:57.690> uh<00:00:59.780> really<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:03.650> this

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
up on often day but uh really this this

up on often day but uh really this this
is<00:01:05.299> basically<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.750> guess<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.350> another<00:01:07.680> type

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is basically I guess this another type

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.950 
is basically I guess this another type
of<00:01:07.950> washer<00:01:09.260> or<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.880> went<00:01:11.880> searching<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.689> my

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
of washer or I went searching in my

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.100 
of washer or I went searching in my
laundry<00:01:13.710> room<00:01:13.890> where<00:01:14.729> toolbox<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.840> found

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
laundry room where toolbox is and found

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.609 
laundry room where toolbox is and found
it<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.210> yeah<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.780> if<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.080> want<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> do<00:01:19.439> with

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
it so yeah so if you want to do with

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:28.130 
it so yeah so if you want to do with
that<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:22.320> basically<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.240> just<00:01:27.930> take<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that is basically you can just take a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.620 
that is basically you can just take a
little<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.590> piece<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.950> string<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.450> loop<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
little this piece of string and loop it

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.920 
little this piece of string and loop it
around<00:01:30.840> there<00:01:31.650> cuz<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.280> does<00:01:32.460> has<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.750> hole<00:01:33.750> in

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
around there cuz it does has a hole in

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.359 
around there cuz it does has a hole in
it<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:36.350> play<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.590> any<00:01:38.130> problem

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it see it and play with that any problem

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
it see it and play with that any problem
with<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.790> it'll<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.390> spinning<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
with that is it'll be spinning and the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.530 
with that is it'll be spinning and the
loop<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.770> come<00:01:41.070> off<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.040> take

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
loop will come off of there you can take

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.399 
loop will come off of there you can take
this<00:01:46.189> and<00:01:47.600> instead<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.720> using<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.290> can

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
this and instead of using this you can

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.520 
this and instead of using this you can
tie<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> tie<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> loop<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.299> it'll<00:01:52.229> still

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
tie a tie a loop like that it'll still

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.660 
tie a tie a loop like that it'll still
work<00:01:52.560> pretty<00:01:52.890> good<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:55.579> put<00:01:56.579> it

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
work pretty good actually and put it

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.560 
work pretty good actually and put it
around<00:01:57.950> here<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.880> like<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
around here just make it like that and

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.950 
around here just make it like that and
why<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.899> struggling<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.590> take<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> pliers<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
why you struggling I take the pliers and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.459 
why you struggling I take the pliers and
tighten<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.020> up<00:02:04.340> while<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.700> there

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
tighten it up while it's on there

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.960 
tighten it up while it's on there
and<00:02:07.849> that<00:02:08.849> could<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.060> pretty<00:02:09.330> cool

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
and that could be pretty cool

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.530 
and that could be pretty cool
hold<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.150> second<00:02:12.420> I'll<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.750> can

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
hold on one second I'll see if I can

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.660 
hold on one second I'll see if I can
kind<00:02:14.349> of<00:02:14.470> demonstrate<00:02:14.950> what<00:02:15.099> this<00:02:15.190> look<00:02:15.459> like

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
kind of demonstrate what this look like

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:26.570 
kind of demonstrate what this look like
for<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:15.940> guys<00:02:16.120> almost<00:02:17.080> like<00:02:21.780> -<00:02:23.040> doctor<00:02:24.040> don't

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.759 

hopefully<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.640> won't<00:02:27.730> come<00:02:27.970> off<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.680> I

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
hopefully it won't come off on and I

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.530 
hopefully it won't come off on and I
have<00:02:30.040> as<00:02:30.190> far<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.519> I<00:02:30.640> gotta<00:02:30.849> tighten<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.360> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
have as far as I gotta tighten it the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.640 
have as far as I gotta tighten it the
way<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.989> just<00:02:32.019> told<00:02:32.380> you<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:33.000> but<00:02:34.000> uh<00:02:34.530> guess<00:02:35.530> you

Britain's<00:02:46.750> pretty<00:02:46.959> good<00:02:47.200> actually<00:02:48.180> spins

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
Britain's pretty good actually spins

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.229 
Britain's pretty good actually spins
better<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.080> longer<00:02:50.230> than<00:02:50.560> it<00:02:50.650> would<00:02:51.239> only

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
better and longer than it would only

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.550 
better and longer than it would only
thing<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.870> if<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.560> do<00:02:53.739> this<00:02:53.890> with<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:55.560> butterfly

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560
