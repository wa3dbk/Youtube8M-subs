games<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.700> don't<00:03:50.820> even<00:03:50.910> know<00:03:51.090> they<00:03:51.269> all<00:03:51.450> are<00:03:51.630> but

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
games I don't even know they all are but

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.630 
games I don't even know they all are but
one<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.109> them's<00:03:52.230> tomb<00:03:52.470> raider<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:53.040> think

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
one of them's tomb raider I think

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.360 
one of them's tomb raider I think
bioshock<00:03:54.420> infinite<00:03:54.720> as<00:03:55.019> i<00:03:55.170> said<00:03:55.380> for<00:03:55.650> crysis<00:03:56.130> 3

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
bioshock infinite as i said for crysis 3

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.009 
bioshock infinite as i said for crysis 3
and<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:57.000> couple<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.329> other<00:03:57.450> games<00:03:57.600> you<00:03:57.780> get<00:03:57.870> like

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
and a couple of other games you get like

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.780 
and a couple of other games you get like
six<00:03:58.200> games<00:03:58.500> in<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:58.829> bundle<00:03:59.040> but<00:03:59.609> it's

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
six games in that bundle but it's

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.160 
six games in that bundle but it's
unlikely<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.540> lot<00:04:00.720> of<00:04:00.750> people<00:04:00.840> look<00:04:01.049> I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
unlikely that a lot of people look I

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.640 
unlikely that a lot of people look I
crossfire<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.269> hey<00:04:03.269> we'll<00:04:04.109> just<00:04:04.260> be<00:04:04.350> good<00:04:04.440> for

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
crossfire so hey we'll just be good for

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.699 
crossfire so hey we'll just be good for
NVIDIA<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:05.220> think<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.180> because<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.570> would<00:04:07.530> prefer
