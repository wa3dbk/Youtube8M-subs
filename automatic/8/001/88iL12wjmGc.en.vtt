that's<00:01:24.020> what<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:24.259> had<00:01:24.429> I<00:01:25.569> think<00:01:26.569> you<00:01:26.869> know<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
that's what we had I think you know the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.290 
that's what we had I think you know the
nations<00:01:27.470> will<00:01:28.780> support<00:01:29.780> such<00:01:30.319> an<00:01:30.470> endeavor<00:01:31.300> 50

Indonesia<00:01:32.740> requested<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.990> think<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.319> is

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
Indonesia requested and I think it is

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.949 
Indonesia requested and I think it is
imperative<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:37.099> they<00:01:37.340> do<00:01:37.399> so<00:01:37.759> I<00:01:38.860> think<00:01:40.959> is

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
imperative that they do so I think is

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.630 
imperative that they do so I think is
there<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.259> time<00:01:42.740> frame<00:01:42.770> for<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.250> there<00:01:43.550> any

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
there a time frame for that there any

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.300 
there a time frame for that there any
kind<00:01:43.819> of<00:01:43.849> deadline<00:01:44.240> on<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:45.130> well<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.220> think

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.859
