00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.040

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.910
 things that after the current state 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.430
 mobilized nothing 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:04:01.530

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.820
 I want to know one thing how is the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.820
 relationship with your current partner 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:48.450

 her boyfriend I do not have to talk either 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:17.460
 One thing is dancing, you are going to suffer 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.460
 but I want to know how it goes 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:27.569
 of a program 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.620
 he just told me that he was 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:47.800
 bad because I was sad because of the horns 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:49.389
 that I had put you in such already 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.729
 one thing 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.289
 Natalia says the same thing my friend told me 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.539
 your girlfriend when she called me the other day 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.400
 we would talk but tell the truth if they stop 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.710
 aggressive what we say we are going to be 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.650
 aggression you told me in off that they 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.919
 grabs wait for us to talk but 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.919
 why not 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.330
 I infer were not so endless strip the 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.129
 Zarina well, what's your partner's name? 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:18.900
 he was unfaithful to me not to you to me either 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:18.900
 high of your perfect conquests 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.360
 this is the boyfriend of the sands and less 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.010
 badly found someone until sand that the 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.080
 contribute tranquility your life with all 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.720
 I have them in front of the truth 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.200
 that the others hold in the head 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.090
 now this was an acting or it was real not 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.140
 Mr understands first out 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.600
 with the salt and the second one that was a 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.000
 event where Carmen who was the owner of the 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.630
 Fundamental salary of the event had 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.630
 invited to the press 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:05.230
 problems with who he paid not only 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.160
 he took charge well we'll see how a 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.230
 medium 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.050
 he would not like to keep the low profile 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:25.480
 we all know that it could be done 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:28.410
 obviously what he does not like about the 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.410
 new stage 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:34.450
 It seems that he also had problems with 

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.669
 gamarra yes but beyond its 

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:39.010
 elections as women I say I think that 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:41.320
 independent and famous 

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.270
 I know I will not give an example but 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.890
 I know super super popular type 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.120
 super famous celebrities who have 

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.370
 married in shape 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.290
 with well-known popular actresses 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.449
 that however we have never achieved a 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:55.389
 picture together have kept the profile and 

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:58.870
 this is also what this over-performance does 

00:07:55.389 --> 00:08:00.520
 I think it makes it even more media 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.590
 more media because I'm still like that 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.030
 answered correctly ready it 

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.800
 ended the issue and the lottery do not have 

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.290
 nothing more to ask but if you do 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.750
 this overacting is everything a lot is going 

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.940
 we go with santiago to the mobile that is with 

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.650
 vanucci victory that yesterday inaugurated his 

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.490
 local lingerie on the avenue life 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.490
 healthy chalk
