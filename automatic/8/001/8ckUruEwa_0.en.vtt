most<00:04:32.570> it<00:04:32.660> took<00:04:32.810> you<00:04:32.900> forever<00:04:33.110> no<00:04:33.919> only<00:04:34.220> took<00:04:34.460> me

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
most it took you forever no only took me

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.339 
most it took you forever no only took me
like<00:04:34.669> one<00:04:34.970> second<00:04:35.380> because<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.710> am<00:04:37.280> pro<00:04:38.139> hi<00:04:39.139> I'm

basically<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:43.970> get<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.240> idea<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:45.910> looks<00:04:46.910> cool

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
this big hole out of this kit here holy

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:02.210 
this big hole out of this kit here holy
 so<00:04:59.419> see<00:04:59.630> end<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.930> the<00:05:00.020> world

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.010 

so<00:05:02.820> just<00:05:03.060> loading<00:05:03.810> chunks<00:05:04.970> well<00:05:05.970> okay<00:05:06.870> well

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
so just loading chunks well okay well

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.410 
so just loading chunks well okay well
yeah<00:05:07.170> basically<00:05:08.040> something's<00:05:08.760> going<00:05:09.000> on<00:05:09.120> um

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
yeah basically something's going on um

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.740 
yeah basically something's going on um
but<00:05:10.380> there<00:05:10.680> it<00:05:10.800> is<00:05:11.450> there's<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.540> little

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
but there it is there's a little

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.610 
but there it is there's a little
building<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:14.700> you<00:05:15.030> can<00:05:15.180> put<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.360> door<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:16.050> so

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
building and you can put a door and so

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.440 
building and you can put a door and so
on<00:05:16.910> everything<00:05:17.910> like<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:20.060> another<00:05:21.060> one<00:05:21.270> is

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
on everything like that another one is

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.180 
on everything like that another one is
if<00:05:22.350> I<00:05:22.530> like<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.950> building<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.520> I<00:05:25.160> feel<00:05:26.160> like

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
if I like this building and I feel like

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.340 
if I like this building and I feel like
I<00:05:26.640> need<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:28.760> change<00:05:29.760> my<00:05:29.880> position<00:05:30.270> maybe<00:05:30.990> move

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
I need to change my position maybe move

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.270 
I need to change my position maybe move
somewhere<00:05:31.770> else<00:05:33.320> because<00:05:34.320> i<00:05:34.920> don't<00:05:35.220> know

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
somewhere else because i don't know

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.100 
somewhere else because i don't know
maybe<00:05:35.520> I<00:05:35.670> don't<00:05:35.820> like<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.360> big<00:05:36.570> huge<00:05:36.840> gap<00:05:37.080> in

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
maybe I don't like the big huge gap in

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.720 
maybe I don't like the big huge gap in
the<00:05:37.380> background<00:05:37.830> um<00:05:40.040> just<00:05:41.040> go<00:05:41.220> like<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:43.730> and

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
the background um just go like that and

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.550 
the background um just go like that and
then<00:05:44.850> I<00:05:45.380> clone<00:05:46.380> it<00:05:46.530> and<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:48.330> bring<00:05:49.140> it<00:05:49.230> to<00:05:49.290> where

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
then I clone it and I bring it to where

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.530 
then I clone it and I bring it to where
there<00:05:49.710> is<00:05:49.860> no<00:05:50.070> gap<00:05:51.590> like<00:05:52.590> maybe<00:05:53.210> maybe<00:05:54.210> right

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
there is no gap like maybe maybe right

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.560 
there is no gap like maybe maybe right
here<00:05:56.570> there<00:05:57.570> we<00:05:57.750> go<00:05:58.100> no<00:05:59.100> gap<00:05:59.340> no<00:05:59.850> more<00:06:00.030> gap<00:06:00.180> see

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
here there we go no gap no more gap see

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.970 
here there we go no gap no more gap see
there<00:06:00.720> it<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:00.900> in<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.080> background<00:06:01.880> yeah<00:06:02.930> but

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
there it is in the background yeah but

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.409 
there it is in the background yeah but
then<00:06:04.980> work<00:06:05.160> out<00:06:07.100> so<00:06:08.100> basically<00:06:08.550> yeah<00:06:08.880> it's<00:06:09.270> a

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
then work out so basically yeah it's a

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.260 
then work out so basically yeah it's a
pretty<00:06:09.570> cool<00:06:09.870> program<00:06:10.110> is<00:06:11.010> that<00:06:11.160> a<00:06:11.190> gap<00:06:11.430> it's<00:06:12.120> a

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
pretty cool program is that a gap it's a

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.350 
pretty cool program is that a gap it's a
pretty<00:06:12.450> cool<00:06:12.720> program<00:06:13.760> fun<00:06:14.760> fun<00:06:15.480> fun<00:06:17.360> you
