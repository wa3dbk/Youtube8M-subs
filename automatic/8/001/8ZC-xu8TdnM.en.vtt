feature right here it sort of turns it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.859 
feature right here it sort of turns it
into<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.430> more<00:01:31.430> capable<00:01:31.610> laptop<00:01:32.299> because<00:01:32.540> this

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
into a more capable laptop because this

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.780 
into a more capable laptop because this
doesn't<00:01:33.110> want<00:01:33.290> to<00:01:33.350> fall<00:01:33.530> over<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.220> if<00:01:34.640> you'll

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
doesn't want to fall over and if you'll

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
the coolest features that they showed us

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.020 
the coolest features that they showed us
was<00:02:24.320> this<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:25.100> were<00:02:25.220> able<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.550> click<00:02:25.880> this

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
was this you were able to click this

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.240 
was this you were able to click this
button<00:02:26.239> on<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.540> top<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.020> open<00:02:27.620> up<00:02:27.709> one<00:02:28.010> node

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
button on the top and open up one node

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.699 
button on the top and open up one node
and<00:02:28.520> start<00:02:28.910> typing<00:02:29.120> and<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.260> an<00:02:30.380> actual

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
and start typing and this is an actual
