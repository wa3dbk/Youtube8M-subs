00:00:07.969 --> 00:00:12.090
 it is not mandatory to ask 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.370
 ceiling waterproofing products a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.809
 shower and on the bath surrounds but 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.380
 it remains a practice 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.119
 recommended 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.050
 when these surfaces are intended for 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.520
 be because the ceilings 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.930
 however, is required in the case of 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.670
 steam showers this video explains the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.859
 way to ask this overflowing wrestler 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.850
 on a solid support to prepare a 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.640
 tile ceiling here is how 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.589
 carry out this work the use of panels 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.269
 rigid ceiling can be simpler 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.510
 and adapted that the use of 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.070
 flexible membranes 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.489
 here a solid support has been installed at 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.680
 ceiling 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.400
 in this case it is a sign of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.400
 gypsum the waterproofness of the walls has already been 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.930
 achieved by means of caliber role of 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.119
 glued world panels of any thickness 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 can be used if the flush 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:07.560
 completely in the cement glue that 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.850
 lebron is stuck to the ceiling by means of 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.410
 unmodified glue cement used a 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.660
 cement glue consistency rather 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.320
 liquid but able to hold a mark 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.000
 trowel choose a trowel 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.490
 serrated to apply cement glue 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.940
 so as to cover the entire surface of 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.940
 heart overflows 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.030
 according to the nature of the surface and 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.250
 the thickness of the gauge board 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.080
 of employees we chose the truel 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.880
 adam quarter square inch with a kidney 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.440
 quarter of an inch in some cases of 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.760
 wider teeth may be required 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.760
 to ensure complete membership 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.500
 remove dust or other debris from 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.790
 the surface of the solid support 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.740
 moisten the dry and porous substrates 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.660
 in order to prevent drying out 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.310
 premature cement glue or the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.990
 formation of a skin applied on the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.090
 panel that lebron a thin layer of 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.890
 cement glue using the flat side of the 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.490
 trowel to ensure adherence 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.490
 adequate 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.020
 then being wanting another layer of 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.560
 cement glue using the serrated side 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 trowel 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.860
 apply a thin layer of cement 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.110
 glue on the ceiling area intended for 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.060
 receive heart overflows using the side 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.900
 flat trowel to ensure a 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 adequate adhesion 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.400
 recessed panel that libourne in the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.110
 cement glues all over its surface to 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.909
 means of a wooden trowel or a 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.450
 similar tool to ensure a 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.450
 full membership 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.410
 depending on the size of the ceiling it could 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.180
 be necessary to use several 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.080
 heart leaves overflowing to cover 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.080
 the whole surface 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.510
 the joints are made by arranging 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.060
 the panels side by side and centering 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.980
 on the joints of the sealing strips 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.110
 twitter that bad applied cement

 receive the tape embedded the tape in 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.790
 the cement sticks by means of the flat side of 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.920
 the trowel or plaster spatula 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:45.450
 to ensure adequate adherence and 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:47.940
 remove the air pockets lay a corner

 interior preformed schloter kurdes y at 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.510
 cement glue medium applied cement 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.900
 glue to the place intended to receive the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.870
 point that the querrec recessed corner 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.000
 as Querrec in the adhesive cement 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.349
 to make your job easier 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.819
 stand beside the corner in place at 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.329
 moment in castrated each other in the 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.329
 cement glue 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.830
 repeat the operation for the other corners 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.830
 inside 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.479
 the last step will be to seal 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:27.039
 the joints between the walls and the ceiling 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.960
 by means of the bands that the bad measure 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.000
 and cut off the tape sections that the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.419
 bad so as to achieve an overlap 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.310
 from 2 inches to all the options the 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.500
 rival bands that will serve to realize 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.870
 overlap will not have to 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.400
 go back to the bottom of the corners as well 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.410
 you will limit the thickness of the 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.639
 membrane in these areas and would facilitate 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.349
 laying small tiles on 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.270
 can form a fold in the bands that 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.440
 the strips before laying them for 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.659
 it grows well there nook and 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.620
 make tiling as easy as possible 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:04.630
 subsequent applied cement glue no 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.169
 modified at the place intended to receive 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.169
 groups

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:14.159
 cement glue 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.530
 repeat the operation for the joints 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.510
 remaining making sure you achieve a 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.990
 minimum overlap of 2 inches to 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.850
 all transitions anchors 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.710
 must also be sealed with 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:43.520
 core sections of the bands using 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:45.080
 glue cement unmodified once 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.760
 the entire ceiling covered with 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.530
 glued panels world and the joints and 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.630
 trap them with accessories 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.880
 curie the assembly is waterproof 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.360
 vapor impermeable is ready
