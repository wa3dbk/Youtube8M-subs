00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.399 

and<00:01:27.890> make<00:01:28.219> sure<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.450> do<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:29.780> this<00:01:30.140> arch

and make sure that you do have this arch

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.529 
and make sure that you do have this arch
because<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.009> next<00:01:31.310> string<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:31.939> open<00:01:31.969> this

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
because the next string is open this

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.310 
because the next string is open this
g-string<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:35.270> have<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:35.780> far<00:01:36.079> and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
g-string so you have that so far and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.310 
g-string so you have that so far and
with<00:01:37.280> your<00:01:37.640> first<00:01:38.030> finger<00:01:38.479> we're<00:01:39.110> going<00:01:39.259> to

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
with your first finger we're going to

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.660 
with your first finger we're going to
put<00:01:39.740> on<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:39.950> first<00:01:40.310> fret<00:01:40.759> of<00:01:40.909> the<00:01:41.450> b-string<00:01:42.670> so

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
put on the first fret of the b-string so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.490 
put on the first fret of the b-string so
let's<00:01:43.909> put<00:01:44.179> all<00:01:44.360> that<00:01:44.720> together<00:01:45.020> see<00:01:45.380> if<00:01:45.409> you

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
let's put all that together see if you

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.890 
let's put all that together see if you
can<00:01:45.619> put<00:01:45.740> all<00:01:45.829> three<00:01:46.069> of<00:01:46.130> those<00:01:46.250> together

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.020 

and<00:01:49.990> make<00:01:50.590> sure<00:01:50.830> this<00:01:51.130> last<00:01:51.400> one<00:01:51.580> is<00:01:51.670> arched

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
and make sure this last one is arched

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.080 
and make sure this last one is arched
because<00:01:52.600> we<00:01:52.780> have<00:01:52.960> an<00:01:53.110> open<00:01:53.350> e<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.730> there's<00:01:54.910> two

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
because we have an open e so there's two

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.530 
because we have an open e so there's two
open<00:01:55.510> strings<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.290> G<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.640> e<00:01:57.670> are<00:01:58.120> open

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
open strings the G and the e are open

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.180 
open strings the G and the e are open
and<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:59.110> want<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.350> make<00:01:59.470> sure<00:01:59.650> that<00:01:59.830> you<00:01:59.980> arch

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
and you want to make sure that you arch

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.810 

hardest<00:02:10.110> part<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.620> is<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.130> strumming

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
technically E is in the chord but

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.850 
technically E is in the chord but
guitarist<00:02:18.900> we<00:02:19.080> don't<00:02:19.230> play<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.470> because<00:02:19.740> it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
guitarist we don't play it because it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.770 
guitarist we don't play it because it
does<00:02:20.010> sound<00:02:20.250> muddy<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:21.090> we're<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.690> to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
does sound muddy so we're just going to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.600 
does sound muddy so we're just going to
strum<00:02:22.020> from<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.650> fifth<00:02:23.010> string<00:02:23.990> on<00:02:24.990> town

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.760 

and<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.450> C<00:02:30.660> chord<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.320> that's<00:02:31.530> our

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
and that is the C chord so that's our

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.280 
and that is the C chord so that's our
second<00:02:32.280> chord<00:02:32.520> and<00:02:32.810> once<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.930> master<00:02:34.260> that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
second chord and once you master that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.240 
second chord and once you master that
then<00:02:34.920> we'll<00:02:35.070> teach<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.640> D<00:02:35.880> chord
