00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
this takes about five hours so I'm about

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.000 
this takes about five hours so I'm about
five<00:03:06.400> or<00:03:06.519> six<00:03:06.670> hours<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.150> beep<00:03:07.360> from<00:03:07.989> dead<00:03:08.290> okay

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
when my bammo shows the low voltage I

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.160 
when my bammo shows the low voltage I
switch<00:03:11.680> them<00:03:11.829> out<00:03:11.920> right<00:03:12.099> away<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.110> think

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
switch them out right away and I think

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.319 
switch them out right away and I think
it's<00:03:14.500> about<00:03:14.709> five<00:03:14.950> or<00:03:15.099> six<00:03:15.280> hours<00:03:15.489> but<00:03:16.209> you
