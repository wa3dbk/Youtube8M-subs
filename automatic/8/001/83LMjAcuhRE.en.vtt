back<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> bench<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> look

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
back of the bench so it's going to look

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
back of the bench so it's going to look
something<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:48.829> well<00:00:49.829> then<00:00:49.950> have<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
something like this well then have a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.910 
something like this well then have a
tuck<00:00:50.489> position<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.410> fit<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.590> space

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
tuck position like this fit some space

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.610 
tuck position like this fit some space
underneath<00:00:53.280> there<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.760> my<00:00:53.879> back<00:00:54.410> what<00:00:55.410> this

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
underneath there in my back what this

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.020 
underneath there in my back what this
does<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> helps<00:00:56.250> me<00:00:56.489> pull<00:00:56.699> my<00:00:56.850> shoulder

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
does is it helps me pull my shoulder

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.869 
does is it helps me pull my shoulder
blades<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.620> also<00:00:58.890> creates<00:00:59.309> nice<00:00:59.489> space

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
blades back it also creates nice space

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
blades back it also creates nice space
and<00:01:00.480> where<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.840> feet<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.739> drive<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
and where my feet can drive into the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.750 
and where my feet can drive into the
floor<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:03.210> need<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> reason<00:01:05.489> why<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
floor we need that the reason why this

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760 
floor we need that the reason why this
is<00:01:06.030> okay<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.780> because<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.409> horizontal

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is okay is because it's a horizontal

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340 
is okay is because it's a horizontal
pushing<00:01:08.520> action<00:01:08.939> since<00:01:09.689> you're<00:01:09.869> pushing<00:01:10.229> from

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
pushing action since you're pushing from

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.050 
pushing action since you're pushing from
the<00:01:10.439> floor<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.130> horizontal<00:01:11.430> press

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the floor and it's a horizontal press

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.730 
the floor and it's a horizontal press
you're<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.170> any<00:01:13.409> sort<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
you're not going to have any sort of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.590 
you're not going to have any sort of
stress<00:01:14.040> on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> spine<00:01:14.490> that's<00:01:15.270> not<00:01:15.420> what's

bearing the load here what's bearing the
lower<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:18.000> your<00:01:18.090> shoulders<00:01:18.540> your

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you don't have to worry about that it's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140 
you don't have to worry about that it's
not<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.890> same<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.220> doing<00:01:23.310> an<00:01:23.490> upright<00:01:23.850> press

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
not the same as doing an upright press

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.910 
not the same as doing an upright press
or<00:01:24.390> standing<00:01:24.900> press<00:01:25.110> where<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.740> too

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
much of an arch in the back totally

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.310 
much of an arch in the back totally
different<00:01:28.189> having<00:01:29.189> said<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:31.079> next

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
different having said that the next

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.260 
different having said that the next
thing<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> gotta<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:33.030> hand

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
thing you gotta think about is your hand

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
thing you gotta think about is your hand
position<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:35.250> don't<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> grip<00:01:35.880> that's

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
position you don't want a grip that's

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.740 
position you don't want a grip that's
far<00:01:36.360> too<00:01:36.570> wide<00:01:37.909> you<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> grip<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.509> too

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
far too wide you have a grip that's too

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
far too wide you have a grip that's too
wide<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:41.189> about<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> angles<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
wide it's all about the angles that you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.310 
wide it's all about the angles that you
create<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.020> go<00:01:43.140> 182

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
create so we go 182

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
the bench press correctly so you don't

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.700 
the bench press correctly so you don't
get<00:04:21.549> injured<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.140> don't<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.500> too

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
get injured and so you don't have too
