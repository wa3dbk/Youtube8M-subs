and I think that's what's very exciting
is<00:03:42.890> a<00:03:43.040> quality<00:03:43.730> here<00:03:43.970> but<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.720> so<00:03:45.050> can<00:03:45.709> be

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
is a quality here but it so can be

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.220 
is a quality here but it so can be
something<00:03:46.489> individual<00:03:47.209> so<00:03:47.540> why<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.140> that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
something individual so why is it that

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.980 
something individual so why is it that
when<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.500> think<00:03:48.739> design<00:03:49.160> we<00:03:49.760> think<00:03:49.970> Italian

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990
