fangirls<00:00:30.410> being<00:00:30.680> cement<00:00:31.160> we're<00:00:32.150> using<00:00:32.419> the

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
fangirls being cement we're using the

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.970 
fangirls being cement we're using the
scientific<00:00:32.840> method<00:00:33.020> through<00:00:33.530> this<00:00:33.680> and

scientific method through this and
asking<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.370> questions<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:34.970> we're<00:00:35.120> learning

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
asking the questions so we're learning

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.259 
asking the questions so we're learning
the<00:00:35.809> process<00:00:36.080> of<00:00:36.949> both<00:00:37.309> science<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:37.790> then<00:00:38.059> in

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
the process of both science and then in

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.750 
the process of both science and then in
particular<00:00:38.830> engineering<00:00:39.830> components<00:00:40.550> and

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
particular engineering components and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.610 
particular engineering components and
all<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:41.449> great<00:00:41.690> terminology<00:00:42.320> that<00:00:42.350> comes

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
all the great terminology that comes

00:00:42.620 --> 00:01:03.490 
all the great terminology that comes
along<00:00:42.800> with<00:00:43.010> it

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.530 

so<00:01:04.500> children<00:01:05.190> inherit<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.940> from<00:01:06.360> their

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
so children inherit what from their

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.910 
so children inherit what from their
ancestors<00:01:08.060> power<00:01:09.200> leadership<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.770> what

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
ancestors power leadership and then what

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.940 
ancestors power leadership and then what
does<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> prisoners<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:13.680> makes

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
does that do for the prisoners it makes

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.520 
does that do for the prisoners it makes
their<00:01:14.220> lives<00:01:14.490> better<00:01:14.730> he<00:01:15.390> learns<00:01:15.600> about<00:01:15.960> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
their lives better he learns about that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.140 
their lives better he learns about that
it<00:01:16.890> doesn't<00:01:17.190> matter<00:01:17.310> what<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.910> on<00:01:18.120> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it doesn't matter what it is on the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.500 
it doesn't matter what it is on the
outside<00:01:19.160> does<00:01:20.160> all<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:20.610> fit<00:01:20.820> together<00:01:21.180> for

school kids at Colorado Academy at the
beginning<00:01:34.290> they're<00:01:35.009> very<00:01:35.250> frustrated<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
beginning they're very frustrated and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
beginning they're very frustrated and
very<00:01:36.300> much<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> tire<00:01:37.259> world<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.830> can't<00:01:38.340> do

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
very much in the tire world I can't do

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.160 
very much in the tire world I can't do
this<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.210> hard<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.840> when<00:01:40.080> they

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
this it's too hard and when they

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
this it's too hard and when they
accomplish<00:01:40.710> something<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.580> know<00:01:41.820> they

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
accomplish something they know they

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.820 
accomplish something they know they
accomplished<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.750> through<00:01:43.229> hard<00:01:43.619> work

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
accomplished it through hard work

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.370 
accomplished it through hard work
discipline<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.790> desire<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.479> never<00:01:45.930> forget

discipline and desire and never forget
courage<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> let's<00:01:49.410> scale<00:01:49.800> our<00:01:50.280> triangle<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
courage so let's scale our triangle so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.120 
courage so let's scale our triangle so
there's<00:01:53.340> our<00:01:53.490> line<00:01:53.729> okay<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:55.320> what<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.920> goes

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
there's our line okay now what it goes

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.410 
there's our line okay now what it goes
up<00:01:56.369> five<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.060> we<00:01:58.190> multiply<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.399> by<00:01:59.670> whatever

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
up five and we multiply that by whatever

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.020 
up five and we multiply that by whatever
your<00:02:00.600> skill<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.080> event<00:02:01.560> across<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.610> far

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
your skill is event across how far

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.200 
your skill is event across how far
across<00:02:03.590> tens<00:02:04.590> wait<00:02:05.220> can<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.790> like<00:02:05.940> put

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
across tens wait can you just like put

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.330 
across tens wait can you just like put
the<00:02:06.390> dot<00:02:06.630> anywhere<00:02:07.440> when<00:02:07.710> your<00:02:07.890> scale<00:02:08.190> your

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the dot anywhere when your scale your

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.070 
the dot anywhere when your scale your
triangle<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.209> approximating<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.959> your

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
triangle do some approximating in your

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.570 
triangle do some approximating in your
mind<00:02:10.260> okay<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.769> going<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.010> three<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.430> four

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
mind okay it's going to be three to four

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.250 
mind okay it's going to be three to four
times<00:02:11.850> larger<00:02:12.060> what's<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.019> going<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.200> look

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
times larger what's that going to look

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.750 
times larger what's that going to look
like<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.830> figure<00:02:14.100> out<00:02:14.130> what<00:02:14.310> your<00:02:14.400> spaces

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
like and figure out what your spaces

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.030 
like and figure out what your spaces
this<00:02:15.180> group's<00:02:15.480> gonna<00:02:15.660> come<00:02:15.900> up<00:02:16.080> act<00:02:16.380> out<00:02:16.739> their

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
this group's gonna come up act out their

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.220 
this group's gonna come up act out their
piece<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.489> figurative<00:02:18.000> language<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.989> don't

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
piece of figurative language you don't

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.990 
piece of figurative language you don't
have<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.680> get<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.010> perfectly<00:02:20.760> like

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
have to get it perfectly like

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.509 
have to get it perfectly like
word-for-word<00:02:21.420> what<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> general

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
word-for-word what it is but the general

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.030 
word-for-word what it is but the general
idea<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:24.120> should<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.420> able<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.660> get

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
idea you should be able to get

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.289 
idea you should be able to get
oh<00:02:27.290> please<00:02:28.290> next<00:02:28.650> was<00:02:28.829> like<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.069> giraffe<00:02:29.400> got<00:02:29.909> it

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
oh please next was like a giraffe got it

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.500 
oh please next was like a giraffe got it
yes<00:02:30.750> perfect<00:02:31.379> well<00:02:31.950> done<00:02:31.980> well<00:02:32.549> done<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.420> was

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
yes perfect well done well done that was
