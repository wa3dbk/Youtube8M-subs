 alexandre addor to your life of yours 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.030
 performer aspects of their day to day 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.829
 that you like most are the proximity to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.749
 nature the ability to earn money 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.609
 doing what he likes and the fact that his 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.660
 work to help reduce the 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.189
 greenhouse effect 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.529
 that the patriarch of the family 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.480
 Doing your work helps to sustain 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.769
 their children and ensures that Patricia is a 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.630
 the ingredients necessary to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.939
 prepare, among other foods and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.109
 female table champion I love the bench 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.610
 works as a mechanical engineer 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.100
 designing combustion engines for 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.140
 Trucks trucks are the main means 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.579
 of the country are 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 also the most common way of 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.660
 carry the soybeans grow from 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 products to the storage warehouses 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.649
 Brazil has a road area of about 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.930
 1 million and 700 thousand kilometers of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.940
 national roads and highways and a 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.800
 about 2 truck fleet 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.350
 million vehicles, which is equivalent to a 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 truck for every 850 meters 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.920
 combustion engines that mark the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.039
 projects are powered by diesel in brazil 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.719
 unemployment has been mixed since 2007 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.309
 with biodiesel in order to reduce 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.770
 emission of polluting gases 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.720
 biodiesel is a renewable fuel and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.250
 biodegradable material which can be obtained 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.409
 from the chemical reaction of 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.049
 vegetable origin such as oil 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.150
 soybean soybean oil is obtained by 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.040
 of soy crushing ever high 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.710
 pressure which then passes through a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.600
 the process of clarification and refining 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.460
 be a renewable energy source of the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.350
 biofuel consists of carbon 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.670
 neutral which means that its burning 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.890
 does not contribute to the increase in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.720
 gases that helped cause the changes 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.850
 with which Brazil and the rest of the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.380
 world worries Brazil is one of the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.360
 largest biodiesel producers in the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.310
 planet with an annual output of about 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.570
 of 2 billion liters 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.820
 two and a half million liters of 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.530
 biodiesel emit half of the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.630
 carbon dioxide than standard diesel 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.820
 more than 80% of biodiesel is composed of 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.320
 soybean oil which causes 14 per 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.240
 percent of all soybeans produced in Brazil 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 be taught the production of biodiesel 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.469
 this means that annually more than 10 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.470
 million tonnes of soybeans are 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.780
 used for me 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.220
 emission of polluting gases in addition to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.030
 help to reduce the emission of gases 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.740
 pollutants 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.780
 soybeans generate six jobs 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.729
 per thousand hectares of plantation 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.100
 every six direct jobs are generated 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.720
 27 more indirect jobs such as 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.890
 agricultural machinery industry which 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.570
 also uses combustion engines 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.760
 what project marks 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.890
 this means that about 1 million 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.790
 Brazilians depend on the soybean chain 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.830
 in the country 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.780
 the soybean chain depends on producers 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.550
 soy as Alexandre needing 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.070
 to protect soybeans against diseases that 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.690
 tillage is the fungicide of the 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.459
 syngenta that guarantees control 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.100
 efficiency of all complex diseases 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.010
 from soy to rust is one of the diseases that 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.420
 mainly attacks soybean leaves 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.040
 reports can guarantee more days with 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.110
 leaves of plants than any other 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.970
 product for more days with 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.500
 leaves reports allows grains 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.780
 more secure in all 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.880
 situations being four more sacks per 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.610
 one hectare of soybeans is the 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.540
 sufficient to produce 450 liters of 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.610
 biodiesel 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.340
 brazil has about 27 million 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.310
 hectares with soybean plantations 4 sacks 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.320
 of soybeans carries 240 kilos of grain 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.510
 means that with reports it is possible that 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.050
 the 16 million tonnes more than 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.820
 Soy 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.560
 but it was only per hectare it means more 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.989
 food which means more people 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.660
 sitting and greater profitability for the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.519
 producer as alexandre profitability and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.650
 capacity of an invested capital to generate 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.360
 profit and is what the soy producer and 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.430
 issue or use reports in their 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.140
 Agriculture 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.150
 alexandre can not protect your crop 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.120
 he can not make a profit and not get 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.610
 soy in a world without soy is not possible 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.380
 to extract soybean oil without soybean oil 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.790
 there is no biodiesel that will be 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.170
 mixed with the diesel that serves as 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.640
 fuel for trucks that 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.970
 combustion engines 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.799
 landmarks biodiesel the engines to 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.570
 combustion that more projects need to be 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.250
 powered by fossil fuels 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.170
 when burned emit polluting gases 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.150
 that cause the greenhouse effect 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.380
 so select can not help 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.180
 reduce the emission of polluting gases 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.070
 that cause the greenhouse effect 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.510
 there is nothing that genius patrician milestones 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.510
