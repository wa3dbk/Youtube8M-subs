00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 and there is something tnt turn on and 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:15.000
 here a facts hin sets for it 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:17.130
 that a field happens so hello everyone 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.300
 to another video to five 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.640
 things in minecraft you do not have yet 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.170
 did not know the last video wise 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.400
 you have now linked here 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.420
 you are welcome to click on it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.010
 or the link to a video 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.359
 I can use the description very well 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.490
 and you have wished that me 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.960
 do more of it and then I have one 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.219
 few things written down so here 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.440
 can be quite interesting and therefore 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.250
 I'll make that much fun now too 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.110
 with the video fact numero one is when 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.430
 you dig yourself down and that way 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.079
 a small room makes so three times 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.730
 three blocks down here and two blocks 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.579
 high then you can if you stone here 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.590
 placed and then a run here 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 puts the whole in rapeseed and so petty 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.300
 connects here leaves space and there tnt 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
 trans then do the following 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.899
 tnt block to press the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.859
 own head happens the following one can 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.930
 to look through the walls 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.270
 this bug is pretty old 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.710
 actually I already know that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.330
 relatively long, I have nothing left now 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.799
 but is valued for venus 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.939
 actually quite cool if you again 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.290
 looking for a dungeon or similar 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.299
 just look through and he knows exactly 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.880
 where he must look for the whole is synonymous 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.170
 even with monastery itself principle once 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.900
 put it to one can look through but 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.640
 then not with other blocks if you 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.650
 For example, the whole degrades me now 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.150
 and then again here again 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.729
 set in stones and those in pure 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
 the following happens it expresses 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.310
 black is pushed out before the eyes 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.409
 So nothing works now 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.530
 monastery and maybe something else 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.689
 but I 'm sure I do not think so 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.770
 if you take a day and this 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.180
 then accordingly the ambos 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.689
 we can rename quickly 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.030
 and to dinner bohn big d am 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.259
 Clearly these can cover next 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 that's a bit of this 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.320
 animals for example a horse and that 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.090
 follow it is special if you can do that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 power turns and runs 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 this is also possible on the back 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 with all other animals 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.430
 for wolf or perhaps to gas them 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.110
 also come calling 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.700
 the running is then wrong me 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.430
 which looks pretty funny 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.409
 and then you have just one still something 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.820
 here 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.929
 that the wolf moment the camera of course 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.149
 It will also be about trainer 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.450
 animals and never have we are so funny 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.590
 Shaping through the area and flying 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.810
 as a small fact in between 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.580
 if you have a command block in the bus 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.069
 renames and gives a name to 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:30.250
 example in this league blog this then 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.519
 takes out the then placed button 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.670
 ezb still gives meant so and a command 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.459
 enter 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.870
 hello then this does not say hello 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.530
 but he also says his own 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.640
 name as he has been called namely 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.190
 Ugly block just says hello 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.230
 comparatively to normal blog itself 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.690
 command as well as your cloudy says then 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.400
 accordingly, this only add the hello 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.870
 renamed then says ugly blog 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.150
 hello then next three facts 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.920
 she already knew the gas noises 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.569
 are the cat 's noises 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.769
 Developers have done as they once 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.810
 I bit sick so this was 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.959
 hiss and similar endermann 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.010
 Noises are just backwards 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.780
 played very easy slows 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.049
 or snowy words like halo or 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.150
 high or helau and the kripo should 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.410
 originally pigs become one 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.920
 a little strange from the ground is too 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.209
 tilt 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.500
 there is the developer then again 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.730
 a little something changed because of himself 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.530
 somehow did not look like pig 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.269
 and the last point when talking about the 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.040
 would like to fly the edge of a box 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.540
 Field man in May down no ship 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.310
 but you keep falling 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.200
 down at the normal blog course 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.790
 He does not stop at the end of the blog 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.670
 but with a box always on it goes 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.519
 We are always going down no matter 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.660
 what is a thing I still have 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.919
 never thought about it really so so the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.329
 also has been this time by 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.709
 the five things minecraft then still 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.019
 not knowing is now you are again 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.510
 how does it look like? 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.849
 which you knew in 1555 wrote me the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.680
 comments and if you think again 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.180
 what else is new is not enough 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.500
 you did not show things you did not 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.180
 then, of course, we know too 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620
 again a pn write which video 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.819
 Please have a review after 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.010
 above, I would be happy and then 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.639
 See you in the next ride and on 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.639
 bye bye 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.870
 st
