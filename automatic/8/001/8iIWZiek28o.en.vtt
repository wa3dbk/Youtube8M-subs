00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.129 

so<00:00:10.710> what<00:00:10.889> happens<00:00:11.250> during<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.820> g2<00:00:12.300> phase<00:00:12.719> of

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
so what happens during the g2 phase of

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.240 
so what happens during the g2 phase of
interphase

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
interphase

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.189 
interphase
so<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:15.120> interphase<00:00:15.540> we<00:00:15.750> know<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> there

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
so with interphase we know that there

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.040 
so with interphase we know that there
are<00:00:16.320> four<00:00:16.619> or<00:00:17.190> three<00:00:17.250> main<00:00:17.820> parts<00:00:18.180> rather<00:00:18.390> so

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
are four or three main parts rather so

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.929 
are four or three main parts rather so
there<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.260> three<00:00:19.439> main<00:00:19.680> parts<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.250> those

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
there are three main parts and those

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.230 
there are three main parts and those
parts<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:23.480> g1<00:00:25.039> which<00:00:26.039> stands<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.580> gap<00:00:26.820> 1<00:00:27.060> but

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
parts are g1 which stands for gap 1 but

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.960 
parts are g1 which stands for gap 1 but
think<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.810> as<00:00:27.960> growth<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:29.250> growing<00:00:29.760> one

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
think about it as growth as growing one

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.500 
think about it as growth as growing one
so<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> first<00:00:30.359> growing<00:00:30.869> stage<00:00:32.120> you've<00:00:33.120> got<00:00:33.149> s

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so the first growing stage you've got s

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.680 
so the first growing stage you've got s
which<00:00:34.050> stands<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.410> synthesis<00:00:35.059> or<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.329> DNA

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
which stands for synthesis or when DNA

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.819 
which stands for synthesis or when DNA
is<00:00:37.170> made<00:00:37.670> DNA<00:00:38.670> replication<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.600> finally<00:00:40.200> g2

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
is made DNA replication and finally g2

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.810 
is made DNA replication and finally g2
which<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> second<00:00:41.969> phase<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.989> growing<00:00:43.820> ok

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
which is the second phase of growing ok

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.319 
which is the second phase of growing ok
so<00:00:45.270> those<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.629> three<00:00:45.899> main<00:00:46.230> parts<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
so those are the three main parts of

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.979 
so those are the three main parts of
interphase<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> let's<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> look<00:00:54.750> here

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
interphase so let's have a look here

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
interphase so let's have a look here
what<00:00:55.320> happens<00:00:55.649> during<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.010> g2<00:00:56.640> stage<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
what happens during the g2 stage of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.840 
what happens during the g2 stage of
interphase<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> homologous<00:00:59.250> chromosomes

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
interphase so the homologous chromosomes

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.500 
interphase so the homologous chromosomes
pair

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
pair

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
pair
no<00:01:00.899> because<00:01:01.199> homologous<00:01:01.710> chromosomes

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
no because homologous chromosomes

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.370 
no because homologous chromosomes
pairing<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.809> during<00:01:04.500> meiosis<00:01:06.380> which

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
pairing is actually during meiosis which

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
pairing is actually during meiosis which
is<00:01:07.560> completely<00:01:08.490> separate<00:01:08.880> from<00:01:09.180> their<00:01:09.720> other

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
is completely separate from their other

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.670 
is completely separate from their other
parts<00:01:10.549> B<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.820> synthesis<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.450> proteins<00:01:12.960> yeah

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
parts B the synthesis of proteins yeah

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.280 
parts B the synthesis of proteins yeah
possibly<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.520> could<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.570> could<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
possibly it could be you could have the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.469 
possibly it could be you could have the
production<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> proteins<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:17.909> is<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
production of proteins which is the the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.359 
production of proteins which is the the
growth<00:01:18.780> which<00:01:19.049> you're<00:01:19.200> talking<00:01:19.320> about<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.979> g2

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
growth which you're talking about in g2

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.070 
growth which you're talking about in g2
so<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.360> leave<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.750> now

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
so let's leave that for now

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.010 
so let's leave that for now
homologous<00:01:22.650> chromosomes<00:01:23.490> separate<00:01:24.090> once

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
homologous chromosomes separate once

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
homologous chromosomes separate once
again<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.470> has<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:25.920> meiosis<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
again this has to do with meiosis so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.060 
again this has to do with meiosis so
we're<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.930> ignore<00:01:28.280> C<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:31.070> D

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
we're going to ignore C and D

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
we're going to ignore C and D
replication<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.939> DNA<00:01:33.119> well<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.750> talked

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
replication of DNA well we just talked

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.310 
replication of DNA well we just talked
about<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:35.310> S<00:01:35.490> phase<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.119> interphase<00:01:36.570> which<00:01:37.110> is

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
about the S phase of interphase which is

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.230 
about the S phase of interphase which is
where<00:01:37.560> DNA<00:01:37.920> synthesis<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.700> DNA<00:01:39.060> replication

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
where DNA synthesis of DNA replication

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990 
where DNA synthesis of DNA replication
occurs<00:01:39.829> therefore<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.670> happens

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
occurs therefore that's not what happens

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.450 
occurs therefore that's not what happens
in<00:01:42.090> g2<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:43.290> actually<00:01:43.680> occurs<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> S

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
in g2 this actually occurs in the S

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.219 
in g2 this actually occurs in the S
phase<00:01:47.180> therefore<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.420> correct<00:01:48.630> answer<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:48.960> B

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.450 

question<00:01:52.229> number<00:01:52.439> two<00:01:52.560> what<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:53.369> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
question number two what is the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.580 
question number two what is the
difference<00:01:53.880> between<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.299> cell<00:01:54.720> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> g1

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
difference between a cell in the g1

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.429 
difference between a cell in the g1
phase<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.729> cell<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.210> g2<00:01:57.719> phase<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
phase and a cell in the g2 phase of the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.370 
phase and a cell in the g2 phase of the
cell<00:01:58.649> cycle<00:01:59.450> casting<00:02:00.450> our<00:02:00.540> minds<00:02:00.750> back<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.229> my

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
cell cycle casting our minds back to my

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.350 
cell cycle casting our minds back to my
little<00:02:01.579> table<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.729> drew<00:02:03.000> over<00:02:03.210> there

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
little table that I drew over there

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.990 
little table that I drew over there
before<00:02:03.780> let's<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.439> about<00:02:04.590> this<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.460> cell

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
before let's think about this a a cell

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.449 
before let's think about this a a cell
in<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.390> g2<00:02:06.869> phase<00:02:07.140> would<00:02:07.439> be<00:02:07.560> smaller<00:02:08.069> than<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
in the g2 phase would be smaller than a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.950 
in the g2 phase would be smaller than a
cell<00:02:08.700> energy<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.330> phase

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
cell energy one phase

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.230 
cell energy one phase
well<00:02:10.680> a<00:02:10.890> cell<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.370> initially<00:02:11.880> let's<00:02:12.120> say

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
well a cell would initially let's say

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.630 
well a cell would initially let's say
this<00:02:12.480> cell<00:02:15.410> is<00:02:16.410> normally<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.310> then

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
this cell is normally like this then

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.460 
this cell is normally like this then
after<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.060> goes<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> g1<00:02:18.660> phase<00:02:18.870> then<00:02:19.350> it

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
after it goes to the g1 phase then it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.440 
after it goes to the g1 phase then it
grows<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.710> bit<00:02:19.980> bigger<00:02:22.700> then<00:02:23.700> after<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.270> S

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
grows a bit bigger then after the S

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.650 
grows a bit bigger then after the S
phase<00:02:24.750> then<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.850> cell<00:02:27.090> doesn't<00:02:27.390> grow<00:02:27.480> any

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
phase then the cell doesn't grow any

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.630 
phase then the cell doesn't grow any
bigger<00:02:27.810> but<00:02:28.080> then<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> nucleus<00:02:28.770> would

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.630 

because<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.290> DNA<00:02:34.290> synthesis<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.490> has

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
because of the DNA synthesis that has

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.750 
because of the DNA synthesis that has
occurred<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.600> then<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.930> during<00:02:37.440> g2<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.490> this

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
occurred but then in during g2 then this

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.180 
occurred but then in during g2 then this
cell<00:02:38.940> would<00:02:39.030> grow<00:02:39.240> even<00:02:39.450> bigger<00:02:39.630> again<00:02:40.190> so

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
cell would grow even bigger again so

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.890 
cell would grow even bigger again so
that's<00:02:41.400> slightly<00:02:41.700> bigger<00:02:42.150> let's<00:02:42.540> make<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
that's slightly bigger let's make it a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.190 
that's slightly bigger let's make it a
little<00:02:43.050> bit<00:02:43.230> bigger<00:02:43.350> show<00:02:43.920> me<00:02:44.660> so<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.930> becomes

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
little bit bigger show me so it becomes

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.430 
little bit bigger show me so it becomes
even<00:02:46.350> bigger<00:02:46.650> again

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.830 

so<00:02:52.440> you'd<00:02:52.590> expect<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:53.010> g2<00:02:53.489> cell<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:54.810> a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
so you'd expect the g2 cell to be a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.440 
so you'd expect the g2 cell to be a
larger<00:02:55.410> than<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.590> g1<00:02:56.010> cell<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.879> in<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.150> case

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
larger than a g1 cell so in this case

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.180 
larger than a g1 cell so in this case
this<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.750> wrong<00:02:58.080> because<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.650> says<00:02:58.890> will<00:02:59.040> be

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
this is wrong because it says will be

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.030 
this is wrong because it says will be
smaller<00:02:59.489> be<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.540> cell<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.200> g2<00:03:01.620> phase<00:03:01.830> would

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
smaller be a cell in the g2 phase would

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.070 
smaller be a cell in the g2 phase would
have<00:03:02.190> more<00:03:02.459> mitochondria<00:03:02.760> than<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.569> cell<00:03:03.870> in

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
have more mitochondria than a cell in

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.759 
have more mitochondria than a cell in
the<00:03:04.200> g1<00:03:04.620> phase<00:03:04.890> well<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.660> could<00:03:06.959> be<00:03:07.140> possible

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
the g1 phase well this could be possible

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.449 
the g1 phase well this could be possible
because<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.519> the<00:03:08.640> growth<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:10.459> you

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
because you have the growth of the you

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.309 
because you have the growth of the you
have<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.730> growth<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> cell<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:13.080> let's

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
have the growth of the cell but let's

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.809 
have the growth of the cell but let's
consider<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.799> other<00:03:13.920> possibilities<00:03:14.549> first

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
consider that other possibilities first

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.630 
consider that other possibilities first
a<00:03:15.209> cell<00:03:16.049> in<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> g1<00:03:16.709> phase<00:03:16.769> would<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.340> more

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
a cell in the g1 phase would have more

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.729 
a cell in the g1 phase would have more
DNA<00:03:17.970> in<00:03:18.090> its<00:03:18.569> chromosomes<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.349> cell<00:03:19.560> in<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
DNA in its chromosomes in a cell in the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.819 
DNA in its chromosomes in a cell in the
g2<00:03:20.099> phase<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:21.000> is<00:03:21.060> wrong<00:03:21.450> because<00:03:22.049> during<00:03:22.590> S

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
g2 phase this is wrong because during S

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.819 
g2 phase this is wrong because during S
the<00:03:23.280> S<00:03:23.459> phase<00:03:23.700> which<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.269> between<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.319> g1<00:03:25.680> and

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
the S phase which is between the g1 and

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.940 
the S phase which is between the g1 and
g2<00:03:25.980> you<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.760> increasing<00:03:27.360> DNA<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.530> therefore

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
g2 you have increasing DNA so therefore

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.530 
g2 you have increasing DNA so therefore
G<00:03:29.280> g1<00:03:29.970> phase<00:03:30.209> cells<00:03:30.599> would<00:03:30.780> have<00:03:30.840> less<00:03:31.230> DNA<00:03:32.540> in

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
G g1 phase cells would have less DNA in

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.360 
G g1 phase cells would have less DNA in
its<00:03:33.720> chromosomes<00:03:34.170> let's<00:03:34.769> talk<00:03:34.890> about<00:03:34.980> deep

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
its chromosomes let's talk about deep

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.819 
its chromosomes let's talk about deep
DNA<00:03:36.120> with<00:03:36.299> replication<00:03:36.720> occurs<00:03:37.110> in<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.349> g1

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
DNA with replication occurs in the g1

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.949 
DNA with replication occurs in the g1
phase<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.340> not<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> g2<00:03:38.970> phase<00:03:39.239> wrong

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
phase but not in the g2 phase wrong

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.520 
phase but not in the g2 phase wrong
again<00:03:40.230> because<00:03:40.620> it's<00:03:40.950> s<00:03:41.420> which<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:43.110> S<00:03:43.260> phase

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
again because it's s which the S phase

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.199 
again because it's s which the S phase
which<00:03:43.829> DNA<00:03:44.129> replication<00:03:44.670> occurs<00:03:45.060> in

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
which DNA replication occurs in

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.030 
which DNA replication occurs in
therefore<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> answer<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.690> B<00:03:51.709> which<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.890> meant

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
therefore the answer is B which I meant

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.759 
therefore the answer is B which I meant
occur<00:03:53.519> during<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.000> g1<00:03:54.450> phase<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:55.049> S<00:03:55.230> phase<00:03:55.500> of

occur during the g1 phase and S phase of
the<00:03:55.859> cell<00:03:56.069> cycle

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
the cell cycle

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.090 
the cell cycle
once<00:03:57.569> again<00:03:57.690> more<00:03:58.109> phases<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.859> do<00:03:59.010> with

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
once again more phases to do with

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.140 
once again more phases to do with
interphase<00:03:59.540> S<00:04:00.540> phase<00:04:01.639> what<00:04:02.639> happens<00:04:03.030> during

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
interphase S phase what happens during

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.809 
interphase S phase what happens during
the<00:04:03.269> S<00:04:03.359> phase<00:04:03.389> is<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.840> DNA<00:04:04.170> replicates<00:04:04.819> during

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
the S phase is the DNA replicates during

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.809 
the S phase is the DNA replicates during
the<00:04:06.180> g1<00:04:07.049> phase<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.980> cell<00:04:08.190> grows<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.670> this

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
the g1 phase the cell grows so this

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.099 
the g1 phase the cell grows so this
seems<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.180> would<00:04:09.389> be<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.599> likely<00:04:09.780> answer

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
seems like would be the likely answer

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.930 
seems like would be the likely answer
but<00:04:10.709> let's<00:04:10.889> look<00:04:11.010> at<00:04:11.160> why<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.370> other<00:04:11.609> ones<00:04:11.819> are

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
but let's look at why the other ones are

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.970 
but let's look at why the other ones are
wrong<00:04:12.090> during<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.810> g1<00:04:13.139> phase<00:04:13.170> those<00:04:13.620> DNA

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
wrong during the g1 phase those DNA

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.780 
wrong during the g1 phase those DNA
replicate<00:04:14.430> no<00:04:14.700> no<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.420> doesn't

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.870 

during<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.570> g1<00:04:20.470> phase<00:04:20.710> does<00:04:20.980> mitosis<00:04:21.550> begin

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
during the g1 phase does mitosis begin

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.880 
during the g1 phase does mitosis begin
note<00:04:22.300> because<00:04:22.570> g1<00:04:23.110> is<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.350> part<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
note because g1 is a part of the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.140 
note because g1 is a part of the
interface<00:04:24.160> an<00:04:24.900> interface<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.200> by<00:04:26.940> ptosis<00:04:27.940> are

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
interface an interface and by ptosis are

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.780 
interface an interface and by ptosis are
separate<00:04:29.400> separate<00:04:30.400> from<00:04:30.640> mitosis<00:04:31.210> so

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
separate separate from mitosis so

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.190 
separate separate from mitosis so
therefore<00:04:33.790> it's<00:04:33.910> not<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:34.240> one<00:04:34.420> how<00:04:35.170> about

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
therefore it's not this one how about

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.240 
therefore it's not this one how about
this<00:04:35.530> one<00:04:35.680> over<00:04:35.800> here

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
this one over here

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.130 
this one over here
there's<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.670> cell<00:04:36.910> divide<00:04:37.300> during<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.780> g1

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
there's a cell divide during the g1

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.500 
there's a cell divide during the g1
phase<00:04:38.380> no<00:04:39.010> it<00:04:39.220> doesn't<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:40.030> therefore<00:04:40.360> it's

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
phase no it doesn't so therefore it's

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.600

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.280 
last one the graph below represents the
amount<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.580> DNA<00:04:48.880> during<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.690> cell<00:04:49.960> cycle

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
amount of DNA during the cell cycle

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.090 
amount of DNA during the cell cycle
which<00:04:51.130> part<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:52.090> graph<00:04:52.450> represents

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
which part of the graph represents

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.860 
which part of the graph represents
metaphase<00:04:54.100> so<00:04:54.850> I've<00:04:54.940> got<00:04:55.090> this<00:04:55.270> amount<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.690> DNA

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
metaphase so I've got this amount of DNA

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.810 
metaphase so I've got this amount of DNA
don't<00:04:56.350> worry<00:04:56.560> about<00:04:57.330> this<00:04:58.330> complicated<00:04:59.820> title

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
don't worry about this complicated title

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.390 
don't worry about this complicated title
over<00:05:01.030> here<00:05:01.560> essentially<00:05:02.560> just<00:05:02.890> talking<00:05:03.310> about

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
over here essentially just talking about

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.700 
over here essentially just talking about
the<00:05:03.580> amount<00:05:03.820> of<00:05:04.030> DNA<00:05:04.210> so<00:05:05.110> when<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.380> have<00:05:05.530> the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
the amount of DNA so when you have the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.530 
the amount of DNA so when you have the
you<00:05:06.670> have<00:05:06.820> about<00:05:07.000> 2.5<00:05:07.860> units<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:09.100> DNA<00:05:09.540> starting

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
you have about 2.5 units of DNA starting

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.330 
you have about 2.5 units of DNA starting
off<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.930> then<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.140> goes<00:05:11.260> up<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.560> about<00:05:11.590> five<00:05:12.040> so

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
off and then it goes up to about five so

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.610 
off and then it goes up to about five so
it's<00:05:12.490> doubling<00:05:15.660> so<00:05:16.660> what<00:05:16.900> does<00:05:17.050> this

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
it's doubling so what does this

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.550 
it's doubling so what does this
represent<00:05:17.920> so<00:05:18.430> this<00:05:18.610> represents<00:05:19.330> when<00:05:20.020> the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
represent so this represents when the

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.670 
represent so this represents when the
DNA<00:05:20.890> increases<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:21.910> DNA<00:05:22.630> increases<00:05:23.170> after<00:05:23.530> it

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
DNA increases and DNA increases after it

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.880 
DNA increases and DNA increases after it
replicates<00:05:24.220> and<00:05:24.520> it<00:05:24.910> replicates<00:05:25.060> during<00:05:25.890> the

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
replicates and it replicates during the

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.710 
replicates and it replicates during the
S<00:05:27.070> phase<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.610> synthesis<00:05:28.210> phase<00:05:28.420> of

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
S phase the synthesis phase of

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.090 
S phase the synthesis phase of
interphase<00:05:29.140> so<00:05:29.530> this<00:05:29.740> is<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:30.100> S<00:05:30.250> phase<00:05:32.100> so

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
interphase so this is the S phase so

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.410 
interphase so this is the S phase so
which<00:05:33.280> part<00:05:33.550> of<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.700> graph<00:05:33.880> represents

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:34.420 
which part of the graph represents

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.680 
which part of the graph represents
metaphase<00:05:34.930> so<00:05:35.230> it<00:05:35.350> can't<00:05:35.680> be<00:05:35.830> beat<00:05:36.540> so<00:05:37.540> it's

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
metaphase so it can't be beat so it's

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.600 
metaphase so it can't be beat so it's
not<00:05:37.810> be<00:05:38.700> how<00:05:39.700> about<00:05:40.030> a<00:05:40.680> so<00:05:41.680> it's<00:05:41.860> not<00:05:42.100> a<00:05:42.340> either

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
not be how about a so it's not a either

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.420 
not be how about a so it's not a either
because<00:05:43.000> you'd<00:05:43.150> expect<00:05:43.660> there<00:05:44.230> are<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.920> novel

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
because you'd expect there are the novel

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.420 
because you'd expect there are the novel
amount<00:05:45.670> of<00:05:45.910> DNA<00:05:46.450> to<00:05:47.020> be<00:05:47.050> double<00:05:47.740> during

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
amount of DNA to be double during

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.700 
amount of DNA to be double during
metaphase<00:05:48.970> because<00:05:49.630> remember<00:05:50.290> that<00:05:50.410> the<00:05:50.500> cell

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
metaphase because remember that the cell

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.140 
metaphase because remember that the cell
has<00:05:50.890> already<00:05:51.160> divided<00:05:51.760> its<00:05:51.880> whole<00:05:52.270> genomic

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
has already divided its whole genomic

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.450 
has already divided its whole genomic
genomic<00:05:55.150> and<00:05:55.480> genetic<00:05:55.510> information<00:05:56.460> so

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
genomic and genetic information so

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.510 
genomic and genetic information so
therefore<00:05:57.790> it's<00:05:57.910> not<00:05:58.000> may<00:05:58.180> not<00:05:58.680> be<00:05:59.680> how<00:06:00.340> about

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
therefore it's not may not be how about

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.500 
therefore it's not may not be how about
C<00:06:00.760> and<00:06:00.970> D<00:06:01.500> so<00:06:02.820> we<00:06:03.820> have<00:06:03.970> to<00:06:04.090> remember<00:06:04.300> that

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
C and D so we have to remember that

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.270 
C and D so we have to remember that
metaphase<00:06:04.990> what<00:06:05.500> happens<00:06:05.800> during<00:06:05.950> metaphase

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
metaphase what happens during metaphase

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.000 
metaphase what happens during metaphase
during<00:06:07.000> metaphase<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:08.170> chromosomes<00:06:08.560> they

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
during metaphase the chromosomes they

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.540 
during metaphase the chromosomes they
line<00:06:09.280> up<00:06:10.170> this<00:06:11.170> is<00:06:11.320> my<00:06:11.470> crappy<00:06:11.890> image<00:06:12.220> of

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
line up this is my crappy image of

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.719 
line up this is my crappy image of
chromosomes<00:06:13.240> in<00:06:13.480> a<00:06:13.540> Cell

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
chromosomes in a Cell

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.670 
chromosomes in a Cell
they'll<00:06:15.629> line<00:06:15.839> up<00:06:15.870> in<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.139> middle<00:06:16.229> of<00:06:16.559> the

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
they'll line up in the middle of the

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.379 
they'll line up in the middle of the
equator<00:06:17.099> and<00:06:18.020> they<00:06:19.020> are<00:06:19.379> pulled<00:06:19.680> apart<00:06:20.389> so

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
equator and they are pulled apart so

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.839 
equator and they are pulled apart so
remember<00:06:21.689> the<00:06:21.809> spindle<00:06:22.289> fibers<00:06:22.639> on<00:06:23.639> either

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
remember the spindle fibers on either

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.510 
remember the spindle fibers on either
side<00:06:24.289> spindle<00:06:25.289> fibers<00:06:25.559> they<00:06:25.650> attach<00:06:26.039> to<00:06:26.400> the

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
side spindle fibers they attach to the

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.820 
side spindle fibers they attach to the
centromeres<00:06:26.729> and<00:06:27.389> then<00:06:27.990> there<00:06:28.139> pull<00:06:28.529> the

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
centromeres and then there pull the

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.529 
centromeres and then there pull the
separate<00:06:29.249> chromatids<00:06:29.789> apart<00:06:29.909> the<00:06:30.240> sister

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 
separate chromatids apart the sister

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.010 
separate chromatids apart the sister
chromatids<00:06:30.960> apart<00:06:31.309> so<00:06:32.479> the<00:06:33.479> key<00:06:33.719> thing<00:06:33.990> to

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
chromatids apart so the key thing to

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.170 
chromatids apart so the key thing to
know<00:06:34.259> about<00:06:34.289> this<00:06:34.650> is<00:06:34.949> that<00:06:35.009> during<00:06:35.759> this<00:06:35.849> part

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
know about this is that during this part

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.829 
know about this is that during this part
which<00:06:36.930> is<00:06:36.960> metaphase<00:06:37.759> then<00:06:38.759> you<00:06:39.300> still<00:06:39.599> only

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:39.839 
which is metaphase then you still only

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:42.260 
which is metaphase then you still only
have<00:06:40.169> one<00:06:40.199> cell<00:06:40.830> with<00:06:41.279> twice<00:06:41.729> the<00:06:41.969> amount<00:06:42.029> of

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
have one cell with twice the amount of

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.239 
have one cell with twice the amount of
DNA<00:06:42.449> you<00:06:42.629> have<00:06:42.900> the<00:06:43.020> you<00:06:43.559> have<00:06:43.680> chromatid

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:44.249 
DNA you have the you have chromatid

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:46.309 
DNA you have the you have chromatid
number<00:06:44.520> one<00:06:44.669> and<00:06:44.939> chromatid<00:06:45.389> number<00:06:45.659> two<00:06:45.839> so

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 
number one and chromatid number two so

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:48.529 
number one and chromatid number two so
you<00:06:46.379> have<00:06:46.499> two<00:06:46.800> copies<00:06:47.309> within<00:06:47.879> the<00:06:48.059> same<00:06:48.270> cell

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
you have two copies within the same cell

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.100 
you have two copies within the same cell
so<00:06:49.319> therefore<00:06:49.770> it<00:06:50.009> should<00:06:50.309> be<00:06:50.960> double<00:06:51.960> the

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
so therefore it should be double the

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.969 
so therefore it should be double the
amount<00:06:52.409> of<00:06:52.529> a<00:06:52.770> usual<00:06:53.419> cell<00:06:54.419> the<00:06:55.139> amount<00:06:55.620> of<00:06:55.800> DNA

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
amount of a usual cell the amount of DNA

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.279 
amount of a usual cell the amount of DNA
in<00:06:56.430> this<00:06:56.789> cell<00:06:57.029> should<00:06:57.240> be<00:06:57.389> double<00:06:57.809> the<00:06:57.839> amount

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.289 
in this cell should be double the amount

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.429 
in this cell should be double the amount
of<00:06:58.499> a<00:06:59.490> usual<00:06:59.999> cell<00:07:00.210> so<00:07:00.870> therefore<00:07:01.229> it's<00:07:01.379> not

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:01.439 
of a usual cell so therefore it's not

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:03.110 
of a usual cell so therefore it's not
deep<00:07:01.919> because<00:07:02.159> this<00:07:02.399> would<00:07:02.550> be<00:07:02.580> the<00:07:02.669> normal

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
deep because this would be the normal

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.950
