00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
have to run around and avoid them and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.740 
have to run around and avoid them and
stack<00:00:25.109> them<00:00:25.320> until<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.890> reach<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.250> top

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
goodness okay you know if that were

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.189 
goodness okay you know if that were
smart<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.969> would<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.180> run<00:00:51.510> around<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
smart I would just run around in a

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.410 
smart I would just run around in a
circle<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.460> slowly<00:00:54.000> move<00:00:54.360> towards

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
circle like this and slowly move towards

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.439 
circle like this and slowly move towards
the<00:00:54.899> center<00:00:55.460> because<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.270> would

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
the center because then you would

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.529 
the center because then you would
gradually<00:00:58.079> but<00:00:58.559> inevitably<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.399> able<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.940> run

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
gradually but inevitably be able to run

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
gradually but inevitably be able to run
around<00:01:00.570> everywhere<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:01.920> running

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
around everywhere I'm just running

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.119 
around everywhere I'm just running
around<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:03.030> circles<00:01:03.090> around<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.110> inside<00:01:04.500> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
around in circles around the inside to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.830 
around in circles around the inside to
fill<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.489> eventually<00:01:05.790> okay<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> should

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
fill up eventually okay I should

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.830 
fill up eventually okay I should
probably<00:01:07.229> okay<00:01:08.150> strategy<00:01:09.150> doesn't<00:01:09.330> work<00:01:09.479> for

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
probably okay strategy doesn't work for

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
probably okay strategy doesn't work for
this<00:01:09.960> I've<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.890> decided<00:01:11.220> oh<00:01:11.549> gosh<00:01:11.880> it's

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
can at least beat it this is gonna be my

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.110 
can at least beat it this is gonna be my
last<00:06:36.800> attempt<00:06:37.220> so<00:06:37.340> I<00:06:37.400> gotta<00:06:37.550> make<00:06:37.730> it<00:06:37.790> count

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
last attempt so I gotta make it count

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.570 
last attempt so I gotta make it count
okay<00:06:42.950> I<00:06:42.980> just<00:06:43.220> make<00:06:43.340> it<00:06:43.370> like<00:06:43.520> a

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
okay I just make it like a

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.880 
okay I just make it like a
staircase<00:06:44.110> but<00:06:45.110> you<00:06:45.230> just<00:06:45.470> make<00:06:45.650> like<00:06:45.860> a

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:45.890
