00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.390
 this is the babysitter taskforce tour 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.529
 green left party leader of open 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:20.570
 and i love comparing today 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.550
 what another can strengthen 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.069
 valuable ruining opponent from a to b 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.069
 we are going to see which of these car steps are included 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.899
 yes this kind of this week that they are of course ideally suited 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.770
 chairman 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.930
 with a lot of poppy men from the island 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.640
 because i'm going to try this kid's stroller this suitcase 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.010
 to get in the car 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.040
 because know its great fun but on the spot as apple farmers my grandfather and 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.040
 grandma can 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.330
 it would not surprise us on paper 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.780
 crystal astra also slightly smaller 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.210
 the trunk space the other on the shield 40 meters 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.520
 they make you pack milk in practice, I notice that too 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 this is still going well 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.540
 mcclaren is concerned, it is actually not so crazy in this second car 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.730
 much difference 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 we both fit perfectly in m 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.490
 I know you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.700
 the benches are still over it, the children must of course go to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.500
 Grandpa and Grandma 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.370
 the app store looks very modern on the inside 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.490
 the navigation screen for both cars is neatly at eye level 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.030
 but at the redroom site the clock for one to operate between the seats and that 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.410
 is less convenient 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.150
 furthermore, the speedometer is digital and the rest of the morning strange 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.310
 combination 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.490
 and the astra comes across the middle class to the research with all the buttons 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.820
 instruments of the opels a good or le soir both the there are various 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.820
 steering wheel operation 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.790
 the Opel astra drives like a real open 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.940
 comfortable and a touch sporty 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.350
 He does not help much and the controls respond nicely 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.529
 What is annoying is that the car in traffic jams still comes across jerky 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:14.529
 and he lacked strength in the fifty and sixties 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:19.279
 the crew feels even more comfortable 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:22.739
 there is a management function within the path of the call and at low revs 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.099
 not a lot of pulling power 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.339
 moreover as a tour 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.339
 the engine responds more vividly and smoothly 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:32.069
 how safe do these cars drive 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.999
 let that be assessed by an ebit from the test and training center therefore a 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.599
 to be able to make a good comparison between the two cars, I will first go to all spas 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.340
 sludge latin 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.740
 Sky can be introduced as if all systems are on it while it is in pieces 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.499
 is thrown third place 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.019
 then the slalom will do and as both customer and inconvenience both cars 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.589
 Both cars are equipped with a SP tuner in a booth where it is always 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:05.629
 comes again 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.879
 at the kickoff it is clear that that car has more grip can also do more 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.919
 when the car is busy slippery surfaces in the slip 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.109
 it is therefore if you correct quickly enough with much better handling 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.579
 at the funny images 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:18.729
 romero 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:21.009
 the second test is the slalom 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.449
 the car both score a good enough but there are differences 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:28.069
 the opel astra steer more directly than a little and help less and less 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.299
 therefore he feels sportier 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.229
 how fast the car stopped 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.589
 that is a matter of standing on top of the pedal mh at first sight 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.319
 both cars are excellent 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.819
 and of course another important question 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.459
 what costs and what do you get for that money 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.069
 this astra cosmo costs 24,945 euros 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.599
 but there are several packages on this item that make it extra tasty 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.650
 among other things the extensive navigation, the heated seats and the bi xenon 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.650
 headlights, this one comes at 32 mille 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.699
 the need is a thesis 330 bozer 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.539
 it costs 24,990 euros and is therefore in principle just as expensive as the app store 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.459
 here too, some extras have been fitted, but this version already comes as standard 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.919
 quite a few things on board 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.169
 including the beautiful sounding angry installation 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.240
 the test car comes to 70,000 and 117th 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.590
 choose more and more cars between these two years 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.509
 is primarily a matter of taste 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.840
 in storage options in a storage room 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.819
 it is approximately the same size in practice 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:41.289
 it is true that we feel a bit sportier and more active 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.120
 pay north head 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.930
 and lays several are market square 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.449
 and these can be found in the ergonomics of the bill later 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.520
 some stitches fall 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.969
 one of these on or would you actually with some more engine power 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.389
 and if you ask me about my taste
