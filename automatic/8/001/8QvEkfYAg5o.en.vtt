of his wedding in episode 22 of arrow so
it's<00:04:28.000> probably<00:04:28.210> gonna<00:04:28.330> happen<00:04:28.450> is<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.900> the

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
it's probably gonna happen is is the

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.750 
it's probably gonna happen is is the
events<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.470> these<00:04:29.560> episodes<00:04:29.740> will<00:04:30.220> overlap<00:04:30.729> a

little<00:04:30.940> bit

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
little bit

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.210 
little bit
that's<00:04:32.020> just<00:04:32.320> my<00:04:32.410> best<00:04:32.620> guess<00:04:32.800> though<00:04:33.010> the

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
that's just my best guess though the

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.130 
that's just my best guess though the
producers<00:04:33.640> haven't<00:04:33.970> explained<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.510> they

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
producers haven't explained it they

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.570 
producers haven't explained it they
could<00:04:35.289> have<00:04:35.320> just<00:04:35.410> derped<00:04:35.800> in<00:04:35.950> this<00:04:36.190> moment

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
could have just derped in this moment

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.250 
could have just derped in this moment
where<00:04:36.700> all<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:37.000> us<00:04:37.090> here<00:04:37.360> now<00:04:37.510> could<00:04:38.020> take

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
where all of us here now could take

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.860 
where all of us here now could take
place<00:04:38.380> after<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:39.010> arrow<00:04:39.190> finale<00:04:39.690> it<00:04:40.690> just

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
place after the arrow finale it just

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.029 
place after the arrow finale it just
seems<00:04:41.020> like<00:04:41.110> Oliver<00:04:41.410> is<00:04:41.530> gonna<00:04:41.680> be<00:04:41.800> spending

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 
seems like Oliver is gonna be spending

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.159 
seems like Oliver is gonna be spending
most<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.460> the<00:04:42.580> arrow<00:04:42.760> finale<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.510> the<00:04:43.930> plane

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
most of the arrow finale on the plane
