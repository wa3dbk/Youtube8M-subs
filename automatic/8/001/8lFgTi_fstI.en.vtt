00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
me and he's actually the healer he just

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.890 
me and he's actually the healer he just
puts<00:04:28.500> up<00:04:28.650> with<00:04:28.830> me<00:04:29.040> because<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.490> feed<00:04:29.940> him<00:04:30.180> twice

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
puts up with me because I feed him twice

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:37.100 
puts up with me because I feed him twice
a<00:04:31.050> day<00:04:34.160> so<00:04:35.160> I'm<00:04:36.090> gonna<00:04:36.240> be<00:04:36.360> bouncing<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:37.020> and

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
a day so I'm gonna be bouncing in and

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.060 
a day so I'm gonna be bouncing in and
out<00:04:37.290> because<00:04:37.560> we're<00:04:37.740> filming<00:04:38.010> okay<00:04:40.070> when

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
out because we're filming okay when

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.890 
out because we're filming okay when
we're<00:04:41.280> talking<00:04:41.550> about<00:04:41.790> intuition<00:04:42.300> we're

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
we're talking about intuition we're

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.470 
we're talking about intuition we're
talking<00:04:43.320> about<00:04:43.470> receiving<00:04:44.400> energy<00:04:44.850> because

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
talking about receiving energy because

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.150 
talking about receiving energy because
energy<00:04:46.640> reception<00:04:47.640> is<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:49.530> aunt<00:04:49.710> are<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
energy reception is the aunt are the

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.630 
energy reception is the aunt are the
antennas<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:51.240> what<00:04:51.810> give<00:04:52.140> us<00:04:52.170> information<00:04:52.980> and

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
antennas of what give us information and

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.700 
antennas of what give us information and
resonance<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:55.110> I'm<00:04:55.230> going<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.440> show<00:04:55.680> you

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
resonance and I'm going to show you

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.550 
resonance and I'm going to show you
inside<00:04:56.220> of<00:04:56.820> cells

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
inside of cells

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.770 
inside of cells
how<00:04:58.560> many<00:04:58.860> receivers<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.790> have<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.450> little

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
how many receivers you have and a little

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.080 
how many receivers you have and a little
bit<00:05:00.960> about<00:05:01.170> how<00:05:01.410> they<00:05:01.590> work<00:05:01.700> now<00:05:02.700> there<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.060> a

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
bit about how they work now there is a

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.920 
bit about how they work now there is a
gap<00:05:03.540> between<00:05:04.970> okay<00:05:05.970> here's<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.450> receiver

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
gap between okay here's the receiver

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.950 
gap between okay here's the receiver
here's<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.470> cell<00:05:07.770> structure<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.790> this<00:05:09.750> is

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
here's the cell structure and this is

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.560 
here's the cell structure and this is
the<00:05:10.110> intuition<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.800> get<00:05:11.040> nobody's<00:05:11.880> cross<00:05:12.210> that

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
the intuition I get nobody's cross that

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.220 
the intuition I get nobody's cross that
gap<00:05:12.900> yet<00:05:13.290> how<00:05:14.070> does<00:05:14.280> it<00:05:14.490> get<00:05:14.669> from<00:05:15.110> yeah<00:05:16.110> I'm

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
gap yet how does it get from yeah I'm

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.360 
gap yet how does it get from yeah I'm
receiving<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:17.100> too<00:05:17.610> now<00:05:18.270> I<00:05:18.300> understand<00:05:19.050> it

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
receiving it too now I understand it

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.060 
receiving it too now I understand it
that's<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.610> lived<00:05:20.880> experience<00:05:21.570> and<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:22.950> have

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
that's a lived experience and I have

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.130 
that's a lived experience and I have
lots<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:23.550> those<00:05:23.700> experiences<00:05:24.450> like<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.870> have

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
lots of those experiences like you have

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.930 
lots of those experiences like you have
but<00:05:25.710> I<00:05:25.740> want<00:05:25.980> to<00:05:26.070> show<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.340> what<00:05:26.640> sits

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
but I want to show you what sits

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.070 
but I want to show you what sits
underneath<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:27.870> at<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.740> level<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.160> science

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
underneath that at the level of science

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.629 
underneath that at the level of science
so<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.650> know<00:05:31.770> most<00:05:32.010> of<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.310> know

so you know most of you know
my<00:05:33.120> background<00:05:33.599> let<00:05:33.750> me<00:05:33.870> just<00:05:34.530> briefly<00:05:35.039> give

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
my background let me just briefly give

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.520 
my background let me just briefly give
that<00:05:35.909> so<00:05:36.449> that<00:05:38.210> you<00:05:39.210> know<00:05:39.389> I<00:05:39.419> just<00:05:39.930> really<00:05:40.379> know

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
that so that you know I just really know

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.929 
that so that you know I just really know
what<00:05:40.710> I'm<00:05:40.830> talking<00:05:41.340> about

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
what I'm talking about

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:49.610 
what I'm talking about
I<00:05:44.629> loved<00:05:45.629> science<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:47.030> finished<00:05:48.030> a<00:05:48.240> PhD<00:05:49.139> in

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
I loved science and finished a PhD in

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.480 
I loved science and finished a PhD in

whole<00:05:53.490> lot<00:05:53.699> of<00:05:53.729> years<00:05:53.909> ago<00:05:54.680> after<00:05:55.680> that<00:05:55.860> I<00:05:55.889> did

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
whole lot of years ago after that I did

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.129 
whole lot of years ago after that I did
a<00:05:56.280> postdoctoral<00:05:56.939> fellowship<00:05:57.569> with<00:05:57.990> the

who was extremely well known for his
work<00:06:09.539> on<00:06:09.750> skin<00:06:10.229> and<00:06:11.210> I<00:06:12.210> walked<00:06:12.479> into<00:06:12.689> the

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
work on skin and I walked into the

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.439 
work on skin and I walked into the
primate<00:06:13.259> Center<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:13.800> first<00:06:14.039> day<00:06:14.340> and<00:06:14.789> sat

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
primate Center the first day and sat

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:18.409 
primate Center the first day and sat
down<00:06:15.479> with<00:06:15.960> my<00:06:16.169> boss<00:06:16.740> and<00:06:17.159> said<00:06:17.909> I'm<00:06:18.180> not

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
down with my boss and said I'm not

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.070 
down with my boss and said I'm not
touching<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.229> monkey<00:06:20.270> and<00:06:21.270> he<00:06:21.449> said<00:06:21.779> what<00:06:22.050> are

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
touching a monkey and he said what are

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.339 
touching a monkey and he said what are
we<00:06:22.289> gonna<00:06:22.469> do<00:06:22.740> with<00:06:22.919> you<00:06:23.449> now<00:06:24.449> for<00:06:24.479> my<00:06:25.020> work

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
we gonna do with you now for my work

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:27.080 
we gonna do with you now for my work
which<00:06:25.680> was<00:06:25.919> work<00:06:26.279> with<00:06:26.490> the<00:06:26.639> electron

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
which was work with the electron

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.360 
which was work with the electron
microscope<00:06:27.419> and<00:06:27.930> looking<00:06:28.500> at<00:06:28.650> the<00:06:28.830> secrets

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
microscope and looking at the secrets

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.719 
microscope and looking at the secrets
inside<00:06:30.000> of<00:06:30.210> cells<00:06:30.919> means<00:06:31.919> I<00:06:32.250> have<00:06:32.370> to<00:06:32.520> take

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
inside of cells means I have to take

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:35.510 
inside of cells means I have to take
chunks<00:06:33.000> of<00:06:33.240> tissue<00:06:33.539> and<00:06:33.960> process<00:06:34.469> it<00:06:34.680> and<00:06:35.430> I

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
chunks of tissue and process it and I

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.550 
chunks of tissue and process it and I
wasn't<00:06:35.759> about<00:06:35.969> to<00:06:36.150> run<00:06:36.569> around<00:06:36.719> chopping<00:06:37.440> up

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
wasn't about to run around chopping up

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.879 
wasn't about to run around chopping up
monkeys<00:06:38.029> so<00:06:39.029> he<00:06:39.300> sort<00:06:39.599> of<00:06:39.659> shuttled<00:06:40.139> me<00:06:40.259> off<00:06:40.440> to

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
monkeys so he sort of shuttled me off to

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.730 
monkeys so he sort of shuttled me off to
the<00:06:41.849> microscopy<00:06:42.449> group<00:06:43.080> and<00:06:43.289> I<00:06:43.379> started

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
the microscopy group and I started

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.700 
the microscopy group and I started
working<00:06:43.979> on<00:06:44.279> fish<00:06:44.610> and<00:06:45.289> working<00:06:46.289> on<00:06:46.469> the

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
working on fish and working on the

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.129 
working on fish and working on the
pigment<00:06:46.979> cells<00:06:47.310> of<00:06:47.580> fish<00:06:47.909> because<00:06:48.719> they're

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:49.139 
pigment cells of fish because they're

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:49.969 
pigment cells of fish because they're
exquisite

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
exquisite

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.309 
exquisite
they're<00:06:50.129> really<00:06:50.729> interesting<00:06:51.479> and<00:06:51.750> then<00:06:52.289> I

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
they're really interesting and then I

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.379 
they're really interesting and then I
hooked<00:06:52.740> up<00:06:52.919> with<00:06:53.190> people<00:06:53.580> at<00:06:53.729> the<00:06:53.879> Graduate

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
hooked up with people at the Graduate

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.709 
hooked up with people at the Graduate
Center<00:06:54.659> and<00:06:55.080> we<00:06:55.589> started<00:06:56.039> working<00:06:56.370> with<00:06:56.909> high

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:57.719 
Center and we started working with high

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.439 
Center and we started working with high
speed<00:06:58.080> lasers<00:06:58.849> q-switched<00:06:59.849> lasers<00:07:00.419> that

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449 
speed lasers q-switched lasers that

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.600 
speed lasers q-switched lasers that
develop<00:07:01.289> their<00:07:02.099> pulse<00:07:02.819> in<00:07:03.240> four<00:07:04.199> or<00:07:04.289> five

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
develop their pulse in four or five

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.429 
develop their pulse in four or five
nanoseconds<00:07:05.610> that's<00:07:06.210> so<00:07:06.599> fast<00:07:06.930> you<00:07:07.169> can't

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:07.439 
nanoseconds that's so fast you can't

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:10.219 
nanoseconds that's so fast you can't
conceive<00:07:07.919> of<00:07:07.949> it
