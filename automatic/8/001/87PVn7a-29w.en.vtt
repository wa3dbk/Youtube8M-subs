have a bye but I think we're going to do
it<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:01.350> no<00:02:01.469> reason<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
it because there's no reason to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.859 
it because there's no reason to
experience<00:02:02.490> yeah<00:02:02.790> yeah<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.719> out
