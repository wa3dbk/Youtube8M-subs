00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.459
 Today is absolutely cool 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.360
 his party is one 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.450
 Economic factor of the shares 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.789
 minute 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.600
 you can hear that 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.260
 it is ending today 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.720
 not only up 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.119
 around this 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.060
 Percent to 11 3 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.849
 There was a lack of physical activity 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.079
 August will have continued to expand 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.339
 Martin Biesel 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.010
 because itself becomes 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.150
 also mental 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.440
 and give it 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.410
 actually great 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.160
 unfortunately he got married there 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.210
 this 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.930
 because rarely offered 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.430
 be done 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 Health for humanity 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 they were under construction 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.319
 general 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.319
 Creative crafting this is either 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.560
 in a good mood 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.510
 this health system 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.980
 that seems to me to be a disease 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 this is what distinguishes it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 that are more in harmony with other people 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.800
 the judges of the 11th 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.010
 about the other person 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.530
 to oneself 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.880
 the human being 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.130
 Mirror next to him 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.130
 the community of humans 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.880
 and the community reflects 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.750
 the individual person 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.230
 Rudolf Steiner 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.230
 the founder of the band 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.650
 less beautiful 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.210
 visibly parked to the social web 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.720
 and that was all 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.240
 equally 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.660
 I do not want to mention it now 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.930
 so we would this part 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.890
 take in addition 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.060
 the human parade 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.850
 is actually 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.090
 People are part of it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.010
 the Belgian 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.399
 these people community 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.619
 now this is single 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.519
 as equals the time was ripe 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.059
 vb 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.579
 and that will 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.249
 extension 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.349
 and also this casting 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.419
 the second 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:25.389
 Mosaic 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.669
 the nature 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.669
 Man may say like me 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 I am interested in the cosmos 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:39.329
 but 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.249
 she is 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.449
 Real was 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.599
 that's nothing external to us 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.609
 the human being 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.729
 cartoon 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.109
 the nature 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.379
 Alone the Welsh 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.219
 and I think that's one thing 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.759
 to Iraq 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.869
 by observation 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.429
 can get started yourself 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.449
 and at EUR 8 o'clock if possible with your eyes closed 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.369
 not open publicly 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:12.319
 there 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.779
 but this again 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.049
 that every world 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.969
 has himself 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.329
 a recommendation 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.329
 I know that's nice 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.389
 because only cosiness 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.159
 smallest everyday things 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.159
 all were rubbing with their eyes closed 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.829
 what's in there 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:40.889
 this as expected 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.139
 because you realize that created behind each 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.659
 behind each of course the 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:48.880
 a theater 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.039
 cosmos 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.359
 I do not want to be so easy 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.359
 we've just been the recipient from Sao Paulo 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.269
 and that says a terrific start 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.809
 This is what the author really looks like only on planes 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.119
 Bremerhaven 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.709
 no thanks 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.389
 at Claraplatz 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.719
 Pam Ann Arbor in the street canyons like me 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.840
 and sees 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.689
 every track 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.189
 from Blackberry 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:24.189
 It's nice when it's behind us 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.190
 but actually 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.460
 is this raised way 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.460
 she reached 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.009
 this city look created seals 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.080
 play basketball 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.360
 but sharpen the gaze to look closely 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.949
 and then it changes 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.949
 this picture suddenly terrific 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:48.939
 if I then 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.939
 that's finally here 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:55.710
 there was in Sao Paulo 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.990
 and which then starts 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.740
 but also construction in court 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.789
 Money to come 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.309
 this person 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:04.849
 actually important 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:06.580
 are fantastic 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.580
 wants to expand 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.759
 it is a completely different world 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.580
 the rates like this 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.789
 nothing to 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.150
 it is an expression 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.420
 she sells 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.729
 get in there 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.080
 a completely different example 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.610
 so shortened 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.759
 they already have each other 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.529
 like the chair she sits on 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:37.529
 really built 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:40.839
 worked on it 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.120
 no school attendance 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.550
 UG came back to build wanted 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.680
 There can be hours 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.009
 over a school year Beck 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.270
 and do not have to leave it at 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.119
 and future-proof 

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:56.189
 Behind 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:58.240
 this retail 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.539
 hides 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.960
 the whole world 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.400
 that is my concern 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.860
 take it 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.259
 4 against himself 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.050
 next to St sure 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.619
 thereby 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:17.689
 All freak them out 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.119
 Edward VII 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:23.300
 in this food safety 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.189
 become yourself 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:26.999
 on the one hand 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:30.089
 insignificant 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.089
 on the other hand 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.650
 as a single person 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.029
 Tragedy whole basket 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:43.479
 anchored in 70 are nature 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.080
 the judge wants 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.789
 in itself 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.479
 simultaneously 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.479
 only a copy of the world 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.589
 my picture Klaus Bergmann 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.589
 Wiesbaden 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.569
 look at 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:11.569
 Inter 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:17.119
 to be effective 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:21.409
 11 70 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.740
 that's me 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.740
 so the world knows place to drive light 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.180
 what can Marl do for the player 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.180
 that requires of course 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:35.909
 but 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:38.909
 what is driving you? 

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:42.839
 feels like healing me 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:44.740
 that the cook 

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.740
 they admit to me 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:51.499
 also cash 

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:53.969
 cosmos 

00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:56.819
 Zeil Tora Bora expects that 

00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:59.229
 is possible here 

00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:00.380
 and in conversation 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.539
 Kandern 

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:04.779
 it was a fact is simple or other
