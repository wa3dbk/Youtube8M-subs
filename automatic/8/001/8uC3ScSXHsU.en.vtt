gonna<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:00.950> look<00:03:01.100> at<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.310> rules<00:03:01.550> of<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
gonna have to look at the rules of the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.910 
gonna have to look at the rules of the
five<00:03:02.750> day<00:03:02.900> thing<00:03:03.080> again<00:03:03.320> but<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.560> think<00:03:03.620> day

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
five day thing again but I think day

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.270 
five day thing again but I think day
four<00:03:04.190> is<00:03:05.050> soft<00:03:06.050> protein<00:03:06.820> so<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:07.880> can<00:03:09.280> google

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
four is soft protein so I can google

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.070 
four is soft protein so I can google
what<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.550> means<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.420> think<00:03:11.600> day<00:03:11.690> five<00:03:11.900> is

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
what that means and I think day five is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.600 
what that means and I think day five is
firm<00:03:12.260> protein<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:12.860> I'm<00:03:12.920> not<00:03:13.040> sure<00:03:13.100> I'll<00:03:13.400> post

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
firm protein so I'm not sure I'll post
