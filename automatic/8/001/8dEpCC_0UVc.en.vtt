I am a crafty ninja but the problem with
a<00:00:20.430> purse<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.180> is<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.410> very<00:00:22.470> holy

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
the sewing machine but I think the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.890 
the sewing machine but I think the
presser<00:01:31.740> feet<00:01:31.950> um<00:01:32.329> if<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.720> up

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
presser feet um if you have this up

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
presser feet um if you have this up
would<00:01:34.229> catch<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.220> loops<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> your

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
would catch on the loops of your

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
would catch on the loops of your
knitting<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.329> think<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:36.750> had<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
knitting and I think if you had it so

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.140 
knitting and I think if you had it so
you<00:01:37.650> had<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> against<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.610> feed<00:01:38.759> dogs<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
you had that against the feed dogs I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.780 
you had that against the feed dogs I
think<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.540> might<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.890> might<00:01:41.040> snag<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.759> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
think that might that might snag it so I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
think that might that might snag it so I
think<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.240> best<00:01:42.360> bet<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> by<00:01:42.990> hand

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
think the best bet is to do it by hand

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.560 
think the best bet is to do it by hand
if<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.829> any<00:01:43.950> weird<00:01:44.399> loops<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.479> was

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
if you have any weird loops that was

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.639 
if you have any weird loops that was
another<00:01:45.750> thing<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.049> did<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> few<00:01:46.560> mistakes

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
another thing I did make a few mistakes

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.649 
another thing I did make a few mistakes
on<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> was<00:01:47.970> just<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.360> was<00:01:48.479> kind<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
on this so I was just I was kind of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.270 
on this so I was just I was kind of
bummed<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.259> didn't<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.950> turn<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.189> into

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
bummed out I didn't want to turn it into

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
bummed out I didn't want to turn it into
a<00:01:50.340> full<00:01:50.549> scarf<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.090> I'd<00:01:51.240> made<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.420> dropped

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
a full scarf because I'd made I dropped

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.840 
a full scarf because I'd made I dropped
one<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.380> wrong<00:01:52.530> stitches<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.490> didn't

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
one of the wrong stitches and I didn't

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
one of the wrong stitches and I didn't
realize<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> till<00:01:54.299> too<00:01:54.509> many<00:01:54.960> rows<00:01:55.259> later<00:01:55.560> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
realize it till too many rows later so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.760 
realize it till too many rows later so
um<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.850> decided<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.420> was<00:01:57.540> just<00:01:57.719> gonna<00:01:57.810> clip<00:01:58.530> those

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.410 
um I decided I was just gonna clip those
loops<00:01:59.040> time<00:01:59.340> on<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> inside<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.240> make<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
loops time on the inside and make a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.080

I'm going to pull my thread just through

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.880 
I'm going to pull my thread just through
the<00:02:21.270> felt<00:02:21.510> side<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.320> I've<00:02:22.410> trapped<00:02:22.680> that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
the felt side so that I've trapped that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.450 
the felt side so that I've trapped that
knot<00:02:23.160> between<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.420> knit<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.920> felt<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
knot between the knit and the felt and

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.950 
knot between the knit and the felt and
the<00:02:26.940> nice<00:02:27.090> thing<00:02:27.120> about<00:02:27.300> felt<00:02:27.660> is<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:27.870> don't

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
the nice thing about felt is I don't

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.830 
the nice thing about felt is I don't
have<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.230> worry<00:02:28.380> about<00:02:28.470> raw<00:02:28.800> edges<00:02:29.040> because

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
have to worry about raw edges because

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.930 
have to worry about raw edges because
felt<00:02:30.840> doesn't<00:02:31.140> fray<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.610> what<00:02:32.700> I'm<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.910> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
felt doesn't fray so what I'm going to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.380 
felt doesn't fray so what I'm going to
do<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.330> simply<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> running<00:02:34.800> stitch<00:02:35.330> all<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
do is simply do a running stitch all the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.170 
do is simply do a running stitch all the
way<00:02:37.020> around<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:38.280> purse<00:02:38.490> kind<00:02:38.850> of<00:02:38.940> keep<00:02:39.030> your

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
way around the purse kind of keep your

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.490 
way around the purse kind of keep your
hand<00:02:39.360> on<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.540> inside<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.080> bag<00:02:43.260> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
hand on the inside of the of the bag so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.460 
hand on the inside of the of the bag so
you<00:02:43.530> don't<00:02:43.770> accidentally<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.940> know<00:02:45.470> stitch

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you don't accidentally you know stitch

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.710 
you don't accidentally you know stitch
to<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> other<00:02:46.890> side<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:48.270> can<00:02:48.300> make<00:02:48.600> your

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
to the other side you can make your

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.270 
to the other side you can make your
stitches<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> little<00:02:49.260> tighter<00:02:49.470> than<00:02:49.710> this<00:02:49.950> but

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
stitches a little tighter than this but

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.280 
stitches a little tighter than this but
this<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:50.940> going<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.300> kind<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.660> light<00:02:51.960> wear

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
this is going to be a kind of light wear

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.010 
this is going to be a kind of light wear

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.310 
embellish it my daughter one of my
daughter's<00:02:56.760> was<00:02:56.970> like<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.720> think<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:58.080> want<00:02:58.260> to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
knows like no I think it's better the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.040 
knows like no I think it's better the
way<00:03:01.710> it<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:02.850> know<00:03:03.210> you<00:03:03.270> could<00:03:03.630> maybe

stitch I decided to use kind of a navy
blue<00:03:29.310> thread<00:03:29.730> because<00:03:30.209> I<00:03:30.420> was<00:03:30.540> using<00:03:30.720> navy

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
blue thread because I was using navy

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.870 
blue thread because I was using navy
blue<00:03:31.260> felt<00:03:31.530> when<00:03:32.220> there's<00:03:32.370> several<00:03:32.760> different

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
blue felt when there's several different

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.310

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
shades of blue in this purse so I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.690 
shades of blue in this purse so I
figured<00:03:34.620> my<00:03:34.709> stitches<00:03:35.070> would<00:03:35.190> be<00:03:35.310> pretty<00:03:35.550> well

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
figured my stitches would be pretty well

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.900 
figured my stitches would be pretty well
hidden<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:36.810> having<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.740> lining<00:03:38.430> go<00:03:38.640> just

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.720 
hidden and I'm having the lining go just
underneath<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.480> crocheted<00:03:40.380> edge<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:41.550> did<00:03:41.700> a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
underneath that crocheted edge I did a

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.900 
underneath that crocheted edge I did a
crochet<00:03:42.209> edge<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:43.220> when<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.280> put<00:03:44.550> my<00:03:44.580> crochet

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
crochet edge so when I put my crochet

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.030 
crochet edge so when I put my crochet
handle<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.900> decided<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.590> keep<00:03:46.890> on

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.500 
handle and I decided to keep on
crocheting<00:03:47.459> with<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> tail<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.120> yarn

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
crocheting with the tail of that yarn

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.720 
crocheting with the tail of that yarn
all<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> way<00:03:48.900> around<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.560> would<00:03:49.830> I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
all the way around so that I would I

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
all the way around so that I would I
would<00:03:51.330> have<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.780> good<00:03:52.230> handle<00:03:52.770> would<00:03:52.890> be

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
would have a really good handle would be

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.770 
would have a really good handle would be
on<00:03:53.070> there<00:03:53.220> really<00:03:53.370> well<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.600> would<00:03:54.690> give

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
on there really well and it would give

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.360 
on there really well and it would give
