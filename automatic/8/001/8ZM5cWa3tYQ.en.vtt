00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.670 

I<00:00:04.009> remember<00:00:05.009> receiving<00:00:05.640> from<00:00:06.410> one<00:00:07.410> professor

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
I remember receiving from one professor

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.310 
I remember receiving from one professor
in<00:00:07.830> one<00:00:08.010> class<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.540> spreadsheet<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.110> needed

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
in one class a spreadsheet that I needed

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.950 
in one class a spreadsheet that I needed
to<00:00:10.469> fill<00:00:10.650> out<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.610> order<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> do<00:00:12.179> grammatical

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to fill out in order to do grammatical

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.550 
to fill out in order to do grammatical
analysis<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.880> I<00:00:14.880> remember<00:00:15.570> thinking<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.320> is

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
analysis and I remember thinking this is

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.620 
analysis and I remember thinking this is
you<00:00:17.160> know<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.520> thought<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.210> was<00:00:18.330> what<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
you know I thought that was what it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.060 
you know I thought that was what it
meant<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.020> good<00:00:19.320> scholar<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.830> do<00:00:19.920> your

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
meant to be a good scholar to do your

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.939 
meant to be a good scholar to do your
homework<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:21.140> I've<00:00:22.140> looked<00:00:22.320> at<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> tools<00:00:22.800> at

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
homework and I've looked at the tools at

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
homework and I've looked at the tools at
Lawson<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.609> we<00:00:23.730> have<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.269> these<00:00:24.359> tools

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170

that<00:00:25.439> actually<00:00:26.119> reproduce<00:00:27.119> or<00:00:27.529> within<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that actually reproduce or within a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.299 
that actually reproduce or within a
click<00:00:29.210> can<00:00:30.210> give<00:00:30.599> me<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.869> information<00:00:31.309> now

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
click can give me that information now

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.940 
click can give me that information now
the<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.149> difference<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:34.230> need<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.530> be

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the the difference is you need to be

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.970 
the the difference is you need to be
able<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.309> responsibly<00:00:36.559> interpret<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> apply

that information and that's where our

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.830

winding up parsing entire sections of
the<00:01:13.470> New<00:01:13.590> Testament<00:01:13.880> now<00:01:14.880> I'll<00:01:15.420> grant<00:01:15.869> you

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
the New Testament now I'll grant you

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.480 
the New Testament now I'll grant you
that<00:01:16.080> when<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.409> did<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.070> didn't<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.340> any

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that when I did this we didn't have any

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.429 
that when I did this we didn't have any
software<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.630> today<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.200> think

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
software like we have today but I think

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
software like we have today but I think
that's<00:01:19.590> actually<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.250> point<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.450> were<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
that's actually the point if I were to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.149 
that's actually the point if I were to
do<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:22.140> i<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.530> feel<00:01:22.680> terribly<00:01:23.100> guilty

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
do that now i would feel terribly guilty

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
do that now i would feel terribly guilty
about<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.909> because<00:01:24.180> frankly<00:01:24.720> i'm<00:01:24.869> making<00:01:25.200> them

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
about it because frankly i'm making them

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.249 
about it because frankly i'm making them
spend<00:01:25.650> hours<00:01:26.479> recreating<00:01:27.479> something<00:01:28.020> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
spend hours recreating something that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.340 
spend hours recreating something that
already<00:01:28.530> exists<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.579> i<00:01:30.479> even<00:01:30.630> had<00:01:30.930> my<00:01:31.140> best

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
already exists and i even had my best

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.399 
already exists and i even had my best
students<00:01:31.970> people<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.360> were<00:01:34.229> there

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
students people that really were there

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.660 
students people that really were there
for<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.650> right<00:01:34.770> reasons<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.280> love<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
for the right reasons they love the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.600 
for the right reasons they love the
class<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:35.970> wanted<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.079> well<00:01:37.369> but<00:01:38.369> even

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
class they wanted to do well but even

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.980 
class they wanted to do well but even

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
they would look at you at points and say

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.899 
they would look at you at points and say

way languages are traditionally taught

way languages are traditionally taught
is<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.569> you<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.870> group<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.260> 20<00:02:19.769> 25<00:02:20.160> people

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
is that you get a group of 20 25 people

is that you get a group of 20 25 people

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
they're going to be patient enough and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.539 
they're going to be patient enough and
love<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> enough<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.010> when<00:02:29.190> they<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
love it enough that when they get to

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.280 
love it enough that when they get to
second<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.000> third<00:02:30.269> year<00:02:30.599> then<00:02:30.780> they<00:02:30.959> get<00:02:31.170> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
second and third year then they get to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.830 
second and third year then they get to
the<00:02:31.410> interpretive<00:02:31.890> payoff<00:02:32.269> but<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.660> other

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
the interpretive payoff but the other

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.509 
the interpretive payoff but the other
ninety<00:02:34.290> eight<00:02:34.410> percent<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> students

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
ninety eight percent of the students

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.009 
ninety eight percent of the students
they're<00:02:36.090> never<00:02:36.330> going<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.599> get<00:02:36.750> there<00:02:36.900> because

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
they're never going to get there because

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.350 
they're never going to get there because
they<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.410> can't<00:02:37.620> wait<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:37.980> out<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.489> I

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
they just can't wait to get out and I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360 
they just can't wait to get out and I
think<00:02:39.720> that's<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.959> real<00:02:40.200> disservice<00:02:40.739> to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
think that's a real disservice to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.210 
think that's a real disservice to
students<00:02:42.209> we<00:02:43.019> love<00:02:43.290> memorizing<00:02:43.890> stuff<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.190> I

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
students we love memorizing stuff I I

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.670 
students we love memorizing stuff I I
love<00:02:44.849> making<00:02:45.000> vocab<00:02:45.510> cards<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.989> loved<00:02:46.440> having

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
love making vocab cards I loved having

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.680 
love making vocab cards I loved having
the<00:02:46.890> challenge<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.430> memorizing<00:02:48.180> another

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
the challenge of memorizing another

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.449 
the challenge of memorizing another
paradigm<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.650> sounds<00:02:49.980> geeky<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.370> it

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
paradigm and it sounds geeky and it

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.550 
paradigm and it sounds geeky and it
sounds<00:02:50.730> weird<00:02:50.849> but<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.780> what<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.349> love<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
sounds weird but that's what I love to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.490 
sounds weird but that's what I love to
do<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:53.340> could<00:02:54.150> ever<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.810> fond<00:02:55.110> memories<00:02:55.140> of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
do I could ever have fond memories of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.259 
do I could ever have fond memories of
sitting<00:02:55.709> at<00:02:55.890> starbucks<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.610> writing<00:02:57.180> out

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
sitting at starbucks and writing out

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.699 
sitting at starbucks and writing out
little<00:02:57.450> paradigms<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.079> making<00:02:58.379> spreadsheets

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
little paradigms and making spreadsheets

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.619 
little paradigms and making spreadsheets
and<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.340> love<00:02:59.849> doing<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.150> kind<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.390> thing<00:03:00.450> but

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
and I love doing that kind of thing but

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.449 
and I love doing that kind of thing but
when<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> got<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.049> class<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:02.099> heard<00:03:02.250> my<00:03:02.370> other

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
when I got to class and I heard my other

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.069 
when I got to class and I heard my other
classmates<00:03:02.730> talk<00:03:03.120> about<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.959> know<00:03:04.049> the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
classmates talk about you know the

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.289 
classmates talk about you know the
homework<00:03:04.530> they<00:03:05.160> sent<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.610> really<00:03:05.819> discouraged

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
homework they sent a really discouraged

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.280 
homework they sent a really discouraged
I<00:03:06.450> think<00:03:06.690> professors<00:03:07.290> should<00:03:07.950> realize<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
I think professors should realize that I

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.509 
I think professors should realize that I
I<00:03:10.290> really<00:03:10.799> hope<00:03:10.920> they<00:03:11.040> get<00:03:11.129> on<00:03:11.250> board<00:03:11.430> with

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
I really hope they get on board with

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.089 
I really hope they get on board with
this<00:03:11.640> because<00:03:11.910> we<00:03:12.120> really<00:03:12.510> believe<00:03:12.810> that<00:03:13.799> if

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
this because we really believe that if

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.840 
this because we really believe that if
we<00:03:14.220> put<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.459> payoff<00:03:14.850> up<00:03:15.060> front<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:16.670> not<00:03:17.670> only

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
we put the payoff up front that not only

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.059 
we put the payoff up front that not only
does<00:03:18.660> everybody<00:03:19.170> get<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.620> benefit<00:03:20.040> of

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
does everybody get the benefit of

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.830 
does everybody get the benefit of
learning<00:03:20.280> Greek<00:03:20.670> or<00:03:20.819> Hebrew<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.510> other<00:03:21.630> words

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
learning Greek or Hebrew in other words

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.330 
learning Greek or Hebrew in other words
they<00:03:21.959> really<00:03:22.260> get<00:03:22.470> what<00:03:22.650> they<00:03:22.769> think<00:03:23.160> they're

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
they really get what they think they're

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.309 
they really get what they think they're
supposed<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.170> it's

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
supposed to get out of it and it's

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.440 
supposed to get out of it and it's
sustainable<00:03:25.950> but<00:03:26.519> it'll<00:03:26.700> actually<00:03:26.880> excite

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
sustainable but it'll actually excite

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.770

a brew i really wish that we had some

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.839 
a brew i really wish that we had some
sort<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.750> semantic<00:04:07.290> resource<00:04:07.799> for<00:04:08.549> instance

sort of semantic resource for instance

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.449 
sort of semantic resource for instance
our<00:04:09.060> equivalent<00:04:09.630> of<00:04:09.900> lao<00:04:10.109> nida<00:04:10.410> would<00:04:11.370> have

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
our equivalent of lao nida would have

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.140 
our equivalent of lao nida would have
been<00:04:11.549> really<00:04:11.730> handy<00:04:13.190> if<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.370> really<00:04:14.730> master

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
been really handy if you really master

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.270 
been really handy if you really master
the<00:04:15.180> material<00:04:15.359> really<00:04:15.930> pay<00:04:16.530> close<00:04:16.709> attention

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the material really pay close attention

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.649 
the material really pay close attention
to<00:04:17.310> what<00:04:17.519> we're<00:04:17.639> trying<00:04:17.849> to<00:04:18.000> teach<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
to what we're trying to teach you in the

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.319 
to what we're trying to teach you in the
videos<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:20.070> will<00:04:20.190> develop<00:04:20.430> confidence<00:04:21.030> and

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
videos you will develop confidence and

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.990 
videos you will develop confidence and
your<00:04:21.450> people<00:04:21.719> will<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.890> able<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.280> follow<00:04:23.610> your

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
your people will be able to follow your

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.460 
your people will be able to follow your
own

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
own

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.110 
own
assets<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:24.950> discovery<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.760> think<00:04:25.970> they'll

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
assets of discovery and I think they'll

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.330 
assets of discovery and I think they'll
get<00:04:26.210> excited<00:04:26.600> about<00:04:26.690> Bible<00:04:27.320> too<00:04:27.470> but<00:04:27.680> as<00:04:27.800> they

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
get excited about Bible too but as they

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.570 
get excited about Bible too but as they
see<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:29.020> really<00:04:30.020> more<00:04:30.260> vested<00:04:30.650> in<00:04:31.370> the

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
see you really more vested in the

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.910 
see you really more vested in the
scriptures<00:04:32.030> I<00:04:32.380> think<00:04:33.380> it<00:04:33.470> can<00:04:33.620> only<00:04:33.680> have<00:04:33.890> a

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
scriptures I think it can only have a

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.490 
scriptures I think it can only have a
positive<00:04:34.190> impact<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:35.270> should<00:04:35.990> say<00:04:36.020> one<00:04:36.350> more

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
positive impact I should say one more

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.720 
positive impact I should say one more
thing<00:04:36.560> about<00:04:36.970> what<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.090> video<00:04:38.330> course<00:04:38.780> isn't

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
thing about what the video course isn't

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.780 
thing about what the video course isn't
in<00:04:40.730> terms<00:04:41.000> of<00:04:41.150> what<00:04:41.330> you'll<00:04:41.510> experience<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:43.040> lot

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
in terms of what you'll experience a lot

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.430 
in terms of what you'll experience a lot
of<00:04:43.850> people<00:04:43.970> have<00:04:44.630> had<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.900> foreign<00:04:45.290> language

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
of people have had a foreign language

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
television commercials about products

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.120 
television commercials about products
like<00:04:52.430> rosetta<00:04:52.850> stone<00:04:53.180> where<00:04:54.170> you<00:04:54.200> see<00:04:54.500> a

picture you hear something and you mimic

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.190 
picture you hear something and you mimic
it<00:04:57.580> basically<00:04:58.580> those<00:04:58.820> strategies<00:04:59.180> are<00:04:59.690> once

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
again aimed at memory work they're aimed

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.550 
again aimed at memory work they're aimed
drilling<00:05:04.310> that<00:05:04.700> is<00:05:04.850> not<00:05:05.150> what<00:05:05.990> we're<00:05:06.140> doing<00:05:06.440> in

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
front of you it's about giving you

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.020 
front of you it's about giving you
information<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:13.040> then<00:05:13.190> guiding<00:05:13.640> you<00:05:13.760> through

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
how to think about that information I

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.930 
how to think about that information I
know<00:05:17.480> it<00:05:17.780> might<00:05:17.960> be<00:05:17.990> hard<00:05:18.169> for<00:05:18.890> some<00:05:19.100> listeners

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
know it might be hard for some listeners

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.150 
know it might be hard for some listeners
to<00:05:20.150> believe<00:05:20.540> but<00:05:21.020> we<00:05:21.260> really<00:05:21.620> have<00:05:21.740> eliminated

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
to believe but we really have eliminated
