00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
looks like from the top of it it's

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.000 
looks like from the top of it it's
pretty<00:01:05.100> smart<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.380> can<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> shape

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
pretty smart and you can see the shape

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.740 
pretty smart and you can see the shape
there<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.360> go<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.720> like

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
there you know and just go in like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.789 
there you know and just go in like
darling<00:01:10.820> nice<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> comfy<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:13.619> only

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
darling nice and comfy the only

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.870 
darling nice and comfy the only
drawbacks<00:01:15.740> possibly<00:01:16.740> they're<00:01:17.340> obviously

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
drawbacks possibly they're obviously

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
drawbacks possibly they're obviously
they're<00:01:18.060> not<00:01:18.150> carbon<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.259> would<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> bit

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
they're not carbon that would be a bit

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.149 
they're not carbon that would be a bit
lighter

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
lighter

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:31.130 
lighter
yeah<00:01:20.490> these<00:01:20.729> bits<00:01:21.080> comes<00:01:22.080> could<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:30.140> that's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
yeah these bits comes could be that's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.240 
yeah these bits comes could be that's
about<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.799> really

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
about it really

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.350 
about it really
and<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.360> advised<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> perhaps<00:01:35.360> having

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and I was advised that perhaps having

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.719 
and I was advised that perhaps having
the<00:01:36.450> pads<00:01:36.659> lower<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> bar<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.950> would<00:01:38.549> get

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
the pads lower to the bar and would get

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.810 
the pads lower to the bar and would get
a<00:01:38.790> better<00:01:39.030> position<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.490> what<00:01:41.670> they

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
a better position and but for what they

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.960 
a better position and but for what they
are<00:01:42.079> they<00:01:43.079> go<00:01:43.229> that's<00:01:43.439> how<00:01:43.530> low<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:43.970> and

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
are they go that's how low they are and

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.950 
are they go that's how low they are and
pretty<00:01:45.810> smart<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:47.009> can't<00:01:47.189> adjust<00:01:47.720> these<00:01:48.720> as

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
pretty smart you can't adjust these as

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
pretty smart you can't adjust these as
well<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> think<00:01:49.560> through<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> screw<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
well I think through a screw in the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.319 
well I think through a screw in the
middle<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:53.030> overall<00:01:54.560> for<00:01:55.560> cost<00:01:56.149> what<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
middle there overall for cost what the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.969 
middle there overall for cost what the
are<00:01:57.479> well<00:01:57.750> how<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.930> perform<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.710> another

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
are well how to perform to get another

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.280 
are well how to perform to get another
couple<00:01:59.610> mile<00:01:59.909> an<00:02:00.060> hour<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.780> same<00:02:00.990> kind<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
couple mile an hour of the same kind of

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.700 
couple mile an hour of the same kind of
effort<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.399> I'd<00:02:02.850> give<00:02:03.060> them<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.360> solid<00:02:03.710> seven

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
effort and I'd give them a solid seven

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.430 
effort and I'd give them a solid seven
and<00:02:04.829> half<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.189> that
