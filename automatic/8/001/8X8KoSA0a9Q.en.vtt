from Las Vegas it was robbed roulette
and<00:00:07.550> overall<00:00:08.550> thought<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.090> show<00:00:09.300> pretty

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
and overall thought to the show pretty

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.049 
and overall thought to the show pretty
pretty<00:00:10.559> weak<00:00:10.800> show<00:00:11.010> not<00:00:11.219> gonna<00:00:11.370> lie<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.820> thought

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
pretty weak show not gonna lie I thought

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.870 
pretty weak show not gonna lie I thought
it<00:00:12.240> was<00:00:12.360> um<00:00:12.769> for<00:00:13.769> being<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.099> las<00:00:14.280> vegas<00:00:14.700> show

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it was um for being a las vegas show

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.750 
it was um for being a las vegas show
considering<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.190> higher<00:00:17.190> end<00:00:17.550> i

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
considering it's one of the higher end i

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.990 
considering it's one of the higher end i
guess<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.270> say<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.960> more<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
guess you can say it's more of the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
guess you can say it's more of the
special<00:00:21.000> traditions<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.600> Raw<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.320> really

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.180 
Cesaro misses referee and I enjoyed that
match<00:00:38.579> but<00:00:38.850> after<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.570> had<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:40.190> Ryback

in<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.640> prime<00:00:41.879> time<00:00:42.059> players<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.450> pretty

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
in the prime time players and pretty

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.170 
in the prime time players and pretty
much<00:00:42.750> as<00:00:43.050> 211<00:00:43.800> squash<00:00:44.100> match<00:00:44.340> match<00:00:44.760> they<00:00:45.030> just

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
much as 211 squash match match they just

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
much as 211 squash match match they just
a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.510> jokes<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.050> beginning<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:47.250> had

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
a little jokes at the beginning you had

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.360 
a little jokes at the beginning you had
bear<00:00:47.640> vs.<00:00:48.030> bo<00:00:48.180> Dallas<00:00:48.739> which<00:00:49.739> wasn't<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.070> squash

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
bear vs. bo Dallas which wasn't a squash

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.970 
bear vs. bo Dallas which wasn't a squash
but<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.760> was<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> 20<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.890> know

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
but it was a like a 20 you know

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
but it was a like a 20 you know
two-minute<00:00:53.430> match<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.930> guess<00:00:55.140> they're

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
two-minute match and I guess they're

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.810 
two-minute match and I guess they're
doing<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> whole<00:00:55.680> shelton<00:00:55.980> benjamin<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
doing the whole shelton benjamin and a

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.549 
doing the whole shelton benjamin and a
triple<00:00:57.149> age<00:00:57.210> thing<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.039> then<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.520> had

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
triple age thing with that then we had

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.290 
triple age thing with that then we had
John<00:01:01.559> Cena<00:01:01.829> versus<00:01:02.100> Cody<00:01:02.280> Rhodes<00:01:02.489> which<00:01:03.120> is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
John Cena versus Cody Rhodes which is

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.939 
John Cena versus Cody Rhodes which is
another<00:01:03.480> match<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.379> wasn't<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> squash

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
another match that it wasn't a squash

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
another match that it wasn't a squash
but<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> did<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:06.000> maybe<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.630> two<00:01:07.020> minutes

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
but it did go like maybe in two minutes

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.399 
but it did go like maybe in two minutes
three<00:01:07.439> minutes<00:01:07.619> tops<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.880> then<00:01:09.750> Cena<00:01:10.170> says

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
three minutes tops and then Cena says

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.289 
three minutes tops and then Cena says
he's<00:01:10.590> gonna<00:01:10.680> challenge<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> WWE<00:01:11.850> Champion

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
he's gonna challenge the WWE Champion

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.929 
he's gonna challenge the WWE Champion
this<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.080> pretty<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.350> before<00:01:13.979> he<00:01:14.490> said<00:01:14.729> it's

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
this is pretty much before he said it's

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.160 
this is pretty much before he said it's
either<00:01:15.150> gonna<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.360> rock<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.900> gonna<00:01:15.960> be

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
either gonna be rock or it's gonna be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
either gonna be rock or it's gonna be
Punk<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> guess<00:01:17.280> he<00:01:17.820> was<00:01:18.090> under<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
Punk so I guess he was under the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.999 
Punk so I guess he was under the
impression<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> rematch<00:01:19.560> was<00:01:19.710> already

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
impression that the rematch was already

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.850 
impression that the rematch was already
made<00:01:20.270> for<00:01:21.270> elimination<00:01:21.869> chamber<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.590> he's

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
made for elimination chamber but he's

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.440 
made for elimination chamber but he's
pretty<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:23.340> challenging<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:23.970> WWE

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
pretty much challenging for the WWE

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
pretty much challenging for the WWE
title<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.130> at<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.250> point<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.820> hoping<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
title and at this point I was hoping the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.080 
title and at this point I was hoping the
shield<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.540> come<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:28.590> did<00:01:28.740> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
shield would come out and they did and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
shield would come out and they did and
advice<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.450> out<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.750> music<00:01:30.930> hit<00:01:31.229> they

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
advice and go out there music hit they

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.380 
advice and go out there music hit they
walked<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:31.860> CNN<00:01:32.460> tried<00:01:32.670> battling<00:01:33.119> them<00:01:33.240> all

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
walked down CNN tried battling them all

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.319 
walked down CNN tried battling them all
but<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.350> didn't<00:01:34.710> happen<00:01:34.979> Sheamus<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.670> Ryback

but I didn't happen Sheamus and Ryback

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
but I didn't happen Sheamus and Ryback
got<00:01:36.900> involved<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> shield<00:01:38.009> pretty<00:01:38.189> much<00:01:38.310> took

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
got involved and shield pretty much took

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.280 
got involved and shield pretty much took
out<00:01:38.610> everyone<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.750> was<00:01:39.840> good<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.140> that
