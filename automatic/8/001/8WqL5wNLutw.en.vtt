 To prepare a cake, you need the following ingredients, flour 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:53.560
 cake, sugar, 4 eggs, baking powder, 3 flavor puddings 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:06.610
 creamy juice, winnie type, dainty cakes, preferably with a toffee flavor, sugar 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.890
 powder, 30% cream, lemon-flavored jelly and chocolate 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.220
 sprinkling. We start with preparing a biscuit. We separate yolks from proteins, 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.470
 We pour the proteins into a bowl in which we will whip the foam with a mixer 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:48.640
 from protein and sugar, pour 4 teaspoons of sugar. We can spread it now 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:02:03.270
 form butter, oil it properly. In addition, we put silver, easier 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:13.400
 later you will be able to pull out the sponge cake. We start whipping with protein and sugar, 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.790
 if it is whipped, it will not fall out of the bowl. We add yolks and mix again. 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.380
 We sift the flour and baking powder using a screen and pour 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:53.060
 to mix the previously mixed mass, mix gently. After mixing 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:07.060
 we can pour into the form. Spread with a spoon so that it evenly fills 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.160
 form a whole lot. Put in the oven for 30 minutes at approx. 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:22.500
 180 degrees Celsius. Now we will deal with mass. We pour a whole bottle of type juice 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:32.730
 Winnie, we simmer, pour 3 more packages of pudding 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:41.450
 creamy, mix, heat until it thickens. Simultaneously of course 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:59.350
 stir. After baking the biscuit, we take it out, we can wipe it off 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:09.910
 fat form and to the finished sponge cake we will pour the poultry mass. 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.590
 We pour the mass if it has already thickened. Same as in the case of previously made 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.110
 sponge mass, the same is now spread evenly over the mold. 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.910
 Now we add dainty cookies, we distribute them evenly 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:46.160
 on the entire surface of the mass. In addition, we make lemon jelly, for this purpose 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.370
 for hot water, pour the contents of the packaging and according to the instructions 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:05:06.560
 we make jelly. We pour 30% of our cream, mix it when it's over 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.230
 foam from the cream is compacted, thick, we can sprinkle through the strainer for taste 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:28.090
 icing sugar. In addition, mix and pour the lemon jelly again. 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:41.340
 Again mix, preferably with a mixer. We pour our foam into a pity mass 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.960
 and for relish. Spread evenly so that it takes up the whole 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:06:02.590
 the surface of the form. At the end, sprinkle both for taste and 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.550
 decoration, shredded chocolate. It can be bitter chocolate, it can be sweet, it's already 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.260
 depending on individual preferences. We wish you a tasty one, leave it
