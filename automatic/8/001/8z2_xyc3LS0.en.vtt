00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
side pretty much all you need to do is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.750 
side pretty much all you need to do is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
mannequins and there probably is a time

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639

limit<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.579> do<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> probably<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.109> know<00:00:58.170> me<00:00:58.410> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
limit to do this probably you know me I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.990 
limit to do this probably you know me I
thought<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.280> were<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> try<00:00:59.969> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
thought we were gonna have to try it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.729 
thought we were gonna have to try it
multiple<00:01:00.390> times<00:01:00.449> swags<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.199> got<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.590> our

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
multiple times swags and I got it on our

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.100 
multiple times swags and I got it on our
very<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.309> try<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:03.180> thought<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:03.960> were<00:01:04.019> gonna

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
very first try I thought we were gonna

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.630 
very first try I thought we were gonna
have<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> perfect<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.040> know<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
have to perfect it you know like you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.250 
have to perfect it you know like you
know<00:01:05.760> do<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> bunch<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> runs<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.869> try<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.080> get

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
know do a bunch of runs and try to get

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.080 
know do a bunch of runs and try to get
it<00:01:07.350> under<00:01:07.530> 30<00:01:07.920> seconds<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.490> something<00:01:08.790> i'm<00:01:08.939> not

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it under 30 seconds or something i'm not

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.330 
it under 30 seconds or something i'm not
sure<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:10.140> turns<00:01:10.409> out<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.890> did<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
sure but it turns out we did it on a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
sure but it turns out we did it on a
very<00:01:11.610> first<00:01:11.850> try<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.390> took<00:01:12.570> us<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.080> maybe

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
very first try and it took us in maybe

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
very first try and it took us in maybe
like<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> minute<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.430> maybe<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.880> under<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
like a minute so maybe it's under a

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.210 
like a minute so maybe it's under a
minute<00:01:15.390> or<00:01:15.659> maybe<00:01:15.990> under<00:01:16.259> 45<00:01:16.650> seconds<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.159> we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
minute or maybe under 45 seconds and we

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
minute or maybe under 45 seconds and we
just<00:01:17.490> got<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.850> either<00:01:18.390> way<00:01:18.570> we<00:01:19.229> failed

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
just got it either way we failed

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.190 
just got it either way we failed
miserably<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.939> trying<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.540> fast<00:01:21.840> but

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
miserably at like trying to go fast but

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
miserably at like trying to go fast but
we<00:01:22.380> still<00:01:22.619> ended<00:01:22.890> up<00:01:22.979> getting<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> first

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
we still ended up getting it on a first

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.060 
we still ended up getting it on a first
try<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.479> definitely<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.229> hard<00:01:25.680> easter

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
try so it's definitely not a hard easter

try so it's definitely not a hard easter
egg<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> i'm<00:01:26.430> sure<00:01:26.640> if<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:26.970> three

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you just have to do it probably in some

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
you just have to do it probably in some
kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.710> time<00:01:46.890> limit<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.310> again<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.970> very

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
kind of time limit but again it's a very

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.760 
kind of time limit but again it's a very
easy<00:01:48.240> time<00:01:48.630> limit<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.560> back<00:01:49.649> over

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
easy time limit which up and back over

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.069 
easy time limit which up and back over
the<00:01:49.920> swags<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.549> he<00:01:51.090> missed<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> guys<00:01:51.720> in

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
first floor of the building because he

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.469 
first floor of the building because he
got<00:01:55.140> everybody<00:01:55.530> from<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> second

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
arcade game we can't see it because I'm

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.059 
arcade game we can't see it because I'm
in<00:02:12.629> theater<00:02:12.900> mode<00:02:13.050> but<00:02:13.530> when<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.709> jump

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
in theater mode but when I jump

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.729 
in theater mode but when I jump
over<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.340> mine<00:02:14.689> when<00:02:15.689> I<00:02:15.719> was<00:02:15.810> recording<00:02:16.379> live

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
you'll be able to actually see it if

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.300 
you'll be able to actually see it if
you're<00:02:25.260> playing<00:02:25.469> it<00:02:25.650> yourself<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.159> if<00:02:26.219> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
you're playing it yourself and if you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
you're playing it yourself and if you
want<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:26.489> record<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.030> you've<00:02:27.180> gotta<00:02:27.389> be

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
recording it live which is what I did

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.490 
recording it live which is what I did

there's a couple other arcade games at 6
45<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:34.920> don't<00:02:35.489> think<00:02:35.730> any<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:35.939> these<00:02:36.120> games<00:02:36.299> are

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
45 I don't think any of these games are

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.720 
45 I don't think any of these games are
the<00:02:36.719> actual<00:02:37.200> real<00:02:37.560> version<00:02:38.010> they<00:02:38.159> seem<00:02:38.519> like

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the actual real version they seem like

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.429 
the actual real version they seem like
they<00:02:38.879> are<00:02:39.000> slightly<00:02:39.450> different<00:02:39.930> maybe<00:02:40.260> they

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
they are slightly different maybe they

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.869 
they are slightly different maybe they
couldn't<00:02:40.620> get<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.919> rights<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.310> get<00:02:41.519> the<00:02:41.639> real

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
couldn't get the rights to get the real

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.089 
couldn't get the rights to get the real
deal<00:02:42.150> game<00:02:42.469> swags<00:02:43.469> and<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.680> were<00:02:43.799> both<00:02:43.919> talking

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
deal game swags and I were both talking

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.500 
deal game swags and I were both talking
about<00:02:44.310> how<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.639> didn't<00:02:44.939> seem<00:02:45.090> like<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.359> real

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
about how this didn't seem like the real

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.000 
about how this didn't seem like the real
thing<00:02:45.540> because<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.169> felt<00:02:46.409> different<00:02:46.590> from

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
thing because it felt different from
