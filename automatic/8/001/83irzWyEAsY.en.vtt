00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 and 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.570
 company loggiec decided completely 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.250
 will update the line of game controllers 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.080
 series by and large this 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.150
 cosmetic update + replacement 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.250
 some items to more modern 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.320
 we will start re-acquaintance with the series 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.980
 with the highest wired mouse in the line 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.490
 log house 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.289
 g500s apple smartphones adding 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.090
 index with model name means 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.260
 replacement of components with more advanced 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.090
 without changing design 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.070
 similar situation with products 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.809
 logitech mouse g500s 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.299
 has the same shape as its predecessor 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.309
 same 500 released at the end of 2009 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:42.979
 and she, in turn, almost repeats 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.129
 the shape of the legendary same 5 of 2005 too 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.170
 designed based on la jack x518 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.330
 derived from log houses m x 510 2002 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.940
 year heir to them from 500 for 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.739
 the uninitiated 500 g500s is different 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.049
 just coloring and comparison here is not 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.729
 use of new pseudo stainless steel old 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.199
 models like a lot more than 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.180
 stylized silver stripes 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.430
 I outline the button and mysterious erasing buttons 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.260
 hatching updated same 500 with that 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.420
 do this style framed all new 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.180
 ruler is interesting that a similar situation 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.560
 Was with time from same 500 rusty metal 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 first generation of this mouse 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.950
 although it was washed over time 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.410
 more stylish with so cracked 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.720
 blue black paint same 5 2 generation 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.820
 although it is a matter of taste to guess by touch 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.770
 eyes closed which mouse is in front of 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.740
 you can only old fans of the brand 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.750
 at the full coincidence of the forms already 500500 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.550
 with the novelty more rough sidewalls 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.680
 touching the thumb and 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.880
 the little finger according to the developers is 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.040
 special moisture resistant coating 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.320
 which allows you to keep the clutch 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.780
 even if the hand is sweating during the hot 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.490
 battles tactile sensation caused 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.680
 this coating unusual but in general 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.970
 nice and besides the paint which 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.560
 covered main keys 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.870
 with more resistant to abrasion and not 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.659
 allows the palm to stick to the rest 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.520
 we all have the same 500 ergonomic 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.990
 the shape of the palm of your hand two buttons 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.479
 interchangeable sensitivity ahead left 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.310
 It is more convenient than the buttons on the center of those 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.840
 more that near the wheel is already 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.060
 its mode key 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.590
 inertial or stepwise with this 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.140
 the wheel itself continues to work to 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.860
 middle button in both positions 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.019
 some players don't like 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.879
 lodzhitek inertia sinking mode 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.350
 games he really useless photo 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.180
 when browsing long web pages 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.280
 allows one motion to stick hundreds 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.260
 lines of text 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.850
 Computer g500s are completed 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.620
 weights weights in the wall 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.750
 box they are used for 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.209
 adjusting weight and balances however 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.890
 500 s and so not a feather card with 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.209
 debtors pills easily and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.209
 loaded from the bottom of the controller 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.470
 the legs are 500 with the same as the 500 have low 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.270
 friction coefficient and probably also 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.370
 hardy for a couple of years should be enough 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.320
 even with heavy use 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.570
 side button is already 500 with as already 500 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.190
 built in if you consider central 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.960
 part is superfluous, you can always turn it off 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.240
 drivers, but in general, such a location 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.500
 very convenient indicator of sensitivity 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.420
 and with the side buttons still 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.280
 5-position but now it is equipped 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.020
 blue they are red diodes main 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.820
 Buttons 500 with are sensitive and 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.950
 responsive with a clear click and small 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.480
 lateral move well position it 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.010
 moderate stiffness which allows 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.230
 avoid accidental operation when 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.150
 sufficient ease of clicking the wheel 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.800
 bit sluggish pressed for spring loaded 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.320
 navigation mechanism like it 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.680
 not all of the updated Sanza 500 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.190
 with avocado ns 9800 has increased to 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.200
 8200 15 sensitivity against 5710 already 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.120
 500 honestly we had no 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.650
 claims to the previous sensor but you 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.900
 feels on any surfaces yet 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.850
 more confident if you move on 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.830
 500 from another manipulator 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.360
 consider moving the sensor forward this may 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.700
 affect the angular displacement 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.350
 g500s like all devices of the same series 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.660
 works with brand logic gaming 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.730
 software is good already to version 85 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.290
 subscribe to then some competitor 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.820
 there is no cloudy storage of settings and 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.440
 fast firmware upgrade features 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.420
 mice however with their tasks 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.130
 setting mouse creation parameters 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.739
 macros by writing values ​​to memory 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.700
 device she copes fine 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.130
 get on with g500s 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.959
 with dignity and the heiress 500 having 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.760
 proven form and improved 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.830
 characteristics we can safely 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.049
 recommend this controller to players 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.799
 all genres as well as people far away 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.290
 from games 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.120
 g500s really universal mouse 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.900
 which is suitable for both games and 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.900
 daily work
