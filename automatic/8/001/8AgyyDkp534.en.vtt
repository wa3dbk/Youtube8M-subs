those<00:01:22.200> coming<00:01:22.530> through<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.040> subject<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
those coming through but your subject is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
in focus and crisp in the case of my

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.789 
in focus and crisp in the case of my
backdrop<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> steamer<00:01:28.770> on

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
backdrop I actually use a steamer on

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.010 
backdrop I actually use a steamer on
mine<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.450> tiring<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
mine but that can be really tiring and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.300 
mine but that can be really tiring and
sometimes<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.890> enough<00:01:32.100> time<00:01:32.250> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
sometimes you don't have enough time to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
sometimes you don't have enough time to
actually<00:01:32.759> really<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.360> wrinkles<00:01:33.810> out

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
actually really get all the wrinkles out

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.780 
actually really get all the wrinkles out
so<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.860> adjust<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> depth<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.579> field

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
so if you can adjust the depth of field

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.899 
so if you can adjust the depth of field
on<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:35.970> camera<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.810> something<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.350> 1.8<00:01:37.979> 2.0

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.330 
on your camera to something like 1.8 2.0
or<00:01:39.119> 2.8<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.020> usually<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.530> actually<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.189> rid

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.950 
or 2.8 you usually can actually get rid
of<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.549> lot<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:41.939> depending<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.509> how<00:01:42.720> far

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
of a lot of that depending on how far

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.010 
of a lot of that depending on how far
away<00:01:43.020> your<00:01:43.320> camera<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.540> thing<00:01:45.810> is

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
away your camera is the other thing is

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.670 
away your camera is the other thing is
lighting<00:01:46.610> for<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.790> setup<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.450> actually<00:01:48.780> am<00:01:49.409> only

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
lighting for my setup I actually am only

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.149 
lighting for my setup I actually am only
using<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.729> lights<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.860> traditionally<00:01:52.860> you'd

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
using two lights but traditionally you'd

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
using two lights but traditionally you'd
probably<00:01:53.520> want<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.880> use<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.360> three<00:01:55.200> light<00:01:55.350> setup

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
probably want to use a three light setup

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.100 
probably want to use a three light setup
or<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> five<00:01:56.369> light<00:01:56.579> setup<00:01:56.939> part<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
or a five light setup part of that is

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.929 
or a five light setup part of that is
you<00:01:58.290> would<00:01:58.409> want<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.740> light<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.189> background

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you would want to light the background

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.899 
you would want to light the background
behind<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.509> you'd<00:02:01.020> want<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.700> above<00:02:02.700> head

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
behind you you'd want your above head

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.880 
behind you you'd want your above head
light<00:02:03.119> you'd<00:02:03.659> want<00:02:03.960> your<00:02:04.170> fill<00:02:04.500> light<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
light you'd want your fill light and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.039 
light you'd want your fill light and
you'd<00:02:05.189> want<00:02:05.369> your<00:02:05.520> key<00:02:05.759> light<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.570> those<00:02:06.899> are

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you'd want your key light so those are

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.240 
you'd want your key light so those are
the<00:02:07.110> five<00:02:07.320> lights<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.799> would<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.129> in

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the five lights that you would use in

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
the five lights that you would use in
the<00:02:08.280> setup<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:09.119> actually<00:02:09.660> been<00:02:09.810> getting<00:02:09.929> away

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the setup I'm actually been getting away

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.020 
the setup I'm actually been getting away
with<00:02:10.259> using<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.830> two<00:02:11.009> light<00:02:11.190> setup<00:02:11.459> for<00:02:11.670> most<00:02:11.879> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
with using a two light setup for most of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.630 
with using a two light setup for most of
my

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
my

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.000 
my
I<00:02:12.670> do<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.720> additional<00:02:14.110> lights<00:02:14.349> but

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
I do have the additional lights but

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.860 
I do have the additional lights but
again<00:02:15.220> setting<00:02:15.910> them<00:02:16.060> up<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.390> be<00:02:16.510> really

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
again setting them up can be really

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.720 
again setting them up can be really
cumbersome<00:02:17.349> breaking<00:02:17.739> them<00:02:17.890> down<00:02:18.099> later<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
cumbersome breaking them down later and

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.260 
cumbersome breaking them down later and
also<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.930> cost<00:02:20.349> of<00:02:20.530> electricity<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.700> since

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
also the cost of electricity so since

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.270 
also the cost of electricity so since
I'm<00:02:22.450> not<00:02:22.569> made<00:02:22.870> of<00:02:22.900> money<00:02:23.200> quite<00:02:23.500> yet<00:02:23.770> I<00:02:23.950> just

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
I'm not made of money quite yet I just

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.770 
I'm not made of money quite yet I just
go<00:02:24.400> ahead<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.760> settle<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.150> two<00:02:25.330> lights<00:02:25.540> and

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
go ahead and I settle for two lights and

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.930 
go ahead and I settle for two lights and
it<00:02:26.050> works<00:02:26.319> out<00:02:26.470> perfectly<00:02:26.650> well<00:02:27.069> for<00:02:27.280> me<00:02:27.400> but

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
it works out perfectly well for me but

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.640 
it works out perfectly well for me but
again<00:02:28.060> use<00:02:28.660> your<00:02:28.840> setup<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> way<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.530> you

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
again use your setup the way that you

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.050 
again use your setup the way that you
think<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.980> needs<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.190> be<00:02:30.280> done<00:02:30.519> and<00:02:30.760> if<00:02:30.970> you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
think it needs to be done and if you

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.580 
think it needs to be done and if you
feel<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.360> need<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.510> use<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.900> extra<00:02:32.380> lights

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
feel the need to use the extra lights

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.830 
feel the need to use the extra lights
definitely<00:02:33.519> do<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:33.880> see<00:02:34.239> what<00:02:34.540> kind<00:02:34.750> of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
definitely do that and see what kind of

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.820 
definitely do that and see what kind of
quality<00:02:35.410> it<00:02:35.709> produces<00:02:36.550> in<00:02:36.670> your<00:02:36.819> videos<00:02:37.830> now

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
quality it produces in your videos now

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.440 
quality it produces in your videos now
as<00:02:38.890> for<00:02:39.069> this<00:02:39.190> backdrop<00:02:39.519> system<00:02:39.970> behind<00:02:40.300> me

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
as for this backdrop system behind me

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.650 
as for this backdrop system behind me
mine<00:02:41.349> was<00:02:41.380> a<00:02:41.620> little<00:02:41.800> pricier<00:02:42.580> I've<00:02:42.880> got<00:02:43.120> about

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
mine was a little pricier I've got about

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.449 
mine was a little pricier I've got about
a<00:02:43.840> hundred<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.380> twenty<00:02:44.650> dollars<00:02:44.739> invested

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
a hundred and twenty dollars invested

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.280 
a hundred and twenty dollars invested
into<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.880> as<00:02:46.180> far<00:02:46.239> as<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.540> actual<00:02:46.690> backdrop

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
into it as far as the actual backdrop

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.470 
into it as far as the actual backdrop
system<00:02:47.739> itself<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.030> terms<00:02:49.269> of<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
system itself but in terms of the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.090 
system itself but in terms of the
backgrounds<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.110> paid<00:02:50.350> twenty<00:02:50.739> dollars<00:02:50.769> a

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
backgrounds I paid twenty dollars a

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.009 
backgrounds I paid twenty dollars a
piece<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.549> mine<00:02:51.730> but<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:52.569> came<00:02:52.720> out<00:02:52.840> really

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
piece for mine but they came out really

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:55.710 
piece for mine but they came out really
well<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.950> actually<00:02:54.040> have<00:02:54.459> carrying<00:02:55.299> cases

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
well and I actually have carrying cases

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.360 
well and I actually have carrying cases
for<00:02:55.900> all<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.230> that<00:02:56.319> equipment<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
for all of that equipment and the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.920 
for all of that equipment and the
carrying<00:02:57.640> case<00:02:57.790> is<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.330> the<00:02:58.480> backdrops

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
carrying case is for the backdrops

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.320 
carrying case is for the backdrops
themselves<00:02:59.470> actually<00:02:59.650> have<00:03:00.099> a<00:03:00.340> clear<00:03:00.940> panel

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
themselves actually have a clear panel

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.670 
themselves actually have a clear panel
on<00:03:01.390> them<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.690> can<00:03:01.870> see<00:03:02.049> which<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.530> which

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
on them so I can see which one is which

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.170 
on them so I can see which one is which
I<00:03:02.799> don't<00:03:02.980> have<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.250> guess<00:03:03.489> I<00:03:03.730> don't<00:03:04.000> have<00:03:04.090> to

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I don't have to guess I don't have to

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.089 
I don't have to guess I don't have to
look<00:03:04.299> at<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.510> labels<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.170> know<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.560> know<00:03:05.739> which

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
look at the labels you know I know which

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.190 
look at the labels you know I know which
one<00:03:06.310> my<00:03:06.459> back<00:03:06.670> which<00:03:07.299> one<00:03:07.450> of<00:03:07.480> my<00:03:07.540> backdrops<00:03:08.019> is

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
one my back which one of my backdrops is

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.380 
one my back which one of my backdrops is
in<00:03:08.349> its<00:03:08.920> case<00:03:09.160> at<00:03:09.340> any<00:03:09.459> time<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.239> just

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
in its case at any time so I can just

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.240 
in its case at any time so I can just
pull<00:03:10.540> out<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.660> white<00:03:10.930> one<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.650> green<00:03:11.860> screen

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
pull out the white one the green screen

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.890 
pull out the white one the green screen
or<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.700> black<00:03:12.880> one<00:03:13.030> that<00:03:13.180> you<00:03:13.269> see<00:03:13.480> me<00:03:13.630> use<00:03:13.750> in

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
or the black one that you see me use in

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.340

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
background with the pattern that you've

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.740 
background with the pattern that you've
seen<00:03:19.269> so<00:03:19.480> my<00:03:19.600> earlier<00:03:19.959> videos<00:03:21.359> now<00:03:22.359> if<00:03:22.630> you're

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
seen so my earlier videos now if you're

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.180 
seen so my earlier videos now if you're
going<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:22.959> use<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.079> green<00:03:23.350> screen<00:03:23.709> I'd

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
going to use a green screen I'd

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.190 
going to use a green screen I'd
recommend<00:03:24.790> that<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.359> play<00:03:25.660> around<00:03:25.870> with<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
recommend that you play around with it

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.720 
recommend that you play around with it
quite<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> lot<00:03:26.829> and<00:03:27.040> that<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.400> get<00:03:27.579> your

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
quite a lot and that you get your

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.210 
quite a lot and that you get your
lighting<00:03:28.060> perfect<00:03:28.359> because<00:03:29.049> actually<00:03:29.890> keying

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
lighting perfect because actually keying

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.460 
lighting perfect because actually keying
for<00:03:30.489> green<00:03:30.670> screen<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.209> very<00:03:31.630> difficult<00:03:32.230> and

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
for green screen is very difficult and

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.319 
for green screen is very difficult and
it's<00:03:32.829> not<00:03:32.980> something<00:03:33.370> that<00:03:33.489> just<00:03:33.549> anyone<00:03:34.180> can

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
it's not something that just anyone can

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.240 
it's not something that just anyone can
do<00:03:34.540> their<00:03:34.690> first<00:03:34.900> time<00:03:35.290> very<00:03:35.590> well<00:03:35.709> and

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
do their first time very well and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.860 
do their first time very well and
effectively<00:03:36.970> there's<00:03:37.239> all<00:03:37.450> kinds<00:03:37.810> of

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
effectively there's all kinds of

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.240 
effectively there's all kinds of
problems<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.470> you'll<00:03:38.859> need<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.100> get<00:03:39.190> the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
problems and you'll need to get the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.370 
problems and you'll need to get the
lighting<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.850> shadows<00:03:40.329> just<00:03:40.690> perfect<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.260> do

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
lighting and shadows just perfect to do

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.920 
lighting and shadows just perfect to do
it<00:03:41.530> so<00:03:42.010> that's<00:03:42.100> why<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.340> recommend<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:43.359> early

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
it so that's why I recommend that early

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.289 
it so that's why I recommend that early
shooters<00:03:44.459> stick<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.639> solid<00:03:45.970> color

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
shooters stick to solid color

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.690 
shooters stick to solid color
backgrounds<00:03:46.870> or<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.380> pattern<00:03:47.799> backgrounds

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
backgrounds or to pattern backgrounds

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.970 
backgrounds or to pattern backgrounds
because<00:03:49.090> it'll<00:03:49.660> help<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.930> compensate<00:03:50.590> for

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
because it'll help you compensate for

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.379 
because it'll help you compensate for
other<00:03:51.160> things<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.639> you<00:03:51.730> just<00:03:51.910> may<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.209> be

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
other things that you just may not be

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:54.569 
other things that you just may not be
able<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.690> do<00:03:52.870> yet<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.200> as<00:03:53.889> cool<00:03:54.100> as<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.280> may<00:03:54.519> be

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
able to do yet and as cool as it may be

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.789 
able to do yet and as cool as it may be
to<00:03:54.940> want<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.900> think<00:03:56.049> about<00:03:56.139> keying<00:03:56.530> and

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
to want to think about keying and

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.470 
to want to think about keying and
rotoscoping<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.519> adding<00:03:57.819> background

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
rotoscoping and adding background

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.599 
rotoscoping and adding background
effects<00:03:58.750> or<00:03:58.900> moving<00:03:59.200> backgrounds<00:03:59.799> it's<00:04:00.220> very

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
effects or moving backgrounds it's very

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.360 
effects or moving backgrounds it's very
advanced<00:04:01.180> and<00:04:01.359> it's<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:02.230> while<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.980> actually

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
advanced and it's a while to actually

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.069 
advanced and it's a while to actually
learn<00:04:03.639> all<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.209> skills<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.569> go<00:04:04.810> into<00:04:04.989> that

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
learn all the skills that go into that

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.770 
learn all the skills that go into that
and<00:04:05.350> become<00:04:05.950> very<00:04:06.190> good<00:04:06.400> at<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:06.700> so<00:04:06.880> keep<00:04:07.630> that

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
and become very good at it so keep that

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.050 
and become very good at it so keep that
in<00:04:07.989> mind<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.470> try<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.340> stick<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.670> basics

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
in mind and try and stick to the basics

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.440 
in mind and try and stick to the basics
first

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
first

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.479 
first
once<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:11.019> master<00:04:11.200> lighting<00:04:11.920> on<00:04:12.130> regular

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
once you master lighting on regular

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.309 
once you master lighting on regular
backdrops<00:04:13.000> like<00:04:13.180> this<00:04:13.389> one<00:04:13.630> you<00:04:14.049> can<00:04:14.079> actually

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
backdrops like this one you can actually

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.560 
backdrops like this one you can actually
move<00:04:14.620> on<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.100> fairly<00:04:15.579> easily<00:04:15.850> well<00:04:16.510> if

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
move on to that fairly easily well if

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.390 
move on to that fairly easily well if
you<00:04:16.660> try<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.870> jump<00:04:17.109> into<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.530> right<00:04:17.650> away<00:04:17.709> it's

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
you try to jump into it right away it's

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.099 
you try to jump into it right away it's
just<00:04:18.549> gonna<00:04:18.850> be<00:04:19.000> frustrating<00:04:19.479> a<00:04:19.510> problematic

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
just gonna be frustrating a problematic

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.589 
just gonna be frustrating a problematic
for<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.409> there<00:04:21.190> are<00:04:21.220> cheaper<00:04:21.789> options<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.570> a

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
for you there are cheaper options to a

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:25.140 
for you there are cheaper options to a
backdrop<00:04:23.260> system<00:04:23.710> than<00:04:23.890> this<00:04:24.039> one<00:04:24.280> you<00:04:24.430> can

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
backdrop system than this one you can

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.980 
backdrop system than this one you can
get<00:04:25.270> decent<00:04:25.510> ones

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
get decent ones

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.200 
get decent ones
as<00:04:26.139> low<00:04:26.259> as<00:04:26.410> 60<00:04:26.740> bucks<00:04:26.949> and<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.699> don't<00:04:27.880> have<00:04:28.030> to

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
as low as 60 bucks and you don't have to

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.080 
as low as 60 bucks and you don't have to
actually<00:04:28.360> use<00:04:28.870> fabric<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.919> just<00:04:30.250> prefer<00:04:30.610> fabric

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
actually use fabric I just prefer fabric

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.960 
actually use fabric I just prefer fabric
you<00:04:31.389> can<00:04:31.479> actually<00:04:31.900> use<00:04:32.580> sheets<00:04:33.580> from<00:04:33.910> a

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
you can actually use sheets from a

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.760 
you can actually use sheets from a
savage<00:04:34.479> they<00:04:34.870> actually<00:04:35.169> have<00:04:35.289> paper<00:04:35.500> rolls

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
savage they actually have paper rolls

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.800 
savage they actually have paper rolls
that<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.009> can<00:04:36.220> use<00:04:36.520> so<00:04:37.030> that's<00:04:37.690> actually

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
that you can use so that's actually

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.240 
that you can use so that's actually
pretty<00:04:38.110> cool<00:04:38.229> they<00:04:38.560> come<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.860> variety<00:04:38.979> of

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
pretty cool they come in a variety of

colors and they're surprisingly

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.620 
colors and they're surprisingly
affordable<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.220> actually<00:04:42.520> started<00:04:43.150> out<00:04:43.270> that

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
affordable I actually started out that

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.900 
affordable I actually started out that
way<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:44.080> couple<00:04:44.110> of<00:04:44.560> years<00:04:44.800> back<00:04:45.009> but<00:04:45.639> since

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
way a couple of years back but since

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.430 
way a couple of years back but since
then<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:46.180> decided<00:04:46.449> to<00:04:46.690> move<00:04:46.840> to<00:04:46.990> fabric

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
then I just decided to move to fabric

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.589 
then I just decided to move to fabric
all<00:04:48.370> right<00:04:48.490> well<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:48.910> hope<00:04:49.090> you<00:04:49.210> enjoyed<00:04:49.449> this

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.999 
video I hope you learned a little about
backdrop<00:04:52.000> systems<00:04:52.630> there's<00:04:53.530> gonna<00:04:53.650> be<00:04:53.830> some

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009
