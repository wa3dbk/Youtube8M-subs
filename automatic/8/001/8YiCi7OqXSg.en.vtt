00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
starter button well that was the only

the beginning of that whole episode for

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.549 
the beginning of that whole episode for
me<00:00:39.440> I<00:00:40.629> about<00:00:41.629> to<00:00:41.809> run<00:00:41.960> out<00:00:42.079> in<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.230> camera

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.340 
me I about to run out in the camera
again<00:00:42.829> so<00:00:43.250> it's<00:00:43.970> a<00:00:44.059> new<00:00:44.210> camera<00:00:44.480> keep<00:00:45.079> running

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
again so it's a new camera keep running

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.960 
again so it's a new camera keep running
out<00:00:45.440> or<00:00:45.650> try<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:45.949> stay<00:00:46.100> on<00:00:46.129> top<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.370> it<00:00:46.550> but

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
basically I didn't give up at that point

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.729 
basically I didn't give up at that point
I<00:00:50.979> thought<00:00:51.979> there<00:00:52.820> must<00:00:52.940> be<00:00:53.120> a<00:00:53.149> problem<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:54.050> the

I thought there must be a problem in the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.130 
I thought there must be a problem in the
starting<00:00:55.280> ignition<00:00:55.909> circuit<00:00:56.180> if<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:56.900> have

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
starting ignition circuit if I have

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.750 
starting ignition circuit if I have

ready to go there's fuel in it a bump

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.299 
ready to go there's fuel in it a bump
start<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:02.269> so<00:01:03.229> I<00:01:03.290> pushed<00:01:03.530> it<00:01:03.680> round<00:01:03.860> onto<00:01:04.189> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.590 
the fire so I decided I would press some
switches<00:02:31.340> and<00:02:31.459> dials<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:32.030> one<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> things

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
switches and dials and one of the things

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.840 
switches and dials and one of the things
I<00:02:32.750> did<00:02:32.930> in<00:02:33.080> between<00:02:33.230> trying<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:34.010> was<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.550> flick

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
I did in between trying it was a flick

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.250 
I did in between trying it was a flick
to<00:02:34.970> kill<00:02:35.180> switch<00:02:35.420> off<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:35.900> back<00:02:36.020> on<00:02:36.200> again

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
to kill switch off and back on again

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.150 
to kill switch off and back on again
from<00:02:37.220> then<00:02:37.370> on

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
from then on

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.680 
from then on
wouldn't<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.000> thought<00:02:42.390> well<00:02:42.510> there's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
wouldn't go so I thought well there's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.030 
wouldn't go so I thought well there's
definitely<00:02:42.780> an<00:02:43.080> issue<00:02:43.170> someone<00:02:43.650> maybe<00:02:43.830> with

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
definitely an issue someone maybe with

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.560 
definitely an issue someone maybe with
the<00:02:44.130> switching<00:02:44.550> maybe<00:02:44.760> with<00:02:45.000> something<00:02:45.390> I

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
the switching maybe with something I

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.930 
the switching maybe with something I
found<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.620> ignition<00:02:47.220> fuse<00:02:47.430> holder<00:02:47.820> was

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
found that the ignition fuse holder was

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.270 
found that the ignition fuse holder was
also<00:02:48.270> brittle<00:02:48.660> much<00:02:49.050> like<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.530> indicator<00:02:50.070> one

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
also brittle much like the indicator one

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.650 
also brittle much like the indicator one
and<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:51.000> snapped

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and that snapped

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.540 
and that snapped
so<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:51.840> bridged<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.190> didn't<00:02:53.370> make<00:02:53.490> any

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
so I bridged that but it didn't make any

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.600 
so I bridged that but it didn't make any
difference<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:55.560> did<00:02:55.830> turn<00:02:56.040> over<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:56.490> the

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
difference it did turn over so the

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.980 
difference it did turn over so the
starter<00:02:56.940> appeared<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.360> be<00:02:57.480> fine

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
starter appeared to be fine

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.320 
starter appeared to be fine
the<00:02:58.260> switches<00:02:58.740> appeared<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.520> fine<00:03:00.000> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
the switches appeared to be fine the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.470 
the switches appeared to be fine the
electrics<00:03:00.750> appear<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.110> work<00:03:01.670> but<00:03:02.670> starter

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
electrics appear to work but starter

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.830 
electrics appear to work but starter
solenoid<00:03:03.690> I<00:03:04.200> thought<00:03:04.940> give<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> clean<00:03:06.360> give

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
solenoid I thought give it a clean give

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.430 
solenoid I thought give it a clean give
it<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.990> kick

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
it a kick

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.200 
it a kick
didn't<00:03:07.800> work<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.310> gave<00:03:09.090> up<00:03:09.270> very<00:03:09.600> frustrated<00:03:10.230> I

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
didn't work I gave up very frustrated I

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.060 
didn't work I gave up very frustrated I
came<00:03:12.210> back<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.690> yesterday<00:03:12.980> tested<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
came back to it yesterday tested the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.580 
came back to it yesterday tested the
solenoid<00:03:14.490> and<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.970> does<00:03:15.150> not<00:03:15.300> work<00:03:15.480> as<00:03:16.410> soon<00:03:16.530> as

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
solenoid and it does not work as soon as

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.740 
solenoid and it does not work as soon as
I<00:03:16.740> short<00:03:17.010> at<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> points<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:18.240> start<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.630> what

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
I short at the points the start and what

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.200 
I short at the points the start and what
we're<00:03:18.840> trying<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.260> turn<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.890> I've<00:03:20.790> ordered<00:03:21.000> a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
we're trying to turn so I've ordered a

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.750 
we're trying to turn so I've ordered a
new<00:03:21.360> solenoid<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.200> is<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.560> way<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.730> a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
new solenoid and it is on the way so a

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.430 
new solenoid and it is on the way so a
new<00:03:23.940> fuse<00:03:24.210> holder<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.630> fit<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.200> ignition

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
new fuse holder to fit in the ignition

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.830 
new fuse holder to fit in the ignition
circuit<00:03:25.910> new<00:03:26.910> solenoid<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.420> fit<00:03:27.540> when<00:03:27.690> that

circuit new solenoid to fit when that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140 
circuit new solenoid to fit when that
comes<00:03:28.080> in<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.260> couple<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:28.590> days<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:29.130> then<00:03:30.000> we'll

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
comes in a couple of days and then we'll

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.210 
comes in a couple of days and then we'll
try<00:03:30.330> again<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> starting<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:31.890> for<00:03:32.100> now

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
try again on the starting but for now

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.970 
try again on the starting but for now
but<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.210> bloody<00:03:33.450> brakes<00:03:33.810> still<00:03:34.440> haven't<00:03:34.800> done

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but the bloody brakes still haven't done

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.820 
but the bloody brakes still haven't done
them<00:03:35.780> just<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.870> quick<00:03:37.050> point<00:03:37.260> forget<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
them just a quick point forget to the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.710 
them just a quick point forget to the
brakes<00:03:38.040> actually<00:03:38.460> something<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.300> did<00:03:39.480> find

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
brakes actually something I did find

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.680 
brakes actually something I did find
when<00:03:40.320> I<00:03:40.350> was<00:03:40.500> removing<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.920> solenoid<00:03:41.340> is<00:03:41.690> one

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
when I was removing the solenoid is one

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.250 
when I was removing the solenoid is one
of<00:03:42.810> these<00:03:43.610> bullet<00:03:44.610> points<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:45.120> have<00:03:45.450> them<00:03:45.630> exact

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
of these bullet points I have them exact

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.200 
of these bullet points I have them exact
same<00:03:46.470> thing<00:03:46.710> on<00:03:46.890> my<00:03:47.070> ST<00:03:47.430> as<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.700> happens<00:03:48.030> and

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
same thing on my ST as it happens and

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.290 
same thing on my ST as it happens and
they're<00:03:48.300> very<00:03:48.600> very<00:03:48.810> handy<00:03:49.850> this<00:03:50.850> was<00:03:51.060> just

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
they're very very handy this was just

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.050 
they're very very handy this was just
connected<00:03:52.110> through<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.790> movement<00:03:53.790> where<00:03:53.910> the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
connected through the movement where the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.820 
connected through the movement where the
terminal<00:03:54.270> connections<00:03:55.140> onto<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.470> battery

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
terminal connections onto the battery

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.330 
terminal connections onto the battery
with<00:03:56.790> positive<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.630> negative<00:03:57.690> rings<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.620> it

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
with positive and negative rings so it

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.150 
with positive and negative rings so it
actually<00:03:59.820> noticed<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.930> was<00:04:01.860> what<00:04:02.040> was

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
actually noticed that that was what was

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.070 
actually noticed that that was what was
on<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.370> end<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:03.030> was<00:04:03.240> hanging<00:04:03.510> down<00:04:03.540> into

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
on the end this was hanging down into

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.040 
on the end this was hanging down into
the<00:04:04.290> frame<00:04:04.740> and<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.100> bike

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
the frame and to the bike

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.810 
the frame and to the bike
guess<00:04:07.050> which<00:04:07.410> one<00:04:07.440> they<00:04:07.920> made<00:04:08.130> the<00:04:08.280> positive

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
guess which one they made the positive

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.210 
guess which one they made the positive
whoever<00:04:09.150> fitted<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.750> that's<00:04:10.230> right<00:04:10.560> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
whoever fitted it that's right the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.910 
whoever fitted it that's right the
sodding<00:04:11.700> exposed<00:04:12.240> one<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:13.320> must<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:13.860> been

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
sodding exposed one that must have been

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.980 
sodding exposed one that must have been
shorting<00:04:14.370> on<00:04:14.490> the<00:04:14.610> frame<00:04:14.820> the<00:04:14.970> whole<00:04:15.000> time<00:04:15.390> one

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
shorting on the frame the whole time one

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.620 
shorting on the frame the whole time one
killing<00:04:16.380> the<00:04:16.470> battery<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:17.070> two<00:04:17.850> possibly

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
killing the battery and two possibly

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.680 
killing the battery and two possibly
causing<00:04:18.840> half<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.320> problems<00:04:19.650> I've<00:04:19.770> had<00:04:19.799> so

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
causing half the problems I've had so

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.360 
causing half the problems I've had so
should<00:04:21.690> have<00:04:21.780> checked<00:04:21.930> first<00:04:22.260> I<00:04:22.470> didn't<00:04:22.770> but<00:04:23.340> I

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
should have checked first I didn't but I

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.420 
should have checked first I didn't but I
found<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:23.760> sod<00:04:24.680> always<00:04:25.680> make<00:04:25.920> that<00:04:26.160> one<00:04:26.400> the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
found that sod always make that one the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.550 
found that sod always make that one the
positive<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.180> all<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.600> lot<00:04:28.140> of<00:04:28.230> the<00:04:28.350> time<00:04:28.530> that

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
positive and all a lot of the time that

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.770 
positive and all a lot of the time that
is<00:04:28.860> naturally<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.550> positive<00:04:29.940> but<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:30.600> you're

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
is naturally the positive but if you're

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.870 
is naturally the positive but if you're
fitting<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.170> end<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.650> bike<00:04:31.830> at<00:04:32.520> least<00:04:32.730> is

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
fitting this end to the bike at least is

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.280 
fitting this end to the bike at least is
the<00:04:33.000> insulated<00:04:33.420> end<00:04:33.600> if<00:04:33.810> you're<00:04:34.020> gonna<00:04:34.110> have

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
the insulated end if you're gonna have

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.850 
the insulated end if you're gonna have
it<00:04:34.410> unplugged<00:04:35.250> at<00:04:35.520> any<00:04:35.670> point<00:04:36.680> all<00:04:37.680> right

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
it unplugged at any point all right

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.749 
it unplugged at any point all right
breakage<00:04:38.370> I<00:04:39.920> am

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
breakage I am

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.969 
breakage I am
I<00:04:41.789> messed<00:04:42.449> up<00:04:42.629> a<00:04:42.659> couple<00:04:42.779> of<00:04:43.110> ways<00:04:43.229> taking<00:04:43.860> off

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
I messed up a couple of ways taking off

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.390 
I messed up a couple of ways taking off
these<00:04:44.159> air<00:04:44.789> calipers<00:04:45.680> first<00:04:46.680> thing<00:04:46.889> I<00:04:46.979> didn't

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
these air calipers first thing I didn't

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.510 
these air calipers first thing I didn't
do<00:04:47.550> was<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:48.210> didn't<00:04:48.539> push<00:04:48.809> the<00:04:49.139> Pistons<00:04:50.099> out<00:04:50.249> far

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
do was I didn't push the Pistons out far

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.809 
do was I didn't push the Pistons out far
enough

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819 
enough

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:52.369 
enough
obviously<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.539> pads<00:04:51.719> out<00:04:51.930> on<00:04:52.020> this<00:04:52.080> one<00:04:52.259> I

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
obviously the pads out on this one I

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.320 
obviously the pads out on this one I
pushed<00:04:52.620> out<00:04:52.830> quite<00:04:53.069> far<00:04:53.309> I've<00:04:53.939> done<00:04:54.150> that

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
pushed out quite far I've done that

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.029 
pushed out quite far I've done that
because<00:04:54.539> they're<00:04:54.749> really<00:04:55.139> really<00:04:55.349> really<00:04:55.860> are

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 
because they're really really really are

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.829 
because they're really really really are
stuck<00:04:57.650> when<00:04:58.650> it's<00:04:58.770> not<00:04:58.889> quite<00:04:59.129> so<00:04:59.279> far<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.999> took

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:00.839 
stuck when it's not quite so far I took

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.540 
stuck when it's not quite so far I took
them<00:05:00.990> off<00:05:01.139> the<00:05:01.650> first<00:05:01.860> time<00:05:02.039> I<00:05:02.069> took<00:05:02.189> them<00:05:02.430> off

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
them off the first time I took them off

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.059 
them off the first time I took them off
I<00:05:02.669> didn't<00:05:02.909> crack<00:05:03.479> these<00:05:03.749> real<00:05:04.289> nuts<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.830> didn't

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:05.069 
I didn't crack these real nuts I didn't

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:07.219 
I didn't crack these real nuts I didn't
realize<00:05:05.279> they<00:05:05.400> were<00:05:05.460> on<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.639> back<00:05:06.229> they

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
realize they were on the back they

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.459 
realize they were on the back they
didn't<00:05:07.379> check<00:05:07.529> properly<00:05:07.830> again<00:05:09.169> so<00:05:10.169> I<00:05:10.199> had<00:05:10.319> to

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:10.469 
didn't check properly again so I had to

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:14.149 
didn't check properly again so I had to
refit<00:05:10.860> them<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:12.240> these<00:05:12.599> bolt<00:05:12.900> holes<00:05:13.009> so<00:05:14.009> that

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
refit them on these bolt holes so that

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.010 
refit them on these bolt holes so that
I'd<00:05:14.249> have<00:05:14.399> something<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.879> press<00:05:15.479> against<00:05:15.779> to

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
I'd have something to press against to

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.730 
I'd have something to press against to
crack<00:05:16.259> these<00:05:16.469> bolts<00:05:16.740> free<00:05:17.360> did<00:05:18.360> that<00:05:18.740> then

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
crack these bolts free did that then

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.110 
crack these bolts free did that then
have<00:05:19.889> to<00:05:20.009> refit<00:05:20.309> them<00:05:20.399> the<00:05:20.550> next<00:05:20.699> time<00:05:20.969> around

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
have to refit them the next time around

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.389 
have to refit them the next time around
so<00:05:21.629> that<00:05:21.659> I<00:05:21.839> could<00:05:22.110> use<00:05:22.319> the<00:05:22.649> hydraulics<00:05:23.159> to

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:23.399 
so that I could use the hydraulics to

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.399 
so that I could use the hydraulics to
push<00:05:23.999> these<00:05:24.210> out<00:05:24.449> so<00:05:24.689> rather<00:05:24.899> than<00:05:25.020> fit<00:05:25.259> them

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
push these out so rather than fit them

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.159 
push these out so rather than fit them
on<00:05:25.499> the<00:05:25.589> front<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:26.009> just<00:05:26.669> fitted<00:05:27.569> each<00:05:27.659> caliper

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
on the front I just fitted each caliper

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.290 
on the front I just fitted each caliper
and<00:05:28.289> turn<00:05:28.469> on<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.800> rear<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.490> then<00:05:29.909> just<00:05:30.089> bled

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
and turn on the rear and then just bled

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.469 
and turn on the rear and then just bled
it<00:05:30.479> is<00:05:31.439> very<00:05:32.039> simple<00:05:32.430> with<00:05:32.520> all<00:05:32.669> being<00:05:32.909> quite

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
it is very simple with all being quite

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.670 
it is very simple with all being quite
close<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.349> hand

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
close to hand

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.899 
close to hand
and<00:05:34.849> from<00:05:35.849> there<00:05:36.499> pushed<00:05:37.499> out<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:37.740> Pistons

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
and from there pushed out the Pistons

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:42.889 
and from there pushed out the Pistons
so<00:05:39.599> I've<00:05:40.110> taken<00:05:40.319> out<00:05:41.240> let's<00:05:42.240> cut<00:05:42.479> it<00:05:42.599> up<00:05:42.659> on<00:05:42.809> the

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:42.899 
so I've taken out let's cut it up on the

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:44.959 
so I've taken out let's cut it up on the
bottom<00:05:43.139> there<00:05:43.319> and<00:05:43.559> this<00:05:43.979> one's<00:05:44.189> just<00:05:44.279> filthy

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
bottom there and this one's just filthy

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:56.779 
bottom there and this one's just filthy
inside<00:05:54.620> get<00:05:55.620> them<00:05:55.740> all<00:05:55.830> cleaned<00:05:56.009> put<00:05:56.639> back

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
inside get them all cleaned put back

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.659 
inside get them all cleaned put back
together<00:05:57.439> drill<00:05:58.439> out<00:05:58.589> that<00:05:58.800> screw<00:05:59.279> from<00:05:59.520> the

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
together drill out that screw from the

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.570 
together drill out that screw from the
reservoir<00:05:59.969> that's<00:06:00.209> rounded<00:06:01.459> refold<00:06:02.459> with

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
reservoir that's rounded refold with

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.230 
reservoir that's rounded refold with
some<00:06:02.729> fluid<00:06:03.499> get<00:06:04.499> all<00:06:04.649> blade<00:06:04.999> break<00:06:05.999> should<00:06:06.149> be

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
some fluid get all blade break should be

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.600 
some fluid get all blade break should be
good<00:06:06.620> all<00:06:07.620> right<00:06:07.680> it's<00:06:07.860> quite<00:06:08.039> frustrating

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
good all right it's quite frustrating

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:16.879
