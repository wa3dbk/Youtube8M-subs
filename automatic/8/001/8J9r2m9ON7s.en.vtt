00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.630
 transform experience 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.650
 'Transformers' started with a line of toys 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.740
 made by the Japanese takara composed of robberies that followed Japan 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.779
 they left the car 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.349
 aircraft 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.819
 but it was with a cartoon beyond the comic and the metal guerrillas 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.619
 gained popularity 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.840
 becoming another element of pop culture of the 80's 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.220
 in the movie wave 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.190
 'transformers' wins a new wine 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.150
 of medium quality 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.710
 the saddest however the impression of a missed opportunity 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.830
 after the same formula game that many of them famous 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.429
 but it was all to lose 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.429
 with a low flow control 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.710
 transform the experience to expose the vehicle 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.820
 exploration 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.510
 everything is very fast and noisy as in the movie and this explosive action is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360
 main quality 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.530
 but the hanged way and the attachment to ruin experience 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.870
 the premise is the same as the cinema more than the script minimum is different 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.200
 he counts on the battle between the transformations of good and evil 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.610
 represented by the autobots and see them from seven points 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.000
 in general the team complemented the feature but the narrative changes when 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.990
 about situations that are going on in the movies 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.140
 so as not to spoil the surprise 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.320
 the player can opt for the episodes of the other autobots 10 7 points 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.640
 the beginning comes to remember that anderson author 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.670
 but it's just a facade 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.189
 because although there is freedom the player has access to the small part of the sea with 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.160
 a few days 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.890
 in this exploration the intention is to find secret bidens 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.600
 reaching green circles we have activated the main missions whose 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.540
 goals vary little 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.220
 almost everything is limited to pursuing enemies 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.189
 revolted 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.630
 destroy certain structures or get somewhere in time 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.560
 the alternative missions are even less inspired 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.979
 each robot has two guns in strokes little by little 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.999
 which generate up to a sequence of three attacks 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.749
 weapons are relatively powerful 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.759
 but almost do not serve to inflict damage to enemies 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:24.819
 the way is to count on the hands repeatedly using the same blow 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:29.040
 other opponents require you to throw objects 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.399
 and there is no shortage 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:34.089
 some situations are ridiculous with one of the buildings that 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:35.580
 practically collapsed 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.429
 1 minimum bent 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:40.800
 the Celtic completes with the arrival of human forces 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.339
 with a shooting all over the place 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:47.739
 with the touch of a button the characters turned into the most varied purposes 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.169
 left over speed and destruction 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.879
 the traffic eliminated with titles or departures 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.919
 in humanoid form the controls do not convince the stumbling style until it can 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.680
 be intent on trying to get the impression of controlling machines 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.929
 gigantic 

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:07.799
 but the bad experience 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.989
 mainly in relation to the cane 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.039
 that usually hide the bad angles 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:17.199
 the mission of autobots is less fun than bet on the forms of evil 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.010
 in a game based on destruction 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.260
 the player is penalized if he causes damage to humans as well 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.099
 the goals are even more effective 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.049
 for the great beach party 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.769
 the decepticons get rid of these moorings 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.869
 because it creates destruction as a goal 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:41.019
 even with two campaigns the game is short and for about six hours there I did 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.029
 to collect 

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:43.450
 had stories 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.529
 but this does not increase the life span very much 

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:51.069
 the edition for export 360 is the one that has the best look 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.260
 followed closely by playstation 3 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.309
 which has less light effects 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:57.899
 the following item 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.059
 and asks mainly in the details of the scenarios 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.939
 and finally 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.569
 playstation 2 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.419
 the quality of the front pass as always 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.090
 of computer power 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.349
 and especially the video card 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.629
 but 'transformers' is not a very light game 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.639
 in the control game playstation 3 the successor to command the airplanes 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.609
 gestures can be made to activate the blows 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:28.659
 the sound department stand out but double jeans the main actors of the 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:29.259
 movie 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.860
 reprise their roles 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.159
 and the original voices of great megatron mp 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.280
 it's written in english 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.569
 sr 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:43.099
 to herrera 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.110
 down 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.770
 Teixeira 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.400
 the impression one has of transforming this idea 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.409
 is that the game could be much better 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.699
 mechanical history are races 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.129
 but there is noise and thoughtless action 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:02.120
 however the controls locked the woman an experience maybe these defects 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:06.509
 do not disturb the fans but who is looking for a good action game 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.610
 you should expect something more consistent
