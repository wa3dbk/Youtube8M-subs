00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
is um i guess it's a book about two best

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.869 
is um i guess it's a book about two best
friends<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.809> guy<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.350> girl<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:44.640> being

friends one guy one girl and them being

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.060 
friends one guy one girl and them being
friends<00:00:45.450> causes<00:00:46.079> other<00:00:46.230> conflicts<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:46.950> their

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
friends causes other conflicts in their

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.650 
friends causes other conflicts in their
lives<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.579> they<00:00:47.700> can't<00:00:47.940> really<00:00:48.090> date<00:00:48.300> people

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
lives like they can't really date people

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.610 
lives like they can't really date people
because<00:00:48.870> people<00:00:49.110> always<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.440> they're

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
because people always think they're

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.319 
because people always think they're
together<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.520> stuff<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.180> guess

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
together and stuff like that and I guess

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
together and stuff like that and I guess
this<00:00:51.480> progresses<00:00:52.050> over<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> couple<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
this progresses over like a couple of

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
this progresses over like a couple of
years<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.250> something<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.030> think

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
years or something like that I think

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
years or something like that I think
there's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> name<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.809> books<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.410> I
