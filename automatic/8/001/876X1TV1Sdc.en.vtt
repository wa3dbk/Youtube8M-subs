00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
part broke is the glass front and I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.389 
part broke is the glass front and I
learned<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.440> there's<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.890> million<00:00:47.160> little

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
learned that there's a million little

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.250 
learned that there's a million little
capacitors<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> run

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
capacitors in there and you as you run

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.319 
capacitors in there and you as you run
your<00:00:49.440> finger<00:00:49.770> across<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.399> senses<00:00:51.180> your

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
your finger across it it senses your

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.490 
your finger across it it senses your
finger<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> how<00:00:52.350> your

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
finger and that's kind of how your

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.069 
finger and that's kind of how your
touchscreen<00:00:52.829> works<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> don't<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
touchscreen works so I don't have a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
touchscreen works so I don't have a
touch<00:00:55.440> screen<00:00:55.469> anymore<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.430> that's<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.850> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
touch screen anymore and that's kind of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.020 
touch screen anymore and that's kind of
the<00:00:57.000> whole<00:00:57.120> point<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> ipod<00:00:58.199> touch<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> I

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the whole point of the ipod touch so I

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.619 
the whole point of the ipod touch so I
mean<00:01:00.329> everything<00:01:00.570> else<00:01:00.840> works<00:01:01.640> but<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:03.449> is

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
mean everything else works but this is

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.740 
mean everything else works but this is
it<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> touchscreen<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.240> can't<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.299> use

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
it the touchscreen so can't really use

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.000 
it the touchscreen so can't really use
it<00:01:06.960> um<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.570> how<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.810> goes<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.830> am

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it um so that's how that goes but I am

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.920 
it um so that's how that goes but I am
playing<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.460> binds<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.330> parts<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.810> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
playing out binds the parts for this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.679 
playing out binds the parts for this
I've<00:01:13.590> been<00:01:13.979> looking<00:01:14.040> around<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.030> easily

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
I've been looking around I can easily

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.780 
I've been looking around I can easily
get<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.170> front<00:01:16.500> glass<00:01:16.770> part<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.400> could<00:01:17.700> get

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
here but you see this little rubber

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.789 
here but you see this little rubber
gasket<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.990> that's<00:01:24.990> super<00:01:25.350> hard<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
gasket right here that's super hard to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
gasket right here that's super hard to
find<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.250> some<00:01:26.430> reason<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.420> found<00:01:27.689> one

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
find for some reason and I found one

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.219 
find for some reason and I found one
place<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.290> sells<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.119> they<00:01:30.119> cost<00:01:30.720> forty

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
place that sells it and they cost forty

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
place that sells it and they cost forty
five<00:01:31.409> dollars<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.220> four<00:01:32.909> times<00:01:33.180> more

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
five dollars that is four times more

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.740 
five dollars that is four times more
expensive<00:01:34.250> than<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> actual<00:01:35.549> touch<00:01:36.420> screen

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
expensive than the actual touch screen

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.080 
expensive than the actual touch screen
so<00:01:37.619> I'm<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> see<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.549> find<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so I'm going to see if I can find a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.270 
so I'm going to see if I can find a
cheaper<00:01:39.750> place<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.229> would<00:01:40.500> call<00:01:40.710> them<00:01:40.860> sub

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
cheaper place I would call them sub

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.270 
cheaper place I would call them sub
repair<00:01:41.610> shops<00:01:42.170> found<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.590> New<00:01:43.710> York<00:01:43.979> that
