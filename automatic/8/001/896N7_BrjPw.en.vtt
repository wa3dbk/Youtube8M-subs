other<00:01:41.250> than<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.180> fact<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:44.040> wish<00:01:44.190> he

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
other than the fact that i just wish he

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.890 
other than the fact that i just wish he
had<00:01:44.460> landing<00:01:44.940> gear<00:01:45.210> right<00:01:45.540> here<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:45.810> the

bottom<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.380> at<00:01:47.040> least<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> peg<00:01:47.820> or

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
bottom I at least like a peg or

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.580 
bottom I at least like a peg or
something<00:01:48.330> kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.690> like<00:01:48.810> Starscream<00:01:49.320> where

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
something kind of like Starscream where

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.830

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
he had just had the pegs right here so

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.170 
he had just had the pegs right here so
he<00:01:52.110> could<00:01:52.230> you<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.250> him<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.460> he<00:01:53.940> stands

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.910 
he could you know and him up he stands
out<00:01:54.330> pretty<00:01:54.510> well<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.409> would<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.860> been

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
out pretty well but it would have been

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.210 
out pretty well but it would have been
nice<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.310> had<00:01:56.340> some<00:01:56.460> actual<00:01:56.880> landing<00:01:57.240> gear

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220

nice if we had some actual landing gear
alright<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.460> let's<00:01:59.940> transform<00:02:00.360> him<00:02:00.450> first

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.390 
head with the purple line he does have
light-piping<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.700> shines<00:04:44.970> fairly<00:04:45.690> well<00:04:45.870> um

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
light-piping so it shines fairly well um

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
in overall he looks nice i like the tail

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.800 
in overall he looks nice i like the tail
the<00:04:50.370> tail<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.700> quite<00:04:51.000> articulate<00:04:51.330> although<00:04:51.780> i

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
the tail is quite articulate although i

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.560 
the tail is quite articulate although i
hate<00:04:52.169> how<00:04:52.380> right<00:04:53.310> there<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.700> comes<00:04:53.880> off<00:04:54.090> off<00:04:54.360> of

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
hate how right there it comes off off of

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.890 
hate how right there it comes off off of
this

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
this

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.200 
this
so<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.530> comes<00:04:55.710> off<00:04:55.889> very<00:04:56.220> easily<00:04:56.550> when<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.030> try

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
so it comes off very easily when you try

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.060 
so it comes off very easily when you try
to<00:04:57.240> move<00:04:57.509> his<00:04:57.660> tail<00:04:57.960> so<00:04:58.259> gotta<00:04:58.830> be<00:04:58.949> careful

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
to move his tail so gotta be careful

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.159 
to move his tail so gotta be careful
with<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.430> heard<00:04:59.970> some<00:05:00.449> recommendations

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
with that I heard some recommendations

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.320 
with that I heard some recommendations
of<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:01.949> putting<00:05:02.370> in<00:05:02.460> super<00:05:02.820> glue<00:05:03.000> but<00:05:03.210> then

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
of you putting in super glue but then

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.810 
of you putting in super glue but then
again<00:05:03.449> you<00:05:03.600> can't<00:05:03.960> rotate<00:05:04.199> it<00:05:04.530> or<00:05:05.100> putting<00:05:05.669> in

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
again you can't rotate it or putting in

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.790 
again you can't rotate it or putting in
super<00:05:06.120> glue<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.509> then<00:05:06.780> attach<00:05:07.320> you<00:05:07.530> know<00:05:07.620> let

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
super glue and then attach you know let

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.230 
super glue and then attach you know let
it<00:05:07.889> dry<00:05:08.039> and<00:05:08.100> then<00:05:08.220> attach<00:05:08.639> it<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:08.940> it<00:05:09.030> becomes

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
it dry and then attach it so it becomes

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.770 
it dry and then attach it so it becomes
a<00:05:09.389> lot<00:05:09.479> more<00:05:09.740> rigid<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.180> it<00:05:12.180> hooks<00:05:12.330> up<00:05:12.570> better

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
a lot more rigid and it hooks up better

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.159 
a lot more rigid and it hooks up better
all<00:05:13.259> right<00:05:13.440> that<00:05:13.620> area<00:05:14.810> one<00:05:15.810> thing<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.110> don't

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
all right that area one thing I don't

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.260 
all right that area one thing I don't
like<00:05:16.320> is<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.620> articulation<00:05:17.400> not<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.789> and<00:05:18.090> not

the<00:05:18.680> amount<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:19.800> it's<00:05:19.979> got<00:05:20.190> it<00:05:20.370> has<00:05:20.490> some

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
the amount that it's got it has some

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.550 
the amount that it's got it has some
great<00:05:20.880> articulation<00:05:21.180> all<00:05:21.750> through<00:05:22.080> his<00:05:22.229> legs

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560

his<00:05:22.800> paws<00:05:23.070> his<00:05:23.669> tail<00:05:24.979> but<00:05:25.979> what<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.220> don't<00:05:26.310> like

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
his paws his tail but what I don't like

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.230 
his paws his tail but what I don't like
is<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.729> fact<00:05:26.820> that<00:05:27.060> it's<00:05:27.240> quite<00:05:27.419> loose<00:05:27.810> he<00:05:28.229> is

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
is the fact that it's quite loose he is

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.760 
is the fact that it's quite loose he is
very<00:05:30.240> fairly<00:05:30.600> tough<00:05:30.930> to<00:05:31.169> get<00:05:31.260> them<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.500> stand

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
very fairly tough to get them to stand

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.100 
very fairly tough to get them to stand
because<00:05:32.010> there<00:05:32.340> are<00:05:32.490> two<00:05:32.639> your<00:05:33.000> legs<00:05:33.270> wobble<00:05:34.080> a

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
because there are two your legs wobble a

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.409 
because there are two your legs wobble a
little<00:05:34.169> bit<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.919> just<00:05:35.130> hate<00:05:35.340> how<00:05:36.000> this

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
little bit and I just hate how this

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.900 
little bit and I just hate how this
mid-torso<00:05:37.199> joint<00:05:37.590> just<00:05:37.800> it's<00:05:38.310> just<00:05:38.400> very

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
mid-torso joint just it's just very

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.719 
mid-torso joint just it's just very
loose<00:05:39.380> extremely<00:05:40.380> loose<00:05:40.590> and<00:05:40.919> he<00:05:41.310> did<00:05:41.520> come
