00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 Hello Hello I'm Matt and this time 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.819
 be doing my favorites of the month 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.740
 because I had like two months without doing it 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.559
 To begin with, I was traveling in a hunt 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.110
 so I wanted to try things that 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 they had flushes and shadows various things 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.970
 in one so as not to have to load so much and 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.820
 this palette and this palette has it and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 It has several flavors and not several shades 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.600
 and the colors of the shadow of seems very 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.609
 cute I love mates but also 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.099
 I love the bright ones that he has 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.779
 this for example this blue I love 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 the blue shadows already in my 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.510
 definitely preferred my next 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.290
 favorite is the tremors worth of 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 Costa Rican the previous one was 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.090
 Viaticum mÃ¨diques by the way and I already 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.640
 had the second version of this that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.309
 has more purples and things like that with more 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.280
 extravagant but this one I love I'm 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.629
 using one today for example this depends 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.300
 of your skin tone to use it as 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.280
 bronzer just like this you create it or 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 not because it looks clear but they are so 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.329
 pigmented that definitely if 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.460
 add something 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.309
 you already know that it has always been one of 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.020
 my favorites but this is the second 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.360
 version of which I have just shown 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.170
 also this place that I wanted it from 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.420
 long ago in the gray tone of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.340
 Biscos Mary and something fell but it's a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.200
 duo of flavors the two tones by 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.180
 separate I like this I take it as 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.420
 illuminator but the color they give when 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.289
 they mix is very very cute and finally 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.909
 a suntan of coast of sense yes I have 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.460
 been using quite a lot in the tutorials 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.679
 and it's just in the middle tone 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 most do not add much color so 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.740
 if you want it to outline, it's not going to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 serve but it definitely makes you 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.420
 you see so pale and it's not mate 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.299
 because the bad thing about abc I'll pose mate 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.860
 is that they can see you as dirty so 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.600
 it's very easy to use so it's not 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.970
 mate and that was all for my favorites 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.979
 of the month with 20 thousand what are your 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 favorites or what products of course 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.500
 in the animal tests they recommend me 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.780
 a kiss until the next video 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.360
 hello how about I'm killed a while ago 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.399
 I made a gift a tour where I showed the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.500
 room of the residence where he lived 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.170
 before and appeared to this thing from here that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.450
 it's a good scrub, so also 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.550
 It serves for cellulite and the truth itself 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.410
 I think it works and if I'm interested in doing it 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.120
 for cellulite you can at least do 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.090
 about once a month in the whole body 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.540
 because it exfoliates very well and leaves the skin 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.540
 very soft
