feel kind of like a shrunken down galaxy
s5<00:01:01.920> into<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> slightly<00:01:02.520> smaller<00:01:02.820> body<00:01:03.149> but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
s5 into a slightly smaller body but

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.000 
s5 into a slightly smaller body but

again with the premium specs that we

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.469 
again with the premium specs that we
expect<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> flagship<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> with<00:01:06.299> those

premium specs the number one thing that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
premium specs the number one thing that
is<00:01:08.250> probably<00:01:08.490> most<00:01:08.970> locked<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.229> new

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439

camera on the galaxy s5 and that's

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
camera on the galaxy s5 and that's
expected<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> 16<00:01:13.710> megapixel<00:01:13.860> camera<00:01:14.610> and

expected to be a 16 megapixel camera and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
expected to be a 16 megapixel camera and
along<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.930> new<00:01:16.259> resolution<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.799> would

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
along with that new resolution I would

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.710 
along with that new resolution I would
also<00:01:17.040> expect<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.759> able<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> shoot<00:01:18.330> 4k

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
also expect it to be able to shoot 4k

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260 
also expect it to be able to shoot 4k
video<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.189> Galaxy<00:01:20.610> Note<00:01:20.729> 3<00:01:20.790> can

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
video just like the Galaxy Note 3 can

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.140

around<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> front<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> 50/50<00:01:23.369> shot<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
around the front there is a 50/50 shot a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.780 
around the front there is a 50/50 shot a
pair<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:24.960> rumors<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.770> scenario<00:01:26.250> 1<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.759> a

pair of rumors of scenario 1 and a
scenario<00:01:27.210> 2<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.750> could<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
scenario 2 that we could see with the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
way the front of this phone looks so the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.469 
way the front of this phone looks so the

here with these new rumors but it's

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.970 
here with these new rumors but it's
still<00:04:51.960> gonna<00:04:52.080> be<00:04:52.140> interesting<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.590> see<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.800> new

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
still gonna be interesting to see a new

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.130 
still gonna be interesting to see a new
phone<00:04:53.190> with<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.700> new<00:04:53.880> design<00:04:54.270> again<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.840> like

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
phone with the new design again I like

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.260 
phone with the new design again I like
the<00:04:55.290> Galaxy<00:04:55.650> Note<00:04:55.770> 3<00:04:55.830> so<00:04:56.700> I'd<00:04:56.820> like<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.000> see<00:04:57.240> a

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
the Galaxy Note 3 so I'd like to see a

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.090 
the Galaxy Note 3 so I'd like to see a
shrunken<00:04:57.600> down<00:04:57.840> version<00:04:58.230> of<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.440> also<00:04:58.740> we<00:04:59.010> have

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
shrunken down version of it also we have

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.380 
shrunken down version of it also we have
to<00:04:59.190> remember<00:04:59.220> that<00:04:59.520> even<00:04:59.880> though<00:04:59.970> the<00:05:00.090> specs

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
to remember that even though the specs

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.330 
to remember that even though the specs
seem<00:05:00.660> like<00:05:00.840> a<00:05:00.870> small<00:05:01.440> incremental<00:05:01.830> upgrade

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
seem like a small incremental upgrade

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.450 
seem like a small incremental upgrade
Android<00:05:03.060> 4.4<00:05:03.660> KitKat<00:05:03.930> has<00:05:04.380> way<00:05:04.710> lower<00:05:05.010> system

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
Android 4.4 KitKat has way lower system

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.430 
Android 4.4 KitKat has way lower system
requirements<00:05:06.000> and<00:05:06.090> is<00:05:06.240> better<00:05:06.480> optimized<00:05:07.260> to

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
requirements and is better optimized to

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.530 
requirements and is better optimized to
take<00:05:07.590> advantage<00:05:07.950> of<00:05:08.070> lesser<00:05:08.430> specs<00:05:08.760> so<00:05:09.270> even

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
take advantage of lesser specs so even

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.260 
take advantage of lesser specs so even
though<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.900> has<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.140> similar<00:05:11.000> CPU<00:05:12.000> on<00:05:12.180> the

though it has a similar CPU on the

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.530 
though it has a similar CPU on the
Adreno<00:05:12.600> 330<00:05:12.870> GPU<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:14.370> still<00:05:14.880> should<00:05:15.210> be<00:05:15.240> able

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
Adreno 330 GPU it still should be able

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.230 
Adreno 330 GPU it still should be able
to<00:05:15.660> perform<00:05:16.020> better<00:05:16.800> than<00:05:17.160> it<00:05:17.400> does<00:05:17.640> now<00:05:17.910> on

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
to perform better than it does now on

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.470 
to perform better than it does now on
Android<00:05:18.810> 4.3<00:05:19.640> because<00:05:20.640> of<00:05:20.880> the<00:05:20.970> improvements

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
everything leaks at this point but there

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.860 
everything leaks at this point but there
is<00:05:31.530> a<00:05:31.560> Samsung<00:05:32.280> unpacked<00:05:32.460> event<00:05:32.880> on<00:05:33.180> February

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
24th and all the systems seem to point

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.230 
24th and all the systems seem to point
toward<00:05:37.380> that<00:05:37.710> being<00:05:38.130> the<00:05:38.700> place<00:05:38.940> where<00:05:39.150> we

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
toward that being the place where we

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.900 
toward that being the place where we
first<00:05:39.480> see<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.900> new<00:05:40.020> Samsung<00:05:40.440> Galaxy<00:05:40.860> s5<00:05:41.220> so

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
I'll be there and I hope maybe we'll see

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.520

an<00:05:44.040> updated<00:05:44.580> wearable<00:05:45.510> companion<00:05:46.110> perhaps<00:05:46.410> a

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
an updated wearable companion perhaps a

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.860 
an updated wearable companion perhaps a
new<00:05:46.650> Galaxy<00:05:47.130> gear<00:05:47.430> at<00:05:47.640> that<00:05:48.180> event<00:05:48.480> as<00:05:48.630> well<00:05:48.840> a

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
new Galaxy gear at that event as well a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.510 
new Galaxy gear at that event as well a
little<00:05:49.080> bit<00:05:49.230> less<00:05:49.410> likely<00:05:49.620> but<00:05:49.800> I'm<00:05:50.370> really

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
little bit less likely but I'm really

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.490 
little bit less likely but I'm really
focused<00:05:50.910> on<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.120> phone<00:05:51.330> here<00:05:51.600> so<00:05:51.810> either<00:05:52.260> way

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
focused on the phone here so either way

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.110 
focused on the phone here so either way
that's<00:05:52.680> been<00:05:52.890> it<00:05:53.010> if<00:05:53.190> you're<00:05:53.520> if<00:05:53.700> you're<00:05:53.910> not
