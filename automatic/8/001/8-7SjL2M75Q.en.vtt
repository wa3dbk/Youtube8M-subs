00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
know they lack a little bit of

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.580 
know they lack a little bit of
confidence<00:03:20.299> right<00:03:20.510> now<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:21.110> when<00:03:21.320> you<00:03:21.410> lack<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
confidence right now and when you lack a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.080 
confidence right now and when you lack a
little<00:03:21.890> bit<00:03:21.980> of<00:03:22.070> confidence<00:03:22.340> you're<00:03:22.670> just<00:03:22.850> one

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
little bit of confidence you're just one

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.330 
little bit of confidence you're just one
step<00:03:23.120> behind<00:03:23.630> everything<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:25.040> can<00:03:25.190> see

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
step behind everything and you can see

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.830 
step behind everything and you can see
that<00:03:25.370> at<00:03:25.730> times<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.360> can<00:03:26.480> see<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.630> in

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
that at times and you can see that in

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.020 
that at times and you can see that in
the<00:03:26.930> first<00:03:27.140> half<00:03:27.640> definitely<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:28.760> know<00:03:28.850> we

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
the first half definitely you know we

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.000 
the first half definitely you know we
were<00:03:29.209> insecure<00:03:30.049> and<00:03:30.500> the<00:03:30.620> way<00:03:30.769> we<00:03:30.920> were

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
were insecure and the way we were

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.190 
were insecure and the way we were
playing<00:03:31.360> but<00:03:32.360> you<00:03:32.690> know<00:03:32.780> it's<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.080> be<00:03:33.170> expected

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.200 
playing but you know it's to be expected

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.470 
playing but you know it's to be expected
listen<00:03:33.980> we<00:03:34.160> lost<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.549> last<00:03:34.760> two<00:03:34.880> games<00:03:35.000> you

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
listen we lost the last two games you

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.930 
listen we lost the last two games you
know<00:03:35.600> we're<00:03:35.870> playing<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.799> top<00:03:37.010> team<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.820> know

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
know we're playing the top team you know

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.030 
know we're playing the top team you know
to<00:03:38.570> me<00:03:38.720> that's<00:03:38.750> all<00:03:39.110> a<00:03:39.140> part<00:03:39.410> of<00:03:39.470> football<00:03:39.620> and

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
to me that's all a part of football and

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.039 
to me that's all a part of football and
I<00:03:40.160> think<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.790> response<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.570> got<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.930> the

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
I think the response that I got in the

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.650 
I think the response that I got in the
second<00:03:42.410> half<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:43.610> know<00:03:43.700> I<00:03:43.730> would<00:03:44.000> say<00:03:44.209> we<00:03:44.480> were

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
second half you know I would say we were

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.449 
second half you know I would say we were
pressure<00:03:44.959> and<00:03:45.320> we<00:03:45.500> were<00:03:45.680> all<00:03:45.890> over<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.340> we

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
pressure and we were all over and we

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.520 
pressure and we were all over and we
were<00:03:46.610> running<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.150> we<00:03:47.239> were<00:03:47.390> there<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:47.930> you

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
were running and we were there so you

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.530 
were running and we were there so you
know<00:03:48.650> part<00:03:49.370> of<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.610> agree<00:03:49.850> with<00:03:49.910> import<00:03:50.390> I

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
know part of that I agree with import I

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.180 
know part of that I agree with import I
think<00:03:51.019> that<00:03:51.049> you<00:03:51.320> know<00:03:51.440> we<00:03:51.680> got<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:52.010> back<00:03:52.130> a

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
think that you know we got it back a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:04:00.340 
think that you know we got it back a
little<00:03:52.340> bit<00:03:52.580> in<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.760> second<00:03:53.060> half
