and life it definitely can be a
challenge<00:05:46.860> every<00:05:47.520> dance<00:05:47.789> calls<00:05:48.330> for<00:05:48.539> a

challenge every dance calls for a

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:49.850

for<00:05:52.320> me<00:05:53.240> the<00:05:54.240> only<00:05:54.479> thing<00:05:54.630> that's

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
for me the only thing that's

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.870

because you have to be connected

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.050 
because you have to be connected
together<00:05:58.470> with<00:05:58.889> the<00:05:59.010> person<00:05:59.370> so<00:05:59.700> you<00:05:59.760> can't
