00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
I'll put the camera down for a second

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.090 
I'll put the camera down for a second
seating<00:03:38.140> here<00:03:38.260> how<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.470> sounds<00:03:38.860> when<00:03:38.980> it's

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
have the carburetor worked on at one

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.330 
have the carburetor worked on at one
time<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:38.370> do<00:04:38.640> know<00:04:38.970> about<00:04:39.620> but<00:04:40.620> it<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:40.800> original

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
time I do know about but it is original

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.430 
time I do know about but it is original
carburetor<00:04:41.690> they<00:04:42.690> tried<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.020> use<00:04:43.170> the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
carburetor they tried to use the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.880 
carburetor they tried to use the
original<00:04:43.650> parts<00:04:44.160> in<00:04:44.280> it<00:04:45.230> basically<00:04:46.230> just<00:04:46.470> you

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
original parts in it basically just you

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.800 
original parts in it basically just you
know<00:04:46.920> fine<00:04:47.280> tuned<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.910> try<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.300> get<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.630> work

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
know fine tuned to try to get to work

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.200 
know fine tuned to try to get to work
right<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.800> then<00:04:49.920> it<00:04:50.040> does<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.460> it<00:04:50.550> works<00:04:50.700> very

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
right and then it does and it works very

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.950 
right and then it does and it works very
well

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
well

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.410 
well
it<00:04:52.380> ran<00:04:52.590> rich<00:04:52.830> for<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.130> while<00:04:53.280> and<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:54.120> found<00:04:54.300> it

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
it ran rich for a while and I found it

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.130 
it ran rich for a while and I found it
was<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.600> Calot<00:04:54.900> converter<00:04:55.170> so<00:04:55.470> if<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:55.740> own<00:04:55.890> one

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
was a Calot converter so if you own one

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.880 
was a Calot converter so if you own one
definitely<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.200> catalytic<00:04:58.470> converter<00:04:58.530> will

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
definitely a catalytic converter will

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.130 
definitely a catalytic converter will
make<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.130> run<00:04:59.250> rich<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.840> give<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.960> a<00:05:01.020> few

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
make it run rich and give it a few

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.620 
make it run rich and give it a few
problems<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:03.980> I'll<00:05:04.980> show<00:05:05.220> one<00:05:05.580> more<00:05:05.630> clip

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
problems so I'll show one more clip

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:19.320 
problems so I'll show one more clip
underneath<00:05:07.140> what<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.800> looks<00:05:07.980> like

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.770 

I<00:05:19.479> did<00:05:20.319> forget<00:05:20.620> to<00:05:20.800> mention<00:05:20.919> that<00:05:21.220> it<00:05:21.490> does<00:05:21.780> if

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
I did forget to mention that it does if

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.800 
I did forget to mention that it does if
we<00:05:23.020> did<00:05:23.199> take<00:05:23.379> the<00:05:24.330> transmission<00:05:25.330> out<00:05:25.449> so<00:05:25.689> it's

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
we did take the transmission out so it's

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.140 
we did take the transmission out so it's
not<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.110> original<00:05:26.229> transmission<00:05:27.150> it's

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
not the original transmission it's

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.869 
not the original transmission it's
actually<00:05:28.419> got<00:05:28.539> turbo<00:05:28.780> 350<00:05:29.289> in<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:30.250> so<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.610> mean

00:05:30.869 --> 00:05:30.879 
actually got turbo 350 in it so I mean

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.040 
actually got turbo 350 in it so I mean
you<00:05:31.270> know<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.449> doesn't<00:05:31.629> have<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.960> original

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
you know it doesn't have the original

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.890 
you know it doesn't have the original
four-speed<00:05:32.830> I<00:05:32.860> think<00:05:33.219> it<00:05:33.310> was<00:05:33.430> the<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:34.300> 200

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
four-speed I think it was the the 200

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.879 
four-speed I think it was the the 200
our<00:05:35.849> transmission<00:05:37.259> which<00:05:38.259> like<00:05:38.620> I<00:05:38.650> said<00:05:38.740> I

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
our transmission which like I said I

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.469 
our transmission which like I said I
haven't<00:05:39.129> actually<00:05:39.370> had<00:05:39.610> experience<00:05:39.789> with<00:05:40.300> one

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
haven't actually had experience with one

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.029 
haven't actually had experience with one
but<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:41.620> 350<00:05:42.159> does<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.370> very<00:05:42.759> well<00:05:43.030> job<00:05:43.330> and

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
but the 350 does a very well job and

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.679 
but the 350 does a very well job and
actually<00:05:45.039> it's<00:05:45.460> second<00:05:45.879> gear<00:05:46.120> when<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.479> goes

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:46.689 
actually it's second gear when it goes

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.360 
actually it's second gear when it goes
from<00:05:46.810> first<00:05:47.080> to<00:05:47.319> second<00:05:47.710> it<00:05:47.830> will<00:05:47.889> actually<00:05:48.219> go

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
from first to second it will actually go

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.890 
from first to second it will actually go
give<00:05:48.729> a<00:05:48.759> little<00:05:48.969> bit<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.150> scratch<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:49.689> it<00:05:49.810> so

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
give a little bit of scratch to it so

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.379 
give a little bit of scratch to it so
that's<00:05:52.900> what<00:05:53.110> an<00:05:53.229> old<00:05:53.379> will<00:05:53.620> do<00:05:53.740> for<00:05:54.009> you<00:05:54.389> like

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
that's what an old will do for you like

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:56.820 
that's what an old will do for you like
I<00:05:55.449> said<00:05:55.509> I<00:05:55.659> don't<00:05:56.020> know<00:05:56.199> what<00:05:56.440> I'm<00:05:56.530> going<00:05:56.620> to<00:05:56.680> do

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
I said I don't know what I'm going to do

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.790 
I said I don't know what I'm going to do
with<00:05:56.979> it<00:05:57.099> yet<00:05:57.310> I<00:05:57.580> might<00:05:58.300> keep<00:05:58.479> it<00:05:58.599> all<00:05:58.750> original

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
with it yet I might keep it all original

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.830 
with it yet I might keep it all original
I<00:05:59.830> might<00:06:00.669> actually<00:06:00.819> put<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.180> bigger<00:06:01.360> motor<00:06:01.659> I'm

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
I might actually put a bigger motor I'm

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.619 
I might actually put a bigger motor I'm
not<00:06:02.020> sure<00:06:05.490> but<00:06:06.490> if<00:06:06.639> you<00:06:06.729> have<00:06:06.879> any<00:06:07.030> ideas<00:06:07.150> I'd

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
a little bit more power to it

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.869 
a little bit more power to it
the<00:06:14.409> 307<00:06:14.979> does<00:06:15.129> give<00:06:15.310> it<00:06:15.400> a<00:06:15.460> good<00:06:15.550> amount<00:06:15.819> of
