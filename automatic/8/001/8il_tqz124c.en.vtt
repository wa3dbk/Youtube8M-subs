bosses<00:00:29.880> may<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.330> seem<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.599> it's<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.710> but

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
bosses may not seem that it's a lot but

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.459 
bosses may not seem that it's a lot but
for<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> first<00:00:33.540> day<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.930> would<00:00:34.170> say<00:00:34.350> it's

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
for the first day I would say it's

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.810 
for the first day I would say it's
really<00:00:34.710> nice<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.700> managed<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:37.820> 418

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
really nice and we managed to get 418

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.250 
really nice and we managed to get 418
million<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.510> total<00:00:39.950> loads<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:41.820> only<00:00:42.390> got<00:00:42.660> 55

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
million in total loads now I only got 55

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.990 
million in total loads now I only got 55
million<00:00:43.500> out<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.920> all<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.520> load<00:00:44.730> actually

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
million out of all that load actually

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.790 
million out of all that load actually
that's<00:00:45.390> quite<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> think<00:00:46.410> about<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
that's quite a lot if you think about it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.220 
that's quite a lot if you think about it
because<00:00:47.039> usually<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.090> had<00:00:48.239> over<00:00:48.570> 10<00:00:48.840> people

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
because usually we had over 10 people

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.220 
because usually we had over 10 people
killing<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> boss<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.570> at<00:00:51.570> one<00:00:51.840> time<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> got

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
killing the boss and at one time I got

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.290 
killing the boss and at one time I got
really<00:00:52.620> lucky<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.100> got<00:00:53.280> basically<00:00:53.879> all<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
really lucky and I got basically all the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.029 
really lucky and I got basically all the
loot<00:00:54.480> 6<00:00:55.110> tectonic<00:00:55.710> ashes<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:58.039> 5.5

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
loot 6 tectonic ashes and that was 5.5

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
loot 6 tectonic ashes and that was 5.5
million<00:00:59.280> each<00:00:59.640> so<00:01:00.090> that's<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.690> was<00:01:00.840> quite<00:01:01.050> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
million each so that's that was quite a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
million each so that's that was quite a
lot<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.500> since<00:01:01.770> then<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.219> did<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.430> receive<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
lot but since then I did not receive a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.850 
lot but since then I did not receive a
single<00:01:03.120> load<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.409> loot<00:01:04.650> share

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
single load because my loot share

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.330 
single load because my loot share
potential<00:01:05.460> went<00:01:05.700> down<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:06.390> by<00:01:06.659> quite<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> lot

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
potential went down down by quite a lot

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
potential went down down by quite a lot
so<00:01:08.340> 55<00:01:08.820> mil<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.869> okay<00:01:10.260> that's<00:01:10.530> actually

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so 55 mil that's okay that's actually

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
so 55 mil that's okay that's actually
good<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.460> know<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> problem<00:01:12.180> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
good but you know what the problem is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.429 
good but you know what the problem is
though<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.500> made<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.360> mask<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:16.290> those

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
though that I made a mask with those

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:16.940 
though that I made a mask with those
ashes

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
ashes

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.410 
ashes
I<00:01:17.100> bought<00:01:17.340> some<00:01:17.549> ashes<00:01:17.729> from<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> grand

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I bought some ashes from the grand

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.120 
I bought some ashes from the grand
exchange<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:18.960> made<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> mask<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:19.860> from

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
exchange and I made a mask because from

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.060 
exchange and I made a mask because from
those<00:01:20.340> ashes<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.570> make<00:01:21.810> new<00:01:22.439> Armand<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
those ashes you can make new Armand and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.300 
those ashes you can make new Armand and
it's<00:01:23.490> level<00:01:23.670> 90<00:01:24.090> gear<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.979> apparently<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.100> do

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it's level 90 gear and apparently I do

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.170 
it's level 90 gear and apparently I do
not<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.890> degradable<00:01:29.520> animal<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
not know that it's degradable animal and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.990 
not know that it's degradable animal and
it<00:01:30.509> agreat<00:01:30.840> sin<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.290> dust<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.310> once<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.640> made<00:01:32.820> it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
it agreat sin to dust so once I made it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.929 
it agreat sin to dust so once I made it
I<00:01:33.150> expected<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> sell<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:35.130> high<00:01:35.369> for

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I expected to sell it for very high for

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.140 
I expected to sell it for very high for
like<00:01:36.119> 100<00:01:36.720> mil<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.670> apparently<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.759> only

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
like 100 mil and apparently I only

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.780 
like 100 mil and apparently I only
solved<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.229> 50<00:01:40.650> million<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.310> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
solved for it for 50 million and I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.380 
solved for it for 50 million and I
invested<00:01:42.360> 77<00:01:43.200> million<00:01:43.409> into<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> helm<00:01:44.390> so

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
invested 77 million into the helm so

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.749 
invested 77 million into the helm so
that<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.200> 27<00:01:46.860> million<00:01:47.100> loss<00:01:48.079> but<00:01:49.079> oh<00:01:49.549> well<00:01:50.549> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
that was 27 million loss but oh well I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.760 
that was 27 million loss but oh well I
guess<00:01:51.060> so<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.229> don't<00:01:52.380> count<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
guess so if you if we don't count that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.450 
guess so if you if we don't count that
little<00:01:53.640> mistake<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.689> did<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.200> made<00:01:55.860> 55

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
little mistake that I did I made 55

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
little mistake that I did I made 55
