00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.069
 continue the series slopok game reviews 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.530
 It has long ceased to be a novelty and I to 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.260
 they got quite recently today 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.210
 last game you judging by the number of records 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.509
 tagged last you on social networks 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.699
 this game is right such a masterpiece of the past 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.230
 2013 all praise graphics 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.850
 simple thoughtful straight gameplay 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.420
 implementation of stealth upgrades 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.240
 and most importantly the plot I honestly tried 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.039
 find anything of this first 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.720
 I went through the game to the point where 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.700
 a man with a girl baba run on 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.890
 sewage hiding from the villains with 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.309
 flashlights here I felt the first injection 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.500
 boredom is not interesting just boring and 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.329
 management stupid mission itself with 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.129
 sewage is very similar to the mission 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.770
 fallen angel is black ops 2 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.410
 Only there still were drones 1 stealth mission 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.420
 right after the corpse I just ran across 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.340
 I hit a couple of times but it did not stop 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.850
 get to checkpoint and chasers 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.800
 lagged behind 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.899
 I was soon caught up by the women whole and 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.879
 unscathed I first thought it was 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.809
 some kind of pathetic parody of the metal gear 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.590
 solid 4 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.840
 but decided to hold your opinion 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.549
 returned to the game a week later came to 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.830
 places to fight the blind 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.380
 monsters inside a collapsing building 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.270
 Well, where you have to listen to the ear and appear 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.200
 silhouettes behind the walls to see where 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.020
 enemies are 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.360
 and then I understood last you this mixture 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.009
 the last and the moon dark with the last 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.909
 batman where is he still detective mode 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.420
 there was all this already yes and the plot and me 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.829
 did not find much yes there are inserts and 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.750
 quite good dialogues 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.850
 but for example in the heroes of my past 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.570
 review be on the souls dialogue where 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.840
 more alive 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.860
 and inserts zaebyvayut and so the king of inserts 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.409
 is metal gear solid 4 there it seems 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.930
 99 percent of the game consists of cut-scenes in 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.659
 the gameâ€™s homefront storyline was not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.540
 less soulful so I became 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.490
 bored of this game i don't know maybe me 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.290
 just do not really like all these games 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.740
 about the apocalypse and all kinds of freaks 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.150
 zombie 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.060
 Well, for example stalker and fallout to me 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.700
 I don't like it, but it's not the euro 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.410
 boring and secondary all this we already 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.870
 seen in other games some of them 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.870
 five to six years no novelty
