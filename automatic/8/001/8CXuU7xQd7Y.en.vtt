tires these are the chisels from proline

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.520 
tires these are the chisels from proline
and<00:00:49.710> then<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.430> mounted<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.820> up<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.239> these<00:00:51.530> 2.2

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.209 
inch tightest bead locks and you know
first<00:00:56.820> off<00:00:56.969> they<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.050> made<00:00:58.289> perfect<00:00:58.710> I

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
first off they they just made perfect I

if<00:01:00.180> you've<00:01:00.780> experienced<00:01:01.350> tires<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.739> wheels

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
if you've experienced tires and wheels

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.820 
if you've experienced tires and wheels
before<00:01:02.100> especially<00:01:03.000> from<00:01:03.510> alternate<00:01:04.199> brands

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
before especially from alternate brands

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.060 
before especially from alternate brands
sometimes<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> wheel<00:01:06.150> doesn't<00:01:06.869> see<00:01:07.080> into<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
sometimes the wheel doesn't see into the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.679 
sometimes the wheel doesn't see into the
tire<00:01:08.310> as<00:01:08.580> nice<00:01:08.850> as<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.210> should

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
tire as nice as it should

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.109 
tire as nice as it should
well<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.920> you're<00:01:11.040> buying<00:01:11.189> from<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.729> company

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
well when you're buying from one company

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.499 
well when you're buying from one company
it<00:01:12.630> all<00:01:13.140> kind<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.500> melds<00:01:13.890> together<00:01:14.420> very<00:01:15.420> very

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
it all kind of melds together very very

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.810 
it all kind of melds together very very
nicely<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.650> went<00:01:17.220> ahead<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.490> picked<00:01:17.729> up

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
nicely so I went ahead and I picked up

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.450 
nicely so I went ahead and I picked up
these<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.270> are<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.540> chisels<00:01:19.250> definitely<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
these these are the chisels definitely a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.960 
these these are the chisels definitely a
comp<00:01:20.880> crawler<00:01:21.509> type<00:01:22.110> tire<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.820> it'll

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
comp crawler type tire and I think it'll

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.929 
comp crawler type tire and I think it'll
do<00:01:24.150> very<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.229> G<00:01:25.860> made<00:01:26.360> r1<00:01:27.360> ROC<00:01:27.780> buggy

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
do very well on this G made r1 ROC buggy

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.920 
do very well on this G made r1 ROC buggy
just<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> give<00:01:30.150> me<00:01:30.210> an<00:01:30.270> example<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
just to give me an example of the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.830 
just to give me an example of the
previous<00:01:31.380> wheels<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> tires<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.329> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
previous wheels and tires these are the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.960 
previous wheels and tires these are the
G<00:01:34.140> made<00:01:34.350> wheels<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.189> tires<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.850> they're

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
G made wheels and tires I think they're

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
G made wheels and tires I think they're
called<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.299> Bighorn<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.860> basically<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
called the Bighorn and just basically a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.840 
called the Bighorn and just basically a
plastic<00:01:38.790> bead<00:01:39.570> lock<00:01:39.840> now<00:01:40.500> size<00:01:41.280> wise<00:01:41.579> they're

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
plastic bead lock now size wise they're

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.700 
plastic bead lock now size wise they're
almost<00:01:42.090> identical<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.899> chisel<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
almost identical the chisel is just a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.700 
almost identical the chisel is just a
little<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.490> bigger<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:46.350> biggest

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
little bit bigger and the biggest

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.590 
little bit bigger and the biggest
difference<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> gonna<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> pliability<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
difference is gonna be the pliability of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.160 
difference is gonna be the pliability of
the<00:01:48.810> tire<00:01:49.049> these<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.829> very<00:01:50.159> stiff<00:01:51.170> tires

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the tire these are very stiff tires

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.179 
the tire these are very stiff tires
where<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.790> GA<00:01:54.659> compound<00:01:55.380> on<00:01:55.619> these<00:01:55.799> chisels

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
where the GA compound on these chisels

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.780 
where the GA compound on these chisels
are<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:57.390> awesome<00:01:57.540> very<00:01:58.439> pliable<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.369> they

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
are just awesome very pliable and they

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
are just awesome very pliable and they
got<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.119> memory<00:02:00.509> foam<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
got that memory foam in there so it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.190 
got that memory foam in there so it
really<00:02:01.409> kind<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.979> grabs<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.659> rocks<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
really kind of grabs on to the rocks and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.760 
really kind of grabs on to the rocks and
whatnot

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
whatnot

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.100 
whatnot
so<00:02:04.920> pretty<00:02:05.640> cool<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so pretty cool I have all of the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.369 
so pretty cool I have all of the
upgrades<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:08.099> not<00:02:08.310> even<00:02:08.489> run<00:02:08.940> yet

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
upgrades that I have not even run yet

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.160 
upgrades that I have not even run yet
