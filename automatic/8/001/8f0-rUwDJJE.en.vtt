00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
to update things this vehicle isn't that

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.720

old<00:04:29.310> it's<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.610> 98<00:04:31.130> but<00:04:32.130> I<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.430> thought<00:04:32.580> the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
old it's a 98 but I just thought the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.790 
old it's a 98 but I just thought the
green<00:04:32.970> wasn't<00:04:33.510> quite<00:04:33.660> fitting<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.320> my<00:04:34.620> next

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
green wasn't quite fitting so my next

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.010 
green wasn't quite fitting so my next
step<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.520> take<00:04:36.090> off<00:04:36.270> all<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.600> exterior

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
step is to take off all the exterior

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.500 
step is to take off all the exterior
decals<00:04:37.620> and<00:04:37.950> ugly<00:04:38.490> pinstriping<00:04:39.150> they<00:04:39.300> always
