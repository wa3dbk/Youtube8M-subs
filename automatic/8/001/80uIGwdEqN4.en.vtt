00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.739
 let's say about that I installed this 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.950
 stuff 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.300
 let's start immediately where the home screen is 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.789
 typical of kit kat 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.260
 the lockscreen we can go to insert 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.780
 shortcuts and enable widgets 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.280
 which are normally deactivated then in 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.880
 themes we should go to download 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.060
 from the play stop the themes or from xda Ã¨ 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.409
 install an interface we have one 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.400
 wide range of shares 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.229
 a wide range of options where to 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.210
 example in status bar we could go to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:32.840
 change to battery and go insert to 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 its internal percentage after that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.640
 we could also go 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.790
 sorry I missed an option 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:47.060
 this option where we can go to 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.060
 increase our navigation bar 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:02:00.240
 then adding keys or up to bhutan 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 we could go and change here however in the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:10.190
 power button precisely the settings 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.190
 in fact there is reboot and screenshots 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:19.640
 after that we go to the other and we could 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.989
 go to increase the intensity of the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.640
 vibration go to change the range 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.430
 of the colors below we find superior that 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.150
 it is the burp in practice this Roma already there 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.739
 provides slots and performances vi 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.459
 will increase the clock of the 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.110
 smartphone 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:43.290
 I still have not done it but unite 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.510
 almost all the roms then mine 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.489
 personal impressions 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.290
 this rom for everyday use is 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.910
 really really good 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.120
 will allow you to have a fluidity 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.720
 almost like the stock 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.340
 there is now and there are some light plugs 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.900
 due to the stream I'm doing with 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.459
 screencast of cyan gen 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.830
 however I recommend you try this 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.890
 rom because it has no last bug 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:15.480
 bug has been fixed for graphic glitch 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:19.590
 so when we were taking screenshots then 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.830
 don't worry about any bugs 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.480
 imperfections real system of juve 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.269
 because it's really really all perfect 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.780
 rom that is almost constantly updated 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:34.019
 every week even out a rom a 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.360
