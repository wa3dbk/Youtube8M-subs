00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
out a new format to pick it up in also I

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.949 
out a new format to pick it up in also I
don't<00:02:49.549> know<00:02:49.639> how<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.790> Ebers<00:02:50.450> metagame<00:02:50.840> is

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
don't know how the Ebers metagame is

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.240 
don't know how the Ebers metagame is
gonna<00:02:51.109> change<00:02:51.290> but<00:02:51.439> still<00:02:51.590> interesting

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
gonna change but still interesting

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.030 
gonna change but still interesting
overall<00:02:52.730> so<00:02:53.359> that's<00:02:53.629> more<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.049> my<00:02:54.200> more

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
overall so that's more it's my more

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.500 
overall so that's more it's my more
thing<00:02:55.219> is<00:02:55.310> more<00:02:55.459> observation<00:02:56.120> than<00:02:56.269> being

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
thing is more observation than being

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.809 
thing is more observation than being
like<00:02:56.629> oh<00:02:56.780> yeah<00:02:57.109> a<00:02:57.139> just<00:02:57.530> lashes<00:02:57.859> ban<00:02:58.129> whatever

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
like oh yeah a just lashes ban whatever

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.490 
like oh yeah a just lashes ban whatever
it's<00:02:59.419> kind<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.629> like<00:02:59.780> what<00:02:59.989> does<00:03:00.169> this<00:03:00.260> mean

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
it's kind of like what does this mean

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.319 
it's kind of like what does this mean
now<00:03:00.530> cuz<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.459> don't<00:03:01.639> know<00:03:01.760> what<00:03:01.909> it<00:03:02.000> means<00:03:02.180> like

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
now cuz I don't know what it means like

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.929 
now cuz I don't know what it means like
there's<00:03:02.599> a<00:03:02.659> lot<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.959> shenanigans<00:03:03.469> um<00:03:03.939> my

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
there's a lot of shenanigans um my

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.780 
there's a lot of shenanigans um my
prediction<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.689> that<00:03:05.900> Charizard<00:03:06.609> could<00:03:07.609> be

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
prediction is that Charizard could be

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.640 
prediction is that Charizard could be
next<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.299> chopping<00:03:08.450> block<00:03:08.689> it<00:03:09.049> still<00:03:09.469> has

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
next on the chopping block it still has

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.119 
next on the chopping block it still has
the<00:03:09.799> most

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
the most

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.490 
the most
usage<00:03:10.730> for<00:03:11.209> oh<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.419> according<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.109> sweep<00:03:12.349> of

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
usage for oh you according to sweep of

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.500 
usage for oh you according to sweep of
fight<00:03:12.650> sweeper<00:03:13.189> count<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.790> Charizard<00:03:14.090> is<00:03:14.359> in

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
fight sweeper count that Charizard is in

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.300 
fight sweeper count that Charizard is in
a<00:03:14.599> ton<00:03:14.840> of<00:03:14.870> battles<00:03:15.290> because<00:03:15.500> it's<00:03:16.129> a<00:03:16.159> good

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
a ton of battles because it's a good

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.189 
a ton of battles because it's a good
megget<00:03:16.639> and<00:03:16.669> it<00:03:17.030> has<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.359> diversity<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.169> I

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:18.199 
megget and it has that diversity and I

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.270 
megget and it has that diversity and I
think<00:03:18.379> that's<00:03:18.530> one<00:03:18.680> of<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.799> main<00:03:18.919> problems

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
think that's one of the main problems

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.099 
think that's one of the main problems
that<00:03:19.370> aegislash<00:03:19.699> was<00:03:20.000> too<00:03:20.180> diverse<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.959> could

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
that aegislash was too diverse you could

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.020 
that aegislash was too diverse you could
either<00:03:21.199> be<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.590> super<00:03:22.010> setup<00:03:22.370> physical

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
either be a super setup physical

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.509 
either be a super setup physical
attacker<00:03:23.299> or<00:03:23.659> you<00:03:23.930> could<00:03:24.079> be<00:03:24.199> a<00:03:24.409> super<00:03:24.949> trading

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
attacker or you could be a super trading

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.129 
attacker or you could be a super trading
special<00:03:26.030> attacker<00:03:26.449> that<00:03:26.689> can<00:03:26.870> get<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.079> know

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
special attacker that can get you know

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.199 
special attacker that can get you know
guaranteed<00:03:27.620> kill<00:03:27.799> and<00:03:28.099> ship<00:03:28.340> damage<00:03:28.669> so<00:03:29.120> it

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
guaranteed kill and ship damage so it

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.539 
guaranteed kill and ship damage so it
goes<00:03:29.359> a<00:03:29.389> little<00:03:29.569> it's<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.620> had<00:03:30.799> that<00:03:30.919> 50/50

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
goes a little it's it had that 50/50

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.300 
goes a little it's it had that 50/50
going<00:03:31.819> for<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.769> now<00:03:33.769> it's<00:03:33.949> kind<00:03:34.159> of<00:03:34.189> like

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
going for it and now it's kind of like

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.039 
going for it and now it's kind of like
well<00:03:34.459> chars<00:03:34.729> arms<00:03:34.939> kind<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.209> same<00:03:35.359> thing<00:03:35.389> you

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
well chars arms kind of same thing you

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.449 
well chars arms kind of same thing you
don't<00:03:36.439> predict<00:03:36.829> right<00:03:37.010> on<00:03:37.189> the<00:03:37.280> mega

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
don't predict right on the mega

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.309 
don't predict right on the mega
evolution<00:03:37.549> you're<00:03:38.239> going<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.810> take<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.049> lot<00:03:39.290> of

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
evolution you're going to take a lot of

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.719 
evolution you're going to take a lot of
damage<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.919> think<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.310> only<00:03:40.430> thing<00:03:40.489> keeping

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
damage I think the only thing keeping

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.939 
damage I think the only thing keeping
chars<00:03:41.090> are<00:03:41.269> in<00:03:41.359> check<00:03:41.540> though<00:03:41.720> is<00:03:41.900> del<00:03:42.229> rock<00:03:42.470> so

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
chars are in check though is del rock so

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.860 
chars are in check though is del rock so
the<00:03:43.250> whether<00:03:43.729> or<00:03:43.790> not<00:03:43.909> I<00:03:43.970> could<00:03:44.180> suspect<00:03:44.659> it<00:03:44.780> is

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
the whether or not I could suspect it is

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.569 
the whether or not I could suspect it is
going<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.229> be<00:03:45.349> how<00:03:45.919> much<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.430> problem

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:46.579 
going to be how much of a problem

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:48.819 
going to be how much of a problem
stealth<00:03:46.970> Roxas<00:03:47.389> honestly<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.470> could<00:03:48.709> also

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
stealth Roxas honestly and I could also

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:50.800 
stealth Roxas honestly and I could also
see<00:03:49.099> Megamall<00:03:49.549> while<00:03:49.729> potentially<00:03:50.120> being<00:03:50.569> up

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
see Megamall while potentially being up

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.469 
see Megamall while potentially being up
for<00:03:51.459> problem<00:03:52.459> tests<00:03:52.759> or<00:03:52.879> suspect<00:03:53.269> testing

for problem tests or suspect testing

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.300 
for problem tests or suspect testing
because<00:03:53.629> it<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.810> a<00:03:53.840> problem<00:03:54.109> as<00:03:54.409> well<00:03:54.560> at<00:03:55.099> once

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
because it is a problem as well at once

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.409 
because it is a problem as well at once
that<00:03:55.459> thing<00:03:55.579> hits<00:03:55.729> a<00:03:55.790> field<00:03:55.970> and<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.239> can

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
that thing hits a field and you can

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.030 
that thing hits a field and you can
start<00:03:56.689> standing<00:03:56.930> up<00:03:57.139> into<00:03:57.409> it<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.829> don't<00:03:57.979> know

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
start standing up into it you don't know

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.439 
start standing up into it you don't know
what<00:03:58.189> it's<00:03:58.280> going<00:03:58.400> to<00:03:58.489> do<00:03:58.669> and<00:03:58.909> it<00:03:59.090> does<00:03:59.269> have

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
what it's going to do and it does have

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.119 
what it's going to do and it does have
that<00:03:59.569> Barbie<00:03:59.900> sucker<00:04:00.109> punch<00:04:00.379> with<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.829> huge

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
that Barbie sucker punch with the huge

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.640 
that Barbie sucker punch with the huge
power<00:04:01.340> so<00:04:02.180> than<00:04:02.689> that<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.109> don't<00:04:03.439> think<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
power so than that I don't think the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.719 
power so than that I don't think the
meta<00:04:03.799> game<00:04:03.949> is<00:04:04.069> going<00:04:04.189> to<00:04:04.310> change<00:04:04.430> much<00:04:04.699> from

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:04.729 
meta game is going to change much from

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.369 
meta game is going to change much from
this<00:04:05.090> I<00:04:05.239> think<00:04:05.540> it's<00:04:05.810> more<00:04:05.989> just<00:04:06.019> going<00:04:06.319> to

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
this I think it's more just going to

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.869 
this I think it's more just going to
make<00:04:06.500> people<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:07.040> little<00:04:07.250> more<00:04:07.370> comfortable

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
make people a little more comfortable

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.610 
make people a little more comfortable
and<00:04:08.209> not<00:04:08.329> having<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:08.810> like<00:04:08.930> think<00:04:09.259> too<00:04:09.409> hard

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
and not having to like think too hard

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.649 
and not having to like think too hard
while<00:04:09.769> battling<00:04:10.129> and<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:10.909> think<00:04:11.180> it's<00:04:11.329> going<00:04:11.569> to

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659
