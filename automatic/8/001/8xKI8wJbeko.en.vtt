00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
sort of 15 spot is worth I think best

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
knowing in different parts of the field

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.460 
knowing in different parts of the field

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.040 
pressure what sort of what sort of kick
I<00:00:47.950> guess<00:00:48.950> I<00:00:49.280> always<00:00:49.670> like<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:49.940> attack<00:00:50.330> so<00:00:50.750> it's

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
I guess I always like to attack so it's

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.230 
I guess I always like to attack so it's
it's<00:00:51.740> finding<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.250> good<00:00:52.370> balance<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:52.970> know<00:00:53.210> I

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.240 
it's finding a good balance you know I

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.510 
it's finding a good balance you know I
think<00:00:53.690> sort<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.230> the<00:00:54.440> main<00:00:54.680> part<00:00:54.950> is<00:00:55.100> between

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
think sort of the main part is between

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.880 
think sort of the main part is between
the<00:00:55.610> 40s<00:00:56.000> where<00:00:56.480> I<00:00:56.510> want<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:56.900> grow<00:00:57.050> my<00:00:57.110> game<00:00:57.470> so

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
the 40s where I want to grow my game so

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.070 
the 40s where I want to grow my game so
it's<00:00:58.370> a<00:00:58.430> little<00:00:58.580> sort<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.060> counter-attack<00:00:59.660> but

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
it's a little sort of counter-attack but

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.690 
it's a little sort of counter-attack but
also<00:01:00.200> on<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.530> end<00:01:00.650> of<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:00.800> chain<00:01:01.070> whether<00:01:01.340> you

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
also on the end of the chain whether you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.670 
also on the end of the chain whether you
know<00:01:01.820> we<00:01:02.329> got<00:01:02.450> an<00:01:02.600> overlap<00:01:02.960> or<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.230> one-on-one

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
know we got an overlap or a one-on-one

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.859 
know we got an overlap or a one-on-one
or<00:01:03.890> whether<00:01:04.400> just<00:01:04.670> pin<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.239> ball<00:01:05.420> down<00:01:05.630> into<00:01:05.840> a

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
or whether just pin the ball down into a

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.270 
or whether just pin the ball down into a
corner<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.259> put<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:06.500> pressure<00:01:06.680> back<00:01:06.800> on<00:01:07.100> them

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
corner and put the pressure back on them

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.680 
corner and put the pressure back on them
it's<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.730> great<00:01:07.850> launch<00:01:08.120> pad<00:01:08.360> isn't<00:01:08.570> it

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
guess I played everywhere from my you

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.969 
guess I played everywhere from my you
know<00:01:23.060> ten<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.510> fifteen<00:01:23.900> at<00:01:24.440> one<00:01:24.590> stage<00:01:24.830> or

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
know ten to fifteen at one stage or

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.490 
know ten to fifteen at one stage or
another<00:01:25.360> but<00:01:26.360> yeah<00:01:26.540> look<00:01:26.840> at<00:01:26.960> them<00:01:27.080> I<00:01:27.170> want<00:01:27.440> to

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
another but yeah look at them I want to

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.260 
another but yeah look at them I want to
develop<00:01:27.680> myself<00:01:27.890> into<00:01:28.400> a<00:01:28.430> world-class<00:01:28.909> you're

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
develop myself into a world-class you're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.560 
develop myself into a world-class you're
saying<00:01:29.510> that's<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.140> plan<00:01:30.440> I<00:01:31.270> love<00:01:32.270> playing

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
saying that's the plan I love playing

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.780 
saying that's the plan I love playing
ten<00:01:32.780> as<00:01:32.930> well<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.560> think<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:34.250> probably<00:01:34.460> be<00:01:34.670> my

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
ten as well I think that probably be my

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.050 
ten as well I think that probably be my
second<00:01:35.150> position<00:01:35.510> but<00:01:36.080> then<00:01:36.200> twelve<00:01:37.190> as<00:01:37.460> well

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
second position but then twelve as well

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.670 
second position but then twelve as well
I<00:01:38.090> guess<00:01:38.330> wherever<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.960> play<00:01:39.170> it's<00:01:39.380> sort<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.620> a

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
I guess wherever I play it's sort of a

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.740 
I guess wherever I play it's sort of a
very<00:01:39.920> similar<00:01:40.520> game<00:01:40.670> but<00:01:41.090> one<00:01:41.390> thing<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.630> I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
very similar game but one thing that I

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.450 
very similar game but one thing that I
think<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.290> big<00:01:42.560> positive<00:01:42.770> playing<00:01:43.280> over

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
think is a big positive playing over

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.930 
think is a big positive playing over
here<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:45.140> Europeans<00:01:45.830> are<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.580> best<00:01:46.790> of

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
here is the Europeans are the best of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.480 
here is the Europeans are the best of
controlling<00:01:47.299> a<00:01:47.420> game<00:01:47.630> there<00:01:48.020> now<00:01:48.650> there<00:01:49.070> tends

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
controlling a game there now there tends

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.100 
controlling a game there now there tends
always<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.909> sort<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.299> world<00:01:50.510> class<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:50.990> they

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
always a sort of world class and they

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.359 
always a sort of world class and they
fifteens<00:01:51.530> as<00:01:51.680> well<00:01:51.830> they<00:01:52.010> always<00:01:52.159> seem<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
fifteens as well they always seem to

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.770 
fifteens as well they always seem to
make<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.850> right<00:01:53.000> decisions<00:01:53.510> at<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.750> right

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
make the right decisions at the right

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.109 
make the right decisions at the right
time<00:01:54.140> good<00:01:54.530> game<00:01:54.710> management<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.430> is<00:01:55.490> exactly

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
time good game management it is exactly

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.490 
time good game management it is exactly
good<00:01:56.270> game<00:01:56.450> management<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.020> that's<00:01:57.170> where<00:01:57.440> I

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
good game management and that's where I

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.140 
good game management and that's where I
see<00:01:57.710> myself<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.310> need<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.580> improve<00:01:58.670> most

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150
