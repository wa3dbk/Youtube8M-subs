I'm going to show you how you can create
a<00:00:06.030> blade<00:00:06.480> for<00:00:07.290> such<00:00:07.500> sword<00:00:09.709> this<00:00:10.709> blade<00:00:11.009> is

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
a blade for such sword this blade is

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.850 
a blade for such sword this blade is
made<00:00:12.110> out<00:00:13.110> of<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.799> think<00:00:14.190> 16<00:00:14.969> organs<00:00:15.749> and<00:00:16.230> looks

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
made out of I think 16 organs and looks

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:27.550 
made out of I think 16 organs and looks
pretty<00:00:18.050> good<00:00:19.050> when<00:00:22.070> we<00:00:23.070> looked<00:00:23.310> at<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.610> as<00:00:23.940> a

role model and after we apply smooth

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:44.119 
role model and after we apply smooth
modifier<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:38.219> looks<00:00:38.960> great<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:43.129> let's

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
selecting these edges we are going to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.860 
selecting these edges we are going to
set<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.450> creased<00:03:07.200> one<00:03:08.240> this<00:03:09.240> means<00:03:09.540> these

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
set the creased one this means these

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.190 
set the creased one this means these
edges<00:03:10.560> will<00:03:10.830> remain<00:03:11.519> creased<00:03:12.000> after<00:03:12.750> we<00:03:12.900> apply

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
edges will remain creased after we apply

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.000 
edges will remain creased after we apply
a<00:03:13.230> smooth<00:03:13.560> modifier<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:15.410> now<00:03:16.410> we're<00:03:16.680> going

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
a smooth modifier to it now we're going

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:24.520 
a smooth modifier to it now we're going
to<00:03:17.160> make<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:18.680> visible<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:22.280> we<00:03:23.280> are<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.580> to

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
to make this visible and we are going to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.850 
to make this visible and we are going to
deselect<00:03:27.530> these<00:03:29.120> edges<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.540> we<00:03:31.170> are<00:03:31.230> going<00:03:31.530> to

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
deselect these edges and we are going to

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.140 
deselect these edges and we are going to
go<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.670> rest<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.410> space<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.670> we<00:03:38.910> get<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
go the rest to the space so we get a

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.009 
go the rest to the space so we get a
little<00:03:39.540> bit<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.170> depth<00:03:40.470> folder<00:03:41.480> short<00:03:42.480> now

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
little bit of the depth folder short now

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.229 
little bit of the depth folder short now
we<00:03:43.080> are<00:03:43.470> going<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:44.070> leave<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.580> edges<00:03:45.000> selected

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
we are going to leave the edges selected

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.640 
we are going to leave the edges selected
and<00:03:46.010> apply<00:03:47.010> symmetry<00:03:47.880> modifier<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.630> let<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
and apply symmetry modifier to let the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.880 
and apply symmetry modifier to let the
excess<00:03:50.269> and<00:03:51.269> then<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:52.049> are<00:03:52.140> going<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.440> collapse

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
excess and then we are going to collapse

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.910 
excess and then we are going to collapse
it<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:54.680> then<00:03:55.680> we<00:03:56.400> are<00:03:56.459> going<00:03:56.850> to<00:03:57.090> realize<00:03:57.920> we

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
it and then we are going to realize we

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.289 
it and then we are going to realize we
have<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.370> sword<00:04:00.110> created<00:04:01.730> now<00:04:02.730> we<00:04:02.760> can<00:04:03.120> do

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
have the sword created now we can do

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.020 
have the sword created now we can do
some<00:04:03.720> modifications<00:04:04.530> because<00:04:05.190> after<00:04:05.850> we

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
some modifications because after we

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.009 
some modifications because after we
apply<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:07.530> norms<00:04:07.920> smooth<00:04:08.760> modifier<00:04:09.000> to<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.750> we

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
apply the norms smooth modifier to it we

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.510 
apply the norms smooth modifier to it we
can<00:04:10.200> see<00:04:10.560> we

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
can see we

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:23.120 
can see we
a<00:04:12.110> little<00:04:13.110> bit<00:04:13.230> of<00:04:13.610> too<00:04:17.390> wide<00:04:20.900> my<00:04:21.900> taste<00:04:22.260> we're

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
a little bit of too wide my taste we're

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.680 
a little bit of too wide my taste we're
going<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.640> make<00:04:24.570> it<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.870> little<00:04:24.990> bit<00:04:25.310> narrower

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:37.570 

and<00:04:30.690> this<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.170> pretty<00:04:31.950> much<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:33.290> we<00:04:34.290> created

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:50.690 

plate<00:04:42.530> with<00:04:43.530> crisp<00:04:44.310> edges<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:49.250> the<00:04:50.250> top<00:04:50.280> is

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
plate with crisp edges and the top is

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.920 
plate with crisp edges and the top is
not<00:04:50.880> fully<00:04:51.450> pointed<00:04:52.430> but<00:04:53.430> if<00:04:53.730> you<00:04:54.300> would<00:04:54.660> like

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
not fully pointed but if you would like

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.560 
not fully pointed but if you would like
to<00:04:54.960> have<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.590> pointed<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.910> just<00:04:57.150> need<00:04:57.390> to

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
to have it pointed you just need to

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.640 
to have it pointed you just need to
select<00:04:57.750> these<00:04:58.200> edges<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:59.720> set<00:05:00.720> this<00:05:01.140> crease

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
select these edges and set this crease

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.710 
select these edges and set this crease
one<00:05:03.590> this<00:05:04.590> way<00:05:04.920> after<00:05:05.100> we<00:05:05.430> reapply<00:05:06.240> nomes

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
one this way after we reapply nomes

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:13.280 
one this way after we reapply nomes
modifier<00:05:07.320> we<00:05:07.560> get<00:05:09.020> this<00:05:10.020> kind<00:05:10.500> of<00:05:10.650> effect<00:05:12.290> just

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
modifier we get this kind of effect just

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.560 
modifier we get this kind of effect just
pretty<00:05:13.620> cool<00:05:15.590> so<00:05:16.730> this<00:05:17.730> is<00:05:17.850> pretty<00:05:18.090> much<00:05:18.210> it

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
pretty cool so this is pretty much it

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.970 
pretty cool so this is pretty much it
after<00:05:19.170> we<00:05:19.650> create<00:05:19.890> this<00:05:20.490> kind<00:05:20.850> of<00:05:23.810> blade<00:05:24.980> we

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
after we create this kind of blade we

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.110 
after we create this kind of blade we
have<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:26.970> basic<00:05:27.810> knowledge<00:05:27.960> how<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.440> create

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
have the basic knowledge how to create

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.320 
have the basic knowledge how to create
blades<00:05:30.120> for<00:05:30.630> other<00:05:31.110> swords<00:05:31.770> for<00:05:32.700> access<00:05:33.390> and
