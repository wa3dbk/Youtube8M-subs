okay<00:00:02.560> i'm<00:00:02.679> here<00:00:02.949> with<00:00:03.159> the<00:00:03.639> prototype<00:00:04.270> of

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:04.300 
okay i'm here with the prototype of

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.930 
okay i'm here with the prototype of
polynomial<00:00:05.260> now<00:00:05.380> Polly<00:00:05.650> gnome<00:00:05.890> is<00:00:06.129> basically

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:06.940 
polynomial now Polly gnome is basically

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.879 
polynomial now Polly gnome is basically
the<00:00:07.060> metronome<00:00:07.540> that<00:00:07.720> I<00:00:07.750> wanted<00:00:08.200> to<00:00:08.260> own<00:00:08.559> on

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
the metronome that I wanted to own on

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.890 
the metronome that I wanted to own on
the<00:00:09.040> iphone<00:00:09.490> I<00:00:09.730> wrote<00:00:10.300> a<00:00:10.330> program<00:00:10.599> called

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
the iphone I wrote a program called

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.499 
the iphone I wrote a program called
pyramid<00:00:11.440> for<00:00:11.650> mac<00:00:11.830> and<00:00:11.860> pc<00:00:12.190> which<00:00:12.969> did<00:00:13.240> things

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:13.509 
pyramid for mac and pc which did things

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:15.329 
pyramid for mac and pc which did things
i<00:00:13.630> wanted<00:00:13.809> it<00:00:13.929> to<00:00:14.019> do<00:00:14.170> and<00:00:14.410> then<00:00:14.769> i<00:00:14.799> teamed<00:00:15.190> up

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
i wanted it to do and then i teamed up

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:17.580 
i wanted it to do and then i teamed up
with<00:00:15.460> lucas<00:00:15.820> ives<00:00:16.119> to<00:00:16.420> create<00:00:16.720> the<00:00:16.990> iphone<00:00:17.410> app

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
with lucas ives to create the iphone app

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.470 
with lucas ives to create the iphone app
now<00:00:17.770> this<00:00:18.460> is<00:00:18.579> going<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:18.790> be<00:00:18.910> available<00:00:19.180> in<00:00:19.419> the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
now this is going to be available in the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.229 
now this is going to be available in the
App<00:00:19.660> Store<00:00:19.689> very<00:00:20.259> shortly<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.910> I<00:00:21.970> want<00:00:22.149> to

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239 
App Store very shortly and I want to

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.729 
App Store very shortly and I want to
show<00:00:22.360> you<00:00:22.419> some<00:00:22.720> of<00:00:22.750> the<00:00:22.989> things<00:00:23.200> that<00:00:23.529> it<00:00:23.710> can

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:23.739 
show you some of the things that it can

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.650 
show you some of the things that it can
do<00:00:24.040> so<00:00:24.220> if<00:00:25.000> you've<00:00:25.119> checked<00:00:25.300> out<00:00:25.480> the<00:00:25.599> other

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
do so if you've checked out the other

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.479 
do so if you've checked out the other
video<00:00:26.020> you'll<00:00:26.230> know<00:00:26.470> already<00:00:26.950> that<00:00:27.099> you<00:00:27.340> can

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
video you'll know already that you can

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.580 
video you'll know already that you can
cycle<00:00:27.939> through<00:00:27.970> different<00:00:28.570> rates<00:00:28.840> and<00:00:29.140> you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
cycle through different rates and you

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.040 
cycle through different rates and you
can<00:00:29.739> choose<00:00:29.950> any<00:00:30.189> rate<00:00:30.460> between<00:00:30.730> 1<00:00:31.180> and<00:00:31.329> 32<00:00:31.779> so

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
can choose any rate between 1 and 32 so

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.270 
can choose any rate between 1 and 32 so
you<00:00:32.140> can<00:00:32.259> have<00:00:32.410> quintuplets<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.130> they're

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
you can have quintuplets and they're

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.220 
you can have quintuplets and they're
septuplets<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:34.420> can<00:00:34.600> practice<00:00:34.990> different

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
septuplets you can practice different

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.990 
septuplets you can practice different
rates<00:00:35.620> today<00:00:36.460> I'm<00:00:36.580> going<00:00:36.670> to<00:00:36.730> show<00:00:36.910> you

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
rates today I'm going to show you

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.820 
rates today I'm going to show you
something<00:00:37.210> that's<00:00:37.450> probably<00:00:37.780> more<00:00:37.990> useful<00:00:38.320> on

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
something that's probably more useful on

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.230 
something that's probably more useful on
a<00:00:38.890> kind<00:00:39.610> of<00:00:39.760> practice<00:00:40.270> level<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:42.000> if<00:00:43.000> you've

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
a kind of practice level now if you've

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.000 
a kind of practice level now if you've
ever<00:00:43.360> had<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.660> play<00:00:43.840> with<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:43.990> click<00:00:44.260> track<00:00:44.290> you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
ever had to play with a click track you

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.480 
ever had to play with a click track you
know<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.730> it<00:00:46.120> can<00:00:46.150> be<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> challenge<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.490> once

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
know that it can be a challenge and once

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.090 
know that it can be a challenge and once
you<00:00:48.670> feel<00:00:48.940> like<00:00:49.300> you<00:00:50.230> know<00:00:50.350> you've<00:00:50.530> nailed<00:00:50.829> it

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
you feel like you know you've nailed it

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.590 
you feel like you know you've nailed it
and<00:00:51.130> you<00:00:51.370> can<00:00:51.520> really<00:00:51.760> play<00:00:52.060> with<00:00:52.210> a<00:00:52.270> click

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
and you can really play with a click

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.569 
and you can really play with a click
then<00:00:53.050> you<00:00:53.230> might<00:00:53.410> think<00:00:53.620> that<00:00:53.739> your<00:00:53.950> timing<00:00:54.460> is

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
then you might think that your timing is

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.870 
then you might think that your timing is
sorted<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.710> maybe<00:00:56.980> some<00:00:57.250> gigs<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.550> play<00:00:57.730> with

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:57.880 
sorted so maybe some gigs you play with

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.310 
sorted so maybe some gigs you play with
a<00:00:57.910> click<00:00:58.180> some<00:00:58.510> gigs<00:00:58.720> you<00:00:58.810> don't<00:00:58.989> play<00:00:59.140> with<00:00:59.290> a

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
a click some gigs you don't play with a

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.290 
a click some gigs you don't play with a
click<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.739> you<00:01:00.040> feel<00:01:00.280> like<00:01:00.310> you<00:01:01.060> know<00:01:01.149> you're

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
click and you feel like you know you're

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.679 
click and you feel like you know you're
pretty<00:01:01.450> solid<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.770> is<00:01:03.700> kind<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.089> how<00:01:04.210> I<00:01:04.239> felt

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
pretty solid this is kind of how I felt

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.260 
pretty solid this is kind of how I felt
until<00:01:05.079> I<00:01:05.110> tested<00:01:05.650> this<00:01:05.800> out<00:01:06.010> okay<00:01:06.490> so<00:01:07.090> what

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
until I tested this out okay so what

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.080 
until I tested this out okay so what
I've<00:01:07.390> got<00:01:07.600> is<00:01:07.900> I'm<00:01:08.170> going<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.440> program<00:01:08.860> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
I've got is I'm going to program in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.870 
I've got is I'm going to program in
three<00:01:10.090> bars<00:01:10.360> of<00:01:10.770> eighth<00:01:11.770> notes<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.430> then<00:01:12.670> a

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
three bars of eighth notes and then a

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.200 
three bars of eighth notes and then a
bar<00:01:13.180> of<00:01:13.210> rest<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.770> this<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.909> way<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.090> choose

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
bar of rest so this is the way I choose

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.180 
bar of rest so this is the way I choose
to<00:01:16.540> practice<00:01:16.720> now<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.409> to<00:01:17.650> have<00:01:17.799> a<00:01:17.830> click<00:01:18.159> track

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
to practice now is to have a click track

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.730 
to practice now is to have a click track
there<00:01:19.030> some<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.390> time<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.840> not<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.590> rest

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
there some of the time and not the rest

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.200 
there some of the time and not the rest
of<00:01:20.890> the<00:01:20.950> time<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.310> then<00:01:21.400> you<00:01:21.520> can<00:01:21.700> see<00:01:21.940> how

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
of the time and then you can see how

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.240 
of the time and then you can see how
good<00:01:22.420> your<00:01:22.540> timing<00:01:23.049> is<00:01:23.140> when<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.860> training

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
good your timing is when the training

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.550 
good your timing is when the training
wheels<00:01:24.370> are<00:01:24.549> taken<00:01:24.850> off<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.659> first<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.409> all

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
wheels are taken off so first of all

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.860 
wheels are taken off so first of all
just<00:01:26.909> count<00:01:27.909> along<00:01:28.120> with<00:01:28.330> this<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.659> see<00:01:28.780> if

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
just count along with this and see if

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.160 
just count along with this and see if
you<00:01:28.960> can<00:01:29.140> clap<00:01:29.560> on<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.860> one<00:01:31.799> two<00:01:33.840> three<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.049> on

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
you can clap on the one two three and on

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.899 
you can clap on the one two three and on
the<00:01:35.290> bar<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.590> rest<00:01:35.860> for<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.310> you've<00:01:39.460> seen<00:01:39.670> how

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
the bar of rest for so you've seen how

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:48.660 
the bar of rest for so you've seen how
accurately<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.570> can<00:01:40.690> nail<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.770> one<00:01:46.619> okay<00:01:47.670> so

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
accurately you can nail the one okay so

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.510 
accurately you can nail the one okay so
that's<00:01:49.330> a<00:01:49.510> good<00:01:49.750> click<00:01:50.680> track<00:01:50.979> to<00:01:51.159> practice

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
that's a good click track to practice

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.670 
that's a good click track to practice
along<00:01:51.790> any<00:01:52.119> kind<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.540> rudiments<00:01:53.110> or<00:01:53.260> grooves

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
along any kind of rudiments or grooves

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.080 
along any kind of rudiments or grooves
or<00:01:53.950> whatever<00:01:54.250> you<00:01:54.369> would<00:01:54.460> normally<00:01:54.670> do<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.060> a

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
or whatever you would normally do to a

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.390 
or whatever you would normally do to a
click<00:01:55.390> just<00:01:55.990> plan<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.439> a<00:01:56.619> click<00:01:56.920> with<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.130> bar<00:01:57.369> of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
click just plan to a click with a bar of

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.719 
click just plan to a click with a bar of
rest<00:01:57.759> in<00:01:57.909> there<00:01:58.119> really<00:01:58.810> helps<00:01:59.229> to<00:01:59.520> make<00:02:00.520> you

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
rest in there really helps to make you

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.490 
rest in there really helps to make you
kind<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.090> more<00:02:01.270> confident<00:02:01.810> with<00:02:01.930> your<00:02:02.080> timing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
kind of more confident with your timing

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.130 
kind of more confident with your timing
so<00:02:03.369> one<00:02:03.909> that<00:02:04.060> I've<00:02:04.210> been<00:02:04.360> doing<00:02:04.540> is<00:02:04.900> going

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
so one that I've been doing is going

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.870 
so one that I've been doing is going
three<00:02:05.560> bars<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.890> eighth<00:02:06.070> notes<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.549> then<00:02:06.820> a

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
three bars of eighth notes and then a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.910 
three bars of eighth notes and then a
bar<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.150> rest<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.720> then<00:02:08.140> two<00:02:08.379> bars<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.739> eighth

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
bar of rest and then two bars of eighth

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.640 
bar of rest and then two bars of eighth
notes<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.459> two<00:02:09.729> bars<00:02:09.969> of<00:02:10.060> rest<00:02:10.359> then<00:02:11.109> one<00:02:11.439> bar

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
notes and two bars of rest then one bar

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.830 
notes and two bars of rest then one bar
of<00:02:11.680> eighth<00:02:11.919> note<00:02:12.189> and<00:02:12.370> three<00:02:12.969> bars<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.299> rest<00:02:13.569> so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
of eighth note and three bars of rest so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.630 
of eighth note and three bars of rest so
I'm<00:02:14.499> going<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.650> try<00:02:14.829> and<00:02:14.919> play<00:02:15.159> along

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
I'm going to try and play along

00:02:15.640 --> 00:03:08.160 
I'm going to try and play along
with<00:02:15.880> this<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.870> one<00:02:17.260> two<00:02:17.890> three<00:02:18.400> four<00:03:06.959> ok<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.019> I

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
with this so one two three four ok so I

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.040 
with this so one two three four ok so I
suck<00:03:08.530> at<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.390> second<00:03:10.750> take<00:03:10.900> of

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
suck at that this is the second take of

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.509 
suck at that this is the second take of
this<00:03:11.140> video<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.620> first<00:03:11.830> tech<00:03:12.040> I<00:03:12.160> did<00:03:12.340> much

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
this video and the first tech I did much

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.240 
this video and the first tech I did much
better<00:03:13.590> if<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.709> want<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.920> make<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.160> even

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
better if you want to make it even

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.360 
better if you want to make it even
harder<00:03:15.580> then<00:03:16.180> after<00:03:16.840> your<00:03:17.290> one<00:03:17.739> bar<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.010> click

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
harder then after your one bar of click

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.690 
harder then after your one bar of click
and<00:03:18.519> three<00:03:18.760> bars<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.090> rest<00:03:19.360> add<00:03:20.280> four<00:03:21.280> bars<00:03:21.519> of

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
and three bars of rest add four bars of

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.960 
and three bars of rest add four bars of
rest<00:03:21.970> so<00:03:22.209> one<00:03:22.690> two<00:03:23.110> three<00:03:23.590> four<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.700> now<00:03:24.820> we've

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
rest so one two three four so now we've

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.180 
rest so one two three four so now we've
got<00:03:25.120> three<00:03:25.390> eighths<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.870> rest<00:03:26.110> 28<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:26.980> two

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
got three eighths and a rest 28 and two

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.390 
got three eighths and a rest 28 and two
rests<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.760> then<00:03:27.970> 18<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.780> seven<00:03:29.470> rests<00:03:29.860> so

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
rests and then 18 and seven rests so

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.830 
rests and then 18 and seven rests so
let's<00:03:30.970> see<00:03:31.180> how<00:03:31.209> far<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.570> can<00:03:31.720> get<00:03:32.350> this<00:03:32.470> one<00:03:33.840> 134

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
let's see how far I can get this one 134

00:03:34.840 --> 00:04:08.910 
let's see how far I can get this one 134
22

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.980 

okay<00:04:09.920> so<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.220> wasn't<00:04:10.370> too<00:04:10.670> bad<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.810> weird

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
okay so that wasn't too bad the weird

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.660 
okay so that wasn't too bad the weird
thing<00:04:12.350> is<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.650> first<00:04:12.890> few<00:04:13.100> times<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.460> play

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
thing is the first few times you play

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.840 
thing is the first few times you play
along<00:04:13.940> with<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:14.300> it<00:04:14.840> feels<00:04:15.140> so<00:04:15.580> strange<00:04:16.580> when

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
along with this it feels so strange when

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.250 
along with this it feels so strange when
they<00:04:16.970> click<00:04:17.210> disappears<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.870> suddenly

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
they click disappears and suddenly

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.350 
they click disappears and suddenly
you're<00:04:18.410> really<00:04:18.860> aware<00:04:19.130> of<00:04:19.190> what<00:04:19.760> you're<00:04:19.910> doing

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
you're really aware of what you're doing

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.120 
you're really aware of what you're doing
and<00:04:20.480> you<00:04:20.570> question<00:04:20.810> everything<00:04:21.110> so<00:04:21.920> it's<00:04:22.070> a

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
and you question everything so it's a

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.100 
and you question everything so it's a
really<00:04:22.310> nice<00:04:22.520> way<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.880> test<00:04:23.330> different<00:04:23.690> ways

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
really nice way to test different ways

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.170 
really nice way to test different ways
of<00:04:24.290> staying<00:04:24.530> in<00:04:24.680> time<00:04:24.980> perhaps<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.790> singing

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
of staying in time perhaps you singing

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.730 
of staying in time perhaps you singing
sixteenth<00:04:26.630> notes<00:04:26.930> or<00:04:27.110> you<00:04:27.200> can't<00:04:27.470> hang<00:04:27.620> out

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
sixteenth notes or you can't hang out

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.800 
sixteenth notes or you can't hang out
lied<00:04:27.980> or<00:04:28.310> you're<00:04:28.460> singing<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.850> baseline<00:04:29.390> you

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
lied or you're singing a baseline you

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.210 
lied or you're singing a baseline you
can<00:04:29.960> try<00:04:30.200> all<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:30.560> those<00:04:30.890> different

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
can try all this those different

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.010 
can try all this those different
approaches<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.910> see<00:04:32.090> which<00:04:32.300> one<00:04:32.540> tends<00:04:32.870> to

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
approaches and see which one tends to

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.170 
approaches and see which one tends to
bring<00:04:33.170> you<00:04:33.380> in<00:04:33.500> time<00:04:33.740> more<00:04:34.430> often<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:34.910> then

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
bring you in time more often and then

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.270 
bring you in time more often and then
after<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:35.480> while<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.750> doing<00:04:36.200> this<00:04:36.380> you'll<00:04:37.100> get

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
after a while of doing this you'll get

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.010 
after a while of doing this you'll get
more<00:04:37.490> and<00:04:37.610> more<00:04:37.670> confident<00:04:38.180> with<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.630> then

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
more and more confident with it and then

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.200 
more and more confident with it and then
you<00:04:39.590> know<00:04:39.710> your<00:04:40.010> sense<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.490> internal<00:04:41.000> time

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
you know your sense of internal time

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.940 
you know your sense of internal time
will<00:04:41.480> be<00:04:41.660> really<00:04:42.530> strong<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.120> that's

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
will be really strong so that's

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.470 
will be really strong so that's
