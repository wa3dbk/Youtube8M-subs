00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
in one in pool play we're in a bit of a

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.860 
in one in pool play we're in a bit of a
pickle<00:05:21.280> because<00:05:21.520> we<00:05:21.970> need<00:05:22.150> other<00:05:22.360> teams<00:05:22.660> to

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
pickle because we need other teams to

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.480 
pickle because we need other teams to
win<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.169> lose<00:05:23.200> and<00:05:23.650> if<00:05:23.770> they<00:05:23.919> don't<00:05:24.130> we<00:05:24.370> could

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
win and lose and if they don't we could

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.070 
win and lose and if they don't we could
be<00:05:24.640> out<00:05:24.760> of<00:05:24.789> pool<00:05:25.180> play<00:05:25.419> which<00:05:25.630> doesn't<00:05:25.960> make

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
be out of pool play which doesn't make

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.020 
be out of pool play which doesn't make
sense<00:05:26.350> cuz<00:05:26.530> we<00:05:26.650> beat<00:05:26.830> denial<00:05:27.160> but<00:05:27.940> we

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
sense cuz we beat denial but we

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.340 
sense cuz we beat denial but we
shouldn't<00:05:28.240> lost<00:05:28.479> our<00:05:28.630> first<00:05:28.840> match<00:05:29.050> so<00:05:29.320> I

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
shouldn't lost our first match so I

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.800 
shouldn't lost our first match so I
guess<00:05:29.590> it<00:05:29.770> uh<00:05:29.919> feedback<00:05:30.729> though<00:05:31.060> came<00:05:31.479> back<00:05:31.660> to

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810

close<00:06:39.310> but<00:06:39.520> we<00:06:39.610> ended<00:06:39.850> up<00:06:39.940> pulling<00:06:40.389> it<00:06:40.630> out<00:06:40.780> and

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
close but we ended up pulling it out and

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.680 
close but we ended up pulling it out and
we<00:06:41.979> got<00:06:42.010> the<00:06:42.190> first<00:06:42.550> seed<00:06:42.820> somehow<00:06:43.419> I<00:06:43.630> don't

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:43.690 
we got the first seed somehow I don't

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.120

know<00:06:43.960> our<00:06:44.199> match<00:06:44.380> against<00:06:44.680> denial<00:06:44.949> was

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
know our match against denial was

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.680

absolutely<00:06:45.610> huge<00:06:45.850> to<00:06:46.180> think<00:06:46.210> that<00:06:46.479> we<00:06:46.600> were

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
absolutely huge to think that we were

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.450 
absolutely huge to think that we were
one<00:06:46.810> map<00:06:46.990> away<00:06:47.229> from<00:06:47.440> not<00:06:47.560> even<00:06:47.680> advancing<00:06:48.280> so

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:48.460 
one map away from not even advancing so

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.060 
one map away from not even advancing so
