bridge<00:03:01.620> let's<00:03:02.130> say<00:03:03.530> problem<00:03:04.530> um<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.910> has

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
bridge let's say problem um it has

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.350 
bridge let's say problem um it has
something<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.630> with<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.880> PSP<00:03:08.880> go<00:03:09.060> has

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360

just<00:03:09.690> 32<00:03:10.290> MB<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.769> RAM<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.760> can't<00:03:12.000> probably

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
just 32 MB in RAM so it can't probably

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.250 
just 32 MB in RAM so it can't probably
display<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.380> cutscenes<00:03:14.750> but<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.870> should<00:03:16.080> work
