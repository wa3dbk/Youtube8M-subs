00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.949
 three instruments on stage accompanied the musicians of the region 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.989
 the matter that has become today mascate he presented his show to 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:23.080
 put on the sidelines at the last festival the star of the league 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.849
 by chance to make 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.190
 many projects and then to sing more and more we do 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.530
 there I met the lyricists 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.660
 here it is that mourinho really pushed 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.890
 their age sing 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.450
 even if I try to help voices there I started the little by little actually 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.210
 at 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.780
 portrait 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.830
 gold this story 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.180
 then over time this is actually done things a little bit outdated 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.180
 and 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.100
 that and then it's really there it's really happiness code to sing 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 to his own songs in the scales 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.800
 looking to see 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 jean-marie messier 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.460
 my desire to sing 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.250
 since I am a violinist 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.660
 of my desire to sing a year of a concert of female bobby mac 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.310
 what i saw at marciac at jazz in marciac and that's all it was for me 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.060
 a really a revelation 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.190
 dede 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.700
 in eurocup to have fun with the voice 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.610
 on the menu to use it also as an instrument the sca is not there since 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.110
 c 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.150
 here is the use of the aids 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.700
 of victory without words 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.120
 but since it's true that the press 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.030
 but precisely the relation to the text for me is even more interesting 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.030
 since there is a little this meeting of research of sounds 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.009
 as for suicides in words 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.619
 and for me it's really very important 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:20.399
 so here is the l but also the notion of jazz since I studied jazz 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.759
 at the beginning 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.309
 but at the conservatory in Strasbourg is also 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.309
 in didier lockwood school 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.599
 we did a series of concerts that were them I was great was not 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.949
 evening to the white horse it was complete too and here 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.419
 and I saw I need the songs live first on stage I know it 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.059
 are there a lot of people who 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.639
 vicky customers are waiting 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.639
 not really this album me too 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.429
 in euros to the cheek and I take the time 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.879
 johann morant rare 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.489
 I try to make myself as much fun on stage maybe I'm getting 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.209
 pleasure singing in the shower 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.289
 gold time presses 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.399
 to precisely not ask the question 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.929
 what's the style of what's the most law I'm trying to make a song 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.929
 French more positive in celebration 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.039
 then we talked 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.039
 to the grimace 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.559
 what's the point 

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:33.999
 curdled at the movie a song who's who who says let me snorkel because 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.620
 that it's for me it's really 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.550
 precisely this is 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.610
 it's a kind of bubble 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.240
 here it is that let slip also be carried by a 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.240
 why not the element 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.660
 the file fijais at the site want to make songs that runs songs that 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.430
 heels 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.509
 then he made who sees there 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:56.509
 magazine thank you thank you 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.439
 I have no bad memories from 4 pm to 6 pm in the town hall 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:27.170
 think of the moment 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.059
 the Russian press 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:29.189
 for the moment 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.020
 it was really laden happiness to play at the festival bass-zorn'live 

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:37.559
 We were really pleased 7% is a great welcome 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:39.490
 the audience is warm 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.600
 many more for a first part like that finally it's really 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:43.819
 pleasure 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:47.009
 throwing his advisers that the TV must warn is not sterile 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:50.770
 and legal assistance that allowed him to paradise the mark n 13 deviated 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.480
 and more 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.379
 all these years 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.869
 we must go back to the ranking 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:59.329
 the judgment was created to imitate the voice of all his festive 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.900
 using an instrument for me 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.449
 it's the music that has to talk 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.400
 but it's true that what's new to me is really the 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.300
 the meeting with the text but these six months but kate also now it's from 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.750
 have to wash I have the chance to work and excellent lyricist so 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.919
 it's also here 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.870
 is that happiness a warm welcome of happiness find on the 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.309
 Western coast 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:29.309
 everything is for you 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.029
