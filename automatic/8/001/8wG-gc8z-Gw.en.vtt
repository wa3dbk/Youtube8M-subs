00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.870 
disintegrated the targets hey that was a
fun<00:03:32.820> theory<00:03:33.120> right<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.140> all<00:03:34.350> nope<00:03:35.280> now<00:03:35.820> we

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
fun theory right is that all nope now we

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.230 
fun theory right is that all nope now we
have<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.180> look<00:03:36.420> at<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.750> evidence<00:03:37.050> against<00:03:37.770> it

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
have to look at the evidence against it

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.910 
have to look at the evidence against it
okay<00:03:39.240> first<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.630> all<00:03:39.780> how<00:03:40.350> do<00:03:40.410> we<00:03:40.650> know<00:03:40.890> that

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
okay first of all how do we know that

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.980 
okay first of all how do we know that
the<00:03:41.250> stormtroopers<00:03:41.820> didn't<00:03:42.060> interrogate<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
the stormtroopers didn't interrogate the

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.020 
the stormtroopers didn't interrogate the
Lars<00:03:43.230> they<00:03:43.950> could<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:44.280> asked<00:03:44.580> questions

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
Lars they could have asked questions

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.640 
Lars they could have asked questions
before<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:45.570> weren't<00:03:45.840> satisfied<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.530> they

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
before and weren't satisfied so they

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.560 
before and weren't satisfied so they
killed<00:03:46.890> them<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.340> mean<00:03:47.940> telling<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
killed them I mean telling the

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.000 
killed them I mean telling the
stormtroopers<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.440> they<00:03:49.590> bought<00:03:49.800> the

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
stormtroopers that they bought the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.920 
stormtroopers that they bought the
droids<00:03:50.280> we're<00:03:51.030> going<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.330> wipe<00:03:51.720> their

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
droids we're going to wipe their

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.300 
droids we're going to wipe their
memories<00:03:52.050> and<00:03:52.290> now<00:03:52.770> that<00:03:52.950> they're<00:03:53.130> gone

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
memories and now that they're gone

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.370 
memories and now that they're gone
without<00:03:54.270> that<00:03:54.600> they<00:03:54.720> were<00:03:54.780> too<00:03:55.020> happy<00:03:55.350> about

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
without that they were too happy about

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.070 
without that they were too happy about
that<00:03:56.030> also<00:03:57.030> I<00:03:57.180> don't<00:03:57.270> think<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.720> matters<00:03:58.050> that

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
that also I don't think it matters that

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.170 
that also I don't think it matters that
Vader's<00:03:58.470> knew<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:59.070> Lara's<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.670> past

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
Vader's knew the Lara's in the past

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.030 
Vader's knew the Lara's in the past
I<00:04:00.209> mean<00:04:00.420> Vader<00:04:00.720> isn't<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.200> nicest<00:04:01.590> guy<00:04:01.800> around

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
I mean Vader isn't the nicest guy around

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.620 
I mean Vader isn't the nicest guy around
heck<00:04:02.400> he<00:04:02.550> might<00:04:02.700> have<00:04:02.790> even<00:04:02.910> been<00:04:03.030> mad<00:04:03.300> at<00:04:03.330> them

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
heck he might have even been mad at them

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.420 
heck he might have even been mad at them
I<00:04:03.870> mean<00:04:04.110> they<00:04:04.260> were<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.650> family<00:04:05.070> that<00:04:05.100> bought

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
I mean they were the family that bought

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.800 
I mean they were the family that bought
his<00:04:05.640> mother<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.090> then<00:04:06.209> she<00:04:06.390> got<00:04:06.510> killed<00:04:06.720> by

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
his mother and then she got killed by

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.580 
his mother and then she got killed by
the<00:04:06.870> rare<00:04:07.080> so<00:04:07.459> maybe<00:04:08.459> he's<00:04:08.730> upset<00:04:09.090> at<00:04:09.240> them<00:04:09.590> and

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
the rare so maybe he's upset at them and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.530 
the rare so maybe he's upset at them and
lasted<00:04:11.280> most<00:04:11.520> certainly<00:04:11.880> not<00:04:12.060> least<00:04:12.360> just

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
lasted most certainly not least just

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.300 
lasted most certainly not least just
because<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.020> stormtroopers<00:04:13.620> aren't<00:04:13.860> great

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
because the stormtroopers aren't great

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.000 
because the stormtroopers aren't great
shot<00:04:14.760> doesn't<00:04:15.239> mean<00:04:15.450> they<00:04:15.660> can't<00:04:16.020> be<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.560> mean

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
shot doesn't mean they can't be I mean

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.949 
shot doesn't mean they can't be I mean
they<00:04:17.160> have<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.370> rule<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.850> Empire<00:04:17.880> somehow<00:04:18.660> and

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
they have to rule the Empire somehow and

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.050 
they have to rule the Empire somehow and
that<00:04:19.350> doesn't<00:04:19.739> mean<00:04:19.859> they<00:04:20.100> can't<00:04:20.400> be<00:04:20.520> precise

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
that doesn't mean they can't be precise

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.090 
that doesn't mean they can't be precise
maybe<00:04:21.690> they're<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:21.960> camera<00:04:22.530> shy<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.979> they

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
maybe they're just camera shy and they

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.230 
maybe they're just camera shy and they
shoot<00:04:23.340> better<00:04:23.520> when<00:04:23.729> we<00:04:23.880> aren't<00:04:24.090> watching

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
shoot better when we aren't watching

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.439 
shoot better when we aren't watching
them<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.930> know

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
them you know

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:27.930 
them you know
this<00:04:25.840> theory<00:04:26.350> is<00:04:26.650> kind<00:04:27.010> of<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.190> toss-up<00:04:27.460> for<00:04:27.820> me

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
this theory is kind of a toss-up for me

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.030 
this theory is kind of a toss-up for me
I'm<00:04:28.360> battling<00:04:28.750> what<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:28.960> want<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.560> believe<00:04:29.830> in

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
what I think is more logical well I'll
