the game that you're playing today now
this<00:00:59.579> leads<00:00:59.789> me<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> believe<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.359> Rockstar

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this leads me to believe that Rockstar

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.869 
this leads me to believe that Rockstar
is<00:01:01.199> either<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.620> planning<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.520> adding<00:01:02.730> more

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
