00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Developer's Notebook 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 New gameplay 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 This project required us to deploy our best collaborators to design new graphics and control systems. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 We faced a difficult task. We didn't just want a little improvement. As for the quality of gaming experience, we wanted to make a good leap forward. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Improved graphics 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 The graphics have gone a long way. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 Almost every aspect of visual appearance has been redesigned from the ground up. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 The two main themes we focused on were the graphics 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 both the aircraft themselves and the umbrella framework, which unites it all and then is more united. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 One of the main added aspects is working with CCTV. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 The aim was to allow the cameras to display the beautiful designs of the aircraft in the game, but without the dueling operation. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 And at the same time, we hope that the game experience will deepen. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 You can already see really advanced shading on planes. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 As a result, different types of metal can be recognized because each reflects light differently. 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 The planes to be painted will now really look painted. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 Unpainted aircraft will have a light metallic color. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 We want players to feel like flying. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 From history 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 Wood and fabrics were used to produce the first aircraft. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
 In the construction of aircraft hulls, these materials have long been indispensable. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 However, during the First World War, German engineers were able to produce a metal plane. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
 This breakthrough is attributed to German metallurgist Alfred Wilm, who invented a dural alloy. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 The plane became lighter, but a new problem came: corrosion. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 The solution appeared in the 1920s in the United States. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 Dural was covered with a thin layer of pure aluminum to prevent corrosion. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 Metal structures completely pushed out wooden models. 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Players will feel that the flight is more realistic, dynamic and exciting, helping them to dive into these dangerous steel birds. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 New game control 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
 Another feature we've been working on over the past few months is the control system. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 We knew we had some problems. First, we had to make it easier for people who didn't play World of Warplanes and want to start playing and having fun right away. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 Therefore, many specialists have repeatedly tested various prototypes. Some of our experiments didn't get into alpha or beta testing. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 And testing was really a lot. We've done a lot of experiments to find the best possible control and flight physics system. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 From history 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
 The first "balancing" system for aircraft was introduced by German engineer Otto Lilienthal. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 Adjustments on his glider were done by moving the pilot's body. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 Its weight was about 75% of the aircraft's total weight. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Otto's first "flight" therefore ran with crouched legs. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
 This simple operation has been replaced by mechanical over time. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Rudder was supplemented with rudder, but tilting was achieved by slope wings. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
 Later, directional wings appeared. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 All the elements of the glider were controlled by the pilot with the help of the levers and drawbar system. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 However, the growth in speed and size of the combat aircraft required the development of a more comprehensive control system. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
 The pilot's physical capabilities were complemented by various gains. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 Various systems have emerged to help the pilot at critical moments, such as "automatic dive-down". 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 This led to the creation of an automated control system, which made the process much easier. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 However, all control still depends entirely on the pilot's personal performance. It depends on his abilities, experience and intuition. 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 In the current version, there is a predictive function between the player and the flight interface. 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 This mechanism monitors all the details that a very experienced pilot must pay attention to, allowing the player to perform complex acrobatic maneuvers relatively easily. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 The new control system includes two modes: duel and attack. 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
 The main difference is the autopilot behavior and the camera settings that show the battlefield and the plane itself. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Combat mode allows the most versatile control. According to the player's wishes, bulls, balls and so on can be performed. 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 It is easy to see and the controls are decent. The goal is fast but precise maneuvers. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000
 The combat mode allows acrobatics by simplifying the pilot's demands without, however, limiting overall control. 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 When you switch to Attack mode, both the preview and control will be changed to emphasize other game features. 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 The camera switches to view from under the fuselage of the aircraft, providing a suitable perspective for ground target attacks. Terrain and targets are then much better recognized. 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 The attack mode is specifically designed for low-altitude flights and missile, bomb and gun targeting. It is quite a different game in this mode. 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000
 This feature provides a slightly different sense of automatic piloting. It helps to steer the plane more gently. 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 We want the player to focus on hitting the target instead of minor adjustments that would be necessary in a real plane. As a player, you are also a pilot, shooter and bombardier. 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Control is now more elegant than before. Whether you are pursuing an enemy or flying low and slow in an attack on a ground target, the perception of the entire control of the aircraft has changed fundamentally.
