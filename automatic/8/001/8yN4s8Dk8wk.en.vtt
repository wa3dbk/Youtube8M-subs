I'm<00:03:45.790> quite<00:03:45.970> pale<00:03:46.210> at<00:03:46.360> moments<00:03:46.690> when<00:03:46.720> we<00:03:46.870> use<00:03:47.080> my

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
Kevyn Aucoin sculpting powder in the

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.480 
Kevyn Aucoin sculpting powder in the
color<00:03:49.210> medium<00:03:49.390> it's<00:03:50.230> kind<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.590> more<00:03:50.920> grayish

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
color medium it's kind of more grayish

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.310 
color medium it's kind of more grayish
and<00:03:51.910> when<00:03:52.240> I'm<00:03:52.360> Taylor<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.960> want<00:03:53.140> it<00:03:53.200> to

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
and when I'm Taylor and I want it to

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.930 
and when I'm Taylor and I want it to
actually<00:03:53.500> look<00:03:53.860> like<00:03:53.890> real<00:03:54.220> cheekbones<00:03:54.820> I

actually look like real cheekbones I

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.310 
actually look like real cheekbones I
think<00:03:55.120> using<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.570> grey<00:03:55.750> is<00:03:55.900> better<00:03:56.110> because

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
think using a grey is better because

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.880 
think using a grey is better because
that<00:03:56.590> mimics<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.010> actual<00:03:57.630> naturally<00:03:58.630> but<00:03:59.620> the

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
color the naturally occurs when you do

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.180 
color the naturally occurs when you do

the powder sculpting powder just

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.079 
the powder sculpting powder just
underneath<00:06:23.599> my<00:06:23.749> bottom<00:06:24.619> lip<00:06:24.770> here<00:06:25.069> to<00:06:25.789> make<00:06:25.939> my

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:26.089 
underneath my bottom lip here to make my

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:28.089 
underneath my bottom lip here to make my
lip<00:06:26.330> look<00:06:26.599> more<00:06:26.809> pouty<00:06:27.110> which<00:06:27.589> sounds<00:06:27.919> crazy

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
lip look more pouty which sounds crazy

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.019 
lip look more pouty which sounds crazy
but<00:06:29.379> if<00:06:30.379> my<00:06:30.589> lip<00:06:30.860> was<00:06:31.099> my<00:06:31.520> bottom<00:06:31.789> it<00:06:31.909> was

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
but if my lip was my bottom it was

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:33.579 
but if my lip was my bottom it was
bigger<00:06:32.270> it<00:06:32.479> would<00:06:32.599> cause<00:06:32.809> more<00:06:33.139> of<00:06:33.259> a<00:06:33.349> shadow

00:06:33.579 --> 00:06:33.589 
bigger it would cause more of a shadow

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.189 
bigger it would cause more of a shadow
so<00:06:34.399> by<00:06:34.580> creating<00:06:35.059> that<00:06:35.210> shadow<00:06:35.270> you're

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
so by creating that shadow you're

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:37.359 
so by creating that shadow you're
creating<00:06:36.499> the<00:06:36.589> illusion<00:06:36.710> that<00:06:36.889> you<00:06:37.009> do<00:06:37.189> have<00:06:37.339> a

00:06:37.359 --> 00:06:37.369 
creating the illusion that you do have a

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:48.040 
creating the illusion that you do have a
fuller<00:06:37.639> bottom<00:06:37.789> lip<00:06:38.979> and<00:06:39.979> blend

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050
