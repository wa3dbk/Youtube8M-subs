00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
it only heats the part of the pot that

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.390 
it only heats the part of the pot that
is<00:05:37.780> magnetic<00:05:38.500> so<00:05:38.650> everything<00:05:39.129> else<00:05:39.310> stays

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
is magnetic so everything else stays

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:47.820 
is magnetic so everything else stays
cool<00:05:39.879> so<00:05:40.270> watch<00:05:40.449> this<00:05:45.240> now<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.569> just<00:05:46.629> eats<00:05:47.379> the

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
cool so watch this now it just eats the

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.559 
cool so watch this now it just eats the
back<00:05:48.009> that<00:05:48.220> is<00:05:48.250> part<00:05:48.580> of<00:05:48.729> the<00:05:48.849> pot<00:05:49.090> this<00:05:49.509> is

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:49.569 
back that is part of the pot this is

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.140 
back that is part of the pot this is
that<00:05:49.810> one<00:05:50.020> time<00:05:50.259> you<00:05:51.069> can<00:05:51.220> leave<00:05:51.430> it<00:05:51.550> at<00:05:51.669> 110

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
that one time you can leave it at 110

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.210 
that one time you can leave it at 110
and<00:05:52.479> it<00:05:52.780> will<00:05:52.930> get<00:05:53.080> sloppy<00:05:53.379> and<00:05:53.830> what<00:05:53.979> get
