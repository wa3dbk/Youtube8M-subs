lately I have noticed a whooshing sound

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.299 
lately I have noticed a whooshing sound
which<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.550> have<00:00:08.639> come<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.940> discover<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
which we have come to discover is the

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.009 
which we have come to discover is the
driver<00:00:11.309> side<00:00:11.550> we<00:00:11.790> are<00:00:11.820> wheel<00:00:12.030> bearing<00:00:12.450> which

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
driver side we are wheel bearing which

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.799 
driver side we are wheel bearing which
is<00:00:13.170> loose<00:00:13.349> bad<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:14.730> today<00:00:15.509> we're<00:00:15.630> going<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is loose bad so today we're going to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.150 
is loose bad so today we're going to
change<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.310> okay<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.869> have<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.320> wheel<00:00:19.920> off

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
change it okay so we have the wheel off

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.250 
change it okay so we have the wheel off
and<00:00:20.580> we're<00:00:21.060> up<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.359> jack<00:00:21.630> stands<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:22.140> it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and we're up on jack stands so it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.880 
and we're up on jack stands so it's
pretty<00:00:22.439> safe<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.890> secure<00:00:24.439> next<00:00:25.439> thing<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.740> do

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
pretty safe and secure next thing to do

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.660 
pretty safe and secure next thing to do
is<00:00:26.720> to<00:00:27.720> take<00:00:28.289> off<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.740> brake<00:00:29.039> caliper<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
is to take off the brake caliper and the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.400 
is to take off the brake caliper and the
rotor<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:32.570> then<00:00:33.570> we'll<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.870> into<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
rotor and then we'll get into the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.979 
rotor and then we'll get into the
bearing<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.950> sitting<00:00:35.190> behind<00:00:35.309> there<00:00:35.989> okay

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
bearing just sitting behind there okay

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.959 
bearing just sitting behind there okay
so<00:00:37.380> here's<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> brake<00:00:38.160> rotor<00:00:38.399> with<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
so here's the brake rotor with the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.510 
so here's the brake rotor with the
caliper<00:00:39.390> off<00:00:39.739> caliper<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.070> suspended

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
caliper off caliper is now suspended

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.240 
caliper off caliper is now suspended
from<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.940> coat<00:00:42.239> hanger<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.770> the<00:00:43.770> suspension

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
from a coat hanger in the suspension

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.500 
from a coat hanger in the suspension
just<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.760> doesn't<00:00:45.090> hang<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
just so that it doesn't hang on the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.049 
just so that it doesn't hang on the
hydraulic<00:00:45.899> hoses<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> next<00:00:47.820> thing<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
hydraulic hoses the next thing that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.549 
hydraulic hoses the next thing that
it'll<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.329> take<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.780> rotor<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.320> see

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it'll be take off the rotor and see

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
it'll be take off the rotor and see
what's<00:00:49.710> behind<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.690> okay<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.940> now<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.000> have<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
what's behind it okay so now we have the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.139 
what's behind it okay so now we have the
bearing<00:00:54.629> exposed<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.590> have<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> undo<00:00:56.879> four

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
bearing exposed we have to undo four

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.630 
bearing exposed we have to undo four
bolts<00:01:00.440> and<00:01:01.440> they're<00:01:01.770> ten<00:01:01.949> millimeter<00:01:02.340> bolts

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
bolts and they're ten millimeter bolts

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.530 
bolts and they're ten millimeter bolts
and<00:01:04.070> okay<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.549> those<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.180> four<00:01:06.390> bolts

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
and okay so those are the four bolts

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.410 
and okay so those are the four bolts
that<00:01:06.930> came<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.650> bearing<00:01:08.119> so<00:01:09.119> now<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
that came out of the bearing so now it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.270 
that came out of the bearing so now it
is<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.720> attached<00:01:10.610> in<00:01:11.610> any<00:01:12.170> significant<00:01:13.170> way

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
is not attached in any significant way

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.969 
is not attached in any significant way
however<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.670> may<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.939> quite<00:01:15.390> stuck<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.740> may

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
however it may be quite stuck so we may

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.859 
however it may be quite stuck so we may
have<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.400> use<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.060> hammer<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.509> give<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> good

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
have to use a hammer and give it a good

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.969 
have to use a hammer and give it a good
whack<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.619> get<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> loose<00:01:21.979> okay

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
whack and see we can get it loose okay

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.910 
whack and see we can get it loose okay
so<00:01:23.400> after<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.790> lot<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.409> Smashing<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.530> pounding

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
so after a lot of Smashing and pounding

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.060 
so after a lot of Smashing and pounding
and<00:01:26.330> hammering<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> screwdriver<00:01:28.409> wedges<00:01:28.860> and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and hammering and screwdriver wedges and

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.649 
and hammering and screwdriver wedges and
that<00:01:29.369> sort<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> thing<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.450> whole<00:01:30.630> thing

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that sort of thing the whole thing

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.560 
that sort of thing the whole thing
actually<00:01:30.960> comes<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.680> off<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.130> car<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.479> we

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
actually comes right off the car so we

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.499 
actually comes right off the car so we
have<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.810> disconnect<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> parking<00:01:34.979> brake

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
have to disconnect the parking brake

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
have to disconnect the parking brake
assembly<00:01:36.509> from<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> bearing<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
assembly from the bearing and then the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.910 
assembly from the bearing and then the
bearing<00:01:38.670> will<00:01:39.259> come<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.650> replace<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
bearing will come out we can replace it

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.539 
bearing will come out we can replace it
with<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.159> new<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.369> okay<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.979> we<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
with a new one okay so we now have the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.639 
with a new one okay so we now have the
new<00:01:44.729> bearing<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> park<00:01:46.439> brake

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
new bearing in and the park brake

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.370 
new bearing in and the park brake
assembly<00:01:47.189> is<00:01:47.220> back<00:01:47.520> together<00:01:48.020> basically<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
assembly is back together basically the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.660 
assembly is back together basically the
rule<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.680> anything<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> took<00:01:50.220> apart<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> have

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
rule is anything you took apart you have

rule is anything you took apart you have
to<00:01:50.790> put<00:01:50.970> back<00:01:51.000> together

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
to put back together

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.960 
to put back together
it's<00:01:52.590> either<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.159> new<00:01:53.310> parts<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:53.759> with<00:01:53.880> the

it's either with new parts or with the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.789 
it's either with new parts or with the
same<00:01:54.149> old<00:01:54.329> ones<00:01:55.820> yeah<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.299> wiggle<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
same old ones yeah just wiggle the

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.240 
same old ones yeah just wiggle the
bearing<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> tight<00:01:59.549> fit<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.810> it

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
bearing in it's a tight fit so that it

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.160 
bearing in it's a tight fit so that it
stays<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> way<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.579> supposed<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.170> next

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
stays the way it's supposed to next

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.090 
stays the way it's supposed to next
thing<00:02:04.259> we're<00:02:04.380> going<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> rotor

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
thing we're going to do is put the rotor

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.840 
thing we're going to do is put the rotor
on

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
on

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.660 
on
so<00:02:07.850> we've<00:02:08.030> got<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.239> wheel<00:02:08.360> bearing<00:02:08.720> changed

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
so we've got the wheel bearing changed

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.949 
so we've got the wheel bearing changed
and<00:02:10.670> everything's<00:02:11.120> tightened<00:02:11.390> back<00:02:11.569> up<00:02:11.780> and

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
and everything's tightened back up and

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.000 
and everything's tightened back up and
we're<00:02:12.080> going<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.230> take<00:02:12.349> it<00:02:12.470> for<00:02:12.620> test<00:02:12.800> drive

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
we're going to take it for test drive

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.380 
we're going to take it for test drive
and<00:02:13.129> see<00:02:13.220> if<00:02:13.370> it<00:02:13.459> fits<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.849> whooshing<00:02:14.180> noise

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
and see if it fits the whooshing noise

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.140 
and see if it fits the whooshing noise
which<00:02:14.540> I'm<00:02:14.690> sure<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.959> has
