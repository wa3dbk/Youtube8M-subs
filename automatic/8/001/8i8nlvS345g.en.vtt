over the 50 yard marker all right not
the<00:02:28.819> greatest<00:02:29.000> start<00:02:29.270> on<00:02:29.360> this<00:02:29.450> drive<00:02:29.750> for

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
the greatest start on this drive for

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.540 
the greatest start on this drive for
defense<00:02:30.350> but<00:02:30.470> if<00:02:30.770> we<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.010> get<00:02:31.130> it<00:02:31.250> going<00:02:31.459> again

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
defense but if we can get it going again

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.449 
defense but if we can get it going again
soon<00:02:32.450> here<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:32.780> go<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.200> man<00:02:33.590> while<00:02:33.890> he<00:02:34.100> all<00:02:34.280> we

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
soon here we go and man while he all we

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.010 
soon here we go and man while he all we
forced<00:02:35.000> him<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.150> drop<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.510> wow<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.660> thought<00:02:35.900> he

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
forced him to drop it wow I thought he

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.110 
forced him to drop it wow I thought he
had<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.200> I<00:02:36.500> guess<00:02:36.950> not<00:02:36.980> we<00:02:37.550> it's<00:02:37.819> gonna<00:02:37.970> be

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
had it I guess not we it's gonna be

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.910 
had it I guess not we it's gonna be
second<00:02:38.390> time<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:39.260> was<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.380> crazy<00:02:39.530> play

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
second time that was a crazy play

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.140 
second time that was a crazy play
hopefully<00:02:40.250> we<00:02:40.310> can<00:02:40.459> do<00:02:40.580> something<00:02:40.819> like<00:02:41.000> that

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
hopefully we can do something like that

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.670 
hopefully we can do something like that
once<00:02:41.420> again<00:02:41.690> he's<00:02:41.900> gonna<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:42.230> running<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.560> and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
once again he's gonna be running it and

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.740 
once again he's gonna be running it and
I<00:02:42.769> thought<00:02:43.069> I<00:02:43.130> shot<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.610> get<00:02:43.760> correctly<00:02:44.300> I<00:02:44.330> did

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
I thought I shot to get correctly I did

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.270 
I thought I shot to get correctly I did
but<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:44.989> was<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.260> wrong<00:02:45.530> gap<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.040> he<00:02:46.100> spent

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
but it was the wrong gap and he spent

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.280 
but it was the wrong gap and he spent
about<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.489> nice<00:02:46.700> nine<00:02:46.970> yard<00:02:47.180> gain<00:02:47.390> soon<00:02:48.140> my

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
about a nice nine yard gain soon my

about a nice nine yard gain soon my
opponent<00:02:48.620> runs<00:02:48.680> here<00:02:48.890> third<00:02:49.250> one<00:02:49.610> he's<00:02:50.090> not

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
opponent runs here third one he's not

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.340 
opponent runs here third one he's not
gonna<00:02:50.420> be<00:02:50.510> running<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.840> like<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:51.019> thought<00:02:51.230> he

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
gonna be running it like I thought he

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.690
