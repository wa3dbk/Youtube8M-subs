00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.580
Today is windy : -O

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.620
It blew about 2m from back to front the wind

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.780
Let's start the test of Flight Trainer mode of Microbeast PLUS PRO EDITION V4

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.640
Governor of Microbeast is hovering 2600rpm, idle-up 1 is the 2800rpm

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.880
First, face-to-face hovering :D

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.580
And Flight Trainer Mode On!

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:45.525
Already is Elevator and Aileron is controlled

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.040
And idle-up on in this state

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.420
Even while being controlled, directional control of the Elevator and Ailerons the pilot flew the weaker correspondingly

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.931
When the stick to neutral, also will be stable under control

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.660
Also hovering release the hand from the stick :)

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.880
Since the wind is strong aircraft was swept away

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:39.294
Since the Pitch and the Ladder is free, it does not affect even the attitude stability control and operation

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.560
Returns from idle up to normal

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:35.973
Try playing with changing the direction :D

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.880
There is no fear because the stable is also in the even towards the aircraft in any direction *L*

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.240
It is quite stable and be allowed to Pirouette at low altitude

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.940
Okay up and down the pitch!

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.060
Try to run a little

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.740
It is certainly a flight trainer mode

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.220
You also can practice in such a small place ;-)

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.140
In order to advance from hovering to the next step, it is very survive mode

00:04:11.715 --> 00:04:16.675
Of course, If you do not hit the check helm since the aircraft does not stop, let's practice in a wider location

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.340
Timeout

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.580
It remains is possible landing of course AttitudeControl mode

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.800
PRO EDITION V4 looks great performance

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.300
By all means, please try to upgrade!
