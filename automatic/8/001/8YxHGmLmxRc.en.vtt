raspberry canes I've got some raspberry

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.280 
raspberry canes I've got some raspberry
canes<00:00:25.960> here<00:00:27.390> now<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.450> most<00:00:28.600> important<00:00:29.260> thing

canes here now the most important thing

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.410 
canes here now the most important thing
with<00:00:29.590> raspberry<00:00:30.100> canes<00:00:30.340> is<00:00:30.580> you<00:00:30.730> need<00:00:30.910> to<00:00:30.940> be

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
with raspberry canes is you need to be

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.280 
with raspberry canes is you need to be
able<00:00:31.510> to<00:00:31.750> identify<00:00:31.900> the<00:00:33.120> new<00:00:34.120> shoots<00:00:34.450> that

and you can see the spent flowers on
them<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.470> spent<00:00:47.739> fruit<00:00:48.040> so<00:00:48.340> these<00:00:48.489> are

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
them and the spent fruit so these are

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.890

the<00:00:48.670> old<00:00:49.080> and<00:00:50.080> this<00:00:51.070> shoot<00:00:51.370> here<00:00:51.790> looks<00:00:52.659> much

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
the old and this shoot here looks much

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.040 
the old and this shoot here looks much
fresher<00:00:53.290> and<00:00:53.620> greener<00:00:54.129> this<00:00:55.030> one<00:00:55.269> will<00:00:55.480> fruit

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
fresher and greener this one will fruit

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.500 
fresher and greener this one will fruit
next<00:00:56.320> year<00:00:56.680> so<00:00:56.980> with<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.220> aim<00:00:57.339> of<00:00:57.510> pruning

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
next year so with the aim of pruning

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.630 
next year so with the aim of pruning
raspberries<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.199> to<00:00:59.320> cut<00:00:59.530> out<00:00:59.769> the<00:01:00.040> shoots

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
raspberries is to cut out the shoots

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:20.270 
raspberries is to cut out the shoots
that<00:01:00.940> just<00:01:01.180> finished<00:01:01.300> fruiting

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.310 

so<00:01:21.280> identify<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.149> shoot<00:01:22.479> that<00:01:22.509> needs<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:22.990> be<00:01:23.109> cut

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
so identify a shoot that needs to be cut

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.990 
so identify a shoot that needs to be cut
out<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.909> cut<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.060> right<00:01:25.240> down<00:01:25.299> at<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.750> base

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
out and cut it right down at the base

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.139 
out and cut it right down at the base
ideally<00:01:28.380> above<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.590> new<00:01:29.829> bud<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.549> here<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.000> the

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
ideally above a new bud so here is the

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.779 
ideally above a new bud so here is the
bud<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:32.380> tip<00:01:32.679> protruding<00:01:33.340> out<00:01:33.460> from<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
bud just tip protruding out from the

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.690 
bud just tip protruding out from the
side<00:01:33.969> of<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.179> stem<00:01:34.450> just<00:01:35.380> cut<00:01:35.590> above<00:01:35.829> it<00:01:36.039> like

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
side of the stem just cut above it like

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.679 
side of the stem just cut above it like
that<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.710> to<00:01:38.770> conclude<00:01:39.179> you<00:01:40.179> can't<00:01:40.450> go<00:01:40.659> wrong

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
that so to conclude you can't go wrong

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.719 
that so to conclude you can't go wrong
if<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.469> just<00:01:41.679> leave<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.159> pruning<00:01:42.579> of<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
if you just leave the pruning of the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.120 
if you just leave the pruning of the
raspberries<00:01:43.420> until<00:01:44.170> they<00:01:44.319> finish<00:01:44.619> fruiting

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
raspberries until they finish fruiting

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.169 
raspberries until they finish fruiting
that<00:01:45.549> is<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.819> most<00:01:46.000> important<00:01:46.600> thing<00:01:48.179> and

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
that is the most important thing and

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.709 
that is the most important thing and
that's<00:01:49.390> how<00:01:49.569> you<00:01:49.630> prune<00:01:49.929> raspberry<00:01:50.469> canes
