00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.749 
shift this car is spirited and fun but
you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.800> take<00:01:10.890> off<00:01:11.070> in<00:01:11.190> high<00:01:11.310> gear<00:01:11.520> if<00:01:11.640> you'd

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
you can take off in high gear if you'd

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.780 
you can take off in high gear if you'd
like<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.650> take<00:01:13.830> off<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.280> second<00:01:14.700> gear

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790

like you can take off in second gear
third<00:01:15.060> gear<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.840> drive<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.259> an

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
third gear you can drive it like an

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.560 
third gear you can drive it like an
automatic<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.160> you<00:01:17.280> can<00:01:17.430> use<00:01:17.460> two<00:01:17.729> gears<00:01:17.970> in

this particular car is performance

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.890 
this particular car is performance
oriented<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> like<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.060> use<00:01:21.300> the<00:01:21.450> gears<00:01:21.659> it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
oriented so I like to use the gears it's

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.050
