00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.240
 I poles doc yellow jersey cn must 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.960
 meet up for a new video a 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.460
 easter egg suaad warfare and on the 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.560
 full throttle in the campaign mode 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.900
 banks including one that a rpg 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.210
 hide so a rpg where there is 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.490
 sure is good be closed chpj cash 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.350
 express or not to you to decide everything 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.730
 simply and before anything else is 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.439
 not found this story had fallen 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.329
 above without on a forum simply 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.819
 totally randomly there was a video 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.319
 who showed it to whom I will put you the 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:37.640
 chain links and the a8 in question 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.440
 it's always good to quote one's sources 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.219
 friends when it's not you who 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.289
 find things 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.639
 finally brief and dong there you go see 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.210
 that you direct me directly into the 

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:45.799
 great top 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.479
 in fact it's going to be pretty simple to manipulate 

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:49.249
 but we'll have to take a little 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.079
 the hand actually it's going to take you have 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.399
 of the column to climb to the top for 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.139
 climb on the column has nothing more 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.299
 simple you're just going to have to make some 

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:58.100
 double jam and puts your cursor to the 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.170
 top and a picture of the column is going 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.179
 have to do two double jumps and two 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.010
 dash on the side at the same time so 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.930
 like what I do what you see 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.100
 simply on the screen once 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.900
 you will have done that you will do 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.700
 exactly as I do anyway 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.800
 if it's going a little too fast I'll 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.420
 would put a small extract of the fact on purpose 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.850
 to prove to you in case you have 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.110
 not very well understood in more idle 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.070
 for you to take your time and 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.230
 it's at the end of the video 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.060
 and there you see you have the rpg 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.740
 simply then the peculiarity 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.240
 is that already you and how he is 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.600
 renamed so we can say that it is 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.640
 not necessarily done on purpose 2 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.200
 no noise so a problem the by 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.810
 against who does damage also you 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 can their charge and chaos and and 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.080
 then that's it's just enough 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.270
 it's also dummy because when 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.450
 you will run with short effect it is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.189
 not the RPGs we know and he 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.390
 I just hope that 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.979
 you will have please feel free to let go 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.380
 little nike and especially to check the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.689
 description to see what was found 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.490
 the video finally I think it's them 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.710
 who found me anyway 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.270
 thanks simply that the more I 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.799
 known this simply is the least 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.759
 things that's from this sites and 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.619
 this is simply 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.990
 and then here you go see that I 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.880
 am going to start showing you the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.009
 thing in slow motion so it's very simple 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.390
 of you follow the kind of rectangle and 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.580
 you move your cursor up 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.420
 and then that's ska I had to wear 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.420
 or all ages
