00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
university's color should be in the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.320 
university's color should be in the
uniform<00:01:26.010> which<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.910> you<00:01:27.000> were<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.300> that

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
uniform which if you were to do that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.969 
uniform which if you were to do that
than<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> American<00:01:28.170> flag<00:01:28.320> motif<00:01:28.560> wouldn't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
than the American flag motif wouldn't

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.040 
than the American flag motif wouldn't
work<00:01:29.070> at<00:01:29.190> all<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> very<00:01:30.869> limited

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
work at all it's for like a very limited

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.050 
work at all it's for like a very limited
time<00:01:31.410> I<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> unit<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.820> love<00:01:33.030> that

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
time I think that the unit I love that

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.219 
time I think that the unit I love that
they're<00:01:33.360> doing<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> Wounded

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
they're doing this for the Wounded

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.420 
they're doing this for the Wounded
Warriors<00:01:34.470> Project<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.190> we<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.400> need

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
Warriors Project I think that we do need

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.160 
Warriors Project I think that we do need
to<00:01:35.640> support<00:01:35.940> this<00:01:36.090> group<00:01:36.270> more<00:01:36.509> than<00:01:36.690> we<00:01:36.780> do<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
to support this group more than we do I

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410 
to support this group more than we do I
think<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> uniforms<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.490> pretty<00:01:38.670> badass<00:01:38.910> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
think the uniforms are pretty badass I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
think the uniforms are pretty badass I
don't<00:01:40.080> think<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.470> meant<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.860> look<00:01:40.979> like

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
don't think it's meant to look like

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.499 
don't think it's meant to look like
they're<00:01:41.340> bleeding<00:01:41.550> or<00:01:41.850> even<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.300> was<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
they're bleeding or even if it was that

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.300 
they're bleeding or even if it was that
works<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.259> fact<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.800> the<00:01:43.950> Wounded

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
works the fact that it's the Wounded

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.930 
works the fact that it's the Wounded
Warriors<00:01:44.700> Project<00:01:44.869> am<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.990> wrong<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.640> hope<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
Warriors Project am I wrong I hope that

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.310 
Warriors Project am I wrong I hope that
it's<00:01:48.120> not<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.630> they're<00:01:49.020> meant<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.260> be

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it's not that they're meant to be

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's not that they're meant to be
bleeding<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> somebody<00:01:50.190> just<00:01:50.370> tried<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.670> add

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
bleeding that somebody just tried to add

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.760 
bleeding that somebody just tried to add
a<00:01:50.820> little<00:01:51.060> bit<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.270> creativity<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.140> design<00:01:52.260> to

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
a little bit of creativity and design to

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190 
a little bit of creativity and design to
the<00:01:52.800> uniforms<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:54.120> I<00:01:54.150> think<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.870> where<00:01:55.170> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
the uniforms but I think this is where I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.430 
the uniforms but I think this is where I
mean<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.620> very<00:01:56.040> similar<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:58.080> frat

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
mean this is very similar to the frat

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.570 
mean this is very similar to the frat

journalists<00:02:47.040> at<00:02:47.130> Deadspin<00:02:47.580> things<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.030> that

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
journalists at Deadspin things like that

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.699 
journalists at Deadspin things like that
I<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:48.720> see<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.870> Wounded<00:02:49.230> Warriors<00:02:49.680> Project

I don't see the Wounded Warriors Project
complaining<00:02:50.670> about<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.360> to

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
complaining about it and I have to

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.449 
complaining about it and I have to
imagine<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:52.500> if<00:02:52.620> they're<00:02:52.800> doing<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.250> with

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
imagine that if they're doing this with

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.650 
imagine that if they're doing this with
the<00:02:53.640> under<00:02:54.000> armour

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
the under armour

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.120 
the under armour
under<00:02:54.840> armour<00:02:54.960> probably<00:02:55.470> was<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:55.740> contact

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
under armour probably was in contact

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.250 
under armour probably was in contact
with<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.430> wounded<00:02:56.520> warriors<00:02:56.940> project<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.900> so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
with the wounded warriors project and so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.140 
with the wounded warriors project and so
I<00:02:58.560> don't<00:02:58.890> understand<00:02:59.640> why<00:02:59.670> they<00:02:59.910> would<00:02:59.940> be

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
I don't understand why they would be

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.370 
I don't understand why they would be
offended<00:03:00.360> by<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.840> don't<00:03:01.020> think<00:03:01.320> that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
offended by it I don't think that

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.080 
offended by it I don't think that
there's<00:03:01.740> much<00:03:01.980> evidence<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.490> they<00:03:02.610> are<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
there's much evidence that they are I

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.820 
there's much evidence that they are I
think<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.300> some<00:03:03.570> people<00:03:03.600> are<00:03:03.900> just<00:03:03.960> kind<00:03:04.710> of
