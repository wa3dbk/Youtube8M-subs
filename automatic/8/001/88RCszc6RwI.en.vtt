00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
angle of focus the wider angle focus is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.530 
angle of focus the wider angle focus is
about<00:00:35.820> three<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.420> half<00:00:36.600> feet<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.079> back<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
it is a fixed focus it's not going to

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.130 
it is a fixed focus it's not going to
autofocus<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> other<00:00:42.690> cameras

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
autofocus like some of the other cameras

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290 
autofocus like some of the other cameras
will<00:00:43.440> where<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.309> trying<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.760> seek<00:00:45.000> where

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
will where it's trying to seek where

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000 
will where it's trying to seek where
it's<00:00:45.420> trying<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> focus<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.800> like

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

microphone<00:01:59.729> though<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:01.320> why<00:02:01.619> that's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
microphone though and that's why that's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.649 
microphone though and that's why that's
one<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.610> main<00:02:02.790> reasons<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.270> bought<00:02:03.450> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
one of the main reasons I bought the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.410 
one of the main reasons I bought the
camera<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.140> because<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.860> now<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.270> next

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
camera is because of that now the next

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.090 
camera is because of that now the next
thing<00:02:06.780> we're<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> look<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.500> is

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
thing we're going to look at is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.690 
thing we're going to look at is
there<00:02:08.490> is<00:02:09.050> HDMI<00:02:10.050> slot<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.890> watch<00:02:11.400> it

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
there is HDMI slot so you can watch it

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.470 
there is HDMI slot so you can watch it
and<00:02:11.910> also<00:02:12.690> there's<00:02:12.930> an<00:02:13.110> AV<00:02:13.770> plug<00:02:14.370> both<00:02:15.330> of

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and also there's an AV plug both of

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.320 
and also there's an AV plug both of
those<00:02:15.570> cables<00:02:16.110> come<00:02:16.350> with<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.740> camera

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
those cables come with the camera

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.790 
those cables come with the camera
because<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> HDMI<00:02:18.930> slot<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> little<00:02:19.680> bit

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
because the HDMI slot is a little bit

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.760 
because the HDMI slot is a little bit
smaller<00:02:20.070> than<00:02:20.250> your<00:02:20.610> normal<00:02:20.790> HDMI<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.020> then

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
smaller than your normal HDMI and then

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.000 
smaller than your normal HDMI and then
your<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> VI<00:02:23.430> AV<00:02:24.240> slot<00:02:24.540> is<00:02:24.780> also<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> same<00:02:25.680> it's

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
your a VI AV slot is also the same it's

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.950 
your a VI AV slot is also the same it's
smaller<00:02:26.460> for<00:02:26.820> some<00:02:27.000> reason<00:02:27.330> than<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> normal

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
smaller for some reason than a normal

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.350 
smaller for some reason than a normal
mini<00:02:28.260> plug<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:29.520> they<00:02:29.670> include<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.150> cable

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
mini plug but they include that cable

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.220 
mini plug but they include that cable
with<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:31.020> this<00:02:31.890> next<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.940> DC<00:02:33.540> plug<00:02:33.900> which

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230

it's<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.640> features<00:03:11.760> I<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.360> it

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
it's just one of the features I like it

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.560 
it's just one of the features I like it
does<00:03:13.320> allow<00:03:13.530> it<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.680> flex<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.130> would<00:03:14.390> still<00:03:15.390> get

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
does allow it to flex I would still get

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.990 
does allow it to flex I would still get
an<00:03:15.720> extension<00:03:16.110> cable<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.880> you

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
an extension cable for it so that you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.700 
an extension cable for it so that you
don't<00:03:18.210> you<00:03:18.390> know<00:03:18.510> bend<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:19.050> too<00:03:19.290> much<00:03:19.440> or

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
don't you know bend this too much or

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.800 
don't you know bend this too much or
break<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.100> or<00:03:20.190> anything<00:03:20.520> and<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.060> flip<00:03:21.420> video

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
break it or anything and the flip video

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.540 
break it or anything and the flip video
if<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.200> ever<00:03:22.350> look<00:03:22.560> at<00:03:22.620> those<00:03:22.830> they're<00:03:23.040> solid

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
if you ever look at those they're solid

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.330 
if you ever look at those they're solid
they're<00:03:24.030> very<00:03:24.270> rigid<00:03:24.740> this<00:03:25.740> is<00:03:25.950> just<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.220> little

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
they're very rigid this is just a little

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.950 
they're very rigid this is just a little
bit<00:03:26.490> better<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.820> does<00:03:26.970> allow<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.390> flex<00:03:27.690> and

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
bit better it does allow it to flex and

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.050 
bit better it does allow it to flex and
stuff<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.770> put<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.340> back<00:03:29.520> in<00:03:29.670> there<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:29.940> it

now so as you can see it's kind of going

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.480 
now so as you can see it's kind of going
into<00:05:07.259> the<00:05:07.379> yellow<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:07.919> it<00:05:08.009> turns<00:05:08.250> red

into the yellow and it turns red

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.550 
into the yellow and it turns red

can<00:05:12.210> click<00:05:12.449> on<00:05:12.539> that<00:05:12.599> and<00:05:12.810> actually<00:05:13.349> had<00:05:13.650> game

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
can click on that and actually had game

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.420 
can click on that and actually had game
to<00:05:14.879> it<00:05:15.060> or<00:05:15.349> subtract<00:05:16.349> gain<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.650> usually<00:05:17.219> leave

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
to it or subtract gain I usually leave

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.339 
to it or subtract gain I usually leave
it<00:05:17.580> right<00:05:17.759> at<00:05:17.969> the<00:05:18.210> stock<00:05:18.779> setting<00:05:19.139> it<00:05:19.199> seems

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
it right at the stock setting it seems

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:20.689 
it right at the stock setting it seems

most part I don't need it because I am
using<00:05:35.610> a<00:05:35.759> tripod<00:05:36.000> you've<00:05:36.810> got<00:05:37.050> this<00:05:37.919> is

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
using a tripod you've got this is

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:39.680 
using a tripod you've got this is
actually<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.550> really<00:05:38.819> good<00:05:39.060> feature<00:05:39.240> it's<00:05:39.599> an

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
actually a really good feature it's an

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.070 
actually a really good feature it's an
exposure<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.469> it<00:05:41.069> checks<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.550> faces<00:05:42.419> of<00:05:42.690> the

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
exposure and it checks the faces of the

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.079 
exposure and it checks the faces of the
people<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.500> does<00:05:43.800> not<00:05:43.979> focus<00:05:44.580> since<00:05:44.789> it<00:05:44.969> is<00:05:45.060> a

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.089 
people it does not focus since it is a

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:46.700 
people it does not focus since it is a
fixed<00:05:45.449> focus<00:05:45.779> camera<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:46.259> is<00:05:46.409> for<00:05:46.620> the

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
fixed focus camera it is for the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.149 
fixed focus camera it is for the
exposure<00:05:47.190> so<00:05:47.909> a<00:05:48.330> lot<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.900> times<00:05:49.110> if<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:49.979> have<00:05:50.009> a

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
exposure so a lot of times if you have a

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.369 
exposure so a lot of times if you have a
black<00:05:50.430> background<00:05:50.669> it's<00:05:51.300> just<00:05:51.509> you<00:05:51.750> the

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
black background it's just you the

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:55.969 
black background it's just you the
camera<00:05:52.740> is<00:05:52.830> gonna<00:05:52.919> try<00:05:53.279> to<00:05:54.620> ramp<00:05:55.620> up<00:05:55.800> the

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
camera is gonna try to ramp up the

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.519 
camera is gonna try to ramp up the
exposure<00:05:56.539> what<00:05:57.539> that<00:05:57.719> happens<00:05:58.080> then<00:05:58.289> is<00:05:58.500> you

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529 
exposure what that happens then is you

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.649 
exposure what that happens then is you
look<00:05:58.889> like<00:05:59.099> you're<00:05:59.279> glowing<00:05:59.520> wide<00:05:59.939> so<00:06:00.360> this<00:06:00.509> is

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
look like you're glowing wide so this is

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:02.990 
look like you're glowing wide so this is
a<00:06:00.689> great<00:06:01.020> feature<00:06:01.259> for<00:06:01.710> that<00:06:01.740> and<00:06:02.639> this<00:06:02.729> gets

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
a great feature for that and this gets

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.969 
a great feature for that and this gets
you<00:06:03.120> to<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.389> camera<00:06:03.839> click<00:06:04.439> it<00:06:04.560> again<00:06:04.650> it'll

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
you to the camera click it again it'll

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:06.829 
you to the camera click it again it'll
show<00:06:05.189> you<00:06:05.250> you<00:06:05.879> know<00:06:06.000> what<00:06:06.180> all<00:06:06.330> options<00:06:06.779> you

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:06.839

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:08.819 
have there's 720p at 30 frames per

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:11.719 
have there's 720p at 30 frames per
second<00:06:09.439> 720<00:06:10.439> at<00:06:10.529> 60<00:06:10.949> which<00:06:11.159> is<00:06:11.310> what<00:06:11.460> I've<00:06:11.580> been

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:11.729 
second 720 at 60 which is what I've been

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.089 
second 720 at 60 which is what I've been
using<00:06:11.969> for<00:06:12.360> pretty<00:06:12.599> much<00:06:12.779> all<00:06:13.020> the<00:06:13.259> videos

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
using for pretty much all the videos

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:15.709 
using for pretty much all the videos
that<00:06:14.129> have<00:06:14.370> done<00:06:14.490> so<00:06:14.669> far<00:06:14.879> with<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.150> I<00:06:15.360> do<00:06:15.419> like

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
that have done so far with it I do like

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.420 
that have done so far with it I do like
that<00:06:15.750> because<00:06:16.259> it<00:06:16.409> doesn't<00:06:16.680> look<00:06:16.800> as<00:06:16.949> jerky

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
that because it doesn't look as jerky

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.439 
that because it doesn't look as jerky
and<00:06:17.639> it<00:06:17.729> looks<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:17.939> little<00:06:18.060> bit<00:06:18.240> more

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449 
and it looks a little bit more

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:21.350 
and it looks a little bit more
professional<00:06:18.659> in<00:06:19.199> that<00:06:19.229> angle<00:06:19.939> and<00:06:20.939> then

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
professional in that angle and then

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.019 
professional in that angle and then
you've<00:06:21.509> got<00:06:21.689> the<00:06:21.900> 1080p<00:06:22.860> which<00:06:23.159> is<00:06:23.310> also<00:06:23.490> at<00:06:23.789> 30

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
you've got the 1080p which is also at 30

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:28.040 
you've got the 1080p which is also at 30
frames<00:06:24.330> per<00:06:24.539> second<00:06:25.339> you've<00:06:26.339> got<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:26.759> W<00:06:27.599> VGA

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
frames per second you've got the W VGA

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.329 
frames per second you've got the W VGA
which<00:06:28.199> is<00:06:28.560> going<00:06:28.710> to<00:06:28.770> be<00:06:28.860> 48<00:06:31.039> resolution<00:06:32.039> 40

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:32.339 
which is going to be 48 resolution 40

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:33.589 
which is going to be 48 resolution 40
and<00:06:32.490> then<00:06:32.580> you've<00:06:32.699> got<00:06:32.789> pictures<00:06:33.060> that<00:06:33.449> does

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
and then you've got pictures that does

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.150 
and then you've got pictures that does
it<00:06:33.870> has<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.080> 5<00:06:34.349> megapixel

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
it has a 5 megapixel

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.990 
it has a 5 megapixel
which<00:06:35.550> is<00:06:35.700> really<00:06:35.970> nice<00:06:37.070> let's<00:06:38.070> see<00:06:38.280> and<00:06:38.610> then

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
which is really nice let's see and then

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.550 
which is really nice let's see and then
this<00:06:39.090> is<00:06:39.300> to<00:06:39.450> play<00:06:39.660> it<00:06:39.810> so<00:06:39.960> there's<00:06:40.170> a<00:06:40.230> video<00:06:40.500> I

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
this is to play it so there's a video I

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.090 
this is to play it so there's a video I
recorded<00:06:40.740> earlier<00:06:42.410> so<00:06:43.410> as<00:06:43.500> you<00:06:43.620> can<00:06:43.710> see<00:06:43.890> and

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
record the one thing I don't like about

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.840

it<00:06:55.740> is<00:06:55.980> this<00:06:56.220> red<00:06:56.520> light<00:06:56.760> here<00:06:58.490> because<00:06:59.490> this

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
it is this red light here because this

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.240 
it is this red light here because this
looks<00:07:00.210> so<00:07:00.450> much<00:07:00.480> like<00:07:00.720> a<00:07:00.990> cell<00:07:01.620> phone<00:07:01.650> I<00:07:01.950> mean

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
looks so much like a cell phone I mean

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.920 
looks so much like a cell phone I mean
it's<00:07:02.430> pretty<00:07:02.580> much<00:07:02.700> the<00:07:02.880> same<00:07:02.940> size<00:07:03.360> and<00:07:03.720> color

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
it's pretty much the same size and color

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.590 
it's pretty much the same size and color
as<00:07:04.170> a<00:07:04.200> blackberry<00:07:04.980> so<00:07:05.760> which<00:07:06.030> is<00:07:06.150> really<00:07:06.420> nice

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600 
as a blackberry so which is really nice

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.510 
as a blackberry so which is really nice
it<00:07:07.200> would<00:07:07.440> be<00:07:07.560> great<00:07:07.770> if<00:07:07.890> that<00:07:07.920> light<00:07:08.250> could

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
it would be great if that light could

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.800 
it would be great if that light could
turn<00:07:08.700> off<00:07:08.880> that<00:07:09.060> there's<00:07:09.210> an<00:07:09.360> option<00:07:09.660> in<00:07:09.750> the

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
turn off that there's an option in the

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.030 
turn off that there's an option in the
menu<00:07:10.050> for<00:07:10.170> that<00:07:10.230> hopefully<00:07:10.680> they'll<00:07:10.860> come<00:07:11.010> up

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040 
menu for that hopefully they'll come up

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.700 
menu for that hopefully they'll come up
with<00:07:11.280> that<00:07:11.400> in<00:07:11.550> a<00:07:11.640> firmware<00:07:11.880> update<00:07:12.710> because

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:13.710 
with that in a firmware update because

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.740 
with that in a firmware update because
it<00:07:13.830> would<00:07:13.980> be<00:07:14.100> great<00:07:14.370> to<00:07:14.450> you<00:07:15.450> know<00:07:15.540> if<00:07:15.630> you're

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
it would be great to you know if you're

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.150 
it would be great to you know if you're
playing<00:07:15.870> a<00:07:15.990> prank<00:07:16.230> on<00:07:16.380> a<00:07:16.440> friend<00:07:16.500> or<00:07:16.890> something

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
playing a prank on a friend or something

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.440 
playing a prank on a friend or something
like<00:07:17.250> that<00:07:17.310> you<00:07:17.520> could<00:07:17.640> just<00:07:17.730> pretend<00:07:17.940> like<00:07:18.240> it

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
like that you could just pretend like it

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.960 
like that you could just pretend like it
is<00:07:18.570> a<00:07:18.600> cell<00:07:18.990> phone<00:07:19.280> you<00:07:20.280> can't<00:07:20.520> cover<00:07:20.700> that<00:07:20.910> up

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
is a cell phone you can't cover that up

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.240 
is a cell phone you can't cover that up
with<00:07:21.090> a<00:07:21.240> black<00:07:21.480> piece<00:07:21.720> of<00:07:21.870> tape<00:07:22.080> one<00:07:23.010> thing<00:07:23.160> you

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:23.250 
with a black piece of tape one thing you

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.800 
with a black piece of tape one thing you
want<00:07:23.400> to<00:07:23.490> avoid<00:07:23.760> though<00:07:24.030> is<00:07:24.180> covering<00:07:24.570> up<00:07:24.690> the

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
want to avoid though is covering up the

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.960 
want to avoid though is covering up the
X<00:07:24.960> the<00:07:25.500> internal<00:07:25.980> microphone<00:07:26.190> which<00:07:26.640> is<00:07:26.790> right

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
X the internal microphone which is right

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.350 
X the internal microphone which is right
next<00:07:27.120> to<00:07:27.270> that<00:07:27.450> line<00:07:27.690> so<00:07:28.880> this<00:07:29.880> is<00:07:30.030> pretty<00:07:30.270> much

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 
next to that line so this is pretty much

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.480 
next to that line so this is pretty much
