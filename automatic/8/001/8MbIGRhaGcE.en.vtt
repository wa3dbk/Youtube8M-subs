stick<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.710> I<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.429> USB<00:00:14.670> stick<00:00:15.120> in<00:00:15.360> here<00:00:15.630> let

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
stick but I have a USB stick in here let

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.290 
stick but I have a USB stick in here let
me<00:00:16.619> show<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:18.320> this<00:00:19.320> stick<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:20.369> 4

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
me show you and this stick is 4

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.240 
me show you and this stick is 4
gigabytes<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.220> shows

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
gigabytes but as you can see it shows

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.460 
gigabytes but as you can see it shows
only<00:00:23.789> 7<00:00:24.859> 679<00:00:25.859> megabytes<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.320> that's<00:00:28.320> not

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
only 7 679 megabytes and that's not

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.339 
only 7 679 megabytes and that's not
correct<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.840> 4<00:00:30.840> gigabyte

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
correct because this is a 4 gigabyte

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.000 
correct because this is a 4 gigabyte
hard<00:00:31.590> drive<00:00:32.210> USB<00:00:33.210> stick<00:00:33.719> how<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> fix<00:00:34.770> that

hard drive USB stick how to fix that
well<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.899> need<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> program<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.219> Pali<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
well you need a program from I Pali and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
well you need a program from I Pali and
that's<00:00:39.270> called<00:00:39.540> boot<00:00:39.809> eyes<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.620> gonna<00:00:40.800> run

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that's called boot eyes we're gonna run

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.619 
that's called boot eyes we're gonna run
it<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.250> administrator<00:00:44.570> hey<00:00:45.950> what<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.129> see

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
it as administrator hey what do we see

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.920 
it as administrator hey what do we see
USB<00:00:49.070> disk<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.399> 3.7<00:00:51.090> gigabytes

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
USB disk is 3.7 gigabytes

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.799 
USB disk is 3.7 gigabytes
that's<00:00:52.260> more<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.800> Atta<00:00:53.480> but<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.739> see

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
that's more like Atta but as you can see

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.760 
that's more like Atta but as you can see
here<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:58.020> my<00:00:58.980> computer<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.640> says<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.239> only<00:01:00.420> has

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
here in my computer it says it only has

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.700 
here in my computer it says it only has
679<00:01:02.030> megabyte<00:01:03.030> Ram<00:01:03.359> left<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.260> must<00:01:04.500> fix

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
679 megabyte Ram left so we must fix

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.870 
679 megabyte Ram left so we must fix
that<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.939> how<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.270> fix<00:01:06.600> well<00:01:07.340> it<00:01:08.340> shouldn't<00:01:08.729> be

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
that so how to fix well it shouldn't be

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.530 
that so how to fix well it shouldn't be
so<00:01:09.060> hard

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
so hard

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.860 
so hard
let's<00:01:10.470> look<00:01:11.600> process<00:01:12.600> MBA

we're<00:01:51.800> looking<00:01:52.040> at<00:01:52.160> all<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.880> older<00:01:54.250> this<00:01:55.250> is

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
we're looking at all the older this is

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.630 
we're looking at all the older this is
the<00:01:55.550> sector<00:01:55.820> edit<00:01:56.890> looking<00:01:57.890> at<00:01:58.010> all<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.310> parts

the sector edit looking at all the parts
here<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.150> can<00:02:00.370> we<00:02:01.370> can<00:02:01.400> access

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.660 

so<00:02:18.280> how<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.489> gonna<00:02:18.730> fix<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:20.160> take<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.280> look

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.350

minutes

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:50.190 

you<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.620> move<00:02:38.150> read<00:02:39.150> partitioning

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.949 

I<00:02:50.290> think<00:02:50.920> we're<00:02:51.040> gonna<00:02:51.160> use<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.780> let's<00:02:52.780> go

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
I think we're gonna use this let's go

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.550 
I think we're gonna use this let's go
for<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:56.129> okay<00:02:57.129> and<00:02:57.569> there<00:02:58.569> we<00:02:58.690> go<00:02:58.870> we<00:02:59.230> fixed

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
for this okay and there we go we fixed

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.729 
for this okay and there we go we fixed
it<00:02:59.680> you<00:03:00.010> see<00:03:00.220> we<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.410> select<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.530> tree

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
it you see we just select a tree

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.990 
it you see we just select a tree
partitioning<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.840> then<00:03:04.840> USB<00:03:05.709> HDD<00:03:06.610> mode

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
partitioning and then USB HDD mode

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.949 
partitioning and then USB HDD mode
single<00:03:07.510> partition<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.260> then<00:03:09.160> okay<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:10.750> see

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
single partition and then okay you see

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.509 
single partition and then okay you see
and<00:03:11.140> now<00:03:11.230> we<00:03:11.290> have<00:03:11.620> three<00:03:11.980> point<00:03:12.310> seven

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
and now we have three point seven

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.759 
and now we have three point seven
gigabytes<00:03:13.530> again<00:03:14.530> instead<00:03:15.099> of<00:03:15.810> 674<00:03:16.810> megabyte

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
gigabytes again instead of 674 megabyte

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.420 
gigabytes again instead of 674 megabyte
so<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.989> USB<00:03:20.319> stick<00:03:20.500> was<00:03:20.890> corrupted

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
so this this USB stick was corrupted

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.870 
so this this USB stick was corrupted
probably<00:03:21.970> because<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.650> used<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.099> install

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
probably because I used it to install

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.150 
probably because I used it to install
Linux<00:03:25.120> or<00:03:25.660> maybe<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.019> created<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.709> OS<00:03:26.980> X

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
Linux or maybe I created the OS X

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.850 
Linux or maybe I created the OS X
bootable<00:03:29.340> stick<00:03:30.340> that<00:03:31.120> had<00:03:31.440> another<00:03:32.440> kind<00:03:32.709> of

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
bootable stick that had another kind of

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.069 
bootable stick that had another kind of
partition<00:03:33.430> then<00:03:33.849> this<00:03:34.120> thing<00:03:34.329> is<00:03:34.480> used<00:03:34.780> to

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
partition then this thing is used to

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.800 
partition then this thing is used to
have<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:35.829> thing<00:03:36.040> has<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.269> fat16<00:03:37.269> partition

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
have this thing has a fat16 partition

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.100 
have this thing has a fat16 partition
and<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.560> four<00:03:38.799> gigabytes<00:03:39.370> big<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.690> that's<00:03:40.930> it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
and it's four gigabytes big so that's it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.759 
and it's four gigabytes big so that's it
that's<00:03:41.829> how<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.040> fix<00:03:42.400> your<00:03:42.910> drive<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:44.410> program

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
that's how to fix your drive the program

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.400 
that's how to fix your drive the program
I<00:03:44.920> did<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.280> with<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.120> called<00:03:46.569> boot<00:03:46.810> eyes<00:03:47.049> and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
I did it with is called boot eyes and
