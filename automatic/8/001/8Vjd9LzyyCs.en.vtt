team<00:01:04.260> it's<00:01:04.589> dark<00:01:05.489> water<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.720> really

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
team it's dark water and I don't really

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.510 
team it's dark water and I don't really
have<00:01:07.200> anything<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.740> hits<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.100> very<00:01:08.340> well

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
have anything that hits that very well

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.770 
have anything that hits that very well
except<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.200> zapdos<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> just

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
except for zapdos so I'm kind of just

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.499 
except for zapdos so I'm kind of just
thinking<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:15.210> all

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
thinking about what to do here in all

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.030 
thinking about what to do here in all
honesty<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.439> should<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:16.950> just

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
honesty I probably should have just

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.010 
honesty I probably should have just
thunder<00:01:17.549> wave<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.270> while<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.840> was

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
thunder wave this thing while it was

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
thunder wave this thing while it was
still<00:01:19.140> slow<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.250> has<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.909> ability<00:01:21.299> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
still slow because it has the ability to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
still slow because it has the ability to
gain<00:01:21.960> speed<00:01:22.640> constantly<00:01:24.470> but<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.710> went<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
gain speed constantly but it went with a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.100 
gain speed constantly but it went with a
crunch<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.000> did<00:01:27.210> out<00:01:27.330> speed<00:01:27.659> mime<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
crunch so if it did out speed mime you I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.539 
crunch so if it did out speed mime you I
would<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.530> had<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> sacrifice<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
would have just had to sacrifice it

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.770 
would have just had to sacrifice it
there<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> would<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.420> been<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.540> problem

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
there and that would have been a problem

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.980 
there and that would have been a problem
now<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.490> protect<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.810> get

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
now I just go with a protect to just get

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.420 
now I just go with a protect to just get
a<00:01:34.020> little<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.470> health<00:01:34.799> back<00:01:35.070> from<00:01:35.340> my

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
a little bit of health back from my

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.359 
a little bit of health back from my
leftovers<00:01:36.470> although<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.500> can't<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.979> too<00:01:38.189> much

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
leftovers although I can't get too much

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.499 
leftovers although I can't get too much
back<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:41.070> yeah<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.970> thing<00:01:42.210> just<00:01:42.240> keeps

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
back so yeah this thing just keeps

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.840 
back so yeah this thing just keeps
gaining<00:01:42.899> speed<00:01:43.259> every<00:01:43.920> turn<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.579> out

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
gaining speed every turn that it's out

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.319 
gaining speed every turn that it's out
and<00:01:45.259> i<00:01:46.259> really<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.310> much<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.939> deal

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
and i really don't have much to deal

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.690 
and i really don't have much to deal
with<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.920> pretty<00:01:50.549> big<00:01:50.790> problem<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
with it so it's a pretty big problem so

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.749 
with it so it's a pretty big problem so
i'm<00:01:55.070> considering<00:01:56.070> going<00:01:56.280> out<00:01:56.490> into<00:01:56.670> a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
houndoom knowing that he will resist the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
houndoom knowing that he will resist the
crunch<00:02:01.020> pretty<00:02:01.290> well<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.399> still<00:02:02.640> does

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
crunch pretty well but it still does

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
crunch pretty well but it still does
over<00:02:03.180> half<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.600> my<00:02:03.810> health<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.469> that's<00:02:04.860> a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
over half of my health so that's a

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.479 
over half of my health so that's a
pretty<00:02:05.100> big<00:02:05.340> problem<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.509> go<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:06.930> a

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
pretty big problem then I go for a

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.029 
pretty big problem then I go for a
hidden<00:02:08.489> power<00:02:08.670> grass<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.539> don't<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> clue

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
hidden power grass I don't have a clue

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.630 
hidden power grass I don't have a clue
why<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.489> did<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.060> was<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
why I did that I was a

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.360 
why I did that I was a
play<00:02:13.080> because<00:02:14.080> obviously<00:02:14.319> his<00:02:14.800> Sharpedo<00:02:15.280> is

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
play because obviously his Sharpedo is

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.860 
play because obviously his Sharpedo is
going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.610> outspeed<00:02:15.910> my<00:02:16.090> houndoom<00:02:16.480> my

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
going to outspeed my houndoom my

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.600 
going to outspeed my houndoom my
houndoom<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:17.410> very<00:02:17.709> fast<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.459> has<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
houndoom is very fast and it has a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.330 
houndoom is very fast and it has a
choice<00:02:19.030> scarf<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:20.080> it'll<00:02:20.980> be<00:02:21.010> able<00:02:21.190> to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
choice scarf so it'll be able to

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.790 
choice scarf so it'll be able to
outspeed<00:02:21.640> most<00:02:21.970> things<00:02:22.330> but<00:02:22.540> not<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.959> two<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.740> a

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
outspeed most things but not a two and a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.280 
outspeed most things but not a two and a
half<00:02:23.980> three<00:02:24.280> times<00:02:24.610> speed<00:02:24.910> Sharpedo<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.260> I

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
half three times speed Sharpedo so I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.500 
half three times speed Sharpedo so I
send<00:02:26.560> out<00:02:26.650> Zapdos<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.250> basically<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.270> is<00:02:28.390> my

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
send out Zapdos and basically this is my

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.100 
send out Zapdos and basically this is my
last-ditch<00:02:28.990> effort<00:02:29.880> effort<00:02:30.880> last<00:02:31.840> ditch

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
last-ditch effort effort last ditch

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.140 
last-ditch effort effort last ditch
effort<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.620> kill<00:02:33.130> this<00:02:33.250> thing<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:33.760> I<00:02:33.790> go<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.090> a

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
effort to kill this thing so I go with a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.230 
effort to kill this thing so I go with a
charge<00:02:34.450> beam<00:02:34.860> he<00:02:35.860> switches<00:02:36.100> out<00:02:36.340> into<00:02:36.700> Snorlax

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
charge beam he switches out into Snorlax

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.210 
charge beam he switches out into Snorlax
knowing<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.840> his<00:02:38.020> Sharpedo<00:02:38.500> can't<00:02:38.830> take<00:02:39.040> one

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
knowing that his Sharpedo can't take one

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.570 
knowing that his Sharpedo can't take one
of<00:02:39.310> those<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.230> Snorlax<00:02:41.230> resisted<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:41.950> very

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
of those and Snorlax resisted that very

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.570 
of those and Snorlax resisted that very
well<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.780> only<00:02:43.900> does<00:02:44.140> about<00:02:44.350> 20<00:02:44.800> damage<00:02:45.040> plus

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
well that only does about 20 damage plus

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.360 
well that only does about 20 damage plus
it's<00:02:45.760> got<00:02:45.870> leftovers<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.160> then<00:02:48.160> he's<00:02:48.280> gonna

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
it's got leftovers and then he's gonna

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.460 
it's got leftovers and then he's gonna
curse<00:02:48.790> on<00:02:49.000> top<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.360> that<00:02:49.510> which<00:02:49.750> gets<00:02:49.989> him<00:02:50.110> even

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
curse on top of that which gets him even

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.759 
curse on top of that which gets him even
more<00:02:50.709> defense<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.260> only<00:02:53.290> gives<00:02:53.590> him

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
more defense but it only gives him

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.620 
more defense but it only gives him
normal<00:02:54.340> defense<00:02:54.670> instead<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.120> special

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
normal defense instead of special

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.520 
normal defense instead of special
defense<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:57.330> yeah<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:58.540> comes<00:02:58.780> just<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.200> back

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
defense so yeah this comes just a back

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.300 
defense so yeah this comes just a back
and<00:02:59.709> forth<00:02:59.980> fight<00:03:00.310> between<00:03:00.550> Zapdos<00:03:01.360> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
and forth fight between Zapdos and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.680 
and forth fight between Zapdos and
Snorlax<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.730> neither<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.180> them<00:03:04.300> can<00:03:04.420> really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
Snorlax and neither of them can really

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.560 
Snorlax and neither of them can really
hurt<00:03:04.840> each<00:03:04.989> other<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.380> much<00:03:06.209> he<00:03:07.209> does<00:03:07.420> have

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
hurt each other that much he does have

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.410 
hurt each other that much he does have
rest<00:03:07.959> as<00:03:08.260> Snorlax<00:03:08.950> intend<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.400> do<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:10.000> he<00:03:10.269> just

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
rest as Snorlax intend to do so he just

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.479 
rest as Snorlax intend to do so he just
breasts<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:10.840> off<00:03:11.050> but<00:03:11.890> now<00:03:12.070> I'm<00:03:12.190> getting<00:03:12.310> to

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
breasts that off but now I'm getting to

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.070 
breasts that off but now I'm getting to
the<00:03:12.580> point<00:03:12.790> where<00:03:13.060> I'm<00:03:13.269> building<00:03:13.690> up<00:03:13.810> enough

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
the point where I'm building up enough

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.890 
the point where I'm building up enough
special<00:03:14.440> attack<00:03:14.800> with<00:03:15.040> my<00:03:15.220> charge<00:03:15.610> beams<00:03:15.940> that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
special attack with my charge beams that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.020 
special attack with my charge beams that
I<00:03:17.200> can<00:03:17.380> really<00:03:17.680> actually<00:03:17.920> hurt<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.459> Snorlax

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
I can really actually hurt this Snorlax

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.240 
I can really actually hurt this Snorlax
and<00:03:19.299> anything<00:03:20.049> he<00:03:20.140> sends<00:03:20.470> out<00:03:20.590> after<00:03:20.980> this<00:03:21.070> is

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
and anything he sends out after this is

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.370 
and anything he sends out after this is
going<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.549> be<00:03:21.640> in<00:03:21.730> trouble<00:03:24.239> so<00:03:25.239> even<00:03:25.900> though<00:03:25.930> he

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
going to be in trouble so even though he

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.530 
going to be in trouble so even though he
rested<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:27.400> next<00:03:27.790> charge<00:03:28.000> beam<00:03:28.180> would<00:03:28.420> have

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
rested that next charge beam would have

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.840 
rested that next charge beam would have
killed<00:03:28.780> his<00:03:28.959> Snorlax<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.010> he<00:03:30.250> makes<00:03:30.400> us<00:03:30.549> a

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
killed his Snorlax so he makes us a

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.910 
killed his Snorlax so he makes us a
smart<00:03:31.510> play<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.840> goes<00:03:31.959> into<00:03:32.140> neato<00:03:32.410> king<00:03:32.709> he

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
smart play and goes into neato king he

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.229 
smart play and goes into neato king he
probably<00:03:33.190> should<00:03:33.579> have<00:03:33.670> done<00:03:33.730> this<00:03:34.060> earlier

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
probably should have done this earlier

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.400 
probably should have done this earlier
and<00:03:34.840> since<00:03:35.799> my<00:03:36.040> zapdos<00:03:36.850> is<00:03:37.060> choice<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.750> am<00:03:38.049> going

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
and since my zapdos is choice I am going

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.660 
and since my zapdos is choice I am going
to<00:03:38.500> have<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:38.709> switch<00:03:38.920> into<00:03:39.070> something<00:03:39.519> else

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
to have to switch into something else

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.539 
to have to switch into something else
because<00:03:39.850> neato<00:03:40.299> King<00:03:40.570> resists<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.549> electric

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
because neato King resists the electric

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.000 
because neato King resists the electric
attacks<00:03:44.519> so<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:46.230> don't<00:03:47.230> remember<00:03:47.440> who<00:03:47.709> I<00:03:47.739> go<00:03:47.980> out

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
attacks so I don't remember who I go out

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.640 
attacks so I don't remember who I go out
into<00:03:48.519> here<00:03:48.790> let's<00:03:49.000> look<00:03:49.150> I'm<00:03:49.470> thinking<00:03:50.470> about

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
into here let's look I'm thinking about

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.330 
into here let's look I'm thinking about
going<00:03:50.860> into<00:03:51.220> rhyperior

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.089 

but<00:03:55.340> instead<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:55.760> just<00:03:55.819> go<00:03:56.120> into<00:03:56.269> mu<00:03:56.769> his<00:03:57.769> ice

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
but instead I just go into mu his ice

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.699 
but instead I just go into mu his ice
beam<00:03:58.370> almost<00:03:59.030> kills<00:03:59.390> my<00:03:59.569> mu<00:03:59.840> but<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.409> should<00:04:00.620> be

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
beam almost kills my mu but I should be

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.559 
beam almost kills my mu but I should be
able<00:04:00.769> to<00:04:00.920> get<00:04:01.010> off<00:04:01.129> one<00:04:01.459> psychic<00:04:03.340> indistinct

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
able to get off one psychic indistinct

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.320 
able to get off one psychic indistinct
so<00:04:05.569> each<00:04:05.810> time<00:04:06.110> i<00:04:06.409> use<00:04:06.769> a<00:04:07.010> damaging<00:04:07.760> attack<00:04:08.090> I

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
so each time i use a damaging attack I

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.000 
so each time i use a damaging attack I
will<00:04:08.629> lose<00:04:08.810> some<00:04:09.170> of<00:04:09.200> my<00:04:09.440> health<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:12.739> he<00:04:12.890> goes

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
will lose some of my health so he goes

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.689 
will lose some of my health so he goes
back<00:04:13.069> out<00:04:13.610> into<00:04:13.879> caufe<00:04:14.750> gregus<00:04:15.290> he<00:04:16.190> probably

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
back out into caufe gregus he probably

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.490 
back out into caufe gregus he probably
should<00:04:17.090> have<00:04:17.150> just<00:04:17.359> gone<00:04:17.540> in<00:04:17.720> at<00:04:17.810> out<00:04:17.930> into

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
should have just gone in at out into

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.770 
should have just gone in at out into
Sharpedo<00:04:19.310> because<00:04:19.729> it's<00:04:19.910> dark<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.540> I

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
Sharpedo because it's dark and I

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.360 
Sharpedo because it's dark and I
couldn't<00:04:20.810> hurt<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.410> with<00:04:21.530> my<00:04:21.680> psychic<00:04:21.889> attacks

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
couldn't hurt it with my psychic attacks

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.430 
couldn't hurt it with my psychic attacks
but<00:04:25.000> coffee<00:04:26.000> girgis<00:04:26.389> takes<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.840> all<00:04:27.080> right

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
but coffee girgis takes that all right

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.920 
but coffee girgis takes that all right
and<00:04:27.710> now<00:04:27.740> he<00:04:28.280> goes<00:04:28.580> into<00:04:28.639> Sharpedo<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.780> would

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
and now he goes into Sharpedo that would

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.029 
and now he goes into Sharpedo that would
have<00:04:30.050> been<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.289> smart<00:04:30.560> play<00:04:30.680> originally<00:04:31.539> so<00:04:32.539> I

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
have been the smart play originally so I

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.980 
have been the smart play originally so I
just<00:04:34.039> go<00:04:34.220> with<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.400> toxic<00:04:34.880> here<00:04:35.150> crunch<00:04:35.570> does<00:04:35.810> a

just go with a toxic here crunch does a
lot<00:04:36.320> of<00:04:36.380> damage<00:04:36.740> but<00:04:37.300> good<00:04:38.300> old<00:04:38.479> brick<00:04:38.900> wall

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
lot of damage but good old brick wall

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.990 
lot of damage but good old brick wall
alamo<00:04:39.590> molla<00:04:39.800> here<00:04:40.070> can<00:04:40.220> take<00:04:40.400> it<00:04:40.550> just<00:04:40.699> fine

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
alamo molla here can take it just fine

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.640 
alamo molla here can take it just fine
and<00:04:42.490> I've<00:04:43.490> got<00:04:43.880> to<00:04:44.000> toxic<00:04:44.389> up<00:04:44.539> on<00:04:44.690> Sharpedo<00:04:45.260> so

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
and I've got to toxic up on Sharpedo so

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.529 
and I've got to toxic up on Sharpedo so
I'm<00:04:45.919> just<00:04:46.100> going<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.280> go<00:04:46.370> with<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.639> wish<00:04:47.120> here

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
I'm just going to go with a wish here

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.719 
I'm just going to go with a wish here

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
and protect on the next turn

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.550 
and protect on the next turn
guaranteeing<00:04:50.539> that<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:50.840> get<00:04:51.020> my<00:04:51.050> health<00:04:51.500> back

guaranteeing that I get my health back

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.689 
guaranteeing that I get my health back
and<00:04:52.750> show<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.990> slowly<00:04:54.740> but<00:04:55.070> surely<00:04:55.490> the

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
and show and slowly but surely the

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.960 
and show and slowly but surely the
Sharpedo<00:04:56.120> is<00:04:56.449> actually<00:04:56.960> going<00:04:57.169> down<00:04:57.470> so

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
Sharpedo is actually going down so

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.820 
Sharpedo is actually going down so
that's<00:04:58.970> good<00:04:59.240> now<00:05:00.200> he's<00:05:00.349> gonna<00:05:00.470> go<00:05:00.680> into

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
that's good now he's gonna go into

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.100 
that's good now he's gonna go into
roserade<00:05:01.250> and<00:05:01.729> my<00:05:02.240> protect<00:05:02.630> didn't<00:05:02.930> matter

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
roserade and my protect didn't matter

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.100 
roserade and my protect didn't matter
but<00:05:03.710> I<00:05:03.950> do<00:05:04.010> get<00:05:04.370> my<00:05:04.520> wish<00:05:04.760> back<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.330> this<00:05:05.840> thing

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
but I do get my wish back and this thing

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.589 
but I do get my wish back and this thing
resists<00:05:06.650> toxic<00:05:07.160> so<00:05:07.490> I'm<00:05:07.820> going<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.300> have<00:05:08.389> to<00:05:08.450> go

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
resists toxic so I'm going to have to go

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.770 
resists toxic so I'm going to have to go
into<00:05:08.750> something<00:05:09.139> else<00:05:09.849> and<00:05:10.849> he<00:05:11.330> starts<00:05:11.599> laying

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
into something else and he starts laying

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.500 
into something else and he starts laying
down<00:05:12.050> spikes<00:05:12.639> now<00:05:13.639> I<00:05:13.669> found<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:14.240> interesting

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
down spikes now I found this interesting

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.029 
down spikes now I found this interesting
because<00:05:14.990> if<00:05:15.470> he<00:05:15.740> would<00:05:15.889> have<00:05:15.979> just

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
because if he would have just

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.219 
because if he would have just
straight-up<00:05:16.550> attack<00:05:17.000> me<00:05:17.240> with<00:05:17.570> his<00:05:17.810> roserade

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
straight-up attack me with his roserade

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.589 
straight-up attack me with his roserade
he<00:05:18.590> probably<00:05:19.010> could<00:05:19.550> have<00:05:19.580> killed<00:05:19.970> my<00:05:20.270> alma

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:20.599 
he probably could have killed my alma

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.460 
he probably could have killed my alma
moa<00:05:20.810> maybe<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:22.630> don't<00:05:23.630> know<00:05:23.720> Elmo<00:05:24.139> mole<00:05:24.320> is

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
moa maybe I don't know Elmo mole is

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.150 
moa maybe I don't know Elmo mole is
pretty<00:05:24.710> hard<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:24.950> kill<00:05:26.260> but<00:05:27.260> he<00:05:27.680> was<00:05:27.710> a<00:05:27.800> some

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
pretty hard to kill but he was a some

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.779 
pretty hard to kill but he was a some
hidden<00:05:28.400> power<00:05:28.669> there<00:05:29.030> I<00:05:29.300> think<00:05:30.139> it<00:05:30.289> I<00:05:30.789> figured

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
hidden power there I think it I figured

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.250 
hidden power there I think it I figured
out<00:05:31.910> what<00:05:32.060> it<00:05:32.150> was<00:05:32.360> while<00:05:32.690> I<00:05:32.720> was<00:05:32.840> recording

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
out what it was while I was recording

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.070 
out what it was while I was recording
this<00:05:33.530> but<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.830> forget<00:05:34.220> I<00:05:34.490> think<00:05:35.419> I<00:05:35.630> send<00:05:35.960> out

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
this but I forget I think I send out

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.839 
this but I forget I think I send out
something<00:05:36.530> else<00:05:36.650> and<00:05:36.950> it<00:05:37.160> uses<00:05:37.310> that<00:05:37.550> same

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
something else and it uses that same

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.490 
something else and it uses that same
hidden<00:05:38.060> power<00:05:38.360> on<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:38.780> next<00:05:39.020> thing<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.200> send

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
hidden power on the next thing I send

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.300 
hidden power on the next thing I send
out<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:40.820> if<00:05:41.630> he<00:05:42.080> tried<00:05:42.349> to<00:05:42.470> use<00:05:42.590> it<00:05:42.620> on<00:05:42.860> alamo

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
out so if he tried to use it on alamo

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.339 
out so if he tried to use it on alamo
molla<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:43.940> it<00:05:44.240> was<00:05:44.360> super<00:05:44.570> effective<00:05:44.750> against

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
molla and it was super effective against

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:49.120 
molla and it was super effective against
zapdos<00:05:46.030> it<00:05:47.030> was<00:05:47.210> probably<00:05:47.810> HP<00:05:48.440> ice<00:05:48.680> or

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
zapdos it was probably HP ice or

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:57.129 
zapdos it was probably HP ice or
something<00:05:50.710> maybe<00:05:52.479> HP<00:05:53.479> fighting<00:05:53.990> even<00:05:55.570> but<00:05:56.570> it

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
something maybe HP fighting even but it

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.850 
something maybe HP fighting even but it
really<00:05:57.470> looks<00:05:57.740> like<00:05:57.860> HP<00:05:58.729> AAG<00:05:58.970> ice

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
really looks like HP AAG ice

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.559 
really looks like HP AAG ice
so<00:06:01.870> yeah<00:06:02.870> that's<00:06:03.020> just<00:06:03.139> my<00:06:03.439> guess<00:06:04.389> could<00:06:05.389> also

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:05.569 
so yeah that's just my guess could also

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.659 
so yeah that's just my guess could also
be<00:06:05.870> fighting<00:06:06.319> I<00:06:06.530> didn't<00:06:07.099> get<00:06:07.189> to<00:06:07.250> see<00:06:07.460> what<00:06:07.580> it

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
be fighting I didn't get to see what it

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.689 
be fighting I didn't get to see what it
was<00:06:07.909> but<00:06:08.840> he's<00:06:09.259> also<00:06:09.439> got<00:06:09.680> giga<00:06:09.979> drain<00:06:10.189> so<00:06:10.669> I

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
was but he's also got giga drain so I

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.279

in alamo molla left and this rosy red
can<00:06:34.129> handle<00:06:34.610> them<00:06:34.819> pretty<00:06:35.360> easily<00:06:35.949> at<00:06:36.949> this

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
to wish into Blastoise here and you just

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.159 
to wish into Blastoise here and you just
set<00:06:55.219> up<00:06:55.340> sets<00:06:55.759> up<00:06:55.909> more<00:06:56.120> spikes<00:06:56.509> I<00:06:56.779> really

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
set up sets up more spikes I really

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.730 
set up sets up more spikes I really
don't<00:06:57.259> get<00:06:57.409> what<00:06:57.529> the<00:06:57.590> point<00:06:57.680> of<00:06:57.889> that<00:06:57.949> is<00:06:59.740> but

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:00.740 
don't get what the point of that is but

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.269 
don't get what the point of that is but
yeah<00:07:01.310> it's<00:07:01.669> a<00:07:02.500> looking<00:07:03.500> pretty<00:07:03.740> bad<00:07:03.949> at<00:07:04.159> this

00:07:04.269 --> 00:07:04.279 
yeah it's a looking pretty bad at this

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:08.230 
yeah it's a looking pretty bad at this
point<00:07:05.050> so<00:07:06.050> I<00:07:06.080> wish<00:07:06.589> up<00:07:06.860> going<00:07:07.490> to<00:07:07.550> Blastoise

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 
point so I wish up going to Blastoise

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.350 
point so I wish up going to Blastoise
and<00:07:08.599> I<00:07:09.319> barely<00:07:09.620> survived<00:07:10.099> the<00:07:10.190> spikes<00:07:10.639> can't

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
and I barely survived the spikes can't

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.050 
and I barely survived the spikes can't
survive<00:07:11.659> a<00:07:12.050> sludge<00:07:12.620> bomb<00:07:12.860> so<00:07:13.370> Alamo<00:07:13.849> molla

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
survive a sludge bomb so Alamo molla

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.230 
survive a sludge bomb so Alamo molla
comes<00:07:14.360> back<00:07:14.569> in<00:07:14.889> and<00:07:15.889> it's<00:07:16.490> fitting<00:07:16.969> that<00:07:17.000> this

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
comes back in and it's fitting that this

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.719 
comes back in and it's fitting that this
is<00:07:17.389> my<00:07:17.539> last<00:07:17.719> pokemon<00:07:18.279> basically<00:07:19.279> the<00:07:19.520> only

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729 
is my last pokemon basically the only

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.600 
is my last pokemon basically the only
way<00:07:20.089> this<00:07:20.330> thing<00:07:20.389> ever<00:07:20.839> dies<00:07:21.169> is<00:07:21.589> if<00:07:21.949> all<00:07:22.190> of<00:07:22.250> my

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:22.610 
way this thing ever dies is if all of my

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.959 
way this thing ever dies is if all of my
other<00:07:22.819> pokemon<00:07:23.150> dies<00:07:23.599> well<00:07:24.219> so<00:07:25.219> yeah<00:07:25.699> he<00:07:25.729> gets

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:25.969 
other pokemon dies well so yeah he gets

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:27.909 
other pokemon dies well so yeah he gets
a<00:07:26.120> critical<00:07:26.509> hit<00:07:26.629> there<00:07:26.900> I<00:07:27.199> probably<00:07:27.529> could

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 
a critical hit there I probably could

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:29.709 
a critical hit there I probably could
have<00:07:27.949> lived<00:07:28.219> for<00:07:28.400> another<00:07:28.729> few<00:07:29.029> turns<00:07:29.060> if<00:07:29.569> I

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:29.719 
have lived for another few turns if I

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.610 
have lived for another few turns if I
wanted<00:07:29.990> to<00:07:30.050> stall<00:07:30.680> and<00:07:31.930> it<00:07:32.930> kind<00:07:33.229> of<00:07:33.319> looks

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620
