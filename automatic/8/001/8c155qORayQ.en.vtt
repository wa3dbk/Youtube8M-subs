00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.640
 I servus with alex corner 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.020
 containers and welcome to 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.460
 a new video on a channel 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.630
 Today it's a bit about mine 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.550
 impressions on a new game mode 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.790
 namely carrier resort this was with 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.830
 the first dresden.de cms triangle 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.390
 added to the many and has been for 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.420
 yesterday therefore always for premium 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.550
 available since monday 31 march 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.660
 must be a goal if he's off so well 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.080
 that is still not in the now 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.690
 hands then slides open and easy 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.980
 Already it's off in two weeks 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.420
 it is not so far then 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.700
 bring I show you a bit 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.950
 gameplay of the mep lost 1 im 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.379
 career mode if you still have other webs 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.550
 will be seen then tonight 19 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.740
 30 years of war is always on 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.360
 a bit nervous trike with the hcl 66 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.039
 in connection there is wrong time to do so 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.479
 that kind of people shared so well 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.369
 just turn on my hiphop 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:20.350
 ska and with it his left in the 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:24.100
 description of this beauty field 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.690
 So no soundtrack I wanted was one 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.460
 a little bit about the carrier soap mode 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.539
 tell is basically a mixture 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.280
 from conquest and rush 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.530
 the objective is following each team 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.439
 Therefore , a plane carrier has a career 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.200
 also caries and in the beginning it is about 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.880
 take hold flags congress 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.140
 And to keep that simple is that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.390
 basic rocket positions the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.100
 violets carriern continuously with 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.780
 rockets and thus his 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000
 damage outer shell so much that 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.790
 you may have been at some point this is at 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.229
 50 carrier helped you have to happen too 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.509
 wait a few seconds until about 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.890
 the fallen came to 41 percent and 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.900
 then you can go in there 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.750
 it's about two and cons to 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.630
 destroy the first one is in the trade around that 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.979
 second machine is so easy and so 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.140
 if they broke and you won 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.640
 the thing goes up and down small sequence 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.650
 and is just silly and around 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.570
 apparently when we die them 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.489
 boring because I think that this 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.890
 carriers place mode from the battlefield 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.140
 21 42 part comes out and actually 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.299
 an adaptation of the titan mode is 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.489
 Mode is a bit of a breeze 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.870
 horny added so you have adversaries 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.790
 somehow much more action 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.370
 you had to come back at the end and 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.989
 somehow it felt like one here 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.959
 here it is only now kongo is then 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.430
 it's not me, it's not me 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.400
 believe me even remember correctly gets 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.480
 you even bankrupt thomas jÃ¼rgens and 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.920
 Girls I have to again exactly 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.110
 check if you already noticed 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.400
 have writes the comments are what 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.569
 but definitely new is holger 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.800
 kreft you can order a few road 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.220
 make kids and there is a little 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.959
 success 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.160
 kill me softly means he believes me and 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.319
 make some pretty funny scenes 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.239
 the 40 is of course also at the start of it 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.930
 gives a few new weapons the 160 the 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.700
 aws for example there are deadlines 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.019
 and also not the triple canadian 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.239
 believes that's about it so far as 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.150
 new weapons to level strike everything 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.379
 pretty cool but nothing now 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.790
 earth-shattering 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.540
 By the way, there was a small patch too 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.849
 nervous strike because that contained one 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.530
 smaller for the g36 c many say themselves 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.670
 now a bit like the new 16 find 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.360
 I do not shoot it anymore 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.950
 still too slow 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.200
 one simply writes the new law 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.390
 already played as you find her 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.890
 But back to the carrier place motors in 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.390
 There are two variants how to do it 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.489
 on the one hand can play completely 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.379
 aggressive so all bankruptcy plates first 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.700
 an old one for a few minutes then 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.040
 he goes at some point the enemy 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.330
 carrier on and then the whole team 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.519
 Just send everything in to destroy everything 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.110
 and that just faster than that 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:45.519
 opponent 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.959
 sounds boring now it is in the reason 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.670
 it is nothing else than mixing 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.170
 from congress quickly even if he is one 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.610
 So it's not funny 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.010
 that 's fun when you 're there 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.330
 a little bit on it then has 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.849
 you already feel that you really 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.799
 any case better city bus so you have to 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.690
 well, yes 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.250
 it does not feel like it now 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.620
 is a fight on life and death and 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.890
 enemy here carrier becomes velvet here man 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.629
 and mouse go down but you already have 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.760
 is very interesting and takes care of 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.940
 a little bit of dynamics opposite 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.370
 wash conquest where yes yes the parts 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.599
 by carries are just just the specially 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.489
 pfalz you understand what I mean 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.289
 every case 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.240
 It's nothing new, but it's nothing 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:26.800
 so refreshing so a mean thing 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.020
 not what I was hoping for 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.110
 but still funny is enough 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.880
 metaphors and enough drumming around it 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.470
 is actually quite simple to 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.400
 warstein again full and can on it 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.930
 makes the enemy team break 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.400
 faster than a broken one or one 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.280
 really defends with all men 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.249
 230 or 16 or whatever in 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.319
 own carriers 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.579
 but not so funny after yours 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.809
 a little something else because 

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.889
 somehow you get through this and 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.509
 then maybe there are five people or 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.159
 so in your own money so the 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.359
 guarded enemy carrier and then 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.589
 that's nothing special 

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:58.199
 just faster than the opponent 

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:59.669
 and somehow it's not that hard 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.139
 if you 're a well-rehearsed team than he is 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.189
 somehow not so exciting comes here 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.519
 a lot i believe in the team 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.959
 balance off well but that's just it 

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:08.849
 you want to see more of caries then 

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:10.889
 Do not forget to switch on this evening 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.109
 that was my first impression so far 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.399
 nervous strike if you're upset now 

00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:15.359
 I'll have more then but before me 

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.919
 Everything which has fallen like 

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:18.719
 just surround a download and 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.610
 Of course, write a comment what 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.949
 did not you like and what you a 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.789
 navy strike as general field or what 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.619
 you do not like it 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.169
 See you later on my hit box 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:29.099
 can be together with the hc 666 i am 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:30.719
 put out at this 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.849
 we 'll be in the next video or im
