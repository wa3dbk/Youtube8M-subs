00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
but I was trying that and it seemed like

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.439 
but I was trying that and it seemed like
every<00:00:19.560> time<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.189> ripping<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> CD<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
every time I was just ripping the CD to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.340 
every time I was just ripping the CD to
the<00:00:21.990> PC<00:00:22.980> converting<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> mp3<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.810> then

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the PC converting to mp3 and then

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.839 
the PC converting to mp3 and then
uploading<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.980> google<00:00:26.250> play<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.670> took

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
uploading the google play it took

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.529 
uploading the google play it took
forever<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:28.039> just<00:00:29.039> wasn't<00:00:29.640> efficient<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
forever and just wasn't efficient and it

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.749 
forever and just wasn't efficient and it
did<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.840> store<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> metadata<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.430> basically

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
did not store the metadata so basically

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.510 
did not store the metadata so basically
I<00:00:33.210> wanted<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.170> motion<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.920> my<00:00:35.040> google<00:00:35.340> play

converter<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.430> we'll<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.670> open<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.940> real

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
converter so we'll just open that real

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.730 
converter so we'll just open that real
quick<00:01:05.270> can<00:01:06.270> also<00:01:06.420> go<00:01:06.689> ahead<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.960> open<00:01:07.409> up

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
quick can also go ahead and open up

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.969 
quick can also go ahead and open up
Google<00:01:08.400> Play<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> I'll<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> ahead<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
Google Play and I'll go ahead and make a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.130 
Google Play and I'll go ahead and make a
folder<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.850> mp3<00:01:12.150> temp<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.780> Google

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
folder I just have mp3 temp to Google

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.679 
folder I just have mp3 temp to Google
Play<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.770> that's<00:01:13.950> where<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> conversion<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Play so that's where a conversion the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.770 
Play so that's where a conversion the
folder<00:01:15.930> I'm<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> use<00:01:16.790> will<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.450> as

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
folder I'm going to use will go so as

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.480 
folder I'm going to use will go so as
this<00:01:19.110> converts<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.799> dumps<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> into<00:01:20.400> this

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this converts it dumps it into this

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.980 
this converts it dumps it into this
folder<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.360> will<00:01:21.390> upload<00:01:21.840> it

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
folder and it will upload it

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.880 
folder and it will upload it
simultaneously<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.710> minimize<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
simultaneously so I just minimize that

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.719 
simultaneously so I just minimize that
for<00:01:26.130> now<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.560> easy<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.460> use

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
for now so this is kind of easy to use

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.510 
for now so this is kind of easy to use
but<00:01:30.150> we'll<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.900> some<00:01:31.140> options<00:01:32.100> real<00:01:32.340> quick

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
but we'll do some options real quick

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.060 
but we'll do some options real quick
just<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.470> kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> set<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:34.920> how<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
just so you can kind of set it up how I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.450 
just so you can kind of set it up how I
do<00:01:35.240> general<00:01:36.240> settings<00:01:36.920> encoder<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.310> use

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
do general settings encoder just use
