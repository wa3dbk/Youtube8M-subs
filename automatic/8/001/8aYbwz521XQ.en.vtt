00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
because I ended up having to use um my

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.740 
because I ended up having to use um my
barrel<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:11.370> make<00:02:11.550> bigger<00:02:11.760> curls<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.360> tomorrow

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
barrel to make bigger curls but tomorrow

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.479 
barrel to make bigger curls but tomorrow
I'm<00:02:12.930> gonna<00:02:13.049> try<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.319> just<00:02:13.590> twist<00:02:13.829> it<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.219> think

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
I'm gonna try to just twist it I think

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.699 
I'm gonna try to just twist it I think
it<00:02:14.700> would<00:02:14.790> be

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
it would be

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.400 
it would be
good<00:02:16.550> so<00:02:16.849> she's<00:02:17.060> really<00:02:17.239> soft<00:02:17.629> she's<00:02:18.080> really

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
good so she's really soft she's really

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.850 
good so she's really soft she's really
really<00:02:18.650> nice<00:02:19.330> she<00:02:20.330> fits<00:02:20.569> me<00:02:20.810> really<00:02:20.989> well<00:02:21.170> so

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
really nice she fits me really well so

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.380 
really nice she fits me really well so
I'm<00:02:22.160> thinking<00:02:22.519> I<00:02:22.610> really<00:02:22.640> like<00:02:23.030> her<00:02:23.180> y'all

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
I'm thinking I really like her y'all

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.570 
I'm thinking I really like her y'all
what<00:02:23.660> do<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.810> think<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.410> mean<00:02:25.250> I<00:02:25.280> think<00:02:25.370> she

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
what do you think I mean I think she

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.280 
what do you think I mean I think she
came<00:02:25.730> out<00:02:25.879> really<00:02:26.090> really<00:02:26.209> pretty<00:02:26.599> very<00:02:26.810> cute

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
came out really really pretty very cute

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.729 
came out really really pretty very cute
very<00:02:27.319> sub<00:02:27.950> rich<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.849> think<00:02:29.690> if<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.290> don't<00:02:30.440> have

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
very sub rich I think if you don't have

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.850 
very sub rich I think if you don't have
leave<00:02:31.040> out<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.700> front<00:02:31.970> or<00:02:32.620> enough<00:02:33.620> hair

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
leave out for the front or enough hair

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.759 
leave out for the front or enough hair
to<00:02:33.890> pull<00:02:34.310> out<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.670> still<00:02:35.060> think<00:02:35.330> she<00:02:35.650> would<00:02:36.650> look

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
to pull out I still think she would look

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.380 
to pull out I still think she would look
fine<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.250> using<00:02:37.549> her<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:37.760> a<00:02:37.790> simple<00:02:38.209> cat

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
fine just using her as a simple cat

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.920 
fine just using her as a simple cat
because<00:02:38.750> she<00:02:39.459> she's<00:02:40.459> very<00:02:40.730> easy<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.239> maneuver

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
because she she's very easy to maneuver

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.289 
because she she's very easy to maneuver
she<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.680> parted<00:02:43.129> on<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.430> side<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.030> you

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
she is parted on this side and you

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.880 
she is parted on this side and you
because<00:02:44.720> it's<00:02:44.870> not<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.019> lace<00:02:45.260> plan<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.650> can't

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
because it's not a lace plan you can't

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.039 
because it's not a lace plan you can't
you<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.400> move<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.879> around<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.480> has<00:02:47.660> to<00:02:47.840> kind

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
you know move that around it has to kind

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.750 
you know move that around it has to kind
of<00:02:48.110> stay<00:02:48.319> there<00:02:48.349> but<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.280> know<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.459> can

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
of stay there but you know you can

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.970 
of stay there but you know you can
maneuver<00:02:50.030> her<00:02:50.420> kind<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.260> wear<00:02:51.410> her<00:02:51.530> sideways

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
maneuver her kind of wear her sideways

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.710 
maneuver her kind of wear her sideways
down<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.370> middle<00:02:52.549> you<00:02:52.849> know<00:02:52.970> play<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:53.599> her

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
down the middle you know play with her

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.449 
down the middle you know play with her
but<00:02:53.930> for<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.680> most<00:02:54.829> part<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.069> think<00:02:55.280> she's

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
but for the most part I think she's

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.440 
but for the most part I think she's
really<00:02:55.640> really<00:02:55.790> pretty<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.069> her<00:02:58.400> if<00:02:58.760> you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
really really pretty this is her if you

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.059 
really really pretty this is her if you
like<00:02:59.690> that<00:02:59.900> color<00:03:00.140> gf2<00:03:01.540> 3033<00:03:02.540> this<00:03:03.470> color<00:03:03.739> dia

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
like that color gf2 3033 this color dia

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.990 
like that color gf2 3033 this color dia
x<00:03:04.459> @<00:03:04.760> DX<00:03:05.510> 3<00:03:05.840> 3<00:03:06.049> 4<00:03:06.290> 7<00:03:06.680> is<00:03:06.799> very<00:03:07.099> similar<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.579> that

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
x @ DX 3 3 4 7 is very similar to that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.180 
x @ DX 3 3 4 7 is very similar to that
the<00:03:08.510> only<00:03:08.750> difference<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.410> found<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:10.010> that

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
the only difference I found is that

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.460 
the only difference I found is that
instead<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.910> being<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.239> 27<00:03:11.930> up<00:03:12.019> here<00:03:12.260> it's

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
instead of it being the 27 up here it's

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.960 
instead of it being the 27 up here it's
a<00:03:12.739> little<00:03:13.190> bit<00:03:13.430> of<00:03:13.610> a<00:03:13.900> more<00:03:14.900> orange<00:03:15.530> base<00:03:15.879> 27<00:03:16.879> if

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
a little bit of a more orange base 27 if

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.610 
a little bit of a more orange base 27 if
that<00:03:17.120> makes<00:03:17.329> sense<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.810> don't<00:03:18.260> think<00:03:18.410> it<00:03:18.530> looks

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
that makes sense I don't think it looks

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.349 
that makes sense I don't think it looks
that<00:03:18.769> orange<00:03:19.430> E<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.889> it's<00:03:22.489> just<00:03:22.970> slightly

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
that orange E but it it's just slightly

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.140 
that orange E but it it's just slightly
slightly<00:03:24.049> different<00:03:24.769> then<00:03:24.980> did<00:03:25.639> you<00:03:25.670> have<00:03:25.850> to

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
slightly different then did you have to

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.020 
slightly different then did you have to
30<00:03:26.450> 33<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.109> yeah<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:28.280> one<00:03:28.459> last<00:03:28.639> look<00:03:28.850> at<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
30 33 so yeah so one last look at the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.050 
30 33 so yeah so one last look at the
unit<00:03:29.389> this<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.690> her<00:03:30.340> she's<00:03:31.340> really<00:03:31.579> stop<00:03:31.819> I

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
unit this is her she's really stop I

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.370
