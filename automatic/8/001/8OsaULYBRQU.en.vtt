00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.189 

so<00:00:35.039> I've<00:00:35.789> already<00:00:36.210> said<00:00:36.449> it<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.839> it's

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
so I've already said it but it's

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.639 
so I've already said it but it's
insignificant<00:00:38.089> so<00:00:39.089> you<00:00:39.180> can<00:00:39.359> see<00:00:39.539> the<00:00:39.690> process

empty you can get several drumsticks to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.109 
empty you can get several drumsticks to
it<00:00:47.969> just<00:00:48.180> press<00:00:48.449> it<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.850> another<00:00:50.850> choice

equip you after you have installed pure
joy<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.089> can<00:00:57.269> start<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.780> hydrogen<00:00:58.289> input

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
joy you can start the hydrogen input

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.479 
joy you can start the hydrogen input
program<00:00:59.010> on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.239> left<00:01:00.269> you<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
program on the left you see you the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.490 
program on the left you see you the
input<00:01:02.489> program<00:01:02.960> when<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:03.989> fault

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
input program when you fault

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.700 
input program when you fault
the<00:01:05.309> left<00:01:06.240> control<00:01:06.450> will<00:01:06.840> bound<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.289> drastic

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the left control will bound to drastic

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.380 
the left control will bound to drastic
one<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.880> white<00:01:09.030> control<00:01:09.450> upon<00:01:09.780> -<00:01:09.899> Tracy<00:01:10.259> -

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
one and the white control upon - Tracy -

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
one and the white control upon - Tracy -
unfortunately<00:01:12.740> then<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> dolphin<00:01:14.220> does<00:01:14.340> not

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
unfortunately then a dolphin does not

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.219 
unfortunately then a dolphin does not
differentiate<00:01:15.179> between<00:01:15.479> two<00:01:16.080> different

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
differentiate between two different

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.399 
differentiate between two different
rustics<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.759> we'll<00:01:17.940> need<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> bind<00:01:18.539> every

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
rustics so we'll need to bind every

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.820 
rustics so we'll need to bind every
function<00:01:19.920> onto<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.399> drastic<00:01:21.710> therefore<00:01:22.710> we

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
function onto one drastic therefore we

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.160 
function onto one drastic therefore we
have<00:01:23.009> 16<00:01:23.580> buttons<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.470> 8<00:01:25.470> X's<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.549> just

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
have 16 buttons and 8 X's and just

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
have 16 buttons and 8 X's and just
select<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> want<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.119> also<00:01:30.270> load

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
select what you want you can also load
