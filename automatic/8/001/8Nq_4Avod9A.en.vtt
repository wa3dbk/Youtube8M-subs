00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.489 
that's the reason I agree with them is
uh<00:01:22.679> their<00:01:23.670> basis<00:01:23.999> for<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.240> decision<00:01:24.359> is<00:01:24.810> this

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:25.499 
uh their basis for the decision is this

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:28.489 
uh their basis for the decision is this
institution<00:01:26.399> is<00:01:26.549> religious<00:01:27.179> and<00:01:27.479> its<00:01:28.229> main

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
institution is religious and its main

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.109 
institution is religious and its main
point<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> be<00:01:29.189> religious<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.850> it's<00:01:29.999> a

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
point is to be religious so if it's a

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.639 
point is to be religious so if it's a
public<00:01:30.450> high<00:01:30.600> school<00:01:30.840> obviously<00:01:31.499> they<00:01:31.619> can't

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
public high school obviously they can't

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.770

do<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> right<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.209> it's<00:01:33.359> something<00:01:33.539> that's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
do it right and if it's something that's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.830
