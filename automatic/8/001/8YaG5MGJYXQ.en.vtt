the water with like 10 first-round picks
or<00:03:14.770> something<00:03:15.100> I<00:03:15.160> think<00:03:15.190> they<00:03:15.430> intend<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.760> pick

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270 
or something I think they intend to pick
as<00:03:16.810> snow<00:03:17.200> he<00:03:17.350> said<00:03:17.590> when<00:03:17.740> you<00:03:17.800> have<00:03:17.950> the<00:03:18.130> first

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
as snow he said when you have the first

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.130 
as snow he said when you have the first
pick<00:03:18.490> overall<00:03:18.670> it<00:03:19.060> is<00:03:19.120> kind<00:03:19.390> of<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.690> momentous

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
pick overall it is kind of a momentous

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.710 
pick overall it is kind of a momentous
day<00:03:20.320> for<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:21.330> organization<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.540> think

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
day for the organization and I think

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.600 
day for the organization and I think
he's<00:03:22.810> going<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.050> pick<00:03:23.230> with<00:03:23.440> Tampa<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.340> think

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
he's going to pick with Tampa I think

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.180 
he's going to pick with Tampa I think
Brian's<00:03:25.000> listening<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> lot<00:03:26.890> of<00:03:26.920> teams

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
Brian's listening and to a lot of teams

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.310 
Brian's listening and to a lot of teams
but<00:03:27.550> they<00:03:27.940> feel<00:03:28.540> strongly<00:03:28.900> they're<00:03:29.140> going<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
but they feel strongly they're going to

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.810 
but they feel strongly they're going to
get<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.440> pretty<00:03:29.710> good<00:03:29.860> player<00:03:30.070> with<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.580> pick

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
get a pretty good player with that pick

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.640 
get a pretty good player with that pick
and<00:03:31.000> someone's<00:03:31.990> gonna<00:03:32.110> have<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.290> blow<00:03:32.530> him

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
and someone's gonna have to blow him

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.610 
and someone's gonna have to blow him
away<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.100> price<00:03:33.340> tag<00:03:33.670> for<00:03:34.540> us<00:03:34.690> leading<00:03:35.260> into

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
away the price tag for us leading into

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.520 
away the price tag for us leading into
this<00:03:35.740> has<00:03:36.010> always<00:03:36.190> included<00:03:36.850> Luke<00:03:37.720> Schenn<00:03:37.990> and

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
this has always included Luke Schenn and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.680 
this has always included Luke Schenn and
that's<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:39.070> non-starter<00:03:39.430> for<00:03:39.850> us<00:03:39.940> so<00:03:40.300> they<00:03:40.450> say

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
that's a non-starter for us so they say

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.840 
that's a non-starter for us so they say
well<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:41.080> would<00:03:41.590> consider<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.340> if<00:03:42.610> Luke's

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
well we would consider this if Luke's

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.000 
well we would consider this if Luke's
ends<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.300> the<00:03:43.390> deal<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.840> that's<00:03:44.650> when<00:03:44.860> it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
ends in the deal and that's when it

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.620 
ends in the deal and that's when it
stops<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:45.640> there<00:03:45.760> was<00:03:45.850> still<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.150> potential

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
stops so there was still the potential

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.900 
stops so there was still the potential
there<00:03:46.810> for<00:03:47.080> a<00:03:47.110> deal<00:03:47.320> with<00:03:47.470> Tampa<00:03:47.800> Don<00:03:48.550> Waddell

who<00:05:26.900> do<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.080> think<00:05:27.230> the<00:05:27.290> Islanders<00:05:27.590> will<00:05:27.740> take

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
who do you think the Islanders will take

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.150 
who do you think the Islanders will take
with<00:05:28.010> the<00:05:28.100> number<00:05:28.280> one<00:05:28.430> pick<00:05:29.590> well<00:05:30.590> I<00:05:30.920> think

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
with the number one pick well I think

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.580 
with the number one pick well I think
they're<00:05:31.490> going<00:05:31.580> to<00:05:31.670> take<00:05:31.850> a<00:05:31.880> forward<00:05:32.240> and<00:05:32.590> I

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
they're going to take a forward and I

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.680 
they're going to take a forward and I
would<00:05:34.160> have<00:05:34.280> said<00:05:34.490> until<00:05:34.970> recently<00:05:35.420> they<00:05:35.660> were

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
would have said until recently they were

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.140 
would have said until recently they were
going<00:05:35.900> to<00:05:35.960> take<00:05:36.310> Victor<00:05:37.310> headman<00:05:37.610> but<00:05:37.820> I<00:05:37.850> think

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
going to take Victor headman but I think

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.220 
going to take Victor headman but I think
they're<00:05:38.270> gonna<00:05:38.390> take<00:05:38.570> it<00:05:38.630> forward

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
they're gonna take it forward

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.960 
they're gonna take it forward
and<00:05:39.320> I<00:05:39.500> think<00:05:39.680> it's<00:05:39.770> between<00:05:40.010> Matt<00:05:40.580> Duchene

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
and I think it's between Matt Duchene

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.330 
and I think it's between Matt Duchene
and<00:05:41.540> Jonathan<00:05:42.230> Taveras<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:42.830> I<00:05:42.890> would<00:05:43.070> give

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
and Jonathan Taveras and I would give

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.860 
and Jonathan Taveras and I would give
the<00:05:43.460> nod<00:05:43.610> to<00:05:43.640> Matt<00:05:44.120> to<00:05:44.270> saying<00:05:44.510> that<00:05:44.660> would<00:05:44.750> be

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
the nod to Matt to saying that would be

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.920 
the nod to Matt to saying that would be
my<00:05:45.020> wow<00:05:45.290> thanks<00:05:45.590> for<00:05:45.650> doing<00:05:45.860> this
