00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
lot of times this will come in a set of

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.780 
lot of times this will come in a set of
three<00:00:18.780> pack<00:00:19.020> or<00:00:19.230> something<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.490> just<00:00:20.670> a

there's<00:00:22.620> no<00:00:22.800> read<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.280> it<00:00:23.430> it's<00:00:23.610> a<00:00:23.670> very<00:00:23.820> simple

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
there's no read to it it's a very simple

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.390 
there's no read to it it's a very simple
call<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.200> it<00:00:25.470> does<00:00:25.650> other<00:00:25.860> things<00:00:25.950> like<00:00:26.340> a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
call and it does other things like a

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.279 
call and it does other things like a
pintail<00:00:26.850> and<00:00:27.240> wood<00:00:27.450> duck<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> things<00:00:28.140> like

that too but I'm gonna show you how to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.990 
that too but I'm gonna show you how to
use<00:00:30.810> what<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> call<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.770> Mallard<00:00:32.189> Drake<00:00:32.340> call<00:00:32.700> now

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
use what I call a Mallard Drake call now

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.460 
use what I call a Mallard Drake call now
I<00:00:33.030> suppose<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.570> possible<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:34.050> both<00:00:34.260> the

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
I suppose it's possible that both the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.640 
I suppose it's possible that both the
Drake's<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> hens<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> noise<00:00:35.910> but

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
Drake's and the hens make this noise but

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.990 
Drake's and the hens make this noise but
I've<00:00:37.650> just<00:00:37.920> always<00:00:38.100> been<00:00:38.220> told<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
I've just always been told that it's a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
I've just always been told that it's a
Drake<00:00:39.239> sound<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.140> called<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.829> Mallard

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
Drake sound so I called this Mallard

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.430 
Drake sound so I called this Mallard
Drake<00:00:41.489> call<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:42.899> simple<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.410> use

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
Drake call and it's really simple to use

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
Drake call and it's really simple to use
and<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.130> of<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> contentment<00:00:44.700> call<00:00:44.970> so

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and it's more of a contentment call so

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720 
and it's more of a contentment call so
here's<00:00:45.780> how<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.020> works<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.430> way<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
here's how it works so the way that you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.819 
here's how it works so the way that you
use<00:00:47.880> a<00:00:47.910> six<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:49.170> do<00:00:49.290> a<00:00:49.320> Mallard<00:00:49.710> Drake

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
use a six in one to do a Mallard Drake

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.190 
use a six in one to do a Mallard Drake
call<00:00:50.160> it's<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.730> simple<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.690> bite<00:00:51.960> down

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
call it's really simple just bite down

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.139 
call it's really simple just bite down
on<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.530> end<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> mouthpiece<00:00:53.250> here<00:00:53.280> and

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
on the end of the mouthpiece here and

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.729 
on the end of the mouthpiece here and
you<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.270> go<00:00:56.090> like<00:00:57.090> you're<00:00:57.239> making<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.500> sound

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you just go like you're making the sound

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.759 
you just go like you're making the sound
of<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.980> bug<00:00:59.190> zapper<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.730> something<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> if<00:01:04.679> you

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
of a bug zapper or something so if you

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.169 
of a bug zapper or something so if you
turn<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> around<00:01:05.189> you'll<00:01:05.789> hear<00:01:05.999> my<00:01:06.149> voice

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:06.179 
turn it around you'll hear my voice

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:11.419 
turn it around you'll hear my voice
actually<00:01:06.899> make<00:01:07.139> that<00:01:07.289> sound<00:01:09.679> and<00:01:10.679> you<00:01:11.310> can

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
actually make that sound and you can

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:14.209 
actually make that sound and you can
actually<00:01:11.609> feel<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.359> biting<00:01:12.509> down<00:01:13.219> the

actually feel as you're biting down the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:16.129 
actually feel as you're biting down the
air<00:01:14.579> will<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.179> kind<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.450> vibrate<00:01:15.869> right

00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:16.139 
air will actually kind of vibrate right

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:17.359 
air will actually kind of vibrate right
over<00:01:16.319> the<00:01:16.439> top<00:01:16.649> of<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.889> teeth<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.219> your

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
over the top of your teeth and your

over the top of your teeth and your
tongue<00:01:17.399> right<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.359> call<00:01:18.539> when<00:01:18.749> you're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
tongue right on the call when you're

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.639 
tongue right on the call when you're
doing<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:23.299> the<00:01:24.299> sound<00:01:24.569> on<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.990> call<00:01:25.289> it's

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
doing it and the sound on this call it's

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.319 
doing it and the sound on this call it's
kind<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.039> long<00:01:26.279> drawn-out<00:01:26.670> thing<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
kind of a long drawn-out thing and it

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.899 
kind of a long drawn-out thing and it
kind<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.709> expands<00:01:28.709> a<00:01:28.889> little<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:29.759> volume

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
kind of expands a little bit more volume

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.260 
kind of expands a little bit more volume
towards<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> end<00:01:30.779> of<00:01:30.899> it<00:01:34.670> usually<00:01:35.670> they'll<00:01:36.060> do

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
towards the end of it usually they'll do

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.779 
towards the end of it usually they'll do
two<00:01:36.779> or<00:01:36.929> three<00:01:36.959> of<00:01:37.259> them<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.469> a<00:01:37.499> row<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.130> then

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
two or three of them in a row and then

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.219 
two or three of them in a row and then
you<00:01:39.149> know<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.329> won't<00:01:39.569> hear<00:01:39.749> it<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> while

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you know you won't hear it for a while

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.260 
you know you won't hear it for a while
then<00:01:40.529> you'll<00:01:40.679> hear<00:01:40.859> two<00:01:41.249> or<00:01:41.369> three<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.149> a
