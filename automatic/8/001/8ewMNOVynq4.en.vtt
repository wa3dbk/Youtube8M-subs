table you can actually take this ring
you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.880> take<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> tire<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.470> bead

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you can take the tire and where the bead

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
you can take the tire and where the bead
is<00:01:37.860> normally<00:01:38.280> mounted<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> rim<00:01:39.180> there's<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
is normally mounted on the rim there's a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.440 
is normally mounted on the rim there's a
lip<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.250> inside<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.820> normally<00:01:42.150> would<00:01:42.270> put

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
lip on the inside you normally would put

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.789 
lip on the inside you normally would put
the<00:01:42.540> bead<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.350> conventional

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the bead on there for conventional

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.740 
the bead on there for conventional
running<00:01:44.159> mm-hm<00:01:44.460> you'll<00:01:44.729> move<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.240> bead<00:01:45.479> from

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
running mm-hm you'll move that bead from

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
running mm-hm you'll move that bead from
the<00:01:45.899> outside<00:01:46.320> from<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> inside<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the outside from the inside to the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330 
the outside from the inside to the
outside<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.450> then<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.350> place<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> ring<00:01:49.950> on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
outside and then you place this ring on

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.030 
outside and then you place this ring on
here<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.659> when<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> tighten<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.259> down<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
here and when you tighten it down it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
here and when you tighten it down it
locks<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> between<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.149> ring<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.110> lip

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
locks it between this ring and the lip

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.410 
locks it between this ring and the lip
of<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.470> wheel<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.939> you've<00:01:57.090> done<00:01:57.119> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
of the wheel and so what you've done is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
of the wheel and so what you've done is
you've<00:01:57.600> locked<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.619> bead<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.159> place<00:01:59.189> that's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you've locked that bead in place that's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.280 
you've locked that bead in place that's
how<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.820> get<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.030> bead<00:02:00.270> lock<00:02:00.479> wheel<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.990> now

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
how you get a bead lock wheel and now

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.569 
how you get a bead lock wheel and now
you<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.560> air<00:02:01.710> down<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.159> single<00:02:02.430> digits

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
you could air down to the single digits

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.819 
you could air down to the single digits
and<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.719> go<00:02:03.810> rock<00:02:04.049> crawling<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.710> get

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
and you can go rock crawling you can get

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.730 
and you can go rock crawling you can get
