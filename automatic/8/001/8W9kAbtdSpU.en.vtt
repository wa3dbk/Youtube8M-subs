are in your natural habitat come on skit

00:02:45.959 --> 00:03:01.220 
are in your natural habitat come on skit
at<00:02:46.140> all<00:02:58.489> that<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.640> so<00:02:59.879> strange<00:03:00.269> those<00:03:00.959> animals

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
at all that is so strange those animals

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.690 
at all that is so strange those animals
aren't<00:03:01.769> moving<00:03:01.890> away<00:03:02.129> from<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.459> bus<00:03:02.670> stop<00:03:02.940> I

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
aren't moving away from that bus stop I

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.770 
aren't moving away from that bus stop I
guess<00:03:05.700> these<00:03:05.879> animals<00:03:06.329> are<00:03:06.420> far<00:03:06.750> more

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
guess these animals are far more

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.099 
guess these animals are far more
sophisticated<00:03:07.170> than<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:07.920> thought
