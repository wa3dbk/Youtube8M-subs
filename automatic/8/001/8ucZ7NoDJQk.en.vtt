00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 what if nicolás fishman de supra 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.799
 pixel and today we are going to analyze some 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.120
 brand vinyls we start with the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.759
 people of libran command these vinyls 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.059
 to show his new zebra collection 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.710
 which are similar wood and I also took advantage 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.420
 for some shot for the z3 because 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 it's good to know that for 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.260
 devices that have flat top the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.930
 true that the interesting thing is that they 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 it adds a lot of rigidity and that's good 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.140
 so I'm going to talk about that in a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.269
 I'm going to clarify some things people 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 Libranda sent me to my house slow 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.079
 about a month and a little bit more in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.180
 to arrive and how important and how good 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.510
 they arrive by letter ie they arrive in a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.190
 letter to your house does not pass the problem 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.420
 that you have to go down customs 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.410
 in order to find a package that arrives 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.059
 like a letter like you get the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.890
 invoice of what I had so that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.539
 good movistar is the same thing you get with 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.010
 this may take longer than eye 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.289
 Sometimes it takes a while, it's not the fault of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 brand but it's the fault of the mail 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.500
 Argentine so let's see what what 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.420
 we have here in this case I am with the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.980
 ipad mini I put the zebra vinyl 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.440
 notice that quite big and the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.570
 true that the precision of laser cutting 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 it's spectacular but it really is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.380
 impressive all the bone precision 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.170
 once we place it well and with 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 patience and with desire it is incredible what 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.580
 precise that remains is terrible no longer 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.020
 is not even a half millimeter ran for 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.570
 the side once we put it right 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.490
 eyes now that is impressive that of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.600
 the truth is very very well achieved in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.090
 this caste the buttons are all 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 perfect and what is good as 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.190
 I already told you before to put it in 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.630
 a device with flat lid is that what 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.800
 it makes you feel a little more rigid in 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 general or when we grab it 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.580
 We feel like the phone is a bit 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 More solid to the touch in the back 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.690
 in general this is a feeling of mine that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.190
 happened to me on all devices with 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.470
 flat top happened to me with the nexus 4 to 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.000
 which put a vinyl step 23 and passes 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.350
 with the ipad mini it really feels like a 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.940
 little stiffer is good and in addition 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.830
 He is also valuable because we can 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.020
 support with such a quiet table and 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.180
 drag them without being afraid to be 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.119
 raye am using this vinyl 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.820
 zebra in 73 for little more than a month and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.619
 I think a week and a half longer and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.330
 luck is basically intact is 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.670
 same as the first day or it does not have 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.610
 no stripe no sign 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.649
 the expense now that although they are not wines 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.480
 which are super super-cheap are worth 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.900
 less than a case and at least not 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.970
 they add thickness nor in my opinion a 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.800
 gigantic horrible case and pony 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.300
 we can protect a bit the part 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.980
 back especially the setter is that 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.180
 many users reported that 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.819
 they developed very easy so by 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.350
 lucky barbarian wine for visitors 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.120
 Of course there are other models comes too 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.310
 the front part in this case this area 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.110
 it is removed it is removed and the edges remain 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.610
 milestones or crazy I put them in the part of the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.170
 front because they seem horrible to me 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.300
 the reference part but others come 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.590
 models is no longer the only google zebra 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.660
 that comes but they also come here to 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.549
 dress or ebony that really is 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.080
 barbarian I love color and this already 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.250
 we try them on other phones but one 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 I asked them to see how 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.549
 it stays or would be like this 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.350
 only with another color and also 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.549
 if they want to change the color because 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.040
 imagine that interiors have the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.360
 xperia 7 to 13 in white color but they 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.890
 it bothers that the front is 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.230
 White can be ordered for the black 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.299
 put a white vinyl that is one 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.340
 matteo be the white smooth iván the part 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.160
 back note that it is a white vinyl 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.990
 does not have much more 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.580
 and I would leave the blank back cover 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.830
 and of course the front is black 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.920
 and then finally pochettino a 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.770
 contain a vinyl plus it seems that here 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.720
 is this the black that exists here that in 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.600
 instead of having the white we have the black 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.730
 and this is pretty much matte and pretty 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.340
 opaque and has a slight slight texture 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.020
 rugosa so it's barbaric to 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.140
 replace for example if we do not want 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.640
 have a firm in the back cover of the ex 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.350
 I would see z3 obviously referring to us 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.090
 always to this phone can happen what 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.130
 same with others but we are talking about 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.630
 this without changing the color we can put 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.700
 the black and we are basically left 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.260
 protected against scratches and if we want 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.490
 one day later we changed the truth 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.630
 that were very good for us 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.770
 that I leave the link below in 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.990
 description in case you want to buy them 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.250
 already with portal greases that is with 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.480
 credit card know they are in 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.430
 argentina and they pay it when rent 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.100
 credit they have that damn and hateful 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.980
 surcharge the magical 35 percent that does not 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.440
 It's the fault of Brand's apology 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.239
 before those who put the tax is like this 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.470
 criteria that say they thought 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.970
 whether they would buy it or not or if 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.409
 they had experiences with liberate I am 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.540
 nicola fichman and see you next 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:16.319
