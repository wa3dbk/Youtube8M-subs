00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:05.630 

so<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:04.440> time<00:00:04.650> to<00:00:04.770> explain<00:00:04.980> how<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.250> gravity

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
so it's time to explain how the gravity

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.760 
so it's time to explain how the gravity
gun<00:00:05.759> works<00:00:06.029> now<00:00:06.750> they<00:00:07.049> were<00:00:07.109> quite<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.470> lot<00:00:07.589> of

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
gun works now they were quite a lot of

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.459 
gun works now they were quite a lot of
guesses<00:00:08.099> some<00:00:08.550> bit<00:00:09.000> wacky<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:09.750> they<00:00:10.380> were

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
guesses some bit wacky but they were

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.039 
guesses some bit wacky but they were
actually<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.830> handful<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.030> were<00:00:12.420> pretty

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
actually a handful which were pretty

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.390 
actually a handful which were pretty
spot-on<00:00:13.670> her<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:14.940> without<00:00:15.179> further<00:00:15.389> ado<00:00:16.400> now

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
spot-on her so without further ado now

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.250 
spot-on her so without further ado now
as<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.699> need<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:17.970> guessed<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.359> does<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:18.990> spawn

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
as we need you guessed it does do spawn

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.050 
as we need you guessed it does do spawn
us<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.650> lot<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.949> thought<00:00:20.130> used<00:00:20.430> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
us a lot of you thought used the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.150 
us a lot of you thought used the
minecart<00:00:21.539> block<00:00:21.779> display<00:00:22.109> drink<00:00:22.380> but<00:00:22.650> no<00:00:23.039> it's

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
minecart block display drink but no it's

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.450 
minecart block display drink but no it's
not<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:24.090> simply<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.990> just<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.800> mob<00:00:26.070> where

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
not that it simply is just a mob where

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.730 
not that it simply is just a mob where
the<00:00:26.789> falling<00:00:27.029> sand<00:00:27.180> entity<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.510> its<00:00:27.570> back<00:00:27.779> now

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the falling sand entity on its back now

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.540 
the falling sand entity on its back now
usually<00:00:29.490> if<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.000> try<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> stack<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.550> falling

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
usually if you try to stack a falling

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.299 
usually if you try to stack a falling
sand<00:00:32.880> entity<00:00:33.180> on<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.960> mob<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.680> you'll<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.040> is

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
sand entity on a mob all you'll get is

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.380 
sand entity on a mob all you'll get is
this<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.680> soon<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> mop<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.640> on<00:00:41.879> ground

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
this the as soon as the mop is on ground

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.459 
this the as soon as the mop is on ground
the<00:00:42.770> sand<00:00:43.770> entity<00:00:43.950> will<00:00:44.629> basically<00:00:45.629> land<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
the sand entity will basically land and

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.020 
the sand entity will basically land and
convert<00:00:46.920> into<00:00:47.219> an<00:00:47.280> old<00:00:47.430> block

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
convert into an old block

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.029 
convert into an old block
so<00:00:50.270> this<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.510> over<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.870> doesn't<00:00:52.530> act<00:00:52.800> like

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
so this one over here doesn't act like

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
so this one over here doesn't act like
that<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.730> has<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.390> funny<00:00:54.780> standard<00:00:55.110> city

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that this one has a funny standard city

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.569 
that this one has a funny standard city
but<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.949> not<00:00:56.100> touch<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.370> ground<00:00:56.399> or

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
but it's not touch the ground or

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.060 
but it's not touch the ground or
anything<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.930> still<00:00:58.079> intact<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.890> why<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
anything and it's still intact so why is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.459 
anything and it's still intact so why is
this<00:00:59.340> well<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.120> actually<00:01:00.600> very<00:01:00.750> very<00:01:00.870> simple

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
this well it's actually very very simple

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.299 
this well it's actually very very simple
this<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.460> has<00:01:03.439> position<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> pigs<00:01:04.799> position

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
this one has position the pigs position

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.050 
this one has position the pigs position
and<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> y<00:01:06.140> axis<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.350> 4.0<00:01:08.159> whereas<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> sand

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and the y axis is 4.0 whereas the sand

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.899 
and the y axis is 4.0 whereas the sand
is<00:01:09.299> 5.0<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.830> I'm<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> assume<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
is 5.0 so I'm just going to assume that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.910 
is 5.0 so I'm just going to assume that
that<00:01:12.689> basically<00:01:13.049> means<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.740> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
that basically means that because the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
that basically means that because the
sand<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> technically<00:01:15.240> won't<00:01:15.450> block<00:01:15.540> Cairo<00:01:15.810> it

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
sand is technically won't block Cairo it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.810 
sand is technically won't block Cairo it
doesn't<00:01:16.290> reach<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.860> ground<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.520> don't<00:01:17.700> know

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
doesn't reach the ground I don't know

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
doesn't reach the ground I don't know
I'm<00:01:18.030> making<00:01:18.240> guess<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.900> whereas<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.950> one

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
I'm making guess it whereas on this one

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.410 
I'm making guess it whereas on this one
it's<00:01:20.490> 4.0<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.540> both<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.200> them<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.119> as<00:01:24.119> soon<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it's 4.0 on both of them so as soon as

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.550 
it's 4.0 on both of them so as soon as
it<00:01:24.509> touches<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.840> ground<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.650> block<00:01:26.430> lands

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
it touches the ground the block lands

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.100 
it touches the ground the block lands
and<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:29.130> basically<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:30.689> sand

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
and that is basically how to make sand

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
and that is basically how to make sand
st<00:01:31.380> right<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.009> mob<00:01:32.159> now<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.790> rest<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.180> even

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
st right on the mob now the rest is even

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.289 
st right on the mob now the rest is even
simpler<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.590> if<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.860> hit<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.310> pick<00:01:35.549> who<00:01:36.119> has

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
simpler so if I hit this pick who has

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.109 
simpler so if I hit this pick who has
one<00:01:36.479> hut<00:01:36.710> he<00:01:37.710> will<00:01:37.860> die<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.340> he<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.670> drop<00:01:38.850> his

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
one hut he will die and he will drop his

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.880 
one hut he will die and he will drop his
in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> chest<00:01:39.810> which<00:01:40.200> functions<00:01:40.680> as<00:01:40.770> an

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
in the chest which functions as an

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.450 
in the chest which functions as an
enderchest

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
enderchest

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.539 
enderchest
and<00:01:42.020> however<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.229> i<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.560> use<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.009> gravity

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and however if i have to use the gravity

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.510 
and however if i have to use the gravity
gun<00:01:44.700> which<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.119> basically<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.250> small<00:01:47.250> summer

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
gun which is basically just small summer

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.370 
gun which is basically just small summer
with<00:01:47.909> not<00:01:48.090> by<00:01:48.240> ten<00:01:48.479> if<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.990> hit<00:01:49.140> him<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
with not by ten if I hit him with that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.190 
with not by ten if I hit him with that
then<00:01:49.890> we're<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:50.490> flying<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.930> item

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
then we're actually flying and the item

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.130 
then we're actually flying and the item
will<00:01:52.409> also<00:01:52.860> gonna<00:01:53.040> fly<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.899> horse

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
will also gonna fly so in with horse

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
will also gonna fly so in with horse
armor<00:01:55.290> he'll<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.890> stuff<00:01:56.159> goes<00:01:56.310> flying<00:01:56.549> but

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
armor he'll go the stuff goes flying but

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.319 
armor he'll go the stuff goes flying but
hits<00:01:57.750> him<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.799> normally<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.909> won't<00:02:00.060> fly

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
hits him just normally in it won't fly

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.480 
hits him just normally in it won't fly
now<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> little<00:02:01.740> bit<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.159> facade

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
now this was a little bit of a facade

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.459 
now this was a little bit of a facade
because<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.390> can't<00:02:03.630> actually<00:02:03.840> pick<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.259> any

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
because I can't actually pick up any

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.240 
because I can't actually pick up any
block<00:02:04.740> there<00:02:04.950> are<00:02:05.070> only<00:02:05.310> specific<00:02:05.820> blocks<00:02:06.060> so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
block there are only specific blocks so

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.469 
block there are only specific blocks so
this<00:02:08.250> obviously<00:02:08.519> incorporates<00:02:09.060> while<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.360> was

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
this obviously incorporates while I was

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.479 
this obviously incorporates while I was
talking<00:02:09.690> earlier<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.140> there's<00:02:10.289> also<00:02:10.489> trans

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
talking earlier but there's also trans

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.309 
talking earlier but there's also trans
Landers<00:02:11.819> block<00:02:12.060> deletion<00:02:12.660> trick<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.200> if<00:02:13.260> you

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
Landers block deletion trick so if you

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.449 
Landers block deletion trick so if you
don't<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:14.010> should<00:02:14.160> go<00:02:14.250> check

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
don't know that is you should go check

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.040 
don't know that is you should go check
out<00:02:14.610> his<00:02:14.730> channel<00:02:14.760> I'm<00:02:15.569> sure<00:02:15.810> you'll<00:02:15.930> be<00:02:15.959> able

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
out his channel I'm sure you'll be able

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.500 
out his channel I'm sure you'll be able
to<00:02:16.170> find<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:16.470> quite<00:02:16.620> easily<00:02:16.879> so<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:18.239> tried<00:02:18.480> to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to find it quite easily so I tried to

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.320 
to find it quite easily so I tried to
explain<00:02:18.840> how<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.440> all<00:02:19.620> works<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
explain how this all works so the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.589 
explain how this all works so the
gravity<00:02:21.690> gun<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.349> purely<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.239> knock<00:02:24.390> back

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
gravity gun is purely for the knock back

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.350 
gravity gun is purely for the knock back
effect<00:02:24.629> everything<00:02:25.500> else<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:26.069> unless<00:02:26.400> soon<00:02:26.670> so

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
effect everything else is unless soon so

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.119 
effect everything else is unless soon so
it<00:02:27.480> actually<00:02:27.840> used<00:02:27.989> his<00:02:28.110> proximity<00:02:28.560> sectors

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
it actually used his proximity sectors

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.890 
it actually used his proximity sectors
as<00:02:29.310> opposed<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.970> enchant<00:02:30.420> command

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
as opposed to the enchant command

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.520 
as opposed to the enchant command
detector<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.620> didn't<00:02:32.069> use<00:02:32.099> that<00:02:32.370> because<00:02:32.580> I

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
detector so I didn't use that because I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.440 
detector so I didn't use that because I
couldn't<00:02:34.530> enchant<00:02:35.519> it<00:02:35.670> multiple<00:02:36.060> times<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.390> I

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
couldn't enchant it multiple times so I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.570 
couldn't enchant it multiple times so I
couldn't<00:02:36.660> go<00:02:36.989> from<00:02:37.260> an<00:02:37.680> example<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.459> other

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
couldn't go from an example to the other

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.910 
couldn't go from an example to the other
other<00:02:38.959> example<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.049> another<00:02:40.230> example<00:02:40.349> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
other example to another example and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.920 
other example to another example and
enchants<00:02:41.670> again<00:02:41.970> basically<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.599> I<00:02:42.630> used<00:02:42.840> two

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
enchants again basically so I used two

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.509 
enchants again basically so I used two
proximity<00:02:43.410> detector<00:02:43.769> instead<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:46.370> way<00:02:47.370> this

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
proximity detector instead so way this

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.210 
proximity detector instead so way this
works<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:48.060> first<00:02:48.900> off<00:02:49.200> we<00:02:49.590> delete<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> block

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
works is first off we delete the block

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.380 
works is first off we delete the block
with<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.360> block<00:02:51.989> deletion<00:02:52.410> trick<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.860> that

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
with the block deletion trick so that

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.410 
with the block deletion trick so that
you<00:02:54.390> see<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> block<00:02:54.840> gets<00:02:55.049> deleted<00:02:55.519> then<00:02:56.519> what

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
you see the block gets deleted then what

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.050 
you see the block gets deleted then what
happens<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:59.010> if<00:02:59.190> what's<00:02:59.370> I'm<00:02:59.489> here<00:02:59.760> in<00:02:59.940> this

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
happens is so if what's I'm here in this

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.780 
happens is so if what's I'm here in this
location<00:03:00.480> right<00:03:00.510> here<00:03:01.069> blocks<00:03:02.069> delete<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:02.549> and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
location right here blocks delete it and

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.979 
location right here blocks delete it and
a<00:03:03.569> cat<00:03:04.349> is<00:03:04.769> spawned<00:03:05.549> in<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.180> use<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.599> and

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
a cat is spawned in so if I use this and

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.949 
a cat is spawned in so if I use this and
he<00:03:07.709> appears<00:03:08.540> there<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.599> go

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
he appears there we go

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.720 
he appears there we go
now<00:03:10.349> this<00:03:10.530> cat<00:03:10.709> is<00:03:10.799> actually<00:03:10.889> leashed<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.549> me

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
now this cat is actually leashed to me

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.940 
now this cat is actually leashed to me
he's<00:03:12.000> got<00:03:12.150> super<00:03:12.450> speed<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.840> he<00:03:12.930> sat<00:03:13.170> down<00:03:13.200> he

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
he's got super speed and he sat down he

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.650 
he's got super speed and he sat down he
sat<00:03:14.220> down<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.880> he<00:03:15.000> doesn't<00:03:15.180> wander<00:03:15.329> around<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
sat down so he doesn't wander around the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.860 
sat down so he doesn't wander around the
place<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.609> yeah<00:03:17.609> so<00:03:18.269> basically<00:03:18.389> responds

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
place and yeah so basically responds

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.349 
place and yeah so basically responds
quicker<00:03:19.139> so<00:03:19.380> if<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:19.530> punch<00:03:19.769> him<00:03:20.030> he'll<00:03:21.030> drop<00:03:21.180> his

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
quicker so if I punch him he'll drop his

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.080 
quicker so if I punch him he'll drop his
block<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:22.109> it's<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.349> proper<00:03:22.530> block<00:03:22.970> that's<00:03:23.970> all

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
block and it's a proper block that's all

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.569 
block and it's a proper block that's all
fine<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.389> dandy<00:03:24.450> so<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.530> basically<00:03:25.709> is<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
fine and dandy so that basically is the

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.580 
fine and dandy so that basically is the
only<00:03:26.760> use<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.329> the<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.989> gravity<00:03:28.319> gun<00:03:28.440> it

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
only use of the the gravity gun it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.720 
only use of the the gravity gun it
doesn't<00:03:28.620> have<00:03:28.859> any<00:03:29.010> special<00:03:29.160> uses<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
doesn't have any special uses the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.120 
doesn't have any special uses the
gravity<00:03:29.970> gun<00:03:30.090> is<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.870> can

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
gravity gun is just so that I can

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.780 
gravity gun is just so that I can
basically<00:03:32.130> propel<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:34.099> the<00:03:35.099> animal<00:03:35.400> further

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
basically propel the the animal further

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.110 
basically propel the the animal further
so<00:03:36.630> if<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:37.310> he<00:03:38.310> goes<00:03:38.459> all<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.669> way<00:03:38.760> over<00:03:38.970> there

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
so if I he goes all the way over there

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.110 
so if I he goes all the way over there
so<00:03:39.859> it's<00:03:40.859> just<00:03:41.069> as<00:03:41.459> simple<00:03:41.549> as<00:03:41.760> that<00:03:41.849> it's

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
so it's just as simple as that it's

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.140 
so it's just as simple as that it's
really<00:03:42.419> nothing<00:03:42.599> complicated<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:45.000> hope

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
really nothing complicated and I hope

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.780 
really nothing complicated and I hope
you<00:03:45.269> enjoyed<00:03:45.569> it
