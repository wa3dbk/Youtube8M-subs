00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.360

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.320
 we will do an implied game for seven 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.320
 days 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 every day we will play a different game 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.820
 radical of the pse bunch of front and then 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.969
 you in the comments 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 you have to vote the game in the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.890
 Dais will score from 0 to 10 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.890

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.670
 first weeks and the fourth week of 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.680
 month 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.600
 the most voted game of each week 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 well with more score I mean the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.890
 average with more score because it is exceeded 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.780

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.790
 interaction with you 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.320

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.229

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.750
