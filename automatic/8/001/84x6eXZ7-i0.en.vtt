00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.240
 the second video lesson on balloons 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.190
 this here and the twist of the balloon 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.620
 take the balloon turn it into this 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.389
 so this is called everything if 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.060
 I take the balloon in that moment 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.300
 this way double and turn 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.340
 this is called the double twist of the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.830
 balloon matching a series of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.099
 twisting of double twists is succeeded 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 to create unpayable base we see ad 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.770
 example can can and can be done so 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 simplified so I take this 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.430
 distance an inflated balloon not 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.110
 completely 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.760
 the important as well as the provinces 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.520
 completely because as you progress 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.770
 implement tractions the fold area 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.590
 will fill the final part of the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.600
 balloon then we start by doing one 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:59.010
 portion more or less a diego palm 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.980
 an eye is half scream and where it is 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 forced I make another option later 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.729
 so we made portion of the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.280
 brain tends to use more and ears 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.950
 of our dog and I can to avoid you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.470
 bursting the balloon take a while 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.330
 in such a way that it looks more towards the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.670
 bottom of the balloon or less pressure 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.710
 less pressure is more difficult than that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.840
 environmentalism we do the same identical 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.119
 what for the other part of the dog 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.120
 so at this point the production round 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.840
 eye to me 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.180
 double repeat fix solutions 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:37.160
 the double torch double at this point 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.490
 we could and have got into this 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.800
 so the first two ears snout neck 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:49.670
 legs the same thing for the other two 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:51.290
 women and women production twists 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.170
 we got say all the more 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.930
 the dog's famous one 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.330
 at this point we have this part of 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.550
 tail to see the baby's feet of 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.850
 blow sofia 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.620
 and show that while the child sofia 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.570
 jonker balloon this way 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.780
 this is called a Silea gang 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.850
 pressing here as you prize in the palm 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.190
 of the hand 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:22.280
 the air goes out of them this one 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:26.030
 could be a first figure if you do 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.120
 the long snout this could be the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.860
 proboscis and then obtaining ad 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.670
 get from a balloon ligature 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.760
 similar to the vercana then keep 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.610
 the safe and elegant we see looks 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.550
 this many to face between stop option 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.580
 I am enlightened I am a use and 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.950
 ears the hours I can change them 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.830
 in this way and here I do one 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.989
 profession after it would appear in 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.120
 this way I got ears 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.850
 art foundry for the elephant is a 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 big I don't know below then solution 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:10.220
 production swells to get the money 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.220
 of the bulk 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.650
 in this case we have a long snout that 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.379
 we got as animals we can 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.530
 likewise we count very little on 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:30.890
 balloon always remaining with the 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.640
 same basic moves get for example the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.640
 baby mouse 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.730
 we see 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.080
 at this point I don't want to twist 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.670
 they burn where I do all singles 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.670
 productions we see this could 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.739
 be an outcome and these are the ears of 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.880
 mouse and I say all three singles 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.069
 options 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.900
 I decided in a more definite way what it was 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.019
 the punishment I wanted to get to 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.910
 this point double solution then 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.230
 what we have seen before so 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.390
 simplified in which we know a 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.980
 switching to this one instead is a more way 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:13.129
 defined neck first range second leg 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.550
 re sausage ride bottego neck e 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:20.519
 I make the same passage 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.519
 sure this is the first leg 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:30.320
 this way I got the new two 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:33.420
 legs turn the tail we got pine 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.640
 you want to do the same as being able to leaders 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:42.600
 blow sofia and so we got 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.910
 another basic figure next video 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.910
 let's see how to make swords
