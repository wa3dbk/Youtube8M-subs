00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hi to all and post it for my first 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.440
 blog a cost of 4 and for this first 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.730
 round 4 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.730
 we spoke of chewing gum 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.519
 would be very important you should never 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.639
 go out in single 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.639
 small side never ever 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:31.930
 and that's not usually knew anymore 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 late he twists asking for a single 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.039
 reason 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.760
 one that she has more taste I know 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.760
 says the report 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 we do not have another one and also when we 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.600
 smoke in your mouth you have this mania of 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.640
 make no bubbles but seriously 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.420
 between us it serves strictly nothing 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.420
 instinct 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.960
 the thing that really annoys me is 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.460
 when there is a chewing gum that sticks to me 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.050
 to my wesh shoes 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.080
 the shirts i'm talking a little bit 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.080
 English 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.550
 but the worst is what a chewing 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.020
 gum stuck in the hair no but 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.060
 it's up to a peanut pulls out the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.570
 hair with and in addition yet high 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.680
 fingers cutting hair 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.010
 long live the head rather banging in high school 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.869
 but hey we all know a guy 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.880
 believe me this meaning I'm like he's you 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.240
 makes a sound of combine harvesters 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.240
 no, but it's violently embarrassing 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.320
 speak on 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.320
 no
