don't<00:00:19.740> throw<00:00:19.980> those<00:00:20.160> away<00:00:20.189> because<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.210> can

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
don't throw those away because you can

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
don't throw those away because you can
blitz<00:00:21.570> them<00:00:21.750> out<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> stock<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.710> make<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
blitz them out with a stock and make a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:23.750

nice soup

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720 
nice soup
if<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.420> then<00:00:24.570> just<00:00:25.310> give<00:00:26.310> those<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> little

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
if you then just give those a little

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.380 
if you then just give those a little
peel<00:00:27.230> it<00:00:28.230> creates<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.800> rather<00:00:28.980> nice

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
peel it creates a rather nice

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.420 
peel it creates a rather nice
presentable<00:00:30.390> aspect<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.949> goes<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
presentable aspect that goes in the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.620 
presentable aspect that goes in the
water<00:00:32.460> I'm<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.600> put<00:00:34.550> some<00:00:35.550> lemon<00:00:36.239> little

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
white wine vinegar and I'm just going to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.100 
white wine vinegar and I'm just going to
make<00:00:43.649> sure<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.570> water<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
make sure that the the water is on a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.709 
make sure that the the water is on a
very<00:00:46.559> very<00:00:46.980> light<00:00:47.309> simmer<00:00:47.760> if<00:00:48.300> it's<00:00:48.510> boiling

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
very very light simmer if it's boiling

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.830 
very very light simmer if it's boiling
then<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.559> chances<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.070> success<00:00:50.730> are<00:00:51.300> limited

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
then the chances of success are limited

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.750 
then the chances of success are limited
what<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.370> crack<00:00:53.610> the
