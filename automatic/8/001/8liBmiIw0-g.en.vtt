is<00:02:22.780> still<00:02:22.990> good<00:02:23.250> snakes<00:02:24.250> also<00:02:24.490> have<00:02:24.760> an

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
is still good snakes also have an

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.000 
is still good snakes also have an
impeccable<00:02:25.330> sense<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.990> smell<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.740> is<00:02:26.860> how

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
impeccable sense of smell this is how

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.540
