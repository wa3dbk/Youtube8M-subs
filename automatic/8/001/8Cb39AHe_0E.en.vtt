00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 good 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.240
 how about friends to be able to lose in this 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:24.220
 occasion we also have the unboxing of 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.920
 zte law that basically I said plus 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.740
 is in the plus version 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.689
 device is a range equipment pulling 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.579
 the average because the low-end equipment 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.960
 the difference of this particular with 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.910
 us that we have been showing them 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.800
 right now in the last videos that we've 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.430
 been going up is that this is a team 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.140
 low- end that looks like the average do not go 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.899
 to really see the size if it is 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.329
 considerable a 4.5 screen 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.519
 inches the computer in your hand feels 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.870
 pretty good 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.949
 there you can see, I'm going to take a 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.980
 little bit so they do not see and basically 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.320
 has that texture made with a 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.260
 good touch plastic on the part 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.810
 back nothing fancy but 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 actually the really curious thing about 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.280
 this device is that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.310
 has a 5 megapixel camera and they 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.900
 I say it costs 1,700 pesos thousand 800 pesos 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.659
 more or less I guess you'll like it in 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.119
 the next months until in 1500 they 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.570
 I say at first glance it does not look like a team 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.979
 low end of a cheap price 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.600
 finally we need to evaluate that also 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.720
 it has its performance in other aspects 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.310
 but for now with that with this one 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.860
 simple box nothing else we can see the part 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.780
 Don equipment external physical cause 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 more of the box because I'm already placed 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.600
 that is the box we found the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.340
 headphones 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.980
 like 20 identical to we have them 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.550
 in the other teams, that is you and the 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.930
 charger your microusb cable 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.670
 Chargers do not see much 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.100
 quality but it's so interesting in the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.710
 way that they are like in the then not 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.150
 sometimes get in the way when you connect 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.910
 our other electronic light or nothing 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:13.490
 wrong that part but be good as this 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.510
 it was an extra fast boxing of the zte blade 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.070
 what plus 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.770
 soon we will have an analysis 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.790
 full of this device hanging from 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.190
 living and a 4.5-inch screen 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.390
 they are dual-core processor among others 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.160
 things that place it in the low range 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.230
 so do not forget to subscribe to 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.570
