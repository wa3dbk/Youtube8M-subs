00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 talking about music not with this theme of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.210
 background that is the music I love you 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.799
 show my first design class this 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.330
 that's how it is my first contact with the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.950
 machines with the cables starts to 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.290
 distinguish the bass drums of the cymbals 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.000
 when shooting the tracks this is 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.220
 really the most important thing and the most 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.020
 difficult of the class says that now 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.900
 with all of you I will share the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.000
 Boys 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.000
 [Music] 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.800
 [Applause] 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.870
 here at the dj school one more day for 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.270
 learn how is this new technology 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.010
 to use all these things that are not yet 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.620
 I understand but that I am going to 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.530
 understand and Julian is going to help me so 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.489
 juli and profe whenever you want hands to the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.350
 work basically to start if you 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.920
 you have to be clear that the music 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.340
 electronic when I need to mix it 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.980
 moves on two axes yes they are the 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.460
 hype and the good dish that you have to 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.729
 do for now is try to locate a 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.460
 hype over another what interests me is 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.880
 that distinguishes as from plates and disparate 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.580
 try to shoot always in the hype 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.090
 [Music] 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.600
 it's going to be a very charismatic diet 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 I see her encouraging people I see her 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 floating the pretty good to all this 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 is that I already with two or three plays I gave myself 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.409
 realize that you will do it fast 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.409
 we work we are going 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.760
 [Music] 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.240
 remember that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:04.360
 with this we go overflowing 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.990
 squeezing pause pause this left me a 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.990
 more time with him 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.160
 as to learn and be renewed like this 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.160
 what we have 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.240
 good people saw that I told them this is 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.520
 the most difficult and most complicated part 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.110
 let's see along in the course 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.260
 of the week for all interested 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.520
 to be said is terrible it must be 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.770
 terrible because like the great thing that 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.270
 this must be very good to be 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.460
 at a party to pass music that all 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.320
 dance the music that does not happen with the 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.780
 mixtures that one makes an idea then 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.760
 when it is said to come one day here 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.770
 we dance everything they take out live give them treatment 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.770
 done we danced said to the goalkeeper
