00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
acting like a child and realize that it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but I think it's gotten to a stage at

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
but I think it's gotten to a stage at
this<00:00:54.149> point<00:00:54.449> where<00:00:54.629> both<00:00:55.110> countries<00:00:55.410> are

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
this point where both countries are

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
this point where both countries are
really<00:00:55.949> keen<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.520> try<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.910> solve<00:00:57.149> this

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
really keen to try and solve this

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.450 
really keen to try and solve this
problem<00:00:57.840> remember<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.590> haze<00:00:58.800> isn't<00:00:59.219> just

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
problem remember this haze isn't just

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.729 
problem remember this haze isn't just
affecting<00:00:59.640> Singapore<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.690> Malaysia<00:01:01.199> it's

can do right now to try and help stop
this<00:01:24.650> well<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.159> sure<00:01:26.400> how<00:01:26.549> practical<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this well I'm not sure how practical the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.090 
this well I'm not sure how practical the
solution<00:01:27.869> they've<00:01:28.170> come<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.560> but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
solution they've come up with but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.319 
solution they've come up with but
certainly<00:01:29.460> they've<00:01:29.640> come<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.119> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
certainly they've come up with a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
certainly they've come up with a
solution<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.020> that's<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:32.189> technique

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
solution and that's the this technique

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.399 
solution and that's the this technique
called<00:01:32.850> cloud<00:01:33.270> seeding<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.259> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
called cloud seeding and what that is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.039 
called cloud seeding and what that is
Lucy<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.950> basically<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> plan<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
Lucy is basically the plan is and the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.300 
Lucy is basically the plan is and the
Indonesians<00:01:37.500> are<00:01:37.619> planning<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.890> start<00:01:38.189> this

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
Indonesians are planning to start this

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.270 
Indonesians are planning to start this
as<00:01:38.460> soon<00:01:38.640> as<00:01:38.790> tomorrow<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.110> send<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.680> cloud

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
as soon as tomorrow is to send a cloud

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.280 
as soon as tomorrow is to send a cloud
is<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.700> send<00:01:41.939> seeds<00:01:42.299> into<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> clouds<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
is to send seeds into the clouds and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.950
