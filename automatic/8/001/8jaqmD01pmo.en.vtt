I<00:00:54.350> chose<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.460> study<00:00:55.610> medical<00:00:56.180> parasitology

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
I chose to study medical parasitology

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.359 
I chose to study medical parasitology
mainly<00:00:57.379> because<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.680> wide<00:00:57.890> range<00:00:58.250> of

00:00:58.359 --> 00:00:58.369 
mainly because the wide range of

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:00.789 
mainly because the wide range of
diseases<00:00:58.729> that<00:00:59.449> they're<00:00:59.629> covers<00:00:59.960> all<00:01:00.619> the

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.030 
diseases so my MSC course project was
studying<00:01:14.540> helmets<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.140> factions<00:01:15.530> in<00:01:15.680> Brazil

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
studying helmets and factions in Brazil

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.070 
studying helmets and factions in Brazil
and<00:01:16.460> for<00:01:16.610> this<00:01:16.700> I<00:01:16.880> got<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.120> go<00:01:17.240> out<00:01:17.420> to<00:01:17.720> Brazil

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
and for this I got to go out to Brazil

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.020 
and for this I got to go out to Brazil
to<00:01:18.290> Belo<00:01:18.470> Horizonte<00:01:19.040> where<00:01:19.670> we<00:01:19.790> worked

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
to Belo Horizonte where we worked

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.150 
to Belo Horizonte where we worked

alongside the human hook we had hookworm

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.210 
alongside the human hook we had hookworm
vaccine<00:01:22.190> trials<00:01:23.060> and<00:01:23.410> my<00:01:24.410> project<00:01:24.890> was<00:01:25.070> aimed

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
vaccine trials and my project was aimed

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.460 
vaccine trials and my project was aimed
at<00:01:25.430> looking<00:01:25.580> at<00:01:25.940> how<00:01:26.390> multiple<00:01:27.080> worm

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
and compared to a single one infection

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.060 
and compared to a single one infection
we<00:01:32.960> always<00:01:33.200> want<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.500> make<00:01:33.620> sure<00:01:33.650> that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
we always want to make sure that

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.570 
but what's common with all of our
students<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.350> they<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.980> interest
