00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
never have enough intelligence so the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
never have enough intelligence so the
American<00:00:48.719> people<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.199> don't<00:00:49.260> think<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.739> any

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
American people I don't think have any

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.979 
American people I don't think have any
alternative<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> believe<00:00:51.269> our<00:00:51.539> president

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
alternative but to believe our president

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.439 
alternative but to believe our president
that's<00:00:52.410> why<00:00:52.649> he's<00:00:52.890> been<00:00:53.100> elected<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that's why he's been elected and I

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
that's why he's been elected and I
certainly<00:00:54.929> hope<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.320> never<00:00:55.469> go<00:00:55.739> down<00:00:55.890> this

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
certainly hope we never go down this

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.880 
certainly hope we never go down this
road<00:00:56.460> ever<00:00:56.760> again<00:00:57.179> because<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.440> never<00:00:58.559> want

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
road ever again because you never want

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.799 
road ever again because you never want
to<00:00:58.949> lose<00:00:59.129> any<00:00:59.429> lives<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> there's<00:01:00.179> always<00:01:00.600> an

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to lose any lives and there's always an

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.740 
to lose any lives and there's always an
unintended<00:01:01.679> consequences<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.449> clearly

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
unintended consequences I think clearly

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.450 
unintended consequences I think clearly

have to trust our leaders I think that's

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.010 
have to trust our leaders I think that's
really<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:38.220> only<00:01:38.250> alternative<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.300> have<00:01:39.330> but

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really the only alternative we have but

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.380 
really the only alternative we have but
also<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.130> go<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.550> do<00:01:41.850> something<00:01:42.270> we

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
also when we go in and do something we

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.720 
also when we go in and do something we
need<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.810> an<00:01:42.930> exit<00:01:43.320> strategy<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:44.100> plan

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
need to have an exit strategy a plan

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.630 
need to have an exit strategy a plan
that<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.120> can<00:01:45.300> execute<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.230> have<00:01:47.190> as<00:01:47.340> much

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
that we can execute and have as much

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
that we can execute and have as much
intelligence<00:01:48.150> as<00:01:48.630> we<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.620> know<00:01:49.740> what

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
intelligence as we can but you know what
