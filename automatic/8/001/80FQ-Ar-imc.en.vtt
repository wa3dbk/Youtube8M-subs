Shield it was a great performance so you

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.799

the<00:00:13.259> performance<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.429> impressive

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the performance is what was impressive

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.790

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and that's what we should go away as and

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.519 
and that's what we should go away as and

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
