00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
now we will keep on boiling this till

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.979 
now we will keep on boiling this till
the<00:02:06.970> sugar<00:02:07.180> gets<00:02:07.570> caramelized<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.450> sugar<00:02:10.780> has

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
the sugar gets caramelized the sugar has

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.920 
the sugar gets caramelized the sugar has
started<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.650> get<00:02:11.800> caramelized<00:02:12.480> or<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.690> can

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
started to get caramelized or you can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.729

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.800 

putting<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:21.040> caramelized<00:02:21.640> sugar<00:02:22.120> gives<00:02:22.600> a
