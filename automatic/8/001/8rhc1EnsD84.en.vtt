00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.600
 then continuing with the explanation of the backup tools 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.790
 you restoration d operating system windows 7 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:11.569
 now goya 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.639
 when commenting about 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.029
 what are called restoration points 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.630
 which is a point of restoration is simply a moment in time 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.349
 where we are going to take a small x-ray of our system 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.179
 where it goes to the most in giving the configuration and the versions of the 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.000
 files that we have at that moment in time 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 why should something happen to our system after we can 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.620
 return to that point of restoration 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.530
 i 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.530
 return things to how they were at that moment 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.570
 I mean 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.690
 configurations and file versions 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.990
 suppose I want to install a trailer for my video card but 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.280
 I do not know really if it does not work 100% bonus 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.800
 and I want to make sure that I can return my system to how it was before 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.540
 in case it will not work 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.900
 I'm going to click on start then 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900
 after chic right as a team 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.330
 properties 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.730
 after left side I'm going to click where it says advanced settings 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.100
 of the system 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 and finally in the system protection tab 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530
 here in the bottom 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.710
 we have a configure button and a create button 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.000
 percent precisely the point of restoration I will create a man in 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.240
 this moment 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.130
 let him go more before 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 of the drae see 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.940
 I think it's going to take a few minutes to create it 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.190
 and just after this I can already make the necessary changes in 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.960
 this case is a hypothetical example of video cards where a trailer 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.950
 video card but it can be anything else 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.810
 once it will be done 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.240
 percent the restoration point we can restore our 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.110
 system 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.319
 by clicking on the button above 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.850
 Kelly restored the system 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.129
 by default percent 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.239
 when restoring the system 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.979
 latest 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.819
 last restoration point that we have created if we have more is going to 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.749
 give the option to choose which one we want to return to 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.879
 this is quite useful 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.859
 i recommend them 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:27.259
 finally we have what is called and if transfer 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:31.049
 that will be used to transfer files between one computer and another and is 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.840
 particularly useful when we are going to change computers 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.949
 computer 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.139
 percent 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.989
 in case we buy a new one for some 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.779
 notivoli let's replace the one we have 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.779
 if we click on start all programs 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:48.389
 after 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.169
 accessories 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.179
 after terra while the system 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.419
 we go against and an option that is called windows and if transfer 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.150
 p we can transfer user accounts documents music images mail 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.140
 electronic favorite internet p videos and the pro is set up siones 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.050
 all we have to do is 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.050
 click on next and choose the method 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.410
 through which we are going to transfer 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.179
 the files from one computer to the other 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.759
 for example, choose external hard drive 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:22.490
 and we will choose if this equipment is the new 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.370
 to recover other files 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.650
 or if this equipment is the old one to keep these files and then 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.389
 transferred 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.700
