00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.440 
Zoom swish it used to be on the corner
but<00:02:32.720> knows<00:02:32.990> on<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.290> top<00:02:33.530> of<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.740> camera

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
but knows on the top of the camera

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.740 
but knows on the top of the camera
almost<00:02:35.450> very<00:02:35.720> similar<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.970> T<00:02:37.970> 900<00:02:38.570> with<00:02:38.720> a

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
almost very similar to the T 900 with a

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.590 
almost very similar to the T 900 with a
design<00:02:39.170> but<00:02:39.730> just<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.820> little<00:02:40.910> similar<00:02:41.300> to<00:02:41.450> it

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
design but just a little similar to it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:49.030 
design but just a little similar to it
though<00:02:45.220> focus<00:02:46.600> yeah<00:02:47.600> that<00:02:48.470> was<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.680> hard<00:02:48.890> time

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
though focus yeah that was a hard time

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.250 
though focus yeah that was a hard time
with<00:02:49.160> my<00:02:49.250> iPhone<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:50.030> got<00:02:50.600> to<00:02:50.720> sampling<00:02:51.080> for

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
with my iPhone I got to sampling for

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.040 
with my iPhone I got to sampling for
months<00:02:52.070> ago<00:02:55.209> and<00:02:56.209> they<00:02:56.480> did<00:02:56.810> some

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
months ago and they did some

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.890 
months ago and they did some
improvements<00:02:57.680> are<00:02:57.770> putting<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.190> strap<00:02:59.090> tight

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
improvements are putting the strap tight

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.860 
improvements are putting the strap tight
on<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.380> cuz<00:03:01.280> unlikely<00:03:01.820> takes<00:03:02.060> 10<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.540> 20<00:03:02.840> I

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
on this cuz unlikely takes 10 and 20 I

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.600 
on this cuz unlikely takes 10 and 20 I
have<00:03:03.110> a<00:03:03.170> really<00:03:03.530> hard<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:03.770> putting<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.370> strap

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
have a really hard time putting a strap

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.910 
have a really hard time putting a strap
on<00:03:04.820> but<00:03:05.090> but<00:03:05.870> now<00:03:06.020> that<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.230> made<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.500> easier<00:03:06.890> for

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
on but but now that I made it easier for

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.810 
on but but now that I made it easier for
me<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.280> do<00:03:07.520> even<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:09.680> screen<00:03:10.010> is<00:03:10.160> a<00:03:10.280> little<00:03:10.520> um

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
me to do even a screen is a little um

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.729 
me to do even a screen is a little um
has<00:03:11.360> some<00:03:11.570> little<00:03:11.840> scratches<00:03:12.410> but<00:03:12.910> it's<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:14.380> -<00:03:15.380> a

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
has some little scratches but it's a - a

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.610 
has some little scratches but it's a - a
clip<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:16.310> I'm<00:03:16.430> not<00:03:16.580> worried<00:03:16.910> about<00:03:17.410> right<00:03:18.410> now

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
clip so I'm not worried about right now

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.880 
clip so I'm not worried about right now
here<00:03:18.920> they<00:03:19.160> did<00:03:19.459> some<00:03:19.700> improvement<00:03:20.390> on<00:03:20.510> the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
here they did some improvement on the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.880 
here they did some improvement on the
battery<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:23.420> USB<00:03:23.900> compartment<00:03:24.500> now<00:03:24.739> it

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
battery and and a USB compartment now it

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.930 
battery and and a USB compartment now it
is<00:03:25.040> an<00:03:25.190> all-in-one<00:03:25.670> compartment<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.720> um<00:03:26.900> USB

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
is an all-in-one compartment for um USB

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.630 
is an all-in-one compartment for um USB
so<00:03:28.940> here<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.239> is<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.890> weird<00:03:31.100> thing<00:03:31.160> is<00:03:31.310> for<00:03:31.549> the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
so here it is the weird thing is for the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.789 
so here it is the weird thing is for the
battery<00:03:32.120> the<00:03:32.420> arrows<00:03:32.750> point<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.170> way<00:03:33.350> for

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
battery the arrows point this way for

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.699 
battery the arrows point this way for
the<00:03:34.390> little<00:03:35.390> switch<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.930> really<00:03:36.230> switch<00:03:36.470> but

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
the little switch that really switch but

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.289 
the little switch that really switch but
the<00:03:36.799> really<00:03:37.010> switches<00:03:37.760> on<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.910> left<00:03:40.299> here's

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
the really switches on the left here's

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.400 
the really switches on the left here's
the<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:44.110> hooked<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:47.060> here's<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.600> end<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
the it's hooked and here's the end the

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.800 
the it's hooked and here's the end the
USB<00:03:48.980> hook<00:03:49.220> it<00:03:49.430> takes<00:03:49.670> the<00:03:49.760> same<00:03:49.970> one<00:03:50.209> from<00:03:50.480> DM

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
USB hook it takes the same one from DM

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.530 
USB hook it takes the same one from DM
TX<00:03:51.739> 10<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.190> kicks<00:03:52.459> 20<00:03:55.239> everything<00:03:56.239> from

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
TX 10 and kicks 20 everything from

the<00:04:00.049> memory<00:04:00.470> card<00:04:00.940> they<00:04:01.940> change<00:04:02.329> it<00:04:02.510> up<00:04:02.660> now<00:04:03.019> to

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
the memory card they change it up now to

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.190 
the memory card they change it up now to
