you as you can see you can see the depth

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
you as you can see you can see the depth
of<00:00:54.059> field<00:00:54.390> working<00:00:54.719> really<00:00:55.110> well<00:00:55.260> let<00:00:56.250> me<00:00:56.340> be

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
of field working really well let me be

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.490 
of field working really well let me be
actually<00:00:56.850> zoom<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.109> actually<00:00:58.289> see

actually zoom in so you can actually see

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
actually zoom in so you can actually see
that<00:00:59.180> see<00:01:00.180> how<00:01:00.270> quality<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.370> that's<00:01:02.370> one

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that see how quality that is that's one

that see how quality that is that's one
of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> best<00:01:03.719> probably<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.379> best<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:04.890> a

more photos that I took of a macro of
this<00:01:30.990> camera<00:01:31.530> because<00:01:31.920> macro<00:01:32.430> photography

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
this camera because macro photography

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.690 
this camera because macro photography
it's<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.869> know<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.770> big<00:01:34.950> thing<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.520> low

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
it's you know the big thing in the low

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.480 
it's you know the big thing in the low
light<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> PC<00:01:37.110> Magazine<00:01:37.350> reviewed<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
light and PC Magazine reviewed the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.600 
light and PC Magazine reviewed the
camera<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.420> galaxy<00:01:39.869> s2<00:01:40.049> better<00:01:40.560> than<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
camera on the galaxy s2 better than the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
camera on the galaxy s2 better than the
new<00:01:41.759> iphone<00:01:42.210> 4s<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.960> pretty<00:01:43.799> much<00:01:43.860> all<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
new iphone 4s and pretty much all the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
new iphone 4s and pretty much all the
other<00:01:44.640> cameras<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> only<00:01:46.020> thing

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
other cameras I think the only thing

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.740 
other cameras I think the only thing
that<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.560> better<00:01:46.770> was<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.189> mytouch<00:01:48.060> 4G<00:01:48.720> or

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that was better was like mytouch 4G or

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.160 
that was better was like mytouch 4G or
something<00:01:49.350> um<00:01:49.549> but<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.820> does<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.630> good<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
something um but it does really good and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.590 
something um but it does really good and
it's<00:01:52.320> really<00:01:52.649> great<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.009> taking<00:01:53.579> photos<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's really great for taking photos it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.550 
it's really great for taking photos it
probably<00:01:55.340> does<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.579> well<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.719> point<00:01:58.259> shoot

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
probably does as well as a point shoot

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.730 
probably does as well as a point shoot
camera<00:01:58.590> or<00:01:59.130> even<00:01:59.549> better<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:01.049> still<00:02:01.439> shot

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
camera or even better on or still shot

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
camera or even better on or still shot
so<00:02:02.159> anyway<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.700> was<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.880> review<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.360> still

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
