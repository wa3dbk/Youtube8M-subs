00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
that I explore my option and this is I

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
that I explore my option and this is I
think<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.060> therefore<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.539> come

I<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.680> about<00:00:26.119> pain<00:00:27.119> management<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.630> that

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
I like about pain management is that

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.299 
I like about pain management is that
it's<00:00:28.050> almost<00:00:28.289> more<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:30.170> know<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it's almost more I know I can see a

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.180 
it's almost more I know I can see a
concrete<00:00:32.669> result<00:00:32.880> when<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> help<00:00:34.110> people

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
concrete result when I help people

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.069 
concrete result when I help people
they<00:00:35.640> tell<00:00:35.850> me<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.090> feel<00:00:36.239> better<00:00:36.510> they<00:00:36.660> tell

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
me that it helped that you know it may

good when they tell me that they don't
need<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.289> anymore<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.039> so<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.610> come

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
need to see me anymore and so they come

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.790 
need to see me anymore and so they come
back<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.329> skirt<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.469> wanted

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
back in a skirt that's what we wanted

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680 
back in a skirt that's what we wanted
but<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.550> philosophy<00:00:51.180> with<00:00:51.300> pain<00:00:51.539> management

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
but my philosophy with pain management

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.340 
but my philosophy with pain management
you<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.500> patients<00:00:53.129> still<00:00:53.899> you<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:54.989> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you know patients still you know you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.930 
you know patients still you know you
have<00:00:55.559> all<00:00:55.680> these<00:00:55.710> new<00:00:56.039> tools<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.760> they're

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
have all these new tools and they're

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.209 
have all these new tools and they're
upgrades<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.480> they<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.899> effective<00:00:58.289> but

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
upgrades and they are very effective but

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.819 
upgrades and they are very effective but
the<00:00:59.370> key<00:00:59.550> thing<00:00:59.600> you<00:01:00.600> know<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the key thing you know it's not to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.640 
the key thing you know it's not to
forget<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.690> goals<00:01:03.960> they'll<00:01:04.260> have<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
forget the the goals they'll have the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.520 
forget the the goals they'll have the
patient<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:06.000> subjects<00:01:06.659> still<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> patient<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
patient the subjects still a patient and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.210 
patient the subjects still a patient and
you<00:01:07.799> really<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> tailor<00:01:08.939> individual

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
you really have to tailor individual

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.910 
you really have to tailor individual
treatment<00:01:11.220> modality<00:01:11.729> toward<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.689> patient<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
treatment modality toward a patient and

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.149 
treatment modality toward a patient and
you<00:01:14.790> know<00:01:14.990> new<00:01:15.990> thing<00:01:16.320> doesn't<00:01:16.710> necessarily

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
you know new thing doesn't necessarily

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.890 
you know new thing doesn't necessarily
means<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.700> suitable<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.390> everything

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
means is suitable for everything

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.510 
means is suitable for everything
everybody<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:21.650> even<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.860> all<00:01:23.040> different

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
everybody I think even of all different

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.260 
everybody I think even of all different
modality<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.680> Tiffany<00:01:25.680> modality

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
modality and my Tiffany modality

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.969 
modality and my Tiffany modality
physical<00:01:27.270> examination<00:01:27.930> talking<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> his

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
physical examination talking to his

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
physical examination talking to his
patients<00:01:29.729> still<00:01:29.970> probably<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> first<00:01:30.780> thing

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
patients still probably the first thing

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.649 
patients still probably the first thing
that<00:01:31.530> will<00:01:32.520> help<00:01:32.729> me<00:01:32.850> better<00:01:33.150> than<00:01:33.390> anything

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
that will help me better than anything

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.140 
that will help me better than anything
else<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.890> decide<00:01:35.820> what

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
else so I can actually decide what

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
else so I can actually decide what
treatment<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.780> apply<00:01:37.049> sometimes<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.189> don't

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
treatment to apply sometimes you don't

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
treatment to apply sometimes you don't
need<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.579> go<00:01:38.670> anything<00:01:38.909> high-tech<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.630> simple

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
need to go anything high-tech as simple

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.929 
need to go anything high-tech as simple
as<00:01:40.110> aperture<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.710> already<00:01:40.979> needed<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.520> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
as aperture that's already needed or a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.819 
as aperture that's already needed or a
simple<00:01:42.420> nerve<00:01:42.750> block<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.470> needed

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
simple nerve block that's what we needed

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.190 
simple nerve block that's what we needed
or<00:01:43.979> even<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.399> physical<00:01:44.880> therapy<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.899> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
or even just physical therapy and you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.230 
or even just physical therapy and you
know<00:01:46.229> procedures<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:46.950> always<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.060> right

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
know procedures not always the right

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.230 
know procedures not always the right
thing<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.780> wholly<00:01:49.649> costs<00:01:50.159> right<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
thing to do wholly costs right here I

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.330 
thing to do wholly costs right here I
mean<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.720> give<00:01:52.020> me<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.530> environment<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.310> I

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
mean it give me the environment that I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.639 
mean it give me the environment that I
can<00:01:53.640> focus<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:54.119> patient<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.290> think<00:01:55.320> that's

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
can focus on patient and I think that's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.219 
can focus on patient and I think that's
probably<00:01:55.829> what<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> rare<00:01:57.149> thing<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.930> stays<00:01:58.200> in

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
probably what a rare thing this stays in

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.179 
probably what a rare thing this stays in
today's<00:01:59.040> medicine<00:01:59.610> doctor<00:02:00.479> are<00:02:00.570> forced<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
today's medicine doctor are forced to
