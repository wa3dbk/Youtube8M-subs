00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.570
Your doctor has recommended that you undergo
Photorefractive Keratectomy - or PRK Laser

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:29.220
surgery - to correct a vision problem. But
what does that actually mean?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.000
The human eye is constructed like a camera
... with a clear lens in the front and light-sensitive

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
tissue at the rear. This tissue makes up the
retina which acts like photographic film.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.769
In an eye that has perfect vision, light rays
passing through the pupil are focused by the

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.769
lens to fall precisely at the center of the
retina. There are many common problems that

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.170
can affect the eye and prevent light rays
from focusing properly on the retina.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.170
Three of these problems, myopia - or nearsightedness;
hyperopia - or farsightedness; and astigmatism

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.930
can often be corrected or reduced with the
use of PRK laser surgery.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.729
Myopia, or nearsightedness, occurs when the
shape of the eye is too long or the curve

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:29.649
of the cornea is too extreme. In this case,
light rays are focused on a point in front

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.639
of the retina - instead of on the retina itself.

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:41.639
Hyperopia, or farsightedness, occurs when
the shape of the eye is too short. In this

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.549
case, light rays are focused on a point behind
the retina.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.420
Astigmatism occurs when the cornea is unevenly
curved,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.420
causing light rays to fall off center or not
to focus properly at all.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:08.020
In either case, PRK laser surgery can be used
to flatten all or part of the cornea ... allowing

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.310
your doctor to cause the focal point of light
entering the eye to fall more closely to the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.930
center of the surface of the retina.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.930
PRK is a simple and nonintrusive procedure
that is designed to reduce or eliminate the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.410
need for glasses or contact lenses. PRK laser
surgery generally does not have any effect

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.040
on a patient's overall health and there are
no risks in choosing not to have the surgery.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.080
Your Procedure:

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.330
On the day of your operation, you will be
asked to put on a surgical gown.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.390
You may receive a sedative by mouth and an
intravenous line may be put in.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.220
You will then be transferred to the operating
table.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.310
and you'll be given an anesthetic in the form
of eye drops and an eyelid holder will be

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:07.310
placed around the eye to prevent blinking.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.270
When the operative field is numb, the doctor
will carefully remove the epithelium, or top

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.620
layer of cells, exposing the stroma - the
non-cellular portion of the cornea.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.550
Next, your doctor will use a computer to control
pulses of cool laser light.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.550
These pulses will delicately remove microscopically
thin layers of cells from the stroma. By removing

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.040
tissue in this manner, your doctor will tailor
the new shape of your cornea according to

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.870
the exact nature of your vision problem.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.870
The entire procedure usually takes about 5
minutes and is painless.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.400
Following surgery, you'll be given protective
contact lenses to wear for a few days while

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.400
the outer layer of cells grows back.
