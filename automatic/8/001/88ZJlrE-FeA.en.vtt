00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all today i 'm going to you 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.380
 talk about this little object what is that 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.450
 it is 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.510
 and what 's the point you're all going to see 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
 in this video this little gadget is 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.969
 a gsm tracker 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.889
 it will allow you to call 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 above for to listen to all that is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 pass in the room around him he 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.880
 has two modes of communication 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.310
 either the direct mode is called on the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.650
 sim card that is in the object the object 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.930
 pick up instantly and you hear 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.960
 what happens in the room is 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.700
 the object will be in noise detection mode 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.350
 in noise detection mode this is 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.500
 simple when he hears noise 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.550
 he will call you on your phone 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.260
 and you'll hear what's going on too 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.450
 in the room 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 let's see how it works 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.890
 then simply 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.260
 to insert a sim card into the par in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.100
 the device so a sim card without code 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.920
 preferably pine so that it works 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:01.170
 hop once the sim card to the floor 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.850
 the device will be activated and you 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.090
 can call on the card number 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.810
 sim that you inserted to listen to this 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.810
 that he is going around 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.540
 to switch from one mode to another 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.299
 that is, an audio detection mode 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.570
 or a direct call mode you just 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.710
 to send the code 1-1 1-1 by SMS to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.140
 number in the sim card is the object 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.600
 will switch to noise detection 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.000
 water jo if you want on the contrary 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 so back on the version on the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.020
 direct call mode send you 0000 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.689
 similar to the sim card number and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.530
 the device will automatically go back to 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.939
 number one mode in direct call mode 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.170
 the device has a battery life of three 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.820
 days on standby 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.140
 nobody is going to put him on a standby 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.720
 for three days it's useless 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.750
 so let's say communicating but there two 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.570
 times on a day calls to this is 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.390
 quite common we manage to hold both 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.969
 days 1 otherwise it will recharge with 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.020
 a usb socket 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.049
 so you can connect directly 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.340
 on your computer or on a jack 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.470
 sector and thanks to a supplied adapter 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.020
 with 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.580
 and so it allows you to 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.830
 to have unlimited autonomy 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.680
 when plugged into usb or on 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.360
 sector directly 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.980
 here are the friends the video is over 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.080
 in an upcoming video I will you 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.480
 show a smart switch that is a 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.040
 copy of the galaxy say 200 so are 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 healthy smartwatch that looks pretty 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.090
 interesting for a price rather 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.860
 affordable we'll talk about it as soon as I 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.320
 so get by the end of the month 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.970
 do not hesitate to subscribe to see 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.700
 this video and leave some 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.080
 comments under this one on what 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.760
 you liked what you did not like 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.750
 and if you have questions of course 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.750
 because to chaos
