00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 here is garden as the name is markus 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.410
 head behind the camera in front of the camera 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.309
 july bosch of algae the perennials 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.380
 Gardener from the Allgäu and 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 women's coat the theme right now the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 variety of lady's mantle is there anything 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
 for a variety what is the main places 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.050
 what do we generally mean by 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.180
 women's coat yes the classics you like that 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.660
 In the garden that has as mila mollis the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.720
 soft women's coat next to the voice 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.880
 but here it can show for a moment 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.750
 remains very weak with soft insistence 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.219
 you probably see that now 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.790
 I did not record that well , too 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.559
 around 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.690
 you can not see but since start 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.460
 the 1000 behaved beautifully in that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.629
 women's coat and everyone's in it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.000
 has also seen the early 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.090
 droplets then start here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.579
 build space sets moniz that is times is 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.050
 the soft women's coat will be there 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.989
 I have seen quite high here 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.570
 Exactly is growing very strong 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 only reaches the 50 centimeter height 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.079
 But there are also much smaller women 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.550
 said women often called those in the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.539
 sees mountains are all dwarfs 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.339
 candidates 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.530
 i can go back in line 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.060
 show a little bit of the bring along that 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.100
 is again a chemistry lab is how to 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.320
 so cut in normal gardening 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.240
 it is out there and then afterwards also 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.430
 those are already so big here 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.680
 out of the way actually up to 50 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.820
 that's exactly what you have to get 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.320
 Always keep in mind if you are so 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.150
 a plant in the garden brings her looking 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.350
 only small but then it is so 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.700
 a whole industry exists as well 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.159
 smaller women's coat that it for 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.619
 example alchemilla deep sea was the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.270
 bald women coat carla women coat 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.930
 because he does not have any hair 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.360
 sheet is very clear that will be about half 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.159
 as big as alchemilla mollis is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.890
 for a cramped garden situation a whole 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.149
 good alternative so is the 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.430
 now a bit bigger than about 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.869
 so would 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.960
 40 cm diameter and the office also 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.770
 not so strong from soft eelam olesja 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.040
 Here I have one more 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.750
 smaller dwarf that is müller raised iana 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.700
 who will also silver women's coat 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.320
 called because he is such a beautiful 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.670
 Silver edge has the other one 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.410
 lighting conditions even stronger 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.709
 he falls into the eye he really stays now 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.239
 so at 10 to 20 cm quite nice for a 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.910
 beet foreground or maybe 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.190
 times as a bordering plant at the grave 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.220
 or earlier , gardens were used for rock gardens 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.230
 So for a really cramped situation 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.540
 if you look at all countries assortment 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.830
 how important is a general woman 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260
 officially that one of the best-selling 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.879
 also do not start the best-selling 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.530
 but it really belongs to almost everyone 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.959
 garden somewhere my old miller rhine 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.790
 is just a beautiful plant itself 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.110
 good always a supplement can be used 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.110
 to other stronger ones 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:50.850
 besides as well as the picture shows a lot 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.850
 diversity offers you a heartfelt thanks oliver
