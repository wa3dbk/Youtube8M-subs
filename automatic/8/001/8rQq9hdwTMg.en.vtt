 no 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.999
 it 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:09.579
 the 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.209
 at 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.639
 no 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.499
 r 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.320
 the incident with marc-antoine mathieu but our first rally earth 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.689
 the actor one of the most important choreographers not only from the scene 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.730
 Belgian but also international at the head of his company or the climate weiss 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.340
 and who created it in 86 9% on the year the pib us since it is about us 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.090
 deliver to a new show created in France 8% at the festival au carrÃ© amour 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.680
 sex the show is called nor the very evening of the show me I saw I 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.810
 much higher 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.590
 we are in abstraction but it really works very well I do not 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.030
 think I know I will of course share with the tests 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.560
 will start succeeds in transmitting 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.590
 within the universe as to non-salary charges it is an alternative 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 that is, 100 per cent vote enrollment centers were needed 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.990
 so how do we transmit a green pillar that is over 20 years old 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.120
 and there is coma what we are trying to ride 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
 to recreate something with them new collaborators 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 but I think there are two possibilities of course 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 in this army of shadows so everyone can do it but in this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.310
 county at least one has developed also stay united 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.500
 to collect something it's always the search and for me I think 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.869
 that I'm maybe a pretty destructive creator in the sense of not 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.960
 always stay with the same formation 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.039
 because in the end we are still oneself that contained something 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.319
 and for me the new characters always bring another thing there 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.150
 must not forget also with dancers and magnificent 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.760
 everywhere to go for that means that the creative work does not 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.439
 so it is well before being the one who launched Saturday morning the INSEE 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.170
 Yes, but not only 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.990
 I always worked like that and for me it's Michel who announces himself 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.410
 there is a fear about these factors 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.400
 in themselves I made a coin eurazeo toulepleu to the operation of 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 neoclassical dance had a lot of loneliness 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.200
 in the words is not result close it I think that 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.450
 we must also create a kind 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.819
 why we are here and how we can understand as a sensible system 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.470
 that's why we make the creations of these three cards 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.920
 month 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.509
 here it's three and a half months 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:33.269
 and I know I always have you play I'm thinking about what to do with the 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:33.730
 not 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.129
 because I've done so much not been revealed have been revealed 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.900
 but according to what it is better that we start to go we add in 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.319
 working with energy and it will be the opposite it's a show between 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.469
 humor and renewal we'll all titan see some images on stage 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.059
 there is someone who 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.299
 expat on a year and I saw the novel version trudy malaysia also has a 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.170
 Catalan woman is a text 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.259
 a Flemish author says for years there are music 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.830
 that he plays live on stage then there are the characters the dancers 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.930
 the dancers mimes and finally at the beginning of the show as children 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.930
 who suffocate they just get out of the level between their mother 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.580
 and who will learn it was not at all ready to brake 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.550
 who will learn at least not suspecting him to socialize a 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.040
 market interact arms with others or against each other 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.390
 here are some pictures of this dry show is not certain 

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:29.739
 still 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.159
 cameron avatar 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.419
 soccer 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.599
 we do not come to pay a deserved tribute 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.539
 the 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.539
 3 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.970
 a name 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.439
 short let's go back to our German roots are not see until October 2 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.539
 why at kvs ap brussels does man need twelve new 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.920
 why to move forward you have to continue 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.920
 given kamau here we do a clean sweep of what happened before 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.669
 and we continue but differently with something else 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:47.750
 I think that 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.759
 here with my record for music too 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.330
 4:05 p.m. 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.719
 the musician with the talent of blues musician 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:56.310
 it was very important since 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.900
 I wanted to make a show more abstract 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.849
 she wants to turn because towards the bass the instincts 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.270
 and the reflex all that we forgot the party around the records and more 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.770
 even what the body does not remember 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.180
 these heroes it is something of the unconscious also we warned him 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.410
 to score again for me nothing done it's also about my side 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.180
 liked we are places and manager in short sprints we only have 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.240
 two arms and yet still under the pseudonym is the body 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.419
 our side 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.539
 to reinvent yes and for me 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.319
 it was especially the theater it is also brought men of memory 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.930
 to 2 remember some press sources that this one is always would 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.090
 not there the fairy 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.469
 on their side there is the victorious kind 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.589
 make sense that every time it's like remembering the chain of 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:45.649
 being born and starting over and celebrating 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:48.080
 the show so of you then the man 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.039
 besides every time we put it back and start again 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:53.159
 a fact is rather deserved better 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.379
 two more start again and then you see that your not always take the same 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.379
 way but we take another but there are plenty of possibilities so we get 

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:02.419
 found with 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.159
 of his universe that is perhaps strange love that we can not 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:07.169
 right now 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.319
 so we do not have to commit something good and she when 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.710
 common advent to separate us that's why we will also create a kind 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.710
 we do not come from a concert and we understand the story 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.330
 so this is this bike is something that equals belly and kate 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.460
 winslet in the field of emotion that I thought fundamental compared to 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.500
 dance contemporary dance also know it's not something that carried the 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.009
 word 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:32.680
 although they will not be eliminated there is a text pts 5 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.360
 it's 5 7 bucks worked well this poetry - it's he who makes 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.860
 in 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.590
 art the revival is possible that you have it creators is questioning 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.189
 very regularly and in society it is much more complicated 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:46.410
 today unconventional we came to the end endowed with such 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:47.110
 system 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.210
 he fails to renew himself but I think for me gg question 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.050
 a lot the existence 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.199
 she met in Versailles but boycotted the most we think 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.120
 to do some extreme things the most common is that we are fragile and 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.479
 especially it helps me is that of serious things it was always cut 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:04.139
 with 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.270
 after that m life and death at the end but m in the other side knows 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.970
 something these are very heavy orientation is also supreme proud in 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:12.760
 mass like 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.369
 a baby who is born is a force 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:16.680
 not with someone who has me 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.529
 it's something natural now she's got her strength 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:22.160
 indifferent to passion - who always wants 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.790
 explained ouf one becomes one is scared one becomes a little consumer 7 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.460
 that's all that systems who who are what people this stage cd 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.099
 key something 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.340
 who apart from doing that and who shares his knowledge about the stages of 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:38.750
 change everyone wants to change one day or the other 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.259
 and that's the hardest thing to do 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:43.469
 because one is kneaded usually sees 

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:48.110
 we were all moved to become a habit the mind too but it's for 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.220
 that I did not want to hurt 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.440
 I still want to talk about that and we had to finger we can not change 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.999
 it's also the past the abstract insurer 

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:58.600
 a music have committed 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.010
 left the ps that's something that releases more but you have to be 

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.150
 concrete also because otherwise it becomes conceptual and if it is very 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.010
 concrete it's very physical so ten artists until October 2nd it's at 

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.479
 cabaret s exhaust also on the site doubt an address to see 

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:16.009
 the others but because they are shows that turn a lot 

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:17.479
 to see a little bit of theirs
