to<00:00:55.819> see<00:00:55.999> what<00:00:56.030> would<00:00:56.239> happen<00:00:56.539> when<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:56.929> bear

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
to see what would happen when the bear

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.009 
to see what would happen when the bear
did<00:00:57.289> finally<00:00:57.739> come<00:00:57.949> in<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:59.420> technique<00:00:59.839> is

did finally come in the technique is

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.989 
did finally come in the technique is
called<00:01:00.229> aversive<00:01:00.589> conditioning<00:01:00.799> and<00:01:01.519> the

called aversive conditioning and the
small<00:01:02.239> electric<00:01:02.659> shock<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:03.109> just<00:01:03.379> enough<00:01:03.649> to

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
small electric shock is just enough to

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.890 
small electric shock is just enough to
warn<00:01:04.040> off<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.370> bear<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:05.239> not<00:01:05.420> enough<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.780> do

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
warn off the bear but not enough to do

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.610 
warn off the bear but not enough to do
it<00:01:06.020> any<00:01:06.110> harm

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
it any harm

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.469 
it any harm
after<00:01:07.040> two<00:01:07.250> weeks<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.640> waiting<00:01:07.790> a<00:01:08.180> bear

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
after two weeks of waiting a bear

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.289 
after two weeks of waiting a bear
finally<00:01:09.049> did<00:01:09.260> come<00:01:09.530> in<00:01:09.740> he's<00:01:10.549> a<00:01:10.579> young<00:01:11.090> male

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
finally did come in he's a young male

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:12.999 
finally did come in he's a young male
grizzly<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:11.780> we<00:01:12.020> actually<00:01:12.170> know<00:01:12.560> in<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
grizzly that we actually know in the

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.539 
grizzly that we actually know in the
area<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:15.229> see<00:01:15.469> he<00:01:15.740> comes<00:01:16.009> in<00:01:16.219> and<00:01:16.460> he

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
area and you can see he comes in and he

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.550 
area and you can see he comes in and he
does<00:01:16.759> bite<00:01:17.000> on<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.329> deer<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.659> he<00:01:17.960> gets<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.259> jolt

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
does bite on the deer and he gets a jolt

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.859 
does bite on the deer and he gets a jolt
and<00:01:19.070> we<00:01:19.549> thought<00:01:19.729> well<00:01:19.909> that's<00:01:20.030> great<00:01:20.420> you

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
and we thought well that's great you

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.870 
and we thought well that's great you
know<00:01:20.990> we<00:01:21.140> prove<00:01:21.409> that<00:01:21.439> it's<00:01:21.770> effective<00:01:22.310> what

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
know we prove that it's effective what

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.209 
know we prove that it's effective what
we<00:01:23.000> didn't<00:01:23.299> anticipate<00:01:23.630> was<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.950> bear

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:25.219 
we didn't anticipate was that that bear

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:29.469 
we didn't anticipate was that that bear
was<00:01:25.490> there<00:01:25.729> for<00:01:26.030> 14<00:01:26.960> hours<00:01:27.759> often<00:01:28.759> just

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
was there for 14 hours often just

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.810 
was there for 14 hours often just
staring<00:01:30.229> at<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.500> deer<00:01:30.710> hanging<00:01:31.250> there<00:01:31.460> trying

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
staring at the deer hanging there trying

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.340 
staring at the deer hanging there trying
to<00:01:31.909> figure<00:01:32.119> out<00:01:32.420> how<00:01:32.719> to<00:01:32.780> get<00:01:33.079> it<00:01:33.259> without

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
to figure out how to get it without

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.969 
to figure out how to get it without
getting<00:01:33.799> shocked<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:35.210> next<00:01:35.509> morning<00:01:36.020> he<00:01:36.799> can

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
getting shocked the next morning he can

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.919 
getting shocked the next morning he can
hear<00:01:37.219> the<00:01:37.369> clicking<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.060> Energizer<00:01:38.570> on

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
hear the clicking of the Energizer on

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.249 
hear the clicking of the Energizer on
the<00:01:39.560> deer<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.159> he<00:01:41.149> decides<00:01:41.509> that<00:01:41.719> he<00:01:41.929> needs<00:01:41.960> to

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
the deer and he decides that he needs to

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.200 
the deer and he decides that he needs to
change<00:01:42.649> the<00:01:42.950> environment<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.670> little<00:01:43.700> bit<00:01:44.060> you

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
change the environment a little bit you

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.730 
change the environment a little bit you
can<00:01:44.359> see<00:01:44.390> him<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:44.810> moving<00:01:45.170> around<00:01:45.350> he

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
can see him just moving around he

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.289 
can see him just moving around he
doesn't<00:01:45.859> know<00:01:46.189> what<00:01:46.340> he's<00:01:46.429> doing<00:01:46.460> he<00:01:47.119> just

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
doesn't know what he's doing he just

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.090 
doesn't know what he's doing he just
knows<00:01:47.509> maybe<00:01:47.810> if<00:01:48.140> he<00:01:48.229> changes<00:01:48.799> something

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
knows maybe if he changes something

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.520 
knows maybe if he changes something
it'll<00:01:49.609> make<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:49.939> shot<00:01:50.179> go<00:01:50.450> away<00:01:50.689> he<00:01:51.170> pulled

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
it'll make the shot go away he pulled

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.649 
it'll make the shot go away he pulled
the<00:01:51.679> car<00:01:51.710> battery<00:01:52.369> off<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.060> charger<00:01:53.509> which

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
the car battery off of the charger which

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.569 
the car battery off of the charger which
completely<00:01:54.170> obviously<00:01:54.770> killed<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.280> shock

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
completely obviously killed the shock

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.270 
completely obviously killed the shock
and<00:01:55.969> it<00:01:56.719> was<00:01:56.840> within<00:01:57.020> 90<00:01:57.590> seconds<00:01:58.009> of<00:01:58.100> him

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
and it was within 90 seconds of him

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.639 
and it was within 90 seconds of him
pulling<00:01:58.820> that<00:01:59.090> car<00:01:59.420> battery<00:01:59.780> off<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.229> hearing

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
pulling that car battery off and hearing

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.940 
pulling that car battery off and hearing
the<00:02:01.070> clicking<00:02:01.579> stop<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.899> he<00:02:03.289> went<00:02:03.499> in<00:02:03.649> and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
the clicking stop that he went in and
