00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.779
 to start the exercise you 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 need to choose a slope more abruptly 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.320
 and do not be afraid you will not go miss you 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.200
 will do just side 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.639
 slipping off is a snap 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.750
 lateral sliding is a downward movement 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.850
 on a slope across set to 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.740
 you're moving started leaning on the back 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.740
 cant then leaning on an apron 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 thus you form the work of groups 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.680
 the muscles needed to further 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 learning turns since you chose 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.350
 steep slope this exercise you should 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.160
 start from sitting position you sit down 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.489
 pull and mount lean on 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:05.489
 back edge and with your hands try 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:06.990
 become you get up catch balance and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.250
 check your device 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.080
 your legs must be loaded 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.080
 equally knees bent 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.750
 arms should be in front of you and back 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.770
 must be straight look ahead 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:30.539
 dropping your suits 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:33.119
 you start doing movements while doing 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.520
 your calf muscles are loaded 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.320
 need to get used to the muscles 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.179
 work is quite possible that after that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.880
 your exercises will hurt you tonight 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.920
 muscle is normal and it will 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.049
 last a maximum of three days after 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.299
 of this you will easily do it 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.190
 exercise even between deed and and your 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.610
 turns will be very easy and 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.610
 accurately 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.709
 this is quite a difficult exercise 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.440
 physical plan and it should be done before 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.439
 until the moment you start 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:18.090
 slide off smoothly without any sharp 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:20.340
 mayfly's movements when you finished 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.850
 do this exercise and then unfastened 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.100
 the board 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.140
 do not try to pay it on the sliding 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.090
 surface down is very dangerous for 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.090
 you and for those whom she can come 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.650
 after we learned to do it 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.459
 exercise on the back edge we begin 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.459
 make a drag 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.390
 to start slipping in front 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.080
 cante you need to turn around like 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.630
 this is done you raise one of your 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.060
 feet 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.440
 lie down on your chest and roll over 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:03.320
 leaning on your knees 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.170
 you get up you began to catch balance and 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.040
 check your rack 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.220
 your legs must be loaded 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.110
 equally and knees bent arms should 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.830
 be in front of you and your back should be 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.450
 straight 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:31.640
 look forward dropping you heels 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:33.590
 start to slide off when you started 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:44.240
 do exercise do not try to watch 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:50.540
 look at the board ahead and the most 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.980
 the main back should be flat it 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.440
 quite difficult exercise 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.480
 physical plan and it should be done before 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.670
 until the moment you start 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.660
 slide off smoothly without any sharp 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.660
 crafts movements 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.459
 the process of slipping you can 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.209
 push the board aside 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.950
 down the hill 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:26.500
 usually you just go sit down 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:28.630
 back to prevent you from doing so 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:37.060
 should lean on that leg which 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:39.100
 enter first down psychologically this 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.360
 do not just usually you just 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.160
 sit back to make it easier to understand how 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.740
 try to reach it by hand 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.740
 to the tip to the skit which goes down 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:02.830
 thereby you unwittingly transfer weight 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:05.350
 so how should you do it move 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:09.190
 you doing here is slipping off the plot 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.400
 back and suddenly you are tormented that left 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.950
 leg goes 1 20 I do not sell what you 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.440
 need to do you need to shift weight 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.060
 bodies here on this leg fog in which 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.860
 remote down so it is easier 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.310
 try to reach out with this hand 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.090
 to the tip of the board and the position of your 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.090
 stabilizes 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.300
 you must do this exercise before 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.340
 of the moment until you learn to steadily and 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.860
 move confidently down without at 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.880
 water after which you can proceed to 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.880
 another exercise 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:55.699
 doing the exercises you should not 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:57.559
 make sudden movements why during 

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.079
 first because it won't fix your 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:02.259
 position secondly because it forms 

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:04.729
 wrong technique 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.709
 the next exercise is the beginning and 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.509
 turning behavior it is different from 

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:10.489
 the previous only so that you do not 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:13.969
 slow down and try to continue 

00:06:10.489 --> 00:06:17.049
 moving aside as I do 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:17.049
 I'll try to tell you now
