00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.230
 what's up with the penguins 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.090
 there are some things you should know 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.810
 to better understand penguins 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.700
 the word penguin comes from comes 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.320
 of strangers is not known with 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.650
 certainty of where the word comes from 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.890
 penguin not half of the French pedra 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.020
 Spanish level English some accept it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.680
 with the Welsh peng he means 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.119
 head and win that means white what 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.599
 which makes no sense because it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.670
 penguin has a white head 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.410
 a moment they just told me that in 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.079
 Latin pinguis means fat 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.820
 well that's worse 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.789
 all the penguins live in the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.460
 southern hemisphere is a common idea to believe 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:52.030
 that only live in Antarctica these 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.799
 nine racks can also find 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.670
 penguins on all continents of the 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.500
 southern hemisphere in more can you 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.360
 find them even on the islands 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.960
 galÃ¡pagos is even more still have not is 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.690
 and it does not reach me 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.900
 the penguins can spend more than 75 of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.670
 their life in the water have an advantage in 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 which allows them to be their prey 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.460
 neither interned 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.649
 imagine that you are running and someone 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.229
 Give a hamburger and swallow it 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.420
 whole while you keep running like this 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.880
 like the penguin does it alone that if you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.810
 you do it you would instantly die of a 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.149
 cardiac arrest 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.790
 in the water they are very agile thanks to their 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.310
 wings that work like you're good 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.689
 for something they had to serve and weigh 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.909
 to that your body has a design 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.659
 aerodynamic this does not help them to 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.240
 fly not the penguins do not fly I am 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.689
 who deceived you that flight more flight a 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.890
 hen manca sucks penguin testa what 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.170
 that it is true that this design 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.170
 aerodynamic helps you to slide 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.720
 more easily by water but that's not 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.700
 It is the only thing that gives more agility their 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.280
 bones are not hollow as they have the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.920
 Most birds are consistent and 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.289
 heavy this property helps them not 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.450
 have buoyancy 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.890
 suck that chicken that you know well 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 you can not even float 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.770
 what 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.810
 started to sing to me 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.060
 on earth however the penguins 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.880
 they are not so agile and they have a walk and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.440
 these are like when you realize very 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.270
 late that there is no toilet paper in 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.570
 the bathroom and you go out to look for him 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.730
 pants down if you do walk the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.069
 penguins like you with the pants down 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.620
 some think of the penguins as 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.260
 small and black animals this is not 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.110
 true as there are all colors sizes 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.520
 and flavors the smallest is the penguin 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.580
 blue the biggest is the stopped penguin 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.650
 the tastiest good one does not know which one is 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.520
 the tastiest is a protected animal 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.080
 it is forbidden to eat penguin if any 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.360
 Once you thought that penguins always 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.060
 they walk elegant do not be fooled by 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.860
 appearances the colors of his body 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.070
 They are specially designed for 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.690
 camouflage since while they stop if we 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.150
 you see from above you get confused with the sea 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.790
 if you see them from below they get confused 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.070
 the light of day which does not help them 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.370
 nothing because they still eat them 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.940
 suck that movie not if they have many 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.050
 predators but they are all aquatic 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.330
 proof of this is that they are not afraid of 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.770
 to humans some believe it is 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.140
 because they do not have any tempered 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.200
 terrestrial since the polar bear that is 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.270
 a little bit far 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.970
 in a group the penguins are very birds 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.510
 sociable many species feed 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.050
 nothing raise their babies in groups a 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.349
 group of penguins is called colony if 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.349
 penguin colony 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.480
 when they find the love of their life the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.000
 Most penguins become 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.260
 monogamous means that the male in 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.379
 the female remain faithful during 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.060
 all the glue period or never 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.760
 you will find a penguin with buckets 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.640
 also in many cases both 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.290
 they will stay together almost all their lives 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.630
 the most beautiful thing in couples 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.060
 penguins is that they share the labors 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.310
 the house there are times when mom 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.700
 Penguin goes hunting while 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.490
 they leave another taking care of the chick 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.310
 how should this be one girls out 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.330
 I only say never put your vagina on 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.430
 Water 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.060
 it's already great to realize that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.060
 they are not ducks 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.210
 i 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.380
 all right 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.990
 ah
