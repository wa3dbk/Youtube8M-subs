00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and how big is corn to supply 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.940
 a new video and this time I'm going 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.010
 to submit 12 that probably already 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.719
 you have seen in the smile it is about you 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.090
 and as you are seeing then the truth is 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 which is an authentic past we are going to read 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
 what is not explained about him and tells us 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.690
 which is a physical medium as well 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.789
 they say previous videos and that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 your sentences so without further delay 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.840
 let's start playing with him as 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.400
 always for the new ones to the channel say 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.039
 that I come to practice mode in 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.199
 sand or in just although this case is in 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.930
 sand to test the new gods and in 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.660
 this case I attend as you are seeing the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.879
 skin is pretty cool the wing to the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.500
 Also, let's see how it works 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.180
 Comports in combat I 'm not quite 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.800
 happy because everything I said in the 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.950
 videos in which I announced that I was going to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.320
 go out and its news because I think it 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.570
 has accomplished virtually everything so 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.340
 let's check it and as I say let's go 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.660
 to see how he behaves though 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 probably you already have it 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.500
 tried because it does 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.210
 a few days that went out we're going to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.670
 investigation to prove it when it 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.840
 they carry the votes because they are throwing 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 your rate we 'll see what 's there is 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.220
 As we go out we will buy the boots 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.110
 you know that always good because it is the item 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 initiator and like six watching the attack 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.640
 basic is pretty cool does not have 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.200
 up to three good one for attacks 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.850
 different not this that would be the first 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.580
 is the second and this the third and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.470
 let's read and its passive its passive we 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.540
 says that good is pretty sane it 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.000
 call a holding company and go tell us that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.640
 it was a town and messmer and they can not 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.220
 affect active beyond a second is 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.350
 say that the effects that some 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.020
 gods such as the study or the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.280
 mes menis will not affect you for more than 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.619
 a second so it's pretty good 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
 we will alienate your first ability 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.229
 this one of this stay because as you know 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.570
 there are two stays in intern though 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.360
 what I think are quite similar if not 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.240
 I'm wrong more ruiz 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.680
 they are called equal let's go there well then 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.210
 how are we in this stay now 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.070
 let's read the first skill of the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.460
 stays calls files and tells us that 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.680
 pull good load forward damaging 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.920
 to enemies for 60 damage 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.400
 magic of physical harm forgiveness and good in 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.310
 this in this stay in the stay of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.730
 assault throw all the enemies by 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.579
 in front of you giving them twice yes 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.010
 grams sticking them in the air and good 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:30.390
 Well, it would be basically this in this 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.810
 stay of you hits 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.700
 only once to all the gods 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.080
 be careful here because as you are watching 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.480
 the effect is pretty cool and we're going to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.209
 try here there is how you see the one 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.100
 time and be careful that we are paid to this and 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.490
 Well well enough we will not see 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.190
 How good is a skill that is 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.040
 pretty well it does not promise enough we're going 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.530
 to try it if it seems to you in the 1st 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.180
 the other stay of you here you have it 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.650
 As you can see, he hits them twice and 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.239
 threw in the air and be careful that we die 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.310
 more start we are not interested let's 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.780
 seek the support of our colleagues 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.790
 you have already seen that the minions have 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.280
 changed but this will be discussed in the 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.690
 another video about this park 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.510
 We go without delay to buy the 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.320
 janet boots his skill in that he 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.690
 called because he tells us that if he makes a 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.090
 massive attack of 180 degrees with its 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.870
 sword and it gives all the enemies 70 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.390
 Physical damage and in the assault stay 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.550
 the enemies are what is in the 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.240
 air 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:39.160
 and well he throws them away and in the other 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:42.470
 stay heals you 30 health points 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.150
 for each enemy that impacts and then 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.710
 your skill we will not approve it without 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.350
 more procrastination with continuing to see them well 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.850
 is very cool and see if we can 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.530
 take us down from that envelope that 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.020
 although I do not think so, let's try it 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.000
 we use the first skill and not the 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.130
 we have given and the second one to see here is 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.770
 and see if we get the low yes yes 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.660
 OK 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.430
 with the third with the third attack 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.070
 basic that makes us a kind of combo 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.870
 so pretty well let's read and the 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.580
 third skill forgiveness 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.870
 let's use the con kale any of the 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.240
 that we have already seen as you see the 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.489
 first it gave me quite strong in this 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.930
 stay and kill her pretty fast and 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.060
 the truth looks quite effective 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.340
 pretty well we see already the third one that 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.500
 Well, what will allow us is 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.450
 just change distance as 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.689
 you are seeing we change of stay of 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:35.069
 let's say to the defense 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:38.909
 to highlight the work and tells us to be 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.759
 throws into the air giving damage to 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:46.049
 all the enemies in the area by 150 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:48.509
 physical damage points and their speed of 

00:04:46.049 --> 00:04:50.309
 movement is reduced by 25% 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:52.669
 3 seconds so let's try it 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:54.929
 first, if you think we change 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.149
 stay because I like it more than 

00:04:54.929 --> 00:04:58.979
 attack and here we throw them both 

00:04:57.149 --> 00:05:02.519
 through the air we do this and we're going to 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.869
 use the skill and here is how 

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:05.219
 you are seeing, it has worked 

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:07.589
 pretty good with sun and we have not arrived 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:10.110
 to catch Cali with SamanÃ¡ and care that 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.909
 do not kill us the bad 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.589
 I'm seeing for now though 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.289
 obviously I have not played with this yet 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:18.989
 God, it's quite a fault 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.759
 Care that is worth as keep watching then 

00:05:18.989 --> 00:05:23.489
 the skills have a 15 condom 12 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.039
 14 and well obviously the last one 

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:27.779
 and 3 the one that has more in this case of 85 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.189
 a little less than normal 

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.649
 let's try to kill this year and if 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:33.299
 not carrying active assistance is worth and 

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:35.309
 well, this was basically I hope 

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:37.409
 that you liked that you enjoyed 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:39.599
 I have served you to understand 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:43.339
 that is to say and see you in the next 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.339
 video enjoy it goodbye
