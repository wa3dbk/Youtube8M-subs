 Hello everyone and everyone welcome to the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.330
 channel today's video is a tutorial of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.160
 makeup for obviously a makeup 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.780
 that we have put I have done using 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.400
 Shearing this palette that as I told you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.530
 I really wanted to release 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.330
 sorry, my voice is a little weird and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.920
 at the beginning the video probably 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 you see that I have super bad face because 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.789
 I'm bad but good anyway 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.590
 I wanted to record you something on the palette 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.570
 we have loved the shadows 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.490
 they are of incredible quality 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.710
 they blur very very well I like it a lot 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.210
 because they have nothing to fallout me 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.740
 I mean when the shadows at 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.780
 apply them on the eyelid they start to 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.210
 drop bits on the cheek and we finish 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.770
 with the cheek full of residue of the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.230
 shadow and then we have to go through 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.540
 wipes and others to remove it and that no 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.579
 are erased from all the makeup with 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 these shadows does not happen that at all 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.230
 I'm completely in love with this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.050
 shadow of here is an absolutely color 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 precious if you do not look how it is in the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.469
 eyelid is the color that I wear from all 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.210
 mobile eyelid I love this kind of 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.129
 purple for brown eyes or 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.410
 greenish brown I have brown 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.329
 with some vein a little greenish this 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.850
 kind of bruises that are the least like 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.009
 intense that are almost blue are the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.110
 purple ones that I like the most for this 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.670
 Eye color for my eyes color and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.409
 I am delighted with this palette of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.580
 way very much of having bought it from 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.500
 this side is not very very difficult to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.689
 find because it is sold in england 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.369
 I have seen some boots that they have are 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.080
 distills and if not you can also ask 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.159
 online on some websites so I do not think 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.530
