one<00:02:42.460> I<00:02:42.640> guess<00:02:42.820> some<00:02:43.030> people<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:43.840> in

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
one I guess some people like that but in

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.430 
one I guess some people like that but in
the<00:02:45.180> waterline<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.510> have<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.110> think<00:02:47.200> it

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
the waterline I have it and I think it

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.950 
the waterline I have it and I think it
looks<00:02:47.680> weird<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.490> looks<00:02:48.520> like<00:02:48.970> plastic<00:02:49.480> or

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
looks weird it looks like plastic or

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.720 
looks weird it looks like plastic or
something<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.440> just<00:02:50.470> look<00:02:50.800> strange<00:02:51.250> within

something you just look strange within

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.350 
something you just look strange within
my<00:02:51.880> opinion<00:02:52.300> maybe<00:02:52.450> I'm<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:53.610> used<00:02:54.610> to<00:02:54.730> seeing

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
my opinion maybe I'm just used to seeing

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.070 
my opinion maybe I'm just used to seeing
something<00:02:55.540> dark<00:02:55.840> there<00:02:56.670> anyway<00:02:57.670> I<00:02:58.030> hope<00:02:58.780> that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
East Coast and the reason for that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.900 
East Coast and the reason for that
mainly<00:03:16.900> is<00:03:17.020> because<00:03:17.440> having<00:03:18.340> been<00:03:18.460> raised<00:03:18.760> in

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910

every time a snowflake hits the ground
the<00:03:23.530> entire<00:03:24.040> town<00:03:24.370> basically<00:03:24.700> shuts<00:03:25.240> down<00:03:25.450> and

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
the entire town basically shuts down and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.590 
the entire town basically shuts down and
