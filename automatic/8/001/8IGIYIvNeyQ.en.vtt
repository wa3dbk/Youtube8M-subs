it's simple so I'm gonna walk you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.369 
it's simple so I'm gonna walk you
through<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> system<00:00:35.989> we're<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.200> start

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
through the system we're going to start

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:38.870 
through the system we're going to start
with<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> button<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.070> we're<00:00:38.730> going<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
with the button and we're going to

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.700 
with the button and we're going to
following<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.270> down<00:00:39.510> now<00:00:39.900> when<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.380> push<00:00:40.560> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
following it down now when we push the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.140 
following it down now when we push the
button<00:00:40.920> I'm<00:00:41.070> just<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> explain<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.850> as

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.150 
button I'm just going to explain this as

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.490 
button I'm just going to explain this as
I<00:00:42.240> go<00:00:42.360> along<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.750> imagine<00:00:43.110> I've<00:00:43.200> pushed<00:00:43.380> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
I go along so imagine I've pushed the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.350 
I go along so imagine I've pushed the
button<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> send<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.940> signal<00:00:45.300> off

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
button it's going to send one signal off

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.200 
button it's going to send one signal off
that<00:00:45.570> way<00:00:45.720> one<00:00:46.620> signal<00:00:46.980> off<00:00:47.040> that<00:00:47.250> way<00:00:47.370> now<00:00:47.880> if

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that way one signal off that way now if

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.330 
that way one signal off that way now if
I<00:00:48.360> talk<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.630> you<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:48.810> this<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.340> repeaters

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
I talk to you about this one repeaters

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
I talk to you about this one repeaters
only<00:00:51.329> accept<00:00:52.140> redstone<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> way<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
only accept redstone the way that the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.889 
only accept redstone the way that the
current<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.790> so<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.270> will<00:00:54.420> only<00:00:54.510> accept

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
current is going so it will only accept

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.780 
current is going so it will only accept
the<00:00:55.050> repeated<00:00:55.470> if<00:00:55.710> redstone<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.489> going

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
the repeated if redstone is going

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.040 
the repeated if redstone is going
through<00:00:56.940> this<00:00:57.030> repeater<00:00:57.390> it's<00:00:57.720> only<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
through this repeater it's only going to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.410 
through this repeater it's only going to
go<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> way<00:00:58.559> if<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:59.579> signal<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.000> sent<00:01:00.059> round

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
go this way if a signal is sent round

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.210 
go this way if a signal is sent round
and<00:01:01.020> goes<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> say<00:01:02.010> no

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
and goes like this it's going to say no

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.429 
and goes like this it's going to say no
so<00:01:02.610> this<00:01:03.180> way<00:01:03.360> signal<00:01:03.809> from<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.079> button<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
so this way signal from the button is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.740 
so this way signal from the button is
going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.710> cut<00:01:04.890> off<00:01:05.070> straight<00:01:05.339> away<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> we

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
going to be cut off straight away so we

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.580 
going to be cut off straight away so we
don't<00:01:06.869> need<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> worry<00:01:07.110> about<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> one

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
don't need to worry about that one

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.770 
don't need to worry about that one
however<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.119> carry<00:01:09.329> on<00:01:09.420> so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
however this one is going to carry on so

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.020 
however this one is going to carry on so
each<00:01:10.470> repeater<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> different<00:01:11.729> settings

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
each repeater has a different settings

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.910 
each repeater has a different settings
so<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.110> closer<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.860> be

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so is if it's closer it's going to be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.200 
so is if it's closer it's going to be
quicker<00:01:14.159> if<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.670> further<00:01:14.880> away<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.180> going

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
quicker if it's further away it's going

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.500 
quicker if it's further away it's going
to<00:01:15.390> take<00:01:15.510> longer<00:01:15.920> 0.1<00:01:16.920> seconds<00:01:17.310> 0.2<00:01:18.090> seconds

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
to take longer 0.1 seconds 0.2 seconds

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.130 
to take longer 0.1 seconds 0.2 seconds
0.3<00:01:19.260> seconds<00:01:19.650> 0.4<00:01:20.340> seconds<00:01:20.760> now<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.690> believe<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
0.3 seconds 0.4 seconds now I believe I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
0.3 seconds 0.4 seconds now I believe I
did<00:01:22.320> 60<00:01:23.040> repeaters<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> can't<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.909> one<00:01:24.000> hundred

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
did 60 repeaters I can't be one hundred

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
did 60 repeaters I can't be one hundred
percent<00:01:24.240> sure<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.690> that<00:01:24.780> 60<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> these

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
percent sure on that 60 of these

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.060 
percent sure on that 60 of these
repeaters<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.490> think<00:01:26.909> made<00:01:27.750> me<00:01:28.020> 30<00:01:28.680> set<00:01:28.950> either

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
repeaters I think made me 30 set either

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.380 
repeaters I think made me 30 set either
way<00:01:29.250> whatever<00:01:29.460> happens<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.060> row<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
way whatever happens this row of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.420 
way whatever happens this row of
repeaters<00:01:30.780> here<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.290> 30<00:01:31.680> seconds<00:01:32.190> worth<00:01:32.340> of

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
repeaters here is 30 seconds worth of

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.580 
repeaters here is 30 seconds worth of
repeaters<00:01:32.760> okay<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.260> reason<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> know

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
repeaters okay now the reason I know

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.840 
repeaters okay now the reason I know
it's<00:01:34.770> 30<00:01:34.920> seconds<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.310> because<00:01:35.520> obviously<00:01:35.670> i

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
it's 30 seconds is because obviously i

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700 
it's 30 seconds is because obviously i
added<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.330> naught<00:01:36.450> point<00:01:36.630> fours<00:01:36.930> until<00:01:37.650> I

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
added all the naught point fours until I

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.310 
added all the naught point fours until I
made<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> at<00:01:38.100> 30<00:01:38.340> seconds<00:01:38.960> when<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.049> reaches

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
made it at 30 seconds when it reaches

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
made it at 30 seconds when it reaches
the<00:01:40.439> end<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.580> two<00:01:41.729> signals

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the end of this one we have two signals

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.969 
the end of this one we have two signals
one<00:01:42.720> signal<00:01:43.080> will<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.229> sent<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.650> command

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
one signal will be sent to the command

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.469 
one signal will be sent to the command
block<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.580> will<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:44.820> sent<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> continue

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
block and one will be sent to continue

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
block and one will be sent to continue
down<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.689> way<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.680> command<00:01:46.979> block<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.400> going

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
down that way the command block is going

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.609 
down that way the command block is going
to<00:01:47.700> say<00:01:47.909> whatever<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.960> puts<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
to say whatever we want just puts a and

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.109 
to say whatever we want just puts a and
then<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.250> message<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.900> free<00:01:51.900> hot<00:01:52.200> dogs<00:01:53.119> at

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
then the message and free hot dogs at

said<00:02:00.320> say<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.650> command<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.159> use<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.909> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
said say is the command we use like this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.679 
said say is the command we use like this
hey<00:02:04.100> to<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.310> okay<00:02:06.240> we'll<00:02:06.479> come<00:02:06.630> out

have three you want to add another one
you<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:47.750> continue<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.500> down<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.800> this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
you just continue it down like this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.860 
you just continue it down like this
you'd<00:02:49.100> add<00:02:49.220> another<00:02:49.460> row<00:02:49.700> here<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.480> just<00:02:50.720> make

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you'd add another row here and just make

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.630 
you'd add another row here and just make
it<00:02:50.900> go<00:02:51.020> down<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:51.440> another<00:02:51.560> rope<00:02:51.890> if<00:02:52.070> you<00:02:52.490> want

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
it go down with another rope if you want

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640 
it go down with another rope if you want
to<00:02:52.700> end<00:02:52.820> it<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.300> have<00:02:53.540> we're<00:02:54.440> going<00:02:54.590> to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
to end it like I have we're going to

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.380 
to end it like I have we're going to
continue<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.340> signal<00:02:55.910> is<00:02:55.970> going<00:02:56.030> to<00:02:56.150> go<00:02:56.270> in

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
continue the signal is going to go in

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.460 
continue the signal is going to go in
there<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.630> it's<00:02:56.750> going<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.900> continue<00:02:56.990> down

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
there and it's going to continue down

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.050 
there and it's going to continue down
here<00:02:57.650> now<00:02:57.800> the<00:02:57.860> signal<00:02:58.310> has<00:02:58.340> got<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.730> get<00:02:58.850> back

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
here now the signal has got to get back

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.880 
here now the signal has got to get back
to<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.360> start<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.870> start<00:03:00.080> its<00:03:00.200> 30<00:03:00.350> second<00:03:00.770> loop

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
to the start to start its 30 second loop

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.800 
to the start to start its 30 second loop
as<00:03:01.070> quick<00:03:01.340> as<00:03:01.490> possible<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.480> we're<00:03:02.570> just<00:03:02.600> going

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
as quick as possible so we're just going

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.720 
as quick as possible so we're just going
to<00:03:02.870> get<00:03:02.990> the<00:03:03.110> redstone<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.560> go<00:03:03.680> down<00:03:03.860> here<00:03:04.070> now

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
to get the redstone to go down here now

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.340 
to get the redstone to go down here now
redstone<00:03:05.330> I<00:03:05.510> believe<00:03:05.750> can<00:03:05.900> only<00:03:06.020> go<00:03:06.140> through

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
redstone I believe can only go through

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
redstone I believe can only go through
15<00:03:08.170> bits<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.380> redstone<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.190> can<00:03:10.280> only

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
15 bits of redstone so it can only

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.010 
15 bits of redstone so it can only
travel<00:03:10.700> through<00:03:10.970> 15<00:03:11.360> bits<00:03:11.540> let's<00:03:11.750> just<00:03:11.900> check

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
travel through 15 bits let's just check

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.330 
travel through 15 bits let's just check
that<00:03:12.140> 2<00:03:12.380> 3<00:03:12.620> 4<00:03:12.860> 5<00:03:13.100> 6<00:03:13.130> 7<00:03:13.760> 9<00:03:14.060> 10<00:03:14.870> 11<00:03:14.900> 12<00:03:15.440> 13<00:03:15.500> 14<00:03:15.920> that's

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
that 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 that's

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.670 
that 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 that's
right<00:03:16.490> yeah<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.570> 15th<00:03:17.900> one<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.410> obviously

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
right yeah so the 15th one is obviously

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.890 
right yeah so the 15th one is obviously
gonna<00:03:18.950> read<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.340> repeater<00:03:19.670> now<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.630> reason<00:03:20.750> I

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
gonna read the repeater now the reason I

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.390 
gonna read the repeater now the reason I
say<00:03:21.050> that<00:03:21.080> is<00:03:21.260> because<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.740> repeater<00:03:22.100> can

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
say that is because a repeater can

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.540 
say that is because a repeater can
extend<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:24.680> length<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.160> redstone

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
extend the the length of the redstone

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.070 
extend the the length of the redstone
can<00:03:25.940> carry<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.480> it's<00:03:26.660> going<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.840> allow<00:03:26.960> for

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
can carry so it's going to allow for

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.990 
can carry so it's going to allow for
another<00:03:27.380> 15<00:03:27.770> so<00:03:28.340> it's<00:03:28.610> going<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.790> go<00:03:28.880> through

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
another 15 so it's going to go through

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.750 
another 15 so it's going to go through
here<00:03:29.180> it's<00:03:29.300> going<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.510> continue<00:03:29.920> 14<00:03:30.920> and<00:03:31.460> then

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
here it's going to continue 14 and then

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.430 
here it's going to continue 14 and then
15<00:03:32.180> and<00:03:32.330> it's<00:03:32.450> going<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.600> extend<00:03:32.900> again<00:03:33.140> back

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
15 and it's going to extend again back

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.070 
15 and it's going to extend again back
to<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.740> start<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.430> 15<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:35.390> then<00:03:35.510> again<00:03:35.840> down

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
to the start and 15 and then again down

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.170 
to the start and 15 and then again down
here<00:03:36.110> 15<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.310> all<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.490> you<00:03:37.610> can<00:03:37.880> see<00:03:38.030> all<00:03:38.150> of

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
here 15 and all of you can see all of

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.670 
here 15 and all of you can see all of
these<00:03:38.330> are<00:03:38.480> set<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.750> naught<00:03:38.900> point<00:03:39.080> 1<00:03:39.290> seconds

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
these are set to naught point 1 seconds

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.870 
these are set to naught point 1 seconds
we<00:03:39.740> want<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.950> get<00:03:40.070> down<00:03:40.220> as<00:03:40.370> quick<00:03:40.550> as<00:03:40.700> possible

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
we want to get down as quick as possible

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.960 
we want to get down as quick as possible
and<00:03:41.200> then<00:03:42.200> through<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.500> last<00:03:42.740> one<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.160> back

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and then through the last one and back

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.950 
and then through the last one and back
to<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.180> start<00:03:44.420> and<00:03:44.510> it's<00:03:44.630> going<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.810> loop

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
to the start and it's going to loop

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.720 
to the start and it's going to loop
again<00:03:45.110> obviously<00:03:46.010> one<00:03:46.160> bit<00:03:46.310> will<00:03:46.430> go<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.580> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
again obviously one bit will go to the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.460 
again obviously one bit will go to the
button<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.090> nothing<00:03:47.360> will<00:03:47.450> happen<00:03:47.690> so<00:03:48.170> let's

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
button but nothing will happen so let's

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.920 
button but nothing will happen so let's
demonstrate<00:03:48.730> when<00:03:49.730> we<00:03:49.820> press<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.210> our<00:03:50.480> first

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
demonstrate when we press it our first

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.240 
demonstrate when we press it our first
bit<00:03:51.110> red<00:03:51.260> stones<00:03:51.440> going<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.680> hit<00:03:51.800> there<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:52.130> go

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
bit red stones going to hit there and go

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.040 
bit red stones going to hit there and go
what<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.460> hell<00:03:52.670> why<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.000> am<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.540> going<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:53.840> way

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
what the hell why I am I going this way

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.930 
what the hell why I am I going this way
and<00:03:54.080> just<00:03:54.410> cut<00:03:54.740> out<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.430> other<00:03:55.520> bits<00:03:55.730> going<00:03:55.880> to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
and just cut out the other bits going to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.940 
and just cut out the other bits going to
come<00:03:56.090> down<00:03:56.210> here<00:03:56.890> like<00:03:57.890> so<00:03:59.410> as<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:00.560> see<00:04:00.740> by<00:04:00.890> the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
come down here like so as you see by the

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.980 
come down here like so as you see by the
way<00:04:01.070> this<00:04:01.190> isn't<00:04:01.460> dot<00:04:01.730> on<00:04:01.940> 30<00:04:02.240> seconds<00:04:02.870> and

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
way this isn't dot on 30 seconds and

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.690 
way this isn't dot on 30 seconds and
because<00:04:03.530> obviously<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.890> signal<00:04:04.250> going<00:04:04.460> back

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
because obviously the signal going back

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.430 
because obviously the signal going back
is<00:04:04.970> going<00:04:05.150> to<00:04:05.210> be<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:05.720> know<00:04:05.810> a<00:04:05.840> tiny<00:04:06.140> little

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
is going to be you know a tiny little

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.380 
is going to be you know a tiny little
it's<00:04:07.160> very<00:04:07.370> fast<00:04:07.670> but<00:04:07.880> it's<00:04:07.970> gonna<00:04:08.060> be<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.210> tiny

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
it's very fast but it's gonna be a tiny

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.510 
it's very fast but it's gonna be a tiny
bit<00:04:08.510> behind<00:04:08.870> there's<00:04:09.440> not<00:04:09.560> perfect<00:04:10.340> 30

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
bit behind there's not perfect 30

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.230 
bit behind there's not perfect 30
seconds<00:04:10.970> was<00:04:11.090> very<00:04:11.330> close<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.460> you<00:04:13.460> go<00:04:13.640> free

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
seconds was very close and you go free

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.199 
seconds was very close and you go free
cot<00:04:14.480> dogs<00:04:14.709> hot<00:04:15.709> dogs<00:04:15.740> free<00:04:16.580> hot<00:04:16.730> dogs<00:04:17.000> at<00:04:17.150> the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
cot dogs hot dogs free hot dogs at the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.520 
cot dogs hot dogs free hot dogs at the
cafe<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.350> we<00:04:18.650> go<00:04:18.770> down<00:04:18.950> here<00:04:18.980> and<00:04:20.410> it's<00:04:21.410> going

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
cafe and we go down here and it's going

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.610 
cafe and we go down here and it's going
to<00:04:21.590> put<00:04:21.709> another<00:04:21.890> one<00:04:22.840> eventually<00:04:23.840> after<00:04:24.050> 30

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
to put another one eventually after 30

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.960 
to put another one eventually after 30
seconds<00:04:25.040> time<00:04:25.220> it's<00:04:25.460> going<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.640> send<00:04:25.820> another

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
seconds time it's going to send another

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.060 
seconds time it's going to send another
one<00:04:26.120> there<00:04:26.419> after<00:04:27.169> another<00:04:27.350> 30<00:04:27.590> seconds<00:04:27.919> it's

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
one there after another 30 seconds it's

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.530 
one there after another 30 seconds it's
going<00:04:28.190> to<00:04:28.250> send<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.460> one<00:04:28.669> there<00:04:28.880> and<00:04:29.030> i'll

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
going to send that one there and i'll

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.670 
going to send that one there and i'll
show<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.900> coming<00:04:30.140> all<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.410> way<00:04:30.440> back<00:04:30.620> to

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
show you it coming all the way back to

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.310 
show you it coming all the way back to
the<00:04:30.890> beginning

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
the beginning

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.840 
the beginning
now<00:04:33.500> basically<00:04:34.500> like<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:34.920> said<00:04:35.190> there's<00:04:35.670> two

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
now basically like I said there's two

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.820 
now basically like I said there's two
there's<00:04:36.300> like<00:04:36.450> two<00:04:36.660> systems<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.230> this<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.680> can

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
there's like two systems to this you can

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.940 
there's like two systems to this you can
have<00:04:37.980> the<00:04:38.670> ugly<00:04:38.940> method<00:04:39.300> with<00:04:39.780> huge<00:04:40.680> amounts

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
have the ugly method with huge amounts

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.020 
have the ugly method with huge amounts
of<00:04:41.100> redstone<00:04:41.460> using<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:41.970> randomizer<00:04:43.220> but<00:04:44.220> no

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
of redstone using a randomizer but no

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.000 
of redstone using a randomizer but no
signal<00:04:45.480> as<00:04:46.080> well<00:04:46.260> it's<00:04:46.500> really<00:04:46.770> hard<00:04:46.890> to

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
signal as well it's really hard to

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.830 
signal as well it's really hard to
describe<00:04:47.280> let<00:04:47.910> me<00:04:47.970> tell<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.360> from<00:04:48.480> scratches

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
describe let me tell you from scratches

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.000 
describe let me tell you from scratches
aren't<00:04:49.020> told<00:04:49.200> you<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.410> it's<00:04:49.560> quite<00:04:49.740> hard<00:04:49.890> to

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
aren't told you this it's quite hard to

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.970 
aren't told you this it's quite hard to
explain<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:51.020> there<00:04:52.020> was<00:04:52.140> no<00:04:52.260> way<00:04:52.500> of<00:04:52.530> creating

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
explain and there was no way of creating

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.430 
explain and there was no way of creating
randomness<00:04:53.880> in<00:04:54.270> Minecraft<00:04:54.750> okay<00:04:55.080> through<00:04:55.410> a

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
randomness in Minecraft okay through a

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.320 
randomness in Minecraft okay through a

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
no way of creating randomness not

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.540 
no way of creating randomness not

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
perfect randomness they go you see go

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.650

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
creating perfect randomness it's just

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.190 
creating perfect randomness it's just

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
asking why would you want that well you

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.180 
asking why would you want that well you
can<00:05:27.990> see<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.290> this<00:05:28.380> system<00:05:28.590> is<00:05:28.830> in<00:05:28.980> order

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
can see that this system is in order

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.850 
can see that this system is in order
this<00:05:29.610> is<00:05:29.760> a<00:05:29.790> it's<00:05:30.720> an<00:05:30.840> ordered<00:05:31.200> message<00:05:31.500> system

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
this is a it's an ordered message system

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.170 
this is a it's an ordered message system
it<00:05:31.950> goes<00:05:32.070> one<00:05:32.280> off<00:05:32.400> to<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.550> other<00:05:32.760> which<00:05:33.150> is

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
it goes one off to the other which is

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.550 
it goes one off to the other which is
actually<00:05:33.420> how<00:05:33.600> I<00:05:33.630> prefer<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.200> wouldn't<00:05:34.440> like<00:05:34.530> a

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
actually how I prefer I wouldn't like a

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.410 
actually how I prefer I wouldn't like a
random<00:05:34.980> one<00:05:35.070> but<00:05:35.520> if<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.640> did<00:05:35.820> want<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.090> random

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
random one but if you did want a random

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.460 
random one but if you did want a random
one<00:05:36.710> obviously<00:05:37.710> you<00:05:37.830> may<00:05:38.010> if<00:05:38.430> I<00:05:38.520> demonstrate

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
one obviously you may if I demonstrate

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.020 
one obviously you may if I demonstrate
you<00:05:40.470> may<00:05:40.620> put<00:05:40.800> multiple<00:05:41.190> command<00:05:41.520> blocks<00:05:41.730> up

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030 
you may put multiple command blocks up

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.880 
you may put multiple command blocks up
against<00:05:42.330> each<00:05:42.450> other<00:05:42.630> like<00:05:42.780> this<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.260> you<00:05:43.770> may

against each other like this and you may

it to pick one at random you won't want

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
it to say them all at once like it would

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.670 
it to say them all at once like it would
do<00:05:58.770> there<00:05:58.980> if<00:05:59.220> you<00:05:59.370> had<00:05:59.520> them<00:06:00.290> like<00:06:01.290> this<00:06:01.500> you

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
do there if you had them like this you

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.240 
do there if you had them like this you
won't<00:06:01.800> want<00:06:01.980> it<00:06:02.070> to<00:06:03.590> say<00:06:04.590> them<00:06:04.770> like<00:06:05.070> that

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250 
won't want it to say them like that

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.100 
won't want it to say them like that
until<00:06:05.580> repeater<00:06:05.940> sorry<00:06:06.360> I'm<00:06:06.480> starting<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:06.930> bit

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110

until repeater sorry I'm starting a bit
okay<00:06:08.040> like<00:06:08.310> that<00:06:08.460> you<00:06:09.210> won't<00:06:09.360> want<00:06:09.480> it<00:06:09.510> to<00:06:09.630> do

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
okay like that you won't want it to do

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.090 
okay like that you won't want it to do
that<00:06:09.870> because<00:06:10.050> then<00:06:10.200> it's<00:06:10.560> going<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.740> say<00:06:10.920> them

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
that because then it's going to say them

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.100 
that because then it's going to say them
all<00:06:11.190> at<00:06:11.340> the<00:06:11.430> exact<00:06:11.790> same<00:06:12.030> time<00:06:12.330> you<00:06:12.900> want<00:06:13.050> it

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
all at the exact same time you want it

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.890 
all at the exact same time you want it

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:22.920 
to figure out because it takes a damned

a<00:06:23.130> lot<00:06:23.310> of<00:06:23.430> redstone<00:06:23.760> to<00:06:24.210> create<00:06:24.510> a<00:06:24.630> random

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
a lot of redstone to create a random

a lot of redstone to create a random
