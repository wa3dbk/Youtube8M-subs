wearing this and that's why I had to get

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.740 
wearing this and that's why I had to get
it<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.280> she<00:01:29.579> had<00:01:29.670> green<00:01:29.939> eyes<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.570> her

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it because she had green eyes and her

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.920 
it because she had green eyes and her

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.810 
little travel sized this is a pro I
makeup<00:01:49.049> remover<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> fix<00:01:50.399> plus

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
makeup remover and this is the fix plus

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.120 
makeup remover and this is the fix plus
I<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.990> would<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.229> great<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> carry<00:01:52.979> in

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I think this would be great to carry in

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
I think this would be great to carry in
your<00:01:53.159> kit<00:01:53.520> because<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.790> doesn't<00:01:54.149> take<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
your kit because it doesn't take up a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.410 
your kit because it doesn't take up a
lot<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.720> space<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.610> refill<00:01:57.000> them<00:01:57.210> too

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
lot of space and you can refill them too

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.830 
lot of space and you can refill them too
