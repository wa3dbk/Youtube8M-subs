00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
for it and I realized the only one that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.130 
for it and I realized the only one that
actually<00:00:32.820> looks<00:00:33.270> good<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.780> probably<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
actually looks good it's probably the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139 
actually looks good it's probably the
tiger<00:00:34.559> camo<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.100> kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> wish<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.000> would

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
tiger camo I kind of wish they would

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.610 
tiger camo I kind of wish they would
have<00:00:36.239> had<00:00:36.360> different<00:00:36.600> styles<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.320> tiger

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
have had different styles of the tiger

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.680 
have had different styles of the tiger
maybe<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:38.010> bring<00:00:38.370> back<00:00:38.550> red<00:00:38.879> tiger<00:00:39.360> blue

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
maybe like bring back red tiger blue

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.810 
maybe like bring back red tiger blue
tiger<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.320> think<00:00:40.980> blue<00:00:41.129> tiger<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.579> probably

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
tiger I think blue tiger was probably

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.869 
tiger I think blue tiger was probably
the<00:00:41.910> best<00:00:42.120> camel<00:00:42.510> they've<00:00:42.660> had<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.879> don't

possible<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.650> it<00:02:57.740> feels<00:02:57.920> heavier<00:02:58.570> like<00:02:59.570> when

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
possible but it feels heavier like when

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.910 
possible but it feels heavier like when
you're<00:02:59.810> moving<00:03:00.050> around<00:03:00.140> with<00:03:00.440> your<00:03:00.500> character

you<00:04:18.729> know<00:04:18.880> I'm<00:04:19.600> making<00:04:19.930> shots<00:04:20.410> that<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.769> never

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
you know I'm making shots that I never

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.249 
you know I'm making shots that I never
ever<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.820> make<00:04:22.000> on<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.360> Xbox<00:04:22.810> just<00:04:23.050> because

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:23.259 
ever can make on the Xbox just because

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.650 
ever can make on the Xbox just because
my<00:04:23.410> control<00:04:23.860> over<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.280> over<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:25.090> sticks<00:04:25.419> is

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
my control over that over the sticks is

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.230 
my control over that over the sticks is
nowhere<00:04:26.620> near<00:04:26.860> where<00:04:27.039> it<00:04:27.160> needs<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:27.400> be<00:04:27.490> but

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
nowhere near where it needs to be but

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.080 
nowhere near where it needs to be but
I'm<00:04:28.360> getting<00:04:28.570> better<00:04:28.630> not<00:04:29.350> playing<00:04:29.680> and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
I'm getting better not playing and

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.430 
I'm getting better not playing and
improving<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.509> I<00:04:31.690> guess<00:04:31.900> that's<00:04:32.020> really<00:04:32.320> all

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
improving so I guess that's really all

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.469 
improving so I guess that's really all
that<00:04:32.470> matters<00:04:32.620> with<00:04:32.979> that<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.479> think

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
that matters with that I think

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.390 
that matters with that I think
eventually<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:35.110> probably<00:04:35.410> will<00:04:35.830> be<00:04:35.979> better<00:04:36.160> on

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
eventually I probably will be better on

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.200 
eventually I probably will be better on
the<00:04:36.490> Xbox<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.180> Playstation<00:04:38.699> just<00:04:39.699> because<00:04:40.000> I

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
the Xbox and Playstation just because I

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.310 
the Xbox and Playstation just because I
don't<00:04:40.389> know<00:04:40.449> what<00:04:40.600> it<00:04:40.690> is<00:04:40.720> but<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:41.110> game

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
don't know what it is but the game

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.080 
don't know what it is but the game
seemed<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.830> run<00:04:42.009> a<00:04:42.070> little<00:04:42.250> bit<00:04:42.430> smoother<00:04:42.940> or

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
seemed to run a little bit smoother or

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.540 
seemed to run a little bit smoother or
that<00:04:43.720> could<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:43.930> in<00:04:44.139> my<00:04:44.229> mind<00:04:44.470> to<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:45.160> don't

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
that could be in my mind to I don't

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.779 
that could be in my mind to I don't
really<00:04:45.669> know<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:47.590> thing<00:04:47.620> with<00:04:47.949> this<00:04:48.070> WMD

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
really know but the thing with this WMD

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.080 
really know but the thing with this WMD
map<00:04:49.060> is<00:04:49.740> now<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:50.889> I<00:04:50.949> go<00:04:51.070> back<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.430> watch<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.849> I

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
map is now that I go back and watch it I

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.650 
map is now that I go back and watch it I
really<00:04:53.050> like<00:04:53.259> this<00:04:53.440> map<00:04:53.650> because<00:04:54.039> I<00:04:54.660> always

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
really like this map because I always

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.300 
really like this map because I always
have<00:04:55.870> a<00:04:55.900> lot<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.110> success<00:04:56.560> on<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.889> and<00:04:57.039> the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
have a lot of success on it and the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.650 
have a lot of success on it and the
reason<00:04:57.550> I<00:04:57.610> have<00:04:57.729> some<00:04:57.910> what<00:04:58.030> success<00:04:58.479> is

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
reason I have some what success is

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.180 
reason I have some what success is
because<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.199> way<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.470> map<00:04:59.680> is<00:04:59.830> built

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
because the way the map is built
