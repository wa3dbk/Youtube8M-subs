00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
the longest while and so now before I

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.509 
the longest while and so now before I
used<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.340> say<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.699> an<00:00:24.000> error<00:00:24.449> has<00:00:24.600> occurred

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
used to say as an error has occurred

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.150 
used to say as an error has occurred
some<00:00:26.519> next<00:00:26.970> code<00:00:27.210> number<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.949> are

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
some next code number right now they are

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.880 
some next code number right now they are
showing<00:00:29.699> me<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:32.660> playstation<00:00:33.660> network<00:00:33.890> is

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
showing me this playstation network is

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.610 
showing me this playstation network is
currently<00:00:35.820> undergoing<00:00:37.670> maintenance<00:00:38.690> as<00:00:39.690> you

currently undergoing maintenance as you
can<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:42.590> basically<00:00:43.590> means<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.329> it

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
can see that basically means that it

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.560 
can see that basically means that it
either<00:00:45.840> someone<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.620> hacking<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.730> they're

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
either someone is hacking in and they're

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
either someone is hacking in and they're
trying<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> stop<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.680> person<00:00:50.039> for<00:00:50.190> macking

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920
