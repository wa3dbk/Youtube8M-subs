00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 if they took place this Sunday and what 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.060
 whatever the level on the grounds of 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.200
 foot violence does not stay out 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.269
 of the sports enclosure 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.860
 in sold a referee was violently 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.980
 assaulted two weeks ago 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.389
 since 2006 it's a crime in this 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.699
 department an agreement was signed 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.730
 to speed up the judicial process 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.130
 and audi boil and boris rape have taken over 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.580
 the way to the stadium stage pardon with 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.140
 this referee shocked a fortnight after 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.859
 his aggression by a player on a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.779
 soccer field 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.090
 guillaume de vaud returns to the stage for 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.219
 arbitrate every weekend since five 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.570
 years ago he would never referee 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.579
 imagined such violence 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.649
 after whistling the expulsion of a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.300
 player after a dangerous tackle 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.700
 I was noticing are in cardboard 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.789
 of referee the time the score is the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.500
 reason why I had excluded him and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.149
 when I raised the head of gender c 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.449
 was in front of me 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.370
 the punch here is the closed fist the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.949
 point directly to my face 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.629
 it can be expressed otherwise than by the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.370
 violence so yes I want a lot to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.549
 his player to that kind of forgiveness 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.770
 and here I am it is unforgivable and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.210
 inexcusable following this punch 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.200
 guillaume de vaud had five days 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.869
 stoppage of work 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.000
 today he is still shocked then 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.920
 before the game Beauvoir on sea or years 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.369
 referee wishes to recall a few 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.979
 rules to the captains of the teams that 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:32.189
 referees are people like 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:34.020
 you have welded for the same since the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 day after his assault the young 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.600
 arbitrator was filed a complaint against his 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 aggressor 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
 since June the national union 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.360
 football referees and the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 parquet of sands-d'olonne and the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.460
 rock on yon have signed a convention 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.850
 this convention is to allow 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.710
 quicker steps to 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.899
 legally so in case of aggression 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.979
 of an arbitrator also allows the intervention 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.520
 police forces to challenge 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.320
 directly guilty and so able 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.420
 to have a blatant cap offense all 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.640
 aggression committed against a 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.740
 referee can be punished for five years 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.770
 imprisonment 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.830
