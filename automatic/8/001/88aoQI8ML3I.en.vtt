about embryonic stem cells and about

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
early stages of embryo Genesis is that

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.710 
early stages of embryo Genesis is that
all<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.010> development<00:02:40.400> can<00:02:41.360> happen

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
all of this development can happen

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.400 
all of this development can happen
outside<00:02:42.379> the<00:02:42.590> womb<00:02:42.819> this<00:02:43.819> can<00:02:44.060> happen<00:02:44.299> in<00:02:45.049> a

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
outside the womb this can happen in a

outside the womb this can happen in a
tissue<00:02:45.829> culture<00:02:46.010> dish<00:02:47.079> so<00:02:49.750> cells<00:02:50.750> from<00:02:51.079> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
tissue culture dish so cells from the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.089 
tissue culture dish so cells from the
inner<00:02:51.349> cell<00:02:51.680> mass<00:02:52.120> can<00:02:53.120> be<00:02:53.299> removed<00:02:53.920> we<00:02:54.920> can

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
inner cell mass can be removed we can

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.250 
inner cell mass can be removed we can
take<00:02:55.340> these<00:02:55.549> cells<00:02:55.879> and<00:02:56.690> we<00:02:56.810> can<00:02:56.840> put<00:02:57.140> them

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
take these cells and we can put them

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.000 
take these cells and we can put them
into<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.739> tissue<00:02:58.099> culture<00:02:58.700> dish<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.299> now<00:03:00.260> these

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
into a tissue culture dish and now these

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.500 
into a tissue culture dish and now these
cells<00:03:01.819> which<00:03:02.569> become<00:03:03.079> embryonic<00:03:03.680> stem<00:03:04.069> cells

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
cells which become embryonic stem cells

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.580 
cells which become embryonic stem cells
can<00:03:05.510> divide<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.680> replicate<00:03:07.609> endlessly<00:03:08.590> so

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
can divide and replicate endlessly so

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.559 
can divide and replicate endlessly so
these<00:03:09.739> cells<00:03:10.099> continue<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.849> divide<00:03:11.000> they

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
these cells continue to divide they

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.149 
these cells continue to divide they
continue<00:03:12.049> to<00:03:12.079> generate<00:03:12.409> more<00:03:12.890> and<00:03:12.950> more

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
continue to generate more and more

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.309 
continue to generate more and more
embryonic<00:03:13.819> stem<00:03:14.180> cells<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.659> an<00:03:14.720> infinite

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
embryonic stem cells in an infinite

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.580 
embryonic stem cells in an infinite
supply<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.739> embryonic<00:03:16.280> stem<00:03:16.670> cells<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.590> then

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
supply of embryonic stem cells and then

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.729 
supply of embryonic stem cells and then
we<00:03:19.459> can<00:03:19.700> appropriately<00:03:20.660> adjust<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.530> tissue

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
we can appropriately adjust the tissue

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.920 
we can appropriately adjust the tissue
culture<00:03:22.190> conditions<00:03:22.450> so<00:03:23.450> that<00:03:23.630> we<00:03:23.720> can

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
culture conditions so that we can

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.920 
culture conditions so that we can
regenerate<00:03:24.880> blastocysts<00:03:25.880> in<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.510> culture<00:03:26.900> dish

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
regenerate blastocysts in a culture dish

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.470 
regenerate blastocysts in a culture dish
so<00:03:27.799> these<00:03:27.980> embryonic<00:03:28.430> stem<00:03:28.879> cells<00:03:29.180> are

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
so these embryonic stem cells are

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.050 
so these embryonic stem cells are
capable<00:03:29.989> to<00:03:30.440> give<00:03:30.470> rise<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.459> this<00:03:31.639> structure

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
capable to give rise to this structure

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.990 
capable to give rise to this structure

trophic<00:03:35.980> trophectoderm<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.989> yet<00:03:38.989> if<00:03:39.230> we

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
trophic trophectoderm and yet if we

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.869 
trophic trophectoderm and yet if we
culture<00:03:39.829> our<00:03:39.950> conditions<00:03:40.400> slightly

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
culture our conditions slightly

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.689 
culture our conditions slightly
differently<00:03:41.299> these<00:03:42.139> cells<00:03:42.530> can<00:03:43.160> just<00:03:43.370> divide

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
differently these cells can just divide

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.180 
differently these cells can just divide
and<00:03:44.030> endlessly<00:03:44.690> generate<00:03:45.199> more<00:03:45.769> embryonic

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
and endlessly generate more embryonic

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.589 
and endlessly generate more embryonic
stem<00:03:46.549> cells<00:03:46.879> and<00:03:47.209> then<00:03:48.139> if<00:03:48.500> we<00:03:49.099> take<00:03:49.129> this

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
stem cells and then if we take this

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.319 
stem cells and then if we take this
blastocyst<00:03:50.599> and<00:03:50.930> we<00:03:51.470> implant<00:03:51.980> that<00:03:52.299> into<00:03:53.299> a

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
blastocyst and we implant that into a

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.369 
blastocyst and we implant that into a
pregnant<00:03:54.199> female<00:03:54.560> mouse<00:03:55.549> that<00:03:56.510> blastocyst

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
pregnant female mouse that blastocyst

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.280 
pregnant female mouse that blastocyst
will<00:03:57.859> give<00:03:57.980> rise<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.459> whole<00:03:58.579> Mouse<00:03:58.819> and<00:03:59.299> so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
will give rise to a whole Mouse and so

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.789 
will give rise to a whole Mouse and so
these<00:04:00.709> are<00:04:00.949> truly<00:04:01.660> totipotent<00:04:02.660> cells<00:04:02.930> we<00:04:03.620> can

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
these are truly totipotent cells we can

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.800 
these are truly totipotent cells we can
divide<00:04:04.129> them<00:04:04.310> endlessly<00:04:04.879> in<00:04:05.269> a<00:04:05.569> tissue

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
divide them endlessly in a tissue

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.970 
divide them endlessly in a tissue
culture<00:04:05.989> dish<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:06.799> if<00:04:07.730> we<00:04:08.650> culture<00:04:09.650> them<00:04:09.829> to

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
culture dish and if we culture them to

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.830 
culture dish and if we culture them to
the<00:04:10.069> blastocyst<00:04:10.699> stage<00:04:10.849> we<00:04:11.269> can<00:04:11.419> implant

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
the blastocyst stage we can implant

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.280 
the blastocyst stage we can implant
those<00:04:12.079> blastocysts<00:04:12.829> into<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.370> mice<00:04:13.549> and

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
those blastocysts into the mice and

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.349 
those blastocysts into the mice and
generate<00:04:15.290> more<00:04:16.039> mice

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.740 

so<00:04:19.669> why<00:04:20.669> is<00:04:20.729> this<00:04:21.060> important<00:04:21.689> for
