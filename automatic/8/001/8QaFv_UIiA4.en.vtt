00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.670
 April 2012 in the world capital of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.109
 cellulose still lectures visits 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.900
 techniques and novelties in machinery 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.309
 implements and supplies 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.380
 all gathered in one place, but the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.610
 opportunity to visit all 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.610
 forestry companies in the region 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.550
 the plantation of eucalypt forest rocket 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.980
 and nurseries 1 three forest ponds is one 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.410
 of the municipal 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.060
 three ponds forest panel organization 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.920
 an important step was taken 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.680
 recently in the city of Ribas do Rio 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.320
 for the implementation of the arrangement 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.750
 productive local city course 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.690
 like employees owners 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.790
 sawing a way to make the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.470
 eucalyptus unfolding 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.000
 follow the report here in Ribas do 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.369
 brown river are approximately 20 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.320
 companies operating exclusively in the 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.210
 the timber sector to include producers 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.040
 which are dedicated to the planting of forests 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.050
 processing enterprises 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.119
 processing and unfolding of wood 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.610
 that the sawmills are part of this 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.500
 chain to adapt techniques to add 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.840
 more value to the final product is a 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.399
 challenge to consolidate the activity in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.399
 develop the local productive arrangement 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.479
 with a population of approximately 20 thousand 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.640
 inhabitants of the river 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.409
 in the rural productive sector and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.260
 historically shows the strong vocation 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.240
 for the activities of the timber industry 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.159
 public power and private initiative has 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.020
 partnerships and actions aimed at 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.909
 use of solid wood from 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.130
 eucalyptus and pinus creating a 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.720
 sustainable economic or better 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 use of the raw material and its 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.410
 derivatives for companies 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.360
 processing of wood by means of 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.140
 training and professionalization of the 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.140
 sector 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.600
 The main challenges I believe are 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.030
 awareness of the timber sector 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.850
 of the loggers of those who are 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.630
 producing are generating employment so that 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.120
 they understand the need to change the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.540
 concepts and change the concept of production 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.150
 to start preparing for the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.940
 future concepts to make 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.320
 through technology through 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.170
 knowledge through 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.950
 of the labor force remains competitive in the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.620
 Marketplace 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.390
 for those who are here today 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.450
 I will survive tomorrow 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.790
 the challenge is to make that today we 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.610
 we have 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.489
 around 15 loggers here these errors 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:00.989
 15 they get involved in the process they 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.510
 together want to build a 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.379
 much stronger future in the economy 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.239
 local and for the company's economy 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.430
 the course of solving techniques of 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.470
 eucalyptus and value added to wood 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.689
 was one of the actions for improvement and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.269
 qualification for the industry lasting 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.889
 total of 24 classroom hours the training was 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.500
 carried out through a partnership between 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.930
 various agents as daughter business

 ribbed wood and wood panel 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.299
 appropriate methodology and 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.510
 techniques for daily practice 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.549
 were the focus of ongoing activities with 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.530
 This always brings news to the teacher. 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.510
 that comes from the paraná that is a place that 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.540
 without change 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.669
 the carlet already brings news shows that 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.989
 there is the possibility of closing the 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:54.209
 calypso and it really has 11 in little 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.909
 time has a market to be broken 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.949
 anyway it's really feasible 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.810
 You're the hair and certainly with the 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:03.180
 the Madeira itself will 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.199
 realize this a lack pine wood 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.139
 who is next and is 56 years old in 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:12.419
 maximum and be prepared for the impending 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.069
 change in the forest matrix of the region or 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.299
 even the great goal of professionals 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.340
 that work in the 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.139
 so beyond theory the exchange of 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.180
 experiences and practical classes as well 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.979
 were part of the programming 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.599

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.510
 Federal University of Paraná and researcher 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.699
 foundation of forest research in the 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.690
 for the minister, the theoretical content and 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.260
 practical 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.060
 until the years 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.010
 all we have pine forest 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.530
 practically they will be exchanged forest 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.750
 eucalyptus there is the need for a 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.060
 specific training and eucalyptus 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.100
 has its peculiarities has its 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.230
 stubbornness let's say so 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.020
 at the time of the cut but nothing that people 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.720
 can not master having a technique 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.510
 of sewage is an experience and 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.140
 as the new variety 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:06.340
 We're going to have to close more have more. 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:08.440
 and more time, we can analyze 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.980
 behavior in this way the market 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.130
 is asking for eucalyptus already has some 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.350
 business effects is with eucalyptus inside 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.780
 the city of Campo Grande and the transition 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.640
 from pinus to carlito needs these 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.340
 courses to bring information 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.310
 As a saw to us as a supplier to 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.790
 part of species is part of harvest 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.290
 very important in this regard is by 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.760
 through the professionalization of 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.710
 entrepreneurs and workers to 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.510
 diversify the production that will be 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.310
 possible to attract to the municipality 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.190
 investments linked to the forestry chain 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.010
 in a competitive and socially just manner 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.300
 including optimization of sub-products and 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.550
 generation of income for small 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.870
 farmers in the settlements of 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.300
 family farming 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.770
 The first step has already been taken by 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.780
 work for the acceptance of 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.980
 proposed changes is a change of 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.510
 culture we are trying to 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.450
 prepare people to unfold a way 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.330
 has different methods that 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:12.220
 have a different form of manipulation 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:16.480
 both in cultivation and in no cut as 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.370
 in the handling is sawdust as in drying 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.450
 I have a lot of factors 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.460
 many different 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.440
 then this preparation needs to be 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.240
 worked with businessmen myself 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.420
 I would say that more you choose to be just 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.270
 awareness and convincing 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.300
 of entrepreneurs came the last
