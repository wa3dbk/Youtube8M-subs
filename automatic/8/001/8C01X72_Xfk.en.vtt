projects and here we're going to create

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.930 
projects and here we're going to create
a<00:00:29.849> new<00:00:30.060> program<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> let's<00:00:32.820> call<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.800> first

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
a new program and let's call it my first

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.709 
a new program and let's call it my first
drive<00:00:37.070> and<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.250> close<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.640> content<00:00:38.969> editor<00:00:39.270> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

everstorm robot on the steering block we

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880 
everstorm robot on the steering block we
can<00:00:59.550> choose<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> direction<00:01:00.350> by<00:01:01.350> changing<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can choose the direction by changing the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860 
can choose the direction by changing the
steering<00:01:02.219> parameter<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.510> choose<00:01:03.690> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
steering parameter we can choose the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.700 
steering parameter we can choose the
power<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.939> we<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:05.970> choose<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.869> duration<00:01:07.140> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
power and we can choose the duration so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.710 
power and we can choose the duration so
how<00:01:07.860> long<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.220> should<00:01:08.250> drive<00:01:08.580> let's<00:01:09.299> connect

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
how long it should drive let's connect

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.250 
how long it should drive let's connect
the<00:01:10.170> everstorm<00:01:10.740> robot<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.750> see<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:13.049> this

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the everstorm robot and see what this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.130 
the everstorm robot and see what this
block<00:01:13.439> does

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.430 

so<00:01:20.940> in<00:01:21.940> this<00:01:22.090> tutorial<00:01:22.240> I'm<00:01:22.660> gonna<00:01:22.870> be<00:01:23.080> using<00:01:23.200> a

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
so in this tutorial I'm gonna be using a

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.800 
so in this tutorial I'm gonna be using a
different<00:01:23.590> method<00:01:24.010> for<00:01:24.250> downloading<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.720> if

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
different method for downloading so if

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.480 
different method for downloading so if
you<00:01:25.870> look<00:01:26.050> down<00:01:26.080> here<00:01:26.470> on<00:01:26.620> the<00:01:27.040> button<00:01:27.310> below

as it's downloaded but be careful not to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.000 
as it's downloaded but be careful not to
let<00:01:37.060> your<00:01:37.240> robot<00:01:37.510> drive<00:01:37.720> off<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.870> table<00:01:38.320> when

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
let your robot drive off the table when

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.370 
let your robot drive off the table when
you're<00:01:39.100> using<00:01:39.280> this<00:01:39.520> function<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:41.020> we<00:01:41.170> press

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
you're using this function so we press

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.300 
you're using this function so we press
the<00:01:41.680> download<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.070> run<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.320> as<00:01:48.010> you<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.250> see

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
the download and run and as you can see

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.090 
the download and run and as you can see
the<00:01:48.729> robot<00:01:48.850> moved<00:01:49.180> forward<00:01:49.680> I'm<00:01:50.680> gonna<00:01:50.920> move

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
the robot moved forward I'm gonna move

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.390 
the robot moved forward I'm gonna move
him<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.310> bit<00:01:51.430> back<00:01:51.640> away<00:01:52.570> from<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.869> edge<00:01:52.900> again

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
him a bit back away from the edge again

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.870 
him a bit back away from the edge again
so<00:01:54.400> back<00:01:54.700> in<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:54.970> software<00:01:55.240> I'm<00:01:56.550> now<00:01:57.550> going<00:01:57.790> to

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
so back in the software I'm now going to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.469 
so back in the software I'm now going to
add<00:01:58.000> an<00:01:58.240> extra<00:01:58.990> move<00:01:59.530> steering<00:02:00.009> block<00:02:00.479> this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
add an extra move steering block this

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.440 
add an extra move steering block this
time<00:02:02.009> I'm<00:02:03.009> gonna<00:02:03.220> change<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:04.119> steering

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
time I'm gonna change the steering

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.800 
time I'm gonna change the steering
parameter<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.649> I'm<00:02:05.770> gonna<00:02:05.920> set<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:07.420> minus

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
parameter and I'm gonna set it to minus

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.400 
parameter and I'm gonna set it to minus
100<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.679> as<00:02:09.520> you<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.759> see<00:02:09.820> now<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.869> arrow<00:02:11.080> on

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
100 and as you can see now the arrow on

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.470 
100 and as you can see now the arrow on
top<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.860> steering<00:02:12.070> parameter<00:02:12.610> now

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
top of the steering parameter now

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.220 
top of the steering parameter now
changes<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.080> an<00:02:14.170> arrow<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.709> turns<00:02:14.950> left<00:02:16.230> so

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
changes to an arrow that turns left so

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.580 
changes to an arrow that turns left so
let's<00:02:17.410> try<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.920> run<00:02:18.400> this<00:02:18.520> program<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.590> again

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
let's try and run this program and again

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.110 
let's try and run this program and again
we<00:02:20.739> use<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:20.950> download<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.520> run<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:27.340> as<00:02:27.970> you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
we use the download and run and as you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.390 
we use the download and run and as you
can<00:02:28.239> see<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.840> robot<00:02:29.019> drove<00:02:29.440> forward<00:02:29.799> and<00:02:30.070> then

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
can see the robot drove forward and then

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.539 
can see the robot drove forward and then
turned<00:02:30.640> left<00:02:31.500> I'll<00:02:32.500> reposition<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.280> robot

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
turned left I'll reposition the robot

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.220 
turned left I'll reposition the robot
again<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.920> I<00:02:36.130> want<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.150> robot<00:02:37.299> to<00:02:37.510> turn<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.080> bit

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
again so I want the robot to turn a bit

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.930 
again so I want the robot to turn a bit
further<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:39.730> now<00:02:39.760> I'm<00:02:40.000> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.239> change<00:02:40.450> this

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
further so now I'm going to change this

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.490 
further so now I'm going to change this
duration<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.269> 1.5<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:45.450> after<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.840> want

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
duration to 1.5 and after that I want

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.620 
duration to 1.5 and after that I want
her<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.739> move<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.950> bit<00:02:48.100> backwards<00:02:48.519> so<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.480> gonna

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
her to move a bit backwards so I'm gonna

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.820 
her to move a bit backwards so I'm gonna
add<00:02:49.840> another<00:02:50.130> steering<00:02:51.130> block<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.620> then<00:02:53.620> I'm

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
add another steering block and then I'm

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.449 
add another steering block and then I'm
gonna<00:02:54.010> change<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:56.140> power<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:57.310> minus<00:02:57.730> 50<00:02:59.040> so<00:03:00.040> by

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
gonna change the power to minus 50 so by

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.030 
gonna change the power to minus 50 so by
changing<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.970> power<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.720> minus<00:03:02.080> 50<00:03:02.410> I'm<00:03:02.799> gonna

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
changing the power to minus 50 I'm gonna

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.600 
changing the power to minus 50 I'm gonna
make<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.340> robot<00:03:03.670> move<00:03:03.790> backwards<00:03:04.390> instead<00:03:05.610> so

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
make the robot move backwards instead so

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.100 
make the robot move backwards instead so
let's<00:03:06.910> download<00:03:07.840> this<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.470> run<00:03:08.739> it

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.030 

and<00:03:14.390> as<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.540> could<00:03:15.660> see<00:03:15.870> the<00:03:16.530> robot<00:03:16.860> move

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
and as you could see the robot move

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.490 
and as you could see the robot move
backwards<00:03:17.460> as<00:03:17.610> well<00:03:18.140> so<00:03:19.140> that's<00:03:19.320> how<00:03:19.440> you

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
backwards as well so that's how you

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.990 
backwards as well so that's how you
build<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.830> program<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.400> makes<00:03:20.580> your<00:03:20.700> robot

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
build a program that makes your robot

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.440 
build a program that makes your robot
drive<00:03:21.270> see<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> soon
