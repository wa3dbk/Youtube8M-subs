Ct prepper I just want to show you a
little<00:00:11.730> piece<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.030> hardware<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.719> have<00:00:12.960> I

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
little piece of hardware that I have I

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.140 
little piece of hardware that I have I
want<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.799> encourage<00:00:14.130> you<00:00:14.630> to<00:00:15.630> consider<00:00:16.529> energy

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
want to encourage you to consider energy

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.980 
want to encourage you to consider energy
and<00:00:18.150> if<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.720> get<00:00:18.930> short<00:00:19.230> on<00:00:19.410> energy<00:00:20.810> no<00:00:21.810> matter

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and if we get short on energy no matter

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.679 
and if we get short on energy no matter
what<00:00:22.199> happens<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> grid<00:00:22.920> goes<00:00:23.130> down<00:00:23.689> whatever

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
what happens the grid goes down whatever

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.890 
what happens the grid goes down whatever
you<00:00:24.930> use<00:00:25.320> your<00:00:25.590> imagination<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:26.660> need<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> way

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you use your imagination you need a way

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.230 
you use your imagination you need a way
to<00:00:27.960> produce<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.890> provide<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:29.939> your<00:00:30.060> family

well<00:00:31.140> what<00:00:31.410> I've<00:00:31.500> got<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.360> a<00:00:33.469> piece<00:00:34.469> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
well what I've got here is a piece of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.799 
well what I've got here is a piece of
the<00:00:34.980> system<00:00:35.370> I'm<00:00:35.579> sure<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.480> needed<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the system I'm sure I just needed to

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.650 
the system I'm sure I just needed to
charge<00:00:36.989> some<00:00:37.260> batteries<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:39.450> I'm

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
charge some batteries that I have so I'm

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.360 
charge some batteries that I have so I'm
searching<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.260> batteries<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.129> I'm<00:00:41.219> using

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
searching some batteries but I'm using

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.650 
searching some batteries but I'm using
my<00:00:42.050> my<00:00:43.280> actually<00:00:44.280> blue<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.120> hours<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.510> this

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
my my actually blue the hours on this

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.040 
my my actually blue the hours on this
puppy

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
puppy

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.500 
puppy
we're<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> hour<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:49.100> zero<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.510> bought

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
we're the hour here here zero I bought

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.799 
we're the hour here here zero I bought
this<00:00:52.190> for<00:00:53.190> three<00:00:53.399> hundred<00:00:53.460> bucks<00:00:59.270> and<00:01:00.270> all<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
this for three hundred bucks and all it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.319 
this for three hundred bucks and all it
does<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:00.989> drives<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.739> car<00:01:02.039> alternator<00:01:02.370> pretty

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
does is drives a car alternator pretty

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.700 
does is drives a car alternator pretty
simple<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.739> 12-volt<00:01:05.700> source

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
simple but it's a 12-volt source

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.960 
simple but it's a 12-volt source
so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> have<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.750> will<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.320> diesel<00:01:10.970> hybrid

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
so I have or will have a diesel hybrid

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.140 
so I have or will have a diesel hybrid
solar<00:01:12.450> panels<00:01:13.520> only<00:01:14.520> produce<00:01:14.730> so<00:01:14.970> much

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
solar panels only produce so much

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.990 
solar panels only produce so much
wattage<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.260> I<00:01:16.350> go<00:01:16.470> beyond<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.980> or<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
wattage and if I go beyond that or it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.250 
wattage and if I go beyond that or it
turns<00:01:18.300> out<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.690> be<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.640> overcast<00:01:20.640> day<00:01:21.000> now<00:01:21.900> today

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
turns out to be a overcast day now today

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.820 
turns out to be a overcast day now today
but<00:01:23.160> another<00:01:23.430> day<00:01:23.670> that's<00:01:23.790> overcast<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
but another day that's overcast or a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.800 
but another day that's overcast or a
month<00:01:26.070> that's<00:01:26.430> overcast<00:01:26.910> we<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
month that's overcast we can have that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.880 
month that's overcast we can have that
in<00:01:27.960> Illinois<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.550> well<00:01:29.990> then<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.020> crank<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
in Illinois here well then I crank this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.790 
in Illinois here well then I crank this
guy<00:01:32.100> up<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.720> run<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.050> hour<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> day<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.619> so

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
guy up and run it for hour a day or so

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.180 
guy up and run it for hour a day or so
these<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.160> super<00:01:35.729> efficient<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.190> get

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
these are super efficient and just get

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.950 
these are super efficient and just get
my<00:01:38.369> batteries<00:01:38.790> back<00:01:39.030> up<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.420> where<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.780> need

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
my batteries back up to where they need

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.530 
my batteries back up to where they need
to<00:01:39.990> be<00:01:40.700> when<00:01:41.700> you're<00:01:41.820> designing<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.330> system

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
to be when you're designing a system

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.680 
to be when you're designing a system
it's<00:01:43.050> good<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> robust<00:01:44.250> backup<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
it's good to have robust backup kind of

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.150 
it's good to have robust backup kind of
like<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:45.960> these<00:01:46.110> windmills<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.950> see

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
like all these windmills that you see

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.910 
like all these windmills that you see
around<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:48.420> back<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.050> nuclear<00:01:49.710> power

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
around the back up is a nuclear power

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
around the back up is a nuclear power
plant<00:01:50.009> why<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.910> has<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> nuke<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.960> be

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
plant why not just has a nuke and be

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.430 
plant why not just has a nuke and be
done<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:55.700> kilowatt<00:01:56.700> hours<00:01:56.970> 18<00:01:57.899> cents<00:01:58.320> a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
done but kilowatt hours 18 cents a

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.710 
done but kilowatt hours 18 cents a
kilowatt<00:01:58.830> hour<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.430> more<00:01:59.670> than<00:01:59.880> nuclear<00:01:59.970> for

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
kilowatt hour much more than nuclear for

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.859 
kilowatt hour much more than nuclear for
wind<00:02:01.500> power<00:02:01.940> anyway<00:02:02.940> we<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> worry<00:02:03.840> about

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
wind power anyway we can worry about

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:10.880 
wind power anyway we can worry about
politics<00:02:04.410> later<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:10.170> was<00:02:10.380> one<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.770> was

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
politics later and this was one that was

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.060 
politics later and this was one that was
never<00:02:11.250> used<00:02:11.840> those<00:02:12.840> from<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> state<00:02:14.040> of

never used those from the state of

never used those from the state of
Michigan<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.549> just<00:02:14.760> had<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.150> never

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
Michigan they just had it and never

Michigan they just had it and never
never<00:02:15.989> ever<00:02:16.200> used<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.130> had<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.820> some<00:02:17.970> work

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
never ever used it I had to do some work

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.030 
never ever used it I had to do some work
to<00:02:18.299> get<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.750> revive<00:02:19.140> it<00:02:19.350> they<00:02:19.530> injector
