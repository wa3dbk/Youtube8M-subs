00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.640
 this is a very interesting team 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.160
 we already saw it out there in an event that 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.250
 they had in playa del carmen that we 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.419
 they invited and we were there and there 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 we said hey part with the hp envy x2 for 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.680
 make a very simple review very simple 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.680
 This equipment that input is by 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.450
 course of aluminum is a team 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.430
 endorser the line is the line 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.730
 business you will not find it 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.190
 in stores this is part of the 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.620
 offer of equipment that they sell for 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.200
 small and medium companies and for 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.150
 supposedly great and good let's see 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.060
 some of its features first 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.010
 let's leave it closed like this and 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.820
 we have here hearing aid ports 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:05.170
 usb port and one hdmi port and the other 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.659
 hand we have another USB and charger 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.190
 current that is a proprietary charger 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.280
 It is not 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.549
 is this connector 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.659
 this gets is here and it's the charger 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.510
 of current 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.710
 what's wrong with this being a computer 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.590
 multipurpose how is this good thing 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.710
 here we have the power button just 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.159
 a camera with a light are squares not 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 camera with autofocus and here are the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.180
 Volume buttons plus volume minus ok 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.680
 Now we are going to open it up and go up a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.140
 little so there's a bit of a position 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 more comfortable and here I light it on the button 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.679
 of payment obviously and ready we have 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.100
 here a machine with windows 8 but with 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:57.030
 a dual-core processor of two 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.580
 very interesting nuclei 1.8 gigas has 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.229
 of course windows 8 as I mentioned it 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.550
 and hey it's a 2 in 1 because go we 're going to 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.310
 see the part of one of the parties more 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:14.280
 interesting measures 8 points 12 inches 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.350
 tall almost 12 inches wide weighs 3 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.250
 pounds as a kilo and a half is heavy na 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.590
 the screen 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.430
 11.6 inches about 30 centimeters 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.100
 approximately in HD comes up to 4 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.800
 gigas in solid state disk has 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.190
 beats audio camera that takes video to 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.320
 1080p and take photos at 8 megapixels is 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.750
 interesting out there that matter but 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.030
 good what is really really 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.270
 makes the difference of this machine with 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.940
 others basically this that are windows 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.970
 8 if you can navigate you go here I do not know 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.250
 scare artist the browser we are 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.230
 here watching maddux and it works pretty 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.040
 well more or less 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.849
 our leo is pretty let's say soft no 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:05.360
 there is not much loss out there of these 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.370
 of frames or screenshots and is a 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.430
 team of course touch that has the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.340
 keyboard if we go well there in the 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.069
 most more curious part of this is 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.390
 when or first this button yes and what 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:24.829
 it happens that terminator is disarmed 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.989
 disarm or arm yourself and you have here a 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.000
 tablet that can take you anywhere 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.010
 part is we 're not going to test the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.680
 fall because it's going to break is not for 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.810
 throw nothing but a tablet let's say 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.540
 use a little rougher does not have anything of 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.790
 Plastic is anodized aluminum 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.700
 term of this aluminum where here 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.090
 you have in this vote I do not know for 15 people 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.050
 we have production 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.050
 Oh 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.090
 is for a no doubt microsd is for 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.420
 buÃ©no of the microsd memory everything is 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.090
 learn by touching, you have to learn and 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.210
 well this machine I insist is focused 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.210
 is designed for companies that 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.370
 they want to give their employees a team of 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.670
 next- generation computation with windows 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.190
 8 what is this and what is also a tablet 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.140
 but that the keyboard that you have it for 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.830
 there saved somewhere when 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.270
 use or whatever it works 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.700
 you just put it here here we can 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.930
 see is a windows 8 is a little bit 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:33.390
 girl the letter a single language is a 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.450
 processed as we said a 1.8 jack 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.460
 gigabytes of two cores has 2 gb in 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.120
 ram that 32 bit be operational 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.380
 is of course touch 100% 3.3 the index 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.199
 of windows experience that arrives 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:51.410
 up to 7 and good for those who are this 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.630
 computer we already said it and I repeat it is 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.009
 for companies that understand this to their 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.860
 executives 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:05:00.169
 has endured not these I can stand a more 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.470
 tablet out there plastics ah but hey 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:07.630
 this from hp envy x 2 and I'm seeing it 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:12.060
 of course here at matuk dotcom 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.060
 a point
