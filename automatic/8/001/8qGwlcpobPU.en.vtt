00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
suppose see if I can do it I might need

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.470 
suppose see if I can do it I might need
a<00:01:34.850> lightweight<00:01:35.850> more<00:01:36.270> lightweight<00:01:36.510> of<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.870> gun

a lightweight more lightweight of a gun

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.060 
a lightweight more lightweight of a gun
we<00:01:39.480> might<00:01:39.690> have<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.930> change<00:01:40.460> see<00:01:45.740> try<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.890> one

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
we might have to change see try that one

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.240 
we might have to change see try that one
more<00:01:47.100> time<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.760> can't<00:01:48.030> do<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> then<00:01:48.540> I'll<00:01:48.720> get

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
more time if I can't do it then I'll get

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.200
