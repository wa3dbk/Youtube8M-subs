 powerwolf is the name of a heavy metal band 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.590
 from the saarland and we have to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.719
 just imagine them even if it is 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 this volume had equal volume 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.220
 Summer a giant ball lands 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.170
 one of the german album charts for 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.449
 heavy metal is unusual 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.279
 The five musicians from the Saarland kick 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.650
 on and are at big festivals 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.269
 had asked internationally yesterday 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.220
 powerwolf a home game in the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:34.610
 saarbrücker garage susanne kirchhofer 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.420
 was sold out house for us there 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:42.240
 Home game is a bit too 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.120
 exception situation known faces 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.120
 [Applause] 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 more 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.840
 his 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.730
 woman wulff that's one 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.970
 Success story from the Saarland since 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.680
 ten years, i5 make power metal 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.950
 opulent music often with religious 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.550
 They relate with a wink 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.550
 want to know understood 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.849
 [Music] 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 the credo quintett bit flat 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.960
 using treacherous metals has not only 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.890
 in the music are also one 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.299
 live setting 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.509
 that's a bit of what we do then 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:30.799
 also bring eternity to everyone 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.570
 case times will be so big because they 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.770
 just as you grow up with religion 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.409
 and how to stop in the Catholic 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.020
 church has experienced this symbolism and 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.789
 we bring the whole thing in another 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.280
 context and one may say that 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.270
 Of course, that's cheap 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.310
 Great 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.390
 absolutely you have to play with them 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.560
 You can not go to the slave 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.840
 to do the cliché 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.840
 Berlin is supposed to play cliché 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.750
 Everyone has this principle , they live 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.429
 even at her fifth and so far 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.679
 most successful album creatures often 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.929
 faithfully this brought you this summer 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.530
 place 1 in the german album charts 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.479
 on 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.479
 and that as some volumes 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.509
 over day 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.509
 there 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.840
 then you can do it just by doing a lot 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.400
 persistently long and consistently good 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.460
 quality delivered I would say the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.900
 success did not come from somewhere but 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.660
 We have over the years 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.980
 There are now ten years but we 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.870
 always have our step by step 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.110
 audience expanded and very much live 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.490
 on tours also earned and now 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.720
 Ten years are just that 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.490
 point that I succeed such too 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.490

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.450
 [Music]

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.270
 made socially acceptable so everyone is now 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.270
 after the hans has stolen very much 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.510
 paul wulf this is a unique one 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.510
