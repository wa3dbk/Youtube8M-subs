00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
be put on either side of the the floor

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.090 
be put on either side of the the floor
so<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.340> problem<00:01:36.530> they<00:01:37.530> put<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> charge

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so it's not a problem they put a charge

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.149 
so it's not a problem they put a charge
in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> elements<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:40.140> break<00:01:40.350> down<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> copper
