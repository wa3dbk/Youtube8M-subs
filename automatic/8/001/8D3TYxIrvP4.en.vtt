00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.340
 Hello 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.580
 Let's leave you saved the wonderful ones. 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.029
 they are environments can be worth them 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.970
 receive the owners of the house and all 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.900
 people who go to 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.550
 We can use on Saturdays to refine the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.989
 vague or even leave them more rustic 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.880
 It depends a lot on the owner of the course. 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.829
 to make a toilet 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.649
 It's very interesting because 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.649
 usually the dimensions are small 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.399
 you can throw at the materials 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:53.539
 we can also throw in the design of 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:56.930
 stands on floors and mirrors 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.329
 make the wall coverings 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:05.780
 how is the dry environment we can use 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.390
 on the walls the tissue paper flaws 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.360
 we should only protect the bench area 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.670
 so as not to run the risk of one of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.970
 cell 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 we can also make innovations such as 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.310
 example take the material that was 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 used on the counter and climb on the wall 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.820
 the mirror will be placed in the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.970
 side walls looks very interesting 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.900
 it's very elegant 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.170
 the cabinets in the toilet 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.780
 I think it's a little tacky then 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.049
 I advise you if you really need 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 using a front wall or 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.920
 you create niches other comforts of 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.900
 mirror and then solve your problem 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.160

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:12.390
