00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.470
 and now to the beat of the music that does not stop the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.469
 music when they approach the pylon of the stage that means adding 

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.429

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.909
 Many have tried it, many have done it 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.360
