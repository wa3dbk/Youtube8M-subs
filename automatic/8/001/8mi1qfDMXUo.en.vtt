00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
up if you want to and then it just

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.030 
up if you want to and then it just
slowly<00:05:21.420> dispenses<00:05:22.170> into<00:05:22.440> this<00:05:22.530> whenever<00:05:22.890> it

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
slowly dispenses into this whenever it

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.560 
slowly dispenses into this whenever it
starts<00:05:23.310> getting<00:05:23.550> empty<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.120> I<00:05:24.210> just<00:05:24.360> really

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
starts getting empty and I just really

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.720 
starts getting empty and I just really
like<00:05:24.750> it<00:05:24.930> because<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.560> always<00:05:26.160> find<00:05:26.550> myself

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
like it because I always find myself

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.340 
like it because I always find myself
well<00:05:27.270> I<00:05:27.360> guess<00:05:27.570> you<00:05:27.750> wouldn't<00:05:28.020> want<00:05:28.170> to<00:05:28.200> keep

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
well I guess you wouldn't want to keep

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.500 
well I guess you wouldn't want to keep
it<00:05:28.500> there<00:05:28.710> too<00:05:29.430> long<00:05:29.640> because<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.120> water<00:05:30.330> can

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
it there too long because the water can

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.360 
it there too long because the water can
get<00:05:30.630> nasty<00:05:31.020> but<00:05:31.200> tobe<00:05:31.560> drink<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:31.980> much<00:05:32.130> water

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
get nasty but tobe drink so much water

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.250 
get nasty but tobe drink so much water
because<00:05:32.730> we<00:05:32.850> always<00:05:33.120> let<00:05:33.300> him<00:05:33.450> outside<00:05:33.630> and

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
because we always let him outside and

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.040 
because we always let him outside and
then<00:05:34.800> this<00:05:34.980> is<00:05:35.160> the<00:05:35.430> dog<00:05:35.730> food<00:05:36.060> that<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.540> got<00:05:36.870> for

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
then this is the dog food that I got for

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.010 
then this is the dog food that I got for
him<00:05:37.290> it's<00:05:37.680> so<00:05:37.920> nice<00:05:38.100> because<00:05:38.690> before<00:05:39.690> I<00:05:39.750> would

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
him it's so nice because before I would

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.700 
him it's so nice because before I would
just<00:05:40.140> do<00:05:40.290> the<00:05:40.470> bag<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:42.330> then<00:05:42.540> the<00:05:43.230> food<00:05:43.470> would

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
just do the bag and then the food would

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.010 
just do the bag and then the food would
be<00:05:43.860> just<00:05:44.130> you<00:05:44.370> know<00:05:44.490> in<00:05:44.640> the<00:05:44.700> regular<00:05:45.060> bag<00:05:45.270> you

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
be just you know in the regular bag you

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.500 
be just you know in the regular bag you
can<00:05:46.260> actually<00:05:46.500> keep<00:05:46.830> it<00:05:46.920> in<00:05:47.070> there<00:05:47.220> and<00:05:47.370> it's

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
can actually keep it in there and it's

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.000 
can actually keep it in there and it's
and<00:05:48.510> it's<00:05:48.630> just<00:05:48.810> so<00:05:48.990> much<00:05:49.140> easier<00:05:49.380> whenever

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
and it's just so much easier whenever

00:05:50.010 --> 00:06:02.660 
and it's just so much easier whenever
