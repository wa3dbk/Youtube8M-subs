 in your own city 4 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.339
 when 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:22.589
 fifteen minutes before time ticked as the highest 7 is Brussels in a year 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.200
 for other city 4 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.420
 according to him, the party picked up four people last summer 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.980
 after standing off the ring finger a year ago 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 the ring finger 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.469
 I also don't think the polders go to the first half 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.570
 sue is probably the rest of the year 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.830
 and second in the eu 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.750
 the six 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.190
 we have an index finger there and middle finger even became one to two 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.190
 times 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.310
 iron twice the expected fall 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.550
 the ring finger 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.430
 six staring into speed 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.170
 don't think the first aid 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.730
 second internship and the third factor 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.730
 play against six internship 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.190
 an index finger and middle finger 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.880
 our ways and the player as follows 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.810
 I knew this agreement 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.270
 with partner a new agreement with these two fingers and they will be shown here 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.180
 middle finger stare 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 in the second phase and you 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.610
 the index finger on the third set the fraction it looks a bit like an chord 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.890
 cordane 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.110
 lower 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.990
 then I play the following 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.140
 with five too heavy 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.140
 her forefinger and middle finger rules 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 because rather five stare 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.389
 this week in Arnhem 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.389
 participants on board left that index finger 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:16.419
 the competition finished third in his second phase and your middle finger 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:20.579
