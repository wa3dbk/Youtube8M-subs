00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
coached a lot of good quarterback yeah i

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.720 
coached a lot of good quarterback yeah i
mean<00:02:59.350> i<00:02:59.590> use<00:02:59.740> his<00:02:59.770> athletic<00:03:00.280> ago<00:03:00.460> he<00:03:00.610> had<00:03:00.700> a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
mean i use his athletic ago he had a

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.800 
mean i use his athletic ago he had a
great<00:03:00.940> arm<00:03:01.120> but<00:03:01.270> you<00:03:01.360> know<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> lot<00:03:01.660> of<00:03:01.690> the

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
great arm but you know a lot of the

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.620 
great arm but you know a lot of the
fundamentals<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.060> fine-tune<00:03:04.060> things<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.570> the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
fundamentals and fine-tune things of the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.270 
fundamentals and fine-tune things of the
passing<00:03:05.020> game<00:03:05.170> you<00:03:05.710> know<00:03:05.770> i'm<00:03:05.890> saying<00:03:06.100> that

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
passing game you know i'm saying that

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.920 
passing game you know i'm saying that
guess<00:03:06.430> this<00:03:06.610> isn't<00:03:06.760> what<00:03:06.880> they<00:03:07.060> did<00:03:07.240> but<00:03:07.780> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
guess this isn't what they did but the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.840 
guess this isn't what they did but the
heat<00:03:08.080> is<00:03:08.230> very<00:03:08.530> effective<00:03:08.770> so<00:03:09.100> that's<00:03:09.730> an

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
heat is very effective so that's an

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.600 
heat is very effective so that's an
important<00:03:10.270> process<00:03:11.190> chopped<00:03:12.190> up<00:03:12.340> some<00:03:12.400> time

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
important process chopped up some time

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.980 
important process chopped up some time
