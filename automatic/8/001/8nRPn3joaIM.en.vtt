00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.780
 This ice cream 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:18.500
 Such bag charm and 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:22.810
 I would like to give a basic explanation when processing it into a cell phone strap 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:29.140
 It is the basis of accessories processing 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:31.900
 Clay works can be processed using parts called 9 pins and round cans 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:38.130
 Here is 9 pins 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.130
 Called a courier because the needle is fart in the form of a 9 digits 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 This 9 pin is inserted in the clay work, but if it inserts in this state , the point will be 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:54.100
 It's straight so it's easy to miss 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.950
 So the 9-pin earlier in pliers 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.220
 Kutto child child 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.060
 Please bend it 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.710
 It looks like this 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.770
 this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.710
 I just bent the point 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.299
 In fresh clay work 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.299
 Please insert 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.310
 Yes 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:28.460
 It is the place where it was inserted 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:29.880
 When inserted in , there is a small gap between the year and the 9 pin 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.050
 this 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.909
 Year dedicated crafted rod Ya 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.490
 With toothpick 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.450
 Suppress and clear this gap 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.680
 I will put it up like this and have 9 pins 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.680
 It becomes difficult to receive 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:02:00.380
 And finally, round can 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.380
 Thread here to place a round of 9-pin 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:09.840
 It is a round can of about 8 mm in diameter, but with this finger you can use a finger without using pliers 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.270
 You can open the hall 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 Please open it back and forth when opening 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.810
 Hogaba below to undergo metal fatigue as not open to the left and right also wrong it this is before and after 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.940
 Since it is surely entered 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.940
 It's about moving it back and forth 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:33.480
 After opening the vulcan , just pass it through 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.480
 through 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.200
 After only tighten the cans will be passed through a Sutorappupatsu these chain parts 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.710
 I will 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.830
 If the chain parts are silver , align the color of the round cans baseball pin with the same silver 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:54.870
 Please give me 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:59.909
 Also, in the case of combined works that connect ice cream with two or three 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:05.610
 It is important to align the orientation of the 9-pin circle 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:08.050
 If you hit a circle so that you can see it in front of the work, all 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.170
 When you meditate on the front 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:17.770
 The next round can be connected beautifully 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:21.440
 If this is facing the front or facing the shield or in any direction , the round can not be beautifully connected 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:26.130
 The direction of the work does not become a table at all 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:29.510
 I 'm going to go against this thick 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:36.450
 Please take care of the fundamentals 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:40.730
 How is it delicious? A delicious vanilla ice cream has been completed 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.730
 Please try making it by all means
