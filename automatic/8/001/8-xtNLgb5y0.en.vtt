00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
a PC elitist like myself I have to say

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.340 
a PC elitist like myself I have to say
that<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> ps4<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.510> certainly<00:01:12.840> cranking<00:01:13.260> out

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
that the ps4 is certainly cranking out

some<00:01:13.409> nice<00:01:13.799> graphics<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.549> artistically<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
some nice graphics here artistically the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.990 
some nice graphics here artistically the
game<00:01:15.750> does<00:01:16.049> feel<00:01:16.350> very<00:01:16.710> much<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.009> Halo<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
game does feel very much like Halo the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
game does feel very much like Halo the
assault<00:01:18.420> rifles<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> character<00:01:19.530> modeling

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
assault rifles the character modeling

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280 
assault rifles the character modeling
even<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> world<00:01:20.909> modeling<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.810> not<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> bad

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
even the world modeling that's not a bad

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230 
even the world modeling that's not a bad
thing<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.070> halo<00:01:23.369> art<00:01:23.610> direction<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
thing I think the halo art direction is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.570 
thing I think the halo art direction is
some<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> best<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.380> gaming<00:01:25.860> history<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
now that the bungee art team is not

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
up behind you the bosses have different

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.900 
up behind you the bosses have different
stages<00:04:05.170> so<00:04:05.620> they'll<00:04:05.890> attack<00:04:06.400> differently

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
stages so they'll attack differently

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.789

super abilities at clutch moments is a

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.330 
super abilities at clutch moments is a
really<00:04:52.480> big<00:04:52.660> part<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:53.050> making<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.860> out<00:04:53.950> of<00:04:54.130> some

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
really big part of making it out of some

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.650 
really big part of making it out of some
of<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.520> fights<00:04:54.790> as<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.000> start<00:04:55.420> to<00:04:55.540> get

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
of the fights as you start to get

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.840 
of the fights as you start to get
overwhelmed<00:04:56.350> rather<00:04:56.620> quickly<00:04:57.010> also<00:04:57.790> you

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
overwhelmed rather quickly also you

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.850 
overwhelmed rather quickly also you
can't<00:04:58.240> just<00:04:58.480> camp<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.080> cover<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.500> whole<00:04:59.650> time

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
can't just camp and cover the whole time

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.680 
can't just camp and cover the whole time
because<00:05:00.100> ammo<00:05:00.640> is<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.790> big<00:05:01.000> part<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.360> this<00:05:01.450> game

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
because ammo is a big part of this game

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.690 
because ammo is a big part of this game
and<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.290> will<00:05:02.500> pick<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.860> up<00:05:02.950> from<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.280> enemies

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
and you will pick it up from the enemies

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.520 
and you will pick it up from the enemies
that<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:04.030> killed<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:04.690> if<00:05:05.080> you<00:05:05.170> start<00:05:05.350> running

that you killed so if you start running

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.020 
that you killed so if you start running
low<00:05:05.800> on<00:05:05.830> ammo<00:05:06.190> you're<00:05:06.370> gonna<00:05:06.490> have<00:05:06.670> to<00:05:06.790> venture

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
low on ammo you're gonna have to venture

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.300 
low on ammo you're gonna have to venture
out<00:05:07.360> into<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:08.050> fray<00:05:08.320> and<00:05:08.590> start<00:05:08.860> picking<00:05:09.070> up

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
out into the fray and start picking up

out into the fray and start picking up
some<00:05:09.490> gear<00:05:09.760> if<00:05:09.940> your<00:05:10.270> teammates<00:05:10.720> die<00:05:11.080> in

some gear if your teammates die in

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.440 
some gear if your teammates die in
really<00:05:11.800> exposed<00:05:12.250> areas<00:05:12.700> you<00:05:12.850> have<00:05:13.000> to<00:05:13.120> decide

really exposed areas you have to decide

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.060 
really exposed areas you have to decide
if<00:05:13.660> you<00:05:13.780> want<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.050> run<00:05:14.230> out<00:05:14.260> there<00:05:14.530> and<00:05:14.770> try<00:05:15.010> and

you<00:05:22.300> also<00:05:22.540> have<00:05:22.660> several<00:05:22.960> tactical<00:05:23.620> abilities

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
you also have several tactical abilities

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.310 
you also have several tactical abilities
which<00:05:24.280> vary<00:05:24.610> depending<00:05:25.060> on<00:05:25.180> your<00:05:25.330> class<00:05:25.630> I<00:05:25.900> had

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
which vary depending on your class I had

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.410 
which vary depending on your class I had
a<00:05:26.350> grenade<00:05:26.770> that<00:05:26.950> recharged<00:05:27.460> over<00:05:27.880> time<00:05:28.120> so

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
a grenade that recharged over time so

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.360 
a grenade that recharged over time so
essentially<00:05:28.960> infinite<00:05:29.110> grenades<00:05:29.680> but<00:05:29.920> it<00:05:30.160> was

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
essentially infinite grenades but it was

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.760 
essentially infinite grenades but it was
a<00:05:30.400> good<00:05:30.490> cool<00:05:31.030> down<00:05:31.330> between<00:05:31.780> each<00:05:32.230> grenade<00:05:32.590> I

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
a good cool down between each grenade I

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.710 
a good cool down between each grenade I
could<00:05:32.980> throw<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.430> I<00:05:33.670> also<00:05:33.820> had<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> super<00:05:34.480> punch

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
could throw and I also had a super punch

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.710 
could throw and I also had a super punch
that<00:05:34.930> would<00:05:35.080> do<00:05:35.230> massive<00:05:35.910> melee<00:05:36.910> damage<00:05:37.120> to

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
that would do massive melee damage to

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.330 
that would do massive melee damage to
anybody<00:05:37.930> that<00:05:38.170> I<00:05:38.350> punch<00:05:38.680> but<00:05:38.950> that<00:05:39.130> would<00:05:39.310> also

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
anybody that I punch but that would also

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.150 
anybody that I punch but that would also
have<00:05:39.850> to<00:05:40.060> recharge<00:05:40.480> so<00:05:40.810> using<00:05:41.530> those<00:05:41.680> at<00:05:41.950> key

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
have to recharge so using those at key

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.400 
have to recharge so using those at key
moments<00:05:42.370> can<00:05:42.730> also<00:05:42.850> keep<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.450> alive<00:05:43.750> good<00:05:44.170> aim

you're shooting it embosses also have

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.640 
you're shooting it embosses also have
lots<00:05:52.180> of<00:05:52.330> little<00:05:52.540> weak<00:05:52.780> points<00:05:53.140> that<00:05:53.290> you<00:05:53.440> can

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
lots of little weak points that you can

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.590 
lots of little weak points that you can
learn<00:05:53.860> usually<00:05:54.730> they're<00:05:54.880> hard<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.150> get<00:05:55.360> to<00:05:55.570> but

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
learn usually they're hard to get to but

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.720 
learn usually they're hard to get to but
if<00:05:56.020> you're<00:05:56.170> low<00:05:56.410> on<00:05:56.440> ammo<00:05:56.980> sometimes<00:05:57.490> you're

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.730 
if you're low on ammo sometimes you're

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.700 
if you're low on ammo sometimes you're
forced<00:05:58.150> to<00:05:58.540> actually<00:05:58.870> try<00:05:59.080> and<00:05:59.110> spare<00:05:59.530> your

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
shots and go for the head only figuring

out the stages on some of these giant

out the stages on some of these giant
spider<00:06:04.060> tanks<00:06:04.450> was<00:06:04.600> actually<00:06:04.930> a<00:06:04.990> really<00:06:05.169> fun

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
spider tanks was actually a really fun

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.650 
spider tanks was actually a really fun
experience<00:06:05.710> I<00:06:06.370> found<00:06:06.640> shooting<00:06:07.060> the<00:06:07.210> legs<00:06:07.450> out

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
experience I found shooting the legs out

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.510 
experience I found shooting the legs out
the<00:06:07.870> armored<00:06:08.230> legs<00:06:08.500> out<00:06:08.740> would<00:06:09.160> cause<00:06:09.340> the

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
the armored legs out would cause the

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.220 
the armored legs out would cause the
spider<00:06:09.820> tank<00:06:10.120> to<00:06:10.270> essentially<00:06:10.690> be<00:06:10.720> crippled

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
spider tank to essentially be crippled

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.050 
spider tank to essentially be crippled
for<00:06:11.290> a<00:06:11.470> little<00:06:11.620> period<00:06:11.890> of<00:06:12.070> time<00:06:12.280> then<00:06:12.760> it

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
for a little period of time then it

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.850 
for a little period of time then it
would<00:06:13.150> expose<00:06:13.570> its<00:06:13.840> neck<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.320> if<00:06:14.470> you<00:06:14.590> shoot

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
would expose its neck and if you shoot

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.500 
would expose its neck and if you shoot
it<00:06:15.010> in<00:06:15.130> the<00:06:15.160> neck<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:15.610> can<00:06:15.760> do<00:06:15.880> a<00:06:15.910> massive

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
it in the neck you can do a massive

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.540 
it in the neck you can do a massive
amount<00:06:16.870> of<00:06:16.960> damage<00:06:17.380> you<00:06:17.860> can<00:06:18.040> get<00:06:18.220> in<00:06:18.340> there

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
amount of damage you can get in there

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.370 
amount of damage you can get in there
and<00:06:18.580> actually<00:06:18.820> do<00:06:19.150> a<00:06:19.180> super<00:06:19.690> attack<00:06:19.990> on<00:06:20.200> the

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
and actually do a super attack on the

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.890 
and actually do a super attack on the
neck<00:06:20.560> you<00:06:20.590> can<00:06:20.770> do<00:06:21.040> even<00:06:21.550> more<00:06:21.790> damage<00:06:22.090> killing

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
neck you can do even more damage killing

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.960 
neck you can do even more damage killing
it<00:06:22.990> much<00:06:23.230> faster<00:06:23.530> it's<00:06:24.250> very<00:06:24.460> hard<00:06:24.730> to<00:06:24.790> do

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
it much faster it's very hard to do

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.820 
it much faster it's very hard to do
because<00:06:25.150> the<00:06:25.510> spider<00:06:25.750> tanks<00:06:26.110> have<00:06:26.260> lots<00:06:26.650> of

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
because the spider tanks have lots of

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.980 
because the spider tanks have lots of
different<00:06:27.460> weapons<00:06:27.850> one<00:06:28.330> of<00:06:28.450> which<00:06:28.600> I<00:06:28.780> found

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
different weapons one of which I found

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.740 
different weapons one of which I found
out<00:06:29.230> about<00:06:29.350> right<00:06:29.830> now<00:06:30.190> and<00:06:30.700> I<00:06:31.060> get<00:06:31.300> hit<00:06:31.510> right

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
out about right now and I get hit right

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.690 
out about right now and I get hit right
in<00:06:31.810> the<00:06:31.960> face<00:06:32.140> with<00:06:32.590> a<00:06:32.650> randomly<00:06:33.400> lobbed

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:33.700 
in the face with a randomly lobbed

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.670 
in the face with a randomly lobbed
grenade<00:06:34.240> one<00:06:34.720> of<00:06:34.810> my<00:06:34.930> biggest<00:06:35.169> gripes<00:06:35.560> with

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
grenade one of my biggest gripes with

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.200 
grenade one of my biggest gripes with
the<00:06:35.890> Alpha<00:06:36.190> is<00:06:36.310> that<00:06:36.490> it<00:06:36.610> only<00:06:36.730> lets<00:06:37.090> you

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
the Alpha is that it only lets you

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.210 
the Alpha is that it only lets you
progress<00:06:37.510> to<00:06:37.630> level<00:06:38.169> eight<00:06:38.380> it<00:06:38.710> was<00:06:38.919> a<00:06:38.950> really

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220 
progress to level eight it was a really

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.980 
progress to level eight it was a really
fun<00:06:39.520> experience<00:06:39.700> all<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.390> way<00:06:40.510> but<00:06:40.570> it

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.990 
fun experience all the way but it

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.230 
fun experience all the way but it
certainly<00:06:41.290> left<00:06:41.650> me<00:06:41.830> wanting<00:06:42.070> more<00:06:42.310> and<00:06:42.669> this

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
certainly left me wanting more and this

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.580 
certainly left me wanting more and this
is<00:06:43.360> definitely<00:06:43.510> one<00:06:43.900> of<00:06:43.930> those<00:06:44.050> games<00:06:44.320> that<00:06:44.470> I

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
is definitely one of those games that I

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.200 
is definitely one of those games that I
think<00:06:44.830> could<00:06:44.950> bring<00:06:45.190> me<00:06:45.340> back<00:06:45.580> to<00:06:45.610> console

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
think could bring me back to console

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.300 
think could bring me back to console
gaming<00:06:46.419> in<00:06:46.690> a<00:06:46.780> very<00:06:47.020> big<00:06:47.290> way<00:06:47.470> the<00:06:48.190> art
