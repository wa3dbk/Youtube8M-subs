00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
been having shedding issues and try to

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.250 
been having shedding issues and try to
figure<00:04:15.400> out<00:04:15.519> what<00:04:15.670> is<00:04:15.820> going<00:04:15.880> on<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.229> I

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
figure out what is going on and so I

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.780 
figure out what is going on and so I
finally<00:04:17.769> realize<00:04:18.100> i<00:04:18.190> think<00:04:18.370> a<00:04:18.430> lot<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.609> my

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790

finally realize i think a lot of my
shedding<00:04:19.330> is<00:04:19.479> due<00:04:19.840> to<00:04:20.200> anemia

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
maybe so we'll see how that goes um I

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.060 
maybe so we'll see how that goes um I
had<00:04:59.639> to<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.360> had<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.870> trim<00:05:01.289> my<00:05:01.320> hair<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:02.039> I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
had to I had to trim my hair so I

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.890 
had to I had to trim my hair so I
probably<00:05:02.310> trimmed<00:05:02.789> about<00:05:03.120> one-eighth<00:05:03.630> inch

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
probably trimmed about one-eighth inch

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.120 
probably trimmed about one-eighth inch
to<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.680> 14<00:05:05.460> inch<00:05:06.139> when<00:05:07.139> I<00:05:07.169> washed<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:07.680> last<00:05:07.740> time

to a 14 inch when I washed it last time

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.860 
to a 14 inch when I washed it last time
