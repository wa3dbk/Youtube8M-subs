00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.850 

I<00:00:00.060> guess<00:00:00.510> about<00:00:00.840> two<00:00:01.110> thousand<00:00:01.589> years<00:00:01.770> ago

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I guess about two thousand years ago

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.269 
I guess about two thousand years ago
Jesus<00:00:02.310> said<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.210> will<00:00:03.389> return<00:00:03.780> soon<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:05.100> people

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
Jesus said I will return soon the people

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.460 
Jesus said I will return soon the people
that<00:00:05.549> follow<00:00:05.850> him<00:00:06.029> his<00:00:06.390> disciples<00:00:07.049> thought

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
that follow him his disciples thought

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.650 
that follow him his disciples thought
that<00:00:07.710> meant<00:00:07.919> within<00:00:08.220> their<00:00:08.429> lifetime<00:00:09.059> they

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
that meant within their lifetime they

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180 
that meant within their lifetime they
were<00:00:09.719> convinced<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.590> was<00:00:10.740> only<00:00:11.010> gonna<00:00:11.099> be

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
were convinced that it was only gonna be

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.980 
were convinced that it was only gonna be
a<00:00:11.309> couple<00:00:11.370> years<00:00:11.700> maybe<00:00:12.179> even<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.809> couple

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
a couple years maybe even a couple

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.350 
a couple years maybe even a couple
months<00:00:13.230> before<00:00:13.469> Jesus<00:00:14.040> came<00:00:14.280> back<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.730> judged

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
months before Jesus came back and judged

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.120 
months before Jesus came back and judged
the<00:00:15.690> inhabitants<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.500> earth<00:00:16.529> once<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
the inhabitants of the earth once and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.560 
the inhabitants of the earth once and
for<00:00:17.310> all<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.699> he<00:00:17.850> said<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> wicked<00:00:18.359> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
for all and he said the wicked to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.269 
for all and he said the wicked to
Hamelin<00:00:19.080> he<00:00:19.140> brought<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.740> righteous<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
Hamelin he brought the righteous to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.250 
Hamelin he brought the righteous to
heaven<00:00:20.580> they<00:00:21.539> thought<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.960> was<00:00:22.080> gonna

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
heaven they thought that was gonna

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.840 
heaven they thought that was gonna
happen<00:00:22.410> within<00:00:22.740> their<00:00:23.010> lifetime<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.730> then

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
happen within their lifetime and then

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.480 
happen within their lifetime and then
they<00:00:24.779> died<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.470> that<00:00:25.529> heaven<00:00:25.830> had<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
they died and that heaven had to be and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.710 
they died and that heaven had to be and
then<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.640> next<00:00:26.910> generation<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> believers

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
then the next generation of believers

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.620 
then the next generation of believers
were<00:00:28.410> convinced<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.490> Jesus<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
were convinced that Jesus was going to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.959 
were convinced that Jesus was going to
come<00:00:30.779> back<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.109> their<00:00:31.260> lifetime<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.160> then

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
come back in their lifetime and then

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.799 
come back in their lifetime and then
they<00:00:33.180> died<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.500> still<00:00:34.860> hadn't<00:00:35.250> happened

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
they died and they still hadn't happened

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.150 
they died and they still hadn't happened
and<00:00:36.809> listen<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.230> think<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.590> there<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:37.920> are

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and listen I think that there are are

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.770 
and listen I think that there are are
two<00:00:38.399> conclusions<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.420> draw<00:00:39.570> from

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
two conclusions that we can draw from

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.470 
two conclusions that we can draw from
that<00:00:40.309> but<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.640> is<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.059> Jesus<00:00:42.390> is

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
that but the first is that Jesus is

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.560 
that but the first is that Jesus is
never<00:00:42.719> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> come<00:00:43.110> back<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:44.550> been<00:00:44.730> 2,000

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
never going to come back it's been 2,000

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.910 
never going to come back it's been 2,000
years<00:00:45.840> since<00:00:45.930> he<00:00:46.200> said<00:00:46.379> he<00:00:46.440> was<00:00:46.559> going<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.739> come

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
years since he said he was going to come

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.790 
years since he said he was going to come
back<00:00:47.070> soon<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.289> maybe<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.649> could

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
back soon so you know maybe we could

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
back soon so you know maybe we could
tell<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> conclusion<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.670> he's<00:00:50.850> never

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
tell the conclusion that he's never

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.139 
tell the conclusion that he's never
going<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.360> come<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:52.039> or<00:00:53.039> maybe<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
going to come back or maybe and this is

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.430 
going to come back or maybe and this is
what<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.360> would<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.780> propose<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.379> you

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
what I would like to propose to you

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.910 
what I would like to propose to you
maybe<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.309> maybe<00:00:57.109> Judgment<00:00:58.109> Day<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> closer

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
maybe just maybe Judgment Day is closer

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.560 
maybe just maybe Judgment Day is closer
today<00:00:59.309> than<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.180> has<00:01:00.210> ever<00:01:00.539> been<00:01:00.750> before<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> I
