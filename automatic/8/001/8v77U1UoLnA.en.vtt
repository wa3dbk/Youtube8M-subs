two organelles with different colors the
important<00:02:35.810> thing<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.290> remember<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.070> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
important thing to remember is that the

important thing to remember is that the

primary antibodies must be made in

could use immunofluorescence the same

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.250 
could use immunofluorescence the same
