 the cabin crew are people 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:36.699
 that are trained very drastically in 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.309
 various issues to ensure safety 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.079

 help from a heart attack or a 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.909

 ready to take them out 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.100
 induction 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.620
 in the landing several can happen 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.940
 emergencies as the plane can get out 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.860
 from the runway the plane can have 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.010
 problems with the landing gear a 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.180
 game in an engine can be aroused 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.369
 different emergencies in different 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 stages of which a flight as 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.880
 We are human, we are going on the plane 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.640
 can cause several problems like 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.750
 first aid especially heart attacks 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.800
 spills asthma attack problems 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.450
 together with the iron training team 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.280
 we developed a fire drill in 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.170
 the plane the crew must move 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.149
 kneeling as the smoke is concentrated 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.830
 at the top and they should make sure 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.430
 that passengers breathe through 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.430
 the masks 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.200
 I 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.450
 during this time 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.450
 the day of the friend 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.330
 but no longer 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.010
 between the trainings that they receive 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.530
 resides in aerodynamics and navigation 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.820
 aerial meteorology procedures 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.800
 emergency and use emergency equipment 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.390
 He knows the area a bird that is 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.260
 emergency cabin configuration 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.210
 sudden and planned first aid 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.920
 hazardous materials a crewmember of 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.720
 cabin first that everything has to be 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.770
 a responsible and disciplined person 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.360
 it's an emergency and emergencies do not 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.590
 almost never happen therefore the 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.910
 cabin crew has to be 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.950
 reviewing their procedures 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.660
 emergency will be up to date because when 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.120
 the emergency happens we have to have 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.500
 the knowledge in the head for 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.270
 to make and develop the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.940
 procedure as best as possible and avoid 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.830
 deaths or that takes bigger the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.720
 emergency at 20,000 feet in height 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.700
 flying over the ocean and now the 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.200
 nearest hospital they are the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.090
 responsible for caring for the lives of 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.590
 the passengers a work that in hundreds 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.590
 of cases has been effective
