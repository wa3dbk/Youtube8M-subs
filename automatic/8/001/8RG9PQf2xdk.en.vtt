00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
I'm going to show you how to do a braid

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.710 
I'm going to show you how to do a braid
today<00:00:02.040> we're<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.000> be<00:00:03.090> using<00:00:03.120> it<00:00:03.510> disc

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
today we're going to be using it disc

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.650 
today we're going to be using it disc
and<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.710> so<00:00:05.100> easy<00:00:05.490> we<00:00:05.790> do<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.970> class<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.509> it

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
and this is so easy we do a class on it

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.210 
and this is so easy we do a class on it
I<00:00:06.750> kind<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.140> feel<00:00:07.290> like<00:00:07.350> I'm<00:00:07.620> cheating<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:08.160> out

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
because it takes about 10 seconds so

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.440 
because it takes about 10 seconds so
I've<00:00:13.559> done<00:00:13.769> two<00:00:13.980> colors<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.210> as

we<00:00:15.660> work<00:00:15.960> there's<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.710> top<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.220> bottom<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
we work there's a top and a bottom and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.130 
we work there's a top and a bottom and
they're<00:00:17.730> both<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> same<00:00:18.029> color<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.720> then<00:00:18.840> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
they're both the same color and then the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.439 
they're both the same color and then the
sides<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.680> same<00:00:19.830> color<00:00:20.100> as<00:00:20.279> well<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:21.270> have

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
sides of the same color as well we have

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.359 
sides of the same color as well we have
them<00:00:21.750> there's<00:00:22.140> these<00:00:22.289> polka<00:00:22.680> dots<00:00:22.859> here<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
them there's these polka dots here and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.490 
them there's these polka dots here and
see<00:00:23.490> them<00:00:23.670> that's<00:00:24.630> where<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.869> put<00:00:25.050> your<00:00:25.080> cord

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
see them that's where you put your cord

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.750 
see them that's where you put your cord
you're<00:00:25.680> going<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.890> put<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.070> on<00:00:26.130> either<00:00:26.340> side<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
you're going to put it on either side of

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.589 
you're going to put it on either side of
the<00:00:26.939> dot<00:00:27.680> all<00:00:28.680> four<00:00:29.070> spots<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.210> takes<00:00:30.359> eight

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the dot all four spots so it takes eight

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.359 
the dot all four spots so it takes eight
cord<00:00:30.929> you're<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.740> make<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.920> bracelet

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
cord you're going to make a bracelet

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
cord you're going to make a bracelet
with<00:00:32.579> beads<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.600> takes<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.899> five<00:00:34.170> yards<00:00:34.410> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
with beads it takes about five yards and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.319 
with beads it takes about five yards and
you'll<00:00:34.829> divide<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.399> by<00:00:35.579> eight<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> use<00:00:36.300> that

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you'll divide that by eight and use that

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.139 
you'll divide that by eight and use that
many<00:00:36.719> pieces<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.500> thread<00:00:37.860> if<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:38.940> going

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
many pieces a thread if you're not going

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.430 
many pieces a thread if you're not going
to<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.390> beats<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.870> you're<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.050> going<00:00:40.260> to<00:00:40.320> do

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
to do beats and you're just going to do

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040 
to do beats and you're just going to do
like<00:00:40.649> rats<00:00:40.920> hell<00:00:41.450> it<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.629> depend<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
like rats hell it will depend on the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.619 
like rats hell it will depend on the
thickness<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> rat<00:00:43.920> tail<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.340> how<00:00:45.180> much

thickness of the rat tail on how much

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
thickness of the rat tail on how much
length<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.590> need<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.550> thicker<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.030> rat<00:00:48.210> tail

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
length we need the thicker the rat tail

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.119 
length we need the thicker the rat tail
the<00:00:48.629> more<00:00:48.840> links<00:00:49.110> you'll<00:00:49.260> need<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.860> thinner

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the more links you'll need the thinner

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.389 
the more links you'll need the thinner
the<00:00:50.219> less<00:00:50.809> i<00:00:51.829> don't<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:52.980> know<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.370> answer

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
the less i don't really know the answer

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.319 
the less i don't really know the answer

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
take a break and you stop with it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.470 
take a break and you stop with it
looking<00:01:37.010> like<00:01:37.070> this<00:01:37.370> you'll<00:01:37.910> not<00:01:38.090> know<00:01:38.300> where

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
looking like this you'll not know where

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.870 
looking like this you'll not know where
to<00:01:38.570> start<00:01:38.840> again<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:39.890> if<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.340> ever<00:01:40.520> need<00:01:40.790> to

to start again so if you ever need to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.719 
to start again so if you ever need to
take<00:01:41.090> a<00:01:41.120> break<00:01:41.330> what<00:01:41.690> you<00:01:41.810> do<00:01:43.630> is<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:46.310> stop

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
take a break what you do is you stop

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.360 
take a break what you do is you stop
when<00:01:46.970> there's<00:01:47.060> three<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.810> one<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.160> when<00:01:49.280> you

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
when there's three and one so when you

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.400 
when there's three and one so when you
come<00:01:49.580> back<00:01:49.760> you<00:01:50.150> know<00:01:50.330> exactly<00:01:50.930> where<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.229> pick

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
come back you know exactly where to pick

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.410 
come back you know exactly where to pick
up<00:01:51.590> you<00:01:51.800> would<00:01:51.950> pick<00:01:52.160> up<00:01:52.370> with<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.030> me<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.300> the

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
up you would pick up with this me in the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.870 
up you would pick up with this me in the
bottom<00:01:53.570> and<00:01:53.870> you<00:01:54.500> would<00:01:54.680> come<00:01:54.920> up<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.250> then

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
bottom and you would come up and then

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.430 
bottom and you would come up and then
turn<00:01:56.180> if<00:01:56.590> you're<00:01:57.590> going<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.740> add<00:01:57.950> beads

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
turn if you're going to add beads

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.870 
turn if you're going to add beads
there's<00:02:00.440> just<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:00.890> just<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.190> knock<00:02:01.369> down<00:02:01.400> here

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
there's just it's just a knock down here

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.150 
there's just it's just a knock down here
it's<00:02:02.000> nothing<00:02:02.330> special<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:03.200> tie<00:02:03.440> a<00:02:03.470> knot<00:02:03.830> and

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
it's nothing special you tie a knot and

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.080 
it's nothing special you tie a knot and
your<00:02:04.729> beads<00:02:04.970> hang<00:02:05.240> here<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.710> as<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.460> go<00:02:07.700> you

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
your beads hang here so as you go you

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.610 
your beads hang here so as you go you
need<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.040> pull<00:02:10.040> on<00:02:10.220> your<00:02:10.340> not<00:02:10.520> so<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.300> it<00:02:11.450> will

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
need to pull on your not so that it will

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.110 
need to pull on your not so that it will
gravity<00:02:12.620> will<00:02:13.130> force<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.580> beads<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.940> come

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
gravity will force the beads to come

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.290 
gravity will force the beads to come
down<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:15.170> when<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.470> come<00:02:15.740> up<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.670> drop<00:02:16.910> a<00:02:16.940> bead

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
down so when you come up you drop a bead

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.930 
down so when you come up you drop a bead
and<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:18.020> go<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.380> way<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.800> then<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.580> come

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
and you go this way and then you come

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.150 
and you go this way and then you come
and<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.690> drop<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> need<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.650> go<00:02:21.770> this<00:02:21.920> way

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
and you drop a need and you go this way

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.490 
and you drop a need and you go this way
and<00:02:22.400> every<00:02:23.090> time<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.480> do<00:02:23.720> it<00:02:23.750> they'll<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.410> a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
and every time you do it they'll be a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.650 
and every time you do it they'll be a
bead<00:02:24.739> in<00:02:24.920> alcohol<00:02:25.370> just<00:02:25.730> right<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.360> area

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
bead in alcohol just right in that area

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.570 
bead in alcohol just right in that area
and<00:02:27.170> then<00:02:27.739> when<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.950> bring<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.310> next<00:02:28.459> one

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
and then when you bring the next one

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.020 
and then when you bring the next one
over<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:29.030> locks<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.540> beat<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:29.900> place<00:02:30.170> if<00:02:31.130> you

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
over it locks the beat in place if you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.690 
over it locks the beat in place if you
don't<00:02:32.239> pull<00:02:32.600> on<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.840> right<00:02:33.080> here<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.489> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
don't pull on it right here to have the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.300 
don't pull on it right here to have the
beat<00:02:34.880> drop<00:02:35.450> but<00:02:36.440> what<00:02:36.560> happen<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.190> will

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
beat drop but what happen is it will

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.610 
beat drop but what happen is it will
it'll<00:02:37.670> be<00:02:37.850> up<00:02:37.940> here<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.269> this<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.750> when<00:02:39.470> you

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
it'll be up here like this and when you

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.130 
it'll be up here like this and when you
go<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.860> cross<00:02:40.190> over<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:41.120> beads<00:02:41.390> won't<00:02:41.690> lock<00:02:41.900> in

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
go to cross over the beads won't lock in

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.440 
go to cross over the beads won't lock in
place<00:02:42.380> so<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.280> only<00:02:43.459> thing<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:43.940> have<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.150> do

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
place so the only thing you have to do

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.500 
place so the only thing you have to do
different<00:02:45.410> when<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.680> add<00:02:45.830> these<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.280> pull<00:02:47.269> on

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
different when you add these is pull on

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.870 
different when you add these is pull on
this<00:02:47.720> until<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.440> gets<00:02:48.590> started<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.220> then<00:02:49.730> the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
this until it gets started and then the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.150 
this until it gets started and then the
weight<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.299> will<00:02:50.510> hold<00:02:50.720> itself<00:02:51.160> some

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
weight of it will hold itself some

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.759 
weight of it will hold itself some
people<00:02:52.640> will<00:02:53.110> obviously<00:02:54.110> not<00:02:54.500> they<00:02:54.620> don't

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
people will obviously not they don't

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.560 
people will obviously not they don't
like<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.980> table<00:02:55.310> very<00:02:55.459> much<00:02:55.610> they<00:02:56.000> put<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> screw

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
like a table very much they put a screw

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.830 
like a table very much they put a screw
on<00:02:56.600> their<00:02:56.870> table<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.650> they<00:02:58.340> hold<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.480> cord

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
on their table and they hold the cord

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.050 
on their table and they hold the cord
like<00:03:00.049> this<00:03:00.350> with<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.799> screw<00:03:01.190> holding<00:03:02.000> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
like this with the screw holding the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.690 
like this with the screw holding the
leather<00:03:02.269> cord<00:03:02.660> or<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.500> thread<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.670> that

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
leather cord or the the thread so that

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.810 
leather cord or the the thread so that
the<00:03:05.239> tension<00:03:05.630> itself<00:03:06.049> will<00:03:06.230> pull<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.820> we

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
the tension itself will pull on it we

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.039 
the tension itself will pull on it we
like<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.209> table<00:03:08.510> we're<00:03:08.630> not<00:03:08.720> going<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.959> do

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
like this table we're not going to do

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.009 
like this table we're not going to do
that<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.350> this<00:03:09.470> table<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.390> anyways<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.840> is

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
that to this table so anyways that is

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.140 
that to this table so anyways that is
all<00:03:12.230> you<00:03:12.440> do<00:03:12.620> and<00:03:12.830> when<00:03:13.370> you're<00:03:13.519> completely

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
all you do and when you're completely

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:22.149 
all you do and when you're completely
done<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:15.260> take<00:03:15.500> all<00:03:15.709> your<00:03:15.739> threads

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.479 

out<00:03:23.159> like<00:03:23.489> this<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:25.010> then<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.250> tie

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
out like this and then you just tie

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:35.720 
out like this and then you just tie
another<00:03:26.790> knot<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:31.799> end<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.299> it's<00:03:33.299> that<00:03:33.510> simple
