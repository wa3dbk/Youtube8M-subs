this video will demonstrate a couple new

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.849 
this video will demonstrate a couple new
tools<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:05.160> we<00:00:06.060> will<00:00:06.270> be<00:00:06.330> able<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.140> use<00:00:07.589> on

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
tools that we will be able to use on

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.370 
tools that we will be able to use on
future<00:00:08.069> drawings<00:00:08.910> I'm<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.840> use<00:00:10.110> our

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
future drawings I'm going to use our

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.289 
future drawings I'm going to use our

example I'm going to be starting this
drawing<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.260> exact<00:00:19.710> same<00:00:20.010> way<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.850> did<00:00:21.000> in

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
drawing the exact same way that I did in

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.040 
drawing the exact same way that I did in
the<00:00:21.630> previous<00:00:21.900> video<00:00:22.400> by<00:00:23.400> locating<00:00:24.029> my<00:00:24.390> two

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the previous video by locating my two

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.230 
the previous video by locating my two
center<00:00:25.619> points<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.029> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> find<00:00:28.349> a

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
center points so I'm going to find a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.970 
center points so I'm going to find a
center<00:00:30.240> points<00:00:30.830> offset<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.390> 4<00:00:33.390> inches

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
center points offset that 4 inches

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
center points offset that 4 inches
creates<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.340> circle<00:00:36.059> around<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.510> first

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
creates a circle around that first

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.319 
creates a circle around that first
Center<00:00:37.260> Point<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.430> lower<00:00:38.700> tangency

Center Point and the lower tangency

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.990 
Center Point and the lower tangency
points<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.110> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> bring<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.010> across<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
points I'm going to bring that across to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.319 
points I'm going to bring that across to
give<00:00:42.149> me<00:00:42.329> my<00:00:42.510> other<00:00:42.750> center<00:00:43.530> points<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:45.180> let's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
give me my other center points so let's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.770 
give me my other center points so let's
go<00:00:45.480> ahead<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.690> get<00:00:45.840> started<00:00:46.050> here<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.780> start

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
go ahead and get started here and start

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
1.5 I'm going to bring my lower tangency

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.260 
1.5 I'm going to bring my lower tangency
point<00:01:11.760> across<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:13.189> that's<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.090> my

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
point across and that's going to be my

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.010 
point across and that's going to be my
horizontal<00:01:16.070> piece<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:17.670> Center<00:01:18.090> mark<00:01:18.299> I'm

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
horizontal piece for my Center mark I'm

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.190 
horizontal piece for my Center mark I'm
going<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> offset<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:20.040> vertical<00:01:20.790> 1<00:01:21.000> 4<00:01:21.689> inches

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
going to offset my vertical 1 4 inches

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:32.569 
going to offset my vertical 1 4 inches
and<00:01:28.490> extend<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> little<00:01:30.180> bit<00:01:31.579> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
and extend that down a little bit and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.649 
and extend that down a little bit and
create<00:01:33.060> another<00:01:33.450> circle<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.409> radius<00:01:34.439> of

1.5

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:53.480 

and<00:01:45.150> let's<00:01:46.580> do<00:01:47.580> this<00:01:47.790> top<00:01:50.060> point<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:52.430> okay<00:01:53.430> so

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and let's do this top point here okay so

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.230 
and let's do this top point here okay so
at<00:01:53.730> this<00:01:53.790> point<00:01:54.330> I'm<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.650> to<00:01:55.970> trim<00:01:56.970> away

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
at this point I'm going to trim away

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.640 
at this point I'm going to trim away
some<00:01:57.870> of<00:01:58.710> these<00:01:58.830> pieces<00:01:59.550> of<00:01:59.940> line<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.960> are

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
some of these pieces of line that are

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:10.330 
some of these pieces of line that are
not<00:02:02.430> entirely<00:02:03.320> necessary<00:02:05.330> okay

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.370 

I'm<00:02:11.340> even<00:02:11.850> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.210> go<00:02:12.660> as<00:02:12.930> far<00:02:13.380> as<00:02:13.880> trimming

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
I'm even going to go as far as trimming

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.610 
I'm even going to go as far as trimming
these<00:02:16.380> little<00:02:16.800> pieces<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.220> circle<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
these little pieces of circle so the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.320 
these little pieces of circle so the
only<00:02:19.770> thing<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:20.190> missing<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:21.180> these<00:02:22.020> little

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
only thing I'm missing is these little

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.699 
only thing I'm missing is these little
curved<00:02:24.330> pieces<00:02:25.310> that's<00:02:26.310> connecting<00:02:27.709> my

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
curved pieces that's connecting my

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.250 
curved pieces that's connecting my
circle<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.670> my<00:02:29.850> line<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:30.330> little<00:02:30.660> tangent

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
circle to my line this little tangent

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.400 
circle to my line this little tangent
arc<00:02:31.850> I'm<00:02:32.850> going<00:02:33.240> to<00:02:33.390> be<00:02:33.540> creating<00:02:34.230> that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
arc I'm going to be creating that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.550 
arc I'm going to be creating that
tangent<00:02:35.190> arc<00:02:35.480> using<00:02:36.480> two<00:02:37.050> different<00:02:37.290> methods

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
tangent arc using two different methods

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.900 
tangent arc using two different methods
that<00:02:38.480> will<00:02:39.480> on<00:02:39.810> future<00:02:40.320> drawings<00:02:40.920> speed

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
that will on future drawings speed

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.030 
that will on future drawings speed
things<00:02:42.209> up<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.600> little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:43.020> now<00:02:43.560> previously

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
things up a little bit now previously

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.390 
things up a little bit now previously
what<00:02:44.550> we<00:02:44.700> were<00:02:44.940> doing<00:02:45.650> if<00:02:46.650> we<00:02:46.920> look<00:02:47.100> at<00:02:47.250> our

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
what we were doing if we look at our

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.380 
what we were doing if we look at our
radius<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.260> 0.63<00:02:49.880> we<00:02:50.880> were<00:02:51.030> offsetting<00:02:51.840> this

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
radius of 0.63 we were offsetting this

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.520 
radius of 0.63 we were offsetting this
0.63<00:02:55.130> 0.63<00:02:56.130> then<00:02:57.000> drawing<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.660> circle<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.350> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
0.63 0.63 then drawing a circle with a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.940 
0.63 0.63 then drawing a circle with a
radius<00:02:58.560> of<00:03:00.890> 0.63<00:03:01.910> deleting<00:03:02.910> these<00:03:03.120> out

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
radius of 0.63 deleting these out

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.100 
radius of 0.63 deleting these out
trimming<00:03:04.950> this<00:03:05.160> off<00:03:05.519> trimming<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.390> off<00:03:06.690> and

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
trimming this off trimming this off and

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.080 
trimming this off trimming this off and
that<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.600> process<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.870> worked<00:03:10.380> fine

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
that was a process that worked fine

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.900 
that was a process that worked fine
however<00:03:12.090> there's<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> lot<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.900> steps<00:03:13.700> we<00:03:14.700> want

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
however there's a lot of steps we want

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.050 
however there's a lot of steps we want
to<00:03:15.120> eliminate<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.500> number<00:03:16.800> of<00:03:17.070> steps<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.850> help

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
to eliminate the number of steps to help

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.960 
to eliminate the number of steps to help
speed<00:03:18.420> stuff<00:03:18.810> up<00:03:19.110> so<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:20.010> first<00:03:20.280> method<00:03:20.610> I'm

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
speed stuff up so the first method I'm

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.210 
speed stuff up so the first method I'm
going<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.600> teach<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.410> Filat<00:03:23.250> method

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
going to teach you is the Filat method

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.090 
going to teach you is the Filat method
now<00:03:26.220> if<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.940> come<00:03:27.690> up<00:03:27.720> here<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.590> modify

now we could just click on radius and

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.220 
now we could just click on radius and
that<00:04:04.930> will<00:04:05.110> select<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.860> or<00:04:06.960> I'm<00:04:07.960> going<00:04:08.170> to

well<00:06:54.370> we<00:06:54.490> know<00:06:54.640> the<00:06:54.790> radius<00:06:54.970> is<00:06:55.950> 0.63<00:06:57.270> so<00:06:58.270> we'll

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
well we know the radius is 0.63 so we'll

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.050 
well we know the radius is 0.63 so we'll
type<00:06:58.600> that<00:06:58.870> in<00:06:59.050> and<00:06:59.260> press<00:06:59.410> Enter<00:07:00.010> and<00:07:00.280> it

type that in and press Enter and it

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.650 
type that in and press Enter and it
automatically<00:07:01.720> creates<00:07:02.080> a<00:07:02.730> circle<00:07:03.730> that<00:07:04.360> is

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
automatically creates a circle that is

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.100 
automatically creates a circle that is
tangent<00:07:05.380> to<00:07:05.710> that<00:07:06.270> and<00:07:07.270> now<00:07:07.420> we<00:07:07.480> can<00:07:07.690> come<00:07:07.900> back

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.110 
tangent to that and now we can come back

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:12.870 
tangent to that and now we can come back
and<00:07:08.500> trim<00:07:08.920> off<00:07:09.130> these<00:07:09.430> extra<00:07:10.180> pieces<00:07:11.669> so<00:07:12.669> with

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
and trim off these extra pieces so with

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.980 
and trim off these extra pieces so with
this<00:07:13.090> these<00:07:14.050> different<00:07:14.530> methods<00:07:14.680> we<00:07:15.130> have

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
this these different methods we have

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.000 
this these different methods we have
really<00:07:16.990> three<00:07:17.440> different<00:07:17.470> ways<00:07:18.100> to<00:07:19.060> do<00:07:19.419> this

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.010 
really three different ways to do this

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.760 
really three different ways to do this
exact<00:07:21.010> same<00:07:21.250> part<00:07:21.640> and<00:07:21.910> you<00:07:22.480> end<00:07:22.780> up<00:07:23.320> with<00:07:23.590> the

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
exact same part and you end up with the

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.690 
exact same part and you end up with the
exact<00:07:24.250> same<00:07:24.550> result<00:07:26.250> they're<00:07:27.250> just<00:07:27.460> three

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:27.700 
exact same result they're just three

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.640 
exact same result they're just three
different<00:07:28.030> ways<00:07:28.180> and<00:07:28.510> again<00:07:28.810> in<00:07:29.050> autocad

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.650 
different ways and again in autocad

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.920 
different ways and again in autocad
there's<00:07:30.160> about<00:07:30.520> ten<00:07:30.940> different<00:07:31.360> ways<00:07:31.390> to<00:07:31.810> do

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930 
there's about ten different ways to do

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.010 
there's about ten different ways to do
everything<00:07:32.410> and<00:07:33.340> you<00:07:34.030> just<00:07:34.419> kind<00:07:34.720> of<00:07:34.780> pick

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.020 
everything and you just kind of pick

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.020 
everything and you just kind of pick
which<00:07:35.290> works<00:07:35.740> the<00:07:35.919> best<00:07:36.220> which<00:07:36.460> one<00:07:36.640> you<00:07:36.820> can

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
which works the best which one you can

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.020 
which works the best which one you can
remember<00:07:37.650> and<00:07:38.650> whichever<00:07:39.190> one<00:07:39.400> you<00:07:39.550> feel<00:07:39.760> more

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:40.030 
remember and whichever one you feel more

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.920 
remember and whichever one you feel more
comfortable<00:07:40.780> doing<00:07:40.960> so<00:07:41.440> this<00:07:42.130> is<00:07:42.520> a<00:07:43.060> couple

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
comfortable doing so this is a couple

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.200 
comfortable doing so this is a couple
different<00:07:44.350> new<00:07:44.740> tools<00:07:45.070> for<00:07:45.490> you<00:07:45.550> to<00:07:45.669> use<00:07:45.910> on
