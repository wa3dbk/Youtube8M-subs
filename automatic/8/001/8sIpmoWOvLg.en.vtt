spite of the pump you can see here how

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:34.230 
spite of the pump you can see here how
much<00:00:19.320> water<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.310> free

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.250 

so<00:00:34.810> right<00:00:35.020> now<00:00:35.050> water<00:00:35.560> is<00:00:35.800> flowing<00:00:37.260> usually

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
front and gets drained out into the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.960 
front and gets drained out into the
creek<00:00:42.640> but<00:00:42.790> now<00:00:42.910> the<00:00:42.970> creek<00:00:43.450> is<00:00:43.810> so<00:00:44.050> full<00:00:44.470> that

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
house the pump is running but I it's

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.460 
house the pump is running but I it's
pretty<00:00:51.460> much<00:00:51.670> flowing<00:00:52.390> in<00:00:52.540> faster<00:00:53.170> than<00:00:53.200> its

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
pretty much flowing in faster than its

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.050 
pretty much flowing in faster than its
pumping<00:00:53.800> out<00:00:53.980> right<00:00:54.190> now<00:00:56.880> part<00:00:57.880> of<00:00:57.940> the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060 
pumping out right now part of the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.240 
pumping out right now part of the
problem<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:58.720> outlet<00:00:59.110> or<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.590> pump<00:01:00.040> is

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
problem is the outlet or the pump is

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.750 
problem is the outlet or the pump is
this<00:01:00.490> Creek<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:03.250> was<00:01:03.430> really<00:01:03.490> nowhere

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760
