and my experiences my presentations my
books<00:02:10.690> are<00:02:10.869> unique<00:02:11.290> because<00:02:12.840> I'm<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.080> only

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
books are unique because I'm the only

person that I know that I know of that

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.660

extraterrestrials the tall whites for
more<00:02:23.980> than<00:02:24.220> two<00:02:24.490> years<00:02:24.820> three<00:02:25.510> different

more than two years three different
species<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.790> aliens<00:02:27.790> you're<00:02:27.940> talking<00:02:28.270> about

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
species of aliens you're talking about

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.970 
species of aliens you're talking about
their<00:02:28.690> child<00:02:28.959> yeah<00:02:29.260> can<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.500> describe<00:02:29.860> what

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
their child yeah can you describe what

their child yeah can you describe what
they<00:02:30.280> look<00:02:30.459> nice<00:02:30.640> just<00:02:31.180> got<00:02:31.330> no<00:02:31.510> one<00:02:31.660> like<00:02:33.930> well

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
they look nice just got no one like well

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.650 
they look nice just got no one like well
i'll<00:02:35.530> start<00:02:35.980> with<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.510> tall<00:02:37.510> whites<00:02:38.040> they're

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
i'll start with the tall whites they're

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.729 
i'll start with the tall whites they're
thinner<00:02:40.660> than<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.140> are<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.560> they're<00:02:41.709> very

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
thinner than we are and they're very

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.610 
thinner than we are and they're very
frail<00:02:42.300> throughout<00:02:43.300> most<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.810> their<00:02:43.959> life<00:02:44.170> they

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
frail throughout most of their life they

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
frail throughout most of their life they
are<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.980> same<00:02:45.280> height<00:02:45.850> as<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.480> am<00:02:46.690> 5<00:02:47.170> 11<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
are the same height as I am 5 11 but the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.060 
are the same height as I am 5 11 but the
end<00:02:49.030> they<00:02:49.209> live<00:02:49.450> 10<00:02:49.989> times<00:02:50.380> longer<00:02:50.800> than

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
end they live 10 times longer than

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.900 
end they live 10 times longer than
humans<00:02:51.489> they<00:02:52.150> live<00:02:52.420> 600<00:02:53.230> or<00:02:53.320> 800<00:02:53.500> years<00:02:54.070> Wow

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
humans they live 600 or 800 years Wow

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.630 
humans they live 600 or 800 years Wow
and<00:02:55.239> but<00:02:55.780> they<00:02:55.989> don't<00:02:56.260> age<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:57.010> way<00:02:57.160> we<00:02:57.400> do

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
and but they don't age the way we do

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.090 
and but they don't age the way we do
when<00:02:58.270> they<00:02:58.450> when<00:02:58.900> they<00:02:59.050> get<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.410> be<00:02:59.530> equivalent

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
when they when they get to be equivalent

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.900 
when they when they get to be equivalent
to<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.430> human<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.930> about<00:03:02.290> 40<00:03:02.800> years<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.670> means

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
to a human of about 40 years that means

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.170 
to a human of about 40 years that means
when<00:03:04.180> they<00:03:04.420> are<00:03:04.480> about<00:03:04.720> 400<00:03:05.380> years<00:03:05.980> they<00:03:06.850> start

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
when they are about 400 years they start

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.080 
when they are about 400 years they start
growing<00:03:07.390> again<00:03:07.920> instead<00:03:08.920> of<00:03:09.040> aging<00:03:09.459> as<00:03:09.610> humans

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
growing again instead of aging as humans

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.420 
growing again instead of aging as humans
grow<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.840> then<00:03:10.989> they<00:03:11.110> go<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:11.709> continues

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
grow and then they go and this continues

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.150 
grow and then they go and this continues
and<00:03:12.850> so<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.720> by<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.049> time<00:03:14.200> they<00:03:14.680> get<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.920> be

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
and so that by the time they get to be

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.780 
and so that by the time they get to be
600<00:03:15.880> or<00:03:16.000> 800<00:03:16.150> years<00:03:16.630> old<00:03:17.049> they're<00:03:18.010> very<00:03:18.280> tall

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
600 or 800 years old they're very tall

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.320 
600 or 800 years old they're very tall
eight<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.450> half<00:03:19.480> nine<00:03:20.140> or<00:03:20.620> ten<00:03:21.010> feet<00:03:21.040> tall

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
eight and a half nine or ten feet tall

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.979 
eight and a half nine or ten feet tall
but<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.720> not<00:03:22.930> necessarily<00:03:23.280> good<00:03:24.280> because

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
but this is not necessarily good because

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.680 
but this is not necessarily good because
their<00:03:25.989> skeleton<00:03:26.709> grows<00:03:27.040> more<00:03:27.970> than<00:03:28.450> their

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
their skeleton grows more than their

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.560 
their skeleton grows more than their
internal<00:03:29.260> organs<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:30.940> there<00:03:31.120> comes<00:03:31.330> a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
internal organs and so there comes a

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.539 
internal organs and so there comes a
time<00:03:31.600> after<00:03:32.410> six<00:03:32.650> or<00:03:32.890> eight<00:03:33.010> hundred<00:03:33.310> years

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
time after six or eight hundred years

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.150 
time after six or eight hundred years
when<00:03:33.820> their<00:03:34.480> skeleton<00:03:35.080> their<00:03:35.260> body<00:03:35.500> is<00:03:35.799> tall

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
when their skeleton their body is tall

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.670 
when their skeleton their body is tall
but<00:03:36.190> their<00:03:36.670> organs<00:03:37.150> can't<00:03:37.510> support<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.230> bullet

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
but their organs can't support a bullet

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.590 
but their organs can't support a bullet
at<00:03:38.890> which<00:03:39.070> time<00:03:39.400> they<00:03:39.670> die<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> natural<00:03:40.269> death

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
at which time they die a natural death

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.240 
at which time they die a natural death
because<00:03:41.200> they're<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.680> flesh-and-blood

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
because they're just flesh-and-blood

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.699 
because they're just flesh-and-blood
creatures<00:03:42.370> like<00:03:43.030> we<00:03:43.239> are<00:03:43.450> if<00:03:44.049> they<00:03:44.350> injure

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
creatures like we are if they injure

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.220 
creatures like we are if they injure
themselves<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.549> takes<00:03:45.820> them<00:03:46.120> ten<00:03:46.930> times

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
themselves it takes them ten times

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.009 
themselves it takes them ten times
longer<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.920> heal<00:03:48.250> up<00:03:48.519> than<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.940> human<00:03:49.450> yay<00:03:49.959> so

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
longer to heal up than a human yay so

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.110 
longer to heal up than a human yay so
there's<00:03:50.410> a<00:03:50.470> trade-off<00:03:50.829> yeah<00:03:51.610> right<00:03:51.820> I<00:03:51.850> still

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
there's a trade-off yeah right I still

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.370 
there's a trade-off yeah right I still
look<00:03:52.209> fresh<00:03:52.420> as<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.600> daisy<00:03:52.630> when<00:03:53.110> they<00:03:53.230> go

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
look fresh as a daisy when they go

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.440 
look fresh as a daisy when they go
though<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.799> them<00:03:54.010> look<00:03:54.640> like<00:03:54.760> Tilda<00:03:55.090> Swinton

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
though that them look like Tilda Swinton

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.530 
though that them look like Tilda Swinton
hey<00:03:55.930> just<00:03:56.500> quickly<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.670> you<00:03:57.700> had<00:03:58.329> them
