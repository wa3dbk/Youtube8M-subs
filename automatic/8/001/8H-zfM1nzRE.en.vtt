00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.480
 190 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.330
 sign in 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 born welcome back useful for girls 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.320
 now we see an evening that is not normally installed on the PC 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.389
 like the failwhale card 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.870
 legends name of the card we will talk about 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.099
 I could ask you something like that 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.099
 but that has to do with new computer work 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.049
 joking a little bit if you go get the google translator 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:30.960
 however any other translator 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.150
 and then to literally translate the word failwhale 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.270
 does not provide you with meaning plants 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.640
 separating the words fail the white instead who is the most relevant cable of 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.690
 fire now all clearer of course 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.910
 letting word games go, let's go to the point what a card is 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 fair award who is represented here in the figure 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.050
 it is a connection standard between suburbs 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 sometimes other type words are also used 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.710
 triple yesterday 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.410
 13 94 o 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.460
 you have the link 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 brutally ridiculous interface a habit that is normally used for 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 connect multimedia devices to a PC 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.690
 it shows a connection up to the usp port 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.010
 but the two dimensions in terms of interface are little more than others 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.240
 thick 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.250
 normally a farward card 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.530
 presents more than one connecting door precisely because eh 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.710
 usable age different peripherals a bit like it happens in the usp ports 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.210
 the latter however the door make the same app 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.990
 dallas howard improved interior performance qualities 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.360
 but what is the use of the card seems the same 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 the hedgehog specification refers to data transfer as we said between 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.480
 a peripheral and a pc 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.490
 these data normally only of a multimedia type 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.810
 you will definitely see a video camera connected to a computer 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.560
 in this case the connection between the peripheral and the PC was thanks to a 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.119
 learned cart 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.689
 towards the lighthouse door u 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:17.150
 doing so will turn the card into an acquisition card 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.359
 audio video to be able to transfer your movies to your PC 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.079
 through a video processing program of trading in English 

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:27.620
 you 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.180
 carry out video processing also of a professional type, equipping with 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.730
 suitable tools so you can create 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.330
 your beautiful and amateur movies and turned into a real director 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.209
 where the farward card can be found 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.309
 no computer whine is missing this card 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:53.829
 so it is necessary to buy it separately and it will be tv box I said years 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.219
 prices are only a few euros 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.599
 access to the card will be possible on the PC bed 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.229
 always down to the tennis player 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:08.799
 after connecting the word card to the computer to gain access 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.900
 operating system 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.200
 once started, it recognizes the peripheral and the relative drivers 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.870
 for its correct functioning 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.450
 at this point you are ready for its use simply by connecting the 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.500
 periphery to the board 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.879
 do uan thanks to a dedicated cart 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:34.040
 but which are the links shown here are represented 2 tdci connections 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.309
 failwhale 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:39.919
 the collectors, as you can well see, are different, the TV series lesson exists 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:40.680
 setting 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.100
 I have 4 feet 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.049
 which is often found on the not books 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.510
 the small alloy is substantially identical from the point of view of the 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.309
 ability to manage peripherals 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:55.480
 you will then need the other cable 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.860
 for the connections of the case there are the adepts to the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.540
 tui and if I like it 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.029
 one syringe collector at the other a 4 pin connector 

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:05.290
 other shrimps 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.589
 the possess both ends 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.339
 4 pin interface 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.609
 in the next lesson you will know the component that I think you take TV and 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.120
 computer one of the most important 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.870
 absolutely the ethernet card 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.250
 I just have to thank you a saludo today I lost the key to the next one 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.890
 tim 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.320
 lantana 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.749
 num tel 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.559
 alice rain man 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:41.059
