of the match so far

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.009 
of the match so far
I<00:00:22.980> suppose<00:00:23.430> Stephen<00:00:23.789> McGuire's<00:00:24.090> opening<00:00:24.779> pot

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
I suppose Stephen McGuire's opening pot

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.500 
I suppose Stephen McGuire's opening pot
was<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.279> as<00:00:26.430> good<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.150> was<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> bit

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
was just as good but that was a bit

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:52.330 
was just as good but that was a bit
special<00:00:27.930> as<00:00:28.080> well<00:00:28.230> there

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:09.570 

five

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.650 

six<00:01:12.070> might<00:01:13.070> be<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> little<00:01:13.910> bit<00:01:14.150> straight<00:01:14.450> but

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
six might be a little bit straight but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.880 
six might be a little bit straight but
it<00:01:14.720> looks<00:01:14.900> as<00:01:14.990> if<00:01:15.080> he's<00:01:15.170> got<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.320> slight<00:01:15.590> angle

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
it looks as if he's got a slight angle

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.530 
it looks as if he's got a slight angle
shouldn't<00:01:16.580> be<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.700> problem<00:01:16.880> with<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.330> red

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540
