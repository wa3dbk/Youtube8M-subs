which<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.920> think's<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.250> little<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.579> generous<00:01:47.790> he

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
which I think's a little bit generous he

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880 
which I think's a little bit generous he
wasn't<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.360> accurate<00:01:48.780> but<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.590> fact<00:01:49.799> that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
wasn't that accurate but the fact that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.889 
wasn't that accurate but the fact that
he<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.159> definitely<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.329> can't<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
power or is a not throw power but it's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.880

 truckin<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> his<00:01:57.990> running<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.710> he's

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
 truckin and his running is he's

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.899
