this is a standard 3 inch mount and the
way<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.500> get<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.920> number<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
way we get to that number is the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.139 
way we get to that number is the
distance<00:00:30.359> from<00:00:30.929> inside<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.710> inside<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:32.700> little

tabs you can see that that is three

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700 
tabs you can see that that is three
inches<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> that's<00:00:36.870> when<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.170> come<00:00:37.350> up<00:00:37.410> with

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
inches and that's when we come up with

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.819 
inches and that's when we come up with
that<00:00:37.980> three<00:00:38.579> inch<00:00:38.760> standard<00:00:39.120> mount<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.960> this

is where you would want to measure your

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.600 
is where you would want to measure your
grill<00:00:42.660> bracket<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.590> make<00:00:43.829> sure<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.370> the

little<00:00:44.879> ears<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.840> down<00:00:45.870> inside<00:00:46.559> here

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
little ears that we go down inside here

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.380 
little ears that we go down inside here
are<00:00:47.430> three<00:00:48.120> inches<00:00:48.450> or<00:00:48.719> slightly<00:00:49.530> less<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
are three inches or slightly less and

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
are three inches or slightly less and
also<00:00:51.469> as<00:00:52.469> far<00:00:52.680> as<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> square<00:00:53.190> drive<00:00:53.520> goes

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
also as far as the square drive goes

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.209 
also as far as the square drive goes
they<00:00:54.300> talk<00:00:54.539> about<00:00:54.690> 5/16<00:00:55.559> square<00:00:55.920> drive<00:00:58.219> 5/16

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
they talk about 5/16 square drive 5/16

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.860 
they talk about 5/16 square drive 5/16
so<00:00:59.460> digitally<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.379> 0.3<00:01:01.379> 1<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:02.270> each<00:01:03.270> sixteenth

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
so digitally is 0.3 1 to each sixteenth

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.380 
so digitally is 0.3 1 to each sixteenth
is<00:01:04.080> point<00:01:04.350> zero<00:01:04.680> six<00:01:05.010> two<00:01:05.159> five<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.790> five<00:01:06.030> times

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
is point zero six two five so five times

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.530 
is point zero six two five so five times
that<00:01:06.570> number<00:01:06.750> gets<00:01:07.110> us<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.470> 0.3<00:01:08.460> 1<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
that number gets us to 0.3 1 to the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.450 
that number gets us to 0.3 1 to the
square<00:01:09.840> inside<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.650> motors<00:01:10.950> are<00:01:11.100> slightly

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
square inside the motors are slightly

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510 
square inside the motors are slightly
larger<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.479> particular<00:01:13.049> motor<00:01:13.290> about<00:01:13.680> 328

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
larger this particular motor about 328

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.940 
larger this particular motor about 328
that<00:01:15.270> gives<00:01:15.479> us<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.659> little<00:01:15.810> clearance<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that gives us a little clearance for the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.260 
that gives us a little clearance for the
spit<00:01:17.400> rod<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:18.000> inside<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.830> able<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
spit rod to go inside and be able to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.340 
spit rod to go inside and be able to
still<00:01:21.270> rotate<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.920> now<00:01:23.820> we'll<00:01:24.060> look<00:01:24.090> at<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
still rotate and now we'll look at the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.520 
still rotate and now we'll look at the
rods<00:01:25.619> themselves<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.530> 5/16

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
well if we look at the end here you'll

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.699 
well if we look at the end here you'll
see<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:17.030> rod<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.720> actually<00:02:18.110> machined

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
see that this rod is actually machined

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.940 
see that this rod is actually machined
down<00:02:18.980> to<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.280> 5/16<00:02:20.180> square<00:02:20.629> so<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.409> gives<00:02:21.799> us

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
down to a 5/16 square so this gives us

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.170 
down to a 5/16 square so this gives us
the<00:02:22.069> ability<00:02:22.129> to<00:02:22.430> use<00:02:22.640> industry<00:02:23.090> standard

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the ability to use industry standard

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.430 
the ability to use industry standard
motor<00:02:23.989> sizing<00:02:24.560> drive<00:02:24.920> systems<00:02:25.459> and<00:02:26.349> be<00:02:27.349> able

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
motor sizing drive systems and be able

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.100 
motor sizing drive systems and be able
to<00:02:27.590> spend<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.040> much<00:02:28.459> larger<00:02:29.000> heavier<00:02:29.330> rod<00:02:29.750> for

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
to spend a much larger heavier rod for

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.019 
to spend a much larger heavier rod for
bigger<00:02:30.379> loads<00:02:30.709> like<00:02:31.040> say<00:02:31.400> an<00:02:32.150> 18<00:02:32.450> pound<00:02:32.660> turkey
