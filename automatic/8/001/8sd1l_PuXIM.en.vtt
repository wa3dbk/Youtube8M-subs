we'll<00:04:19.549> take<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.910> tolls<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.390> hope<00:04:20.540> I<00:04:20.690> can<00:04:20.840> make<00:04:20.959> it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.929 

yeah<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.590> would<00:04:24.889> think<00:04:24.919> so<00:04:25.159> but<00:04:25.580> it<00:04:25.759> really

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:25.939 
yeah I would think so but it really

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.830 
yeah I would think so but it really
isn't<00:04:26.210> being<00:04:26.509> reflected<00:04:26.900> on<00:04:27.469> the<00:04:28.189> racetrack

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.350 

back<00:04:31.840> up<00:04:32.140> going<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.770> the<00:04:32.980> inside<00:04:33.460> trying<00:04:34.060> to

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
back up going to the inside trying to

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.960 
back up going to the inside trying to
take<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.990> position<00:04:35.470> away<00:04:35.770> from<00:04:35.800> Dale<00:04:36.370> again

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
take the position away from Dale again

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.219 
take the position away from Dale again
not<00:04:37.510> able<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.900> do<00:04:38.050> so

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.019 

yes<00:04:41.770> good<00:04:41.979> we<00:04:42.099> can<00:04:42.249> hook<00:04:42.370> it<00:04:42.490> doesn't<00:04:42.759> stay<00:04:42.909> out

00:04:43.019 --> 00:04:43.029 
yes good we can hook it doesn't stay out

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.369 
yes good we can hook it doesn't stay out
there<00:04:43.240> too<00:04:43.419> long<00:04:43.449> yeah<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:45.039> would<00:04:45.249> not<00:04:45.279> be

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:46.379 
there too long yeah that would not be

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:54.200 
there too long yeah that would not be
motioning<00:04:47.379> everybody

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.340 

and<00:04:54.509> they<00:04:54.690> say<00:04:54.870> thank<00:04:55.169> you

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.080 

I<00:05:00.410> think<00:05:00.890> it's<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.070> little<00:05:01.250> too<00:05:01.580> early<00:05:01.610> to

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
I think it's a little too early to

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.900 
I think it's a little too early to
predict<00:05:02.930> who's<00:05:03.080> going<00:05:03.350> to

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
predict who's going to

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.850
