00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.440
 difference 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.279
 Picky 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.610
 0 Whoa is 55th 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.790
 high school 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:20.470
 All this time E' 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:21.740
 It's true, I thought that I will post continuously from the last 54 times, but I will go here for a while 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.730
 right 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.880
 E-mail video brush easy to play current situation of play mat 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.460
 I think I want to open 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.850
 8 lawn and Te collapse and Kashiku of work 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:42.770
 And I did not stick bread farmland and the body is standing we have another small little calm 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.620
 It is Hase entered towards the small 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:51.370
 And it is the fifth one that was finished by the making and deployment until the last time 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.370
 That 's a mat 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.040
 Less than this 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.850
 It says that it is the first 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.170
 It looks like pasta is a top joint project 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.990
 2 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.220
 That say bought and saved 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:10.470
 I 'm new, so it's good to be new 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:16.230
 In since it has been asked to create null-de-Play Mat 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.820
 Can be designed towards the prima facie now usually self really normal copy 4 dishes of as good but no copy paper 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.659
 Print base 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.619
 Well we are the future 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.330
 It is for those of the I and have finished the stage, such as a printed 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.730
 Yes 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:33.740
 At the end of the process, I would like to report another stop or something like this with serve. 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.580
 My body hurts for the time being 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.130
 I just want to hop on the design 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:46.950
 It fell drum that has to be a thing that was waiting pile of problems Yes 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.780
 I think you also plug starter last time to say a picture book 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.390
 Not in the middle of listening to Suzuka 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.230
 Ookini was the look this time 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.600
 Skaper and on the river in a good moon 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.670
 I'm designing a back star 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.680
 I made 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.680
 In the case of n playmats, the size is slightly more 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.220
 You're that normal 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.680
 Shan is a play mat 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.150
 And creema of 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.310
 There are 4 kinds of 9 used , I think it will be about the same size as that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.580
 Because 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.090
 I can not drop zone and some Mactan to this one 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.410
 papuwa here 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.280
 Or damage and the like firmly riding on the economy 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.450
 You are in 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.450
 Uncle is also 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.590
 I think 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.160
 now 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.820
 Design is this day 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.820
 Ghan 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.690
 It's and Ppoku to discover how the left side 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.990
 Hmm 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.510
 Don't come 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.770
 Have a useful thickness 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.790
 This open flame g 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.360
 I'm No. 6 of 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.780
 is 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.730
 And even more, this time I 'm riding on this and it's completed in the state not yet finished 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.900
 Called 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.520
 Bees house 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.040
 See you again 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:23.910
 Since the advertising of way I would like to report that of the lifted state 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:28.319
 And it is better that there was a play of Mr. Dyna 7th again 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:32.450
 Because it was Jaimashi I wish I'd Tsu wrote and you also want to publish there who 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.450
 It is white 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.690
 Has entered 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.690
 Um, this is a one-way street 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.460
 Change 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.390
 It would be nice if you could leave the characters that came out to 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.390
 Not only Vanguard characters but also other characters like this 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.830
 This of this accelerator 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.270
 Design is good 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:05.640
 It was there is it in the order God play mat of God 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.640
 This is good even if you are riding him 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.700
 close 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.840
 Printed on photo paper 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.480
 Good morning 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.570
 Will be 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:23.770
 Quite stuck wind in the well design 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:30.100
 Oh, let's say a little bit of this card, even if you put it 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.580
 I think that I want to make it a form that comes out one side in both rear guards 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.280
 Well To this it is about quite to this design 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.600
 Like this 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.550
 No. 9 has had 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.570
 Ma King from lightly side 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.570
 You will be thinking 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.560
 Overwintering and 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.180
 This is good 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.529
 Well I understand that you get this arm or something, but just in the hole of this circle 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.840
 I put the spot 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:57.969
 Do not say 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:03.369
 9 good I put around the neck 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:06.719
 I learned a little visa because there is a circle 8 

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.719
 Well this is also delicious yet 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:17.320
 If you do not check it, maybe this video 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:20.180

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.129
 And to 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.180
 It is basically Well 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.419
 To Ma Te 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:34.130
 Image of Accelerator is based on'm a Well 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:35.820
 Black-and-white a page There are 8 Well Basic in the a little behind even circle in the black-and-white image 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:41.490
 kind of 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:43.420
 It's a kind of satirical kind of a part of it and the sound pattern of the 8 well accelerator 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:49.590
 Parker 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:52.040
 There will therefore enter the image Tteyuu red of this house as it is well in this circle 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.510
 Let's put Parker measures 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.560
 Not in the form of a movie 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.680
 Masu Well that quite a sense of unity Toka be Attari 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.870
 The hands of time 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.710
 Is not good 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.770
 To say the sword 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.009
 Is launched 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.210
 If this is what you want 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.200
 We have an accelerator 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.980
 I'm waiting 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.860
 That is good with Weber this time 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.500
 Have kind here still 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.830
 Would have wanted to have to go to it is the second of the design of the design 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.750
 And 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.470

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:37.920
 This is only the sixth vs. six Sugamo event blaster 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:40.240
 And here is the 73rd one-way one of Nepal's accelerator design 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.870
 Page of the bat 4 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.870
 Introduction

 The beach 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.310
 Color
