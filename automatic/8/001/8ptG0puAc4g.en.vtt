00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.200
 the controversy of today after mine today 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.200
 is the famous piano video that is that 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.459
 is running on the various social networks of which one 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:15.249
 fan with the smart joins him 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.619
 he simply asks for Roman tones 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.470
 but don't exasperate in short, as you have 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.220
 could lose at home against 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 sampdoria 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.470
 I believe it is also a statement 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:32.500
 legitimate if the guy pjanic from like 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.539
 I read in the various newspaper articles and 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:42.129
 websites has been shaken and has 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:44.949
 suffered from this situation and both 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.750
 thinking of leaving the Rome of 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:52.260
 go away because in this square not 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.260
 you can work and I think then 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.540
 I shut up but I shut up 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:06.670
 I believe that the fans have good reason 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.680
 to protest 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.710
 with certainly civilian tones as it has 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.360
 made that guy in the smart i 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.280
 football players must stay exclusively 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.470
 shut up they must not answer not 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.210
 they just have to lower their head and stay 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.960
 shut up pecking at everything that comes 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.909
 obviously always on a civil level not 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.450
 insults on the staff but that boy 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.340
 he did n't just ask why he didn't 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.619
 you won with the sampdoria with tones 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.060
 but colored for charity are not me 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.190
 seems to have been something to be had 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.500
 unleash all this suffering and 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.380
 this decision to leave Rome 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.759
 because so much is known that pjanic at the end 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.979
 year leaves Rome 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.479
 and the substitute is already ready and I believe 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.670
 that the substitute is also a little more 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.459
 incisive respect but admired 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.709
 definitely has a touch of the ball 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:00.130
 amazing when he can tell her about them 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:02.049
 punishments for charity nothing to say though 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.429
 at the level of what they say in Rome 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:10.179
 tighten you tighten but in four years yes 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:12.280
 they really count on the fingers of two hands 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.440
 let's s generous of two hands 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.859
 pjanic's performance is of a high standard 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.620
 ok so this will be yet another 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.230
 pretext for something that is already 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.480
 announced as the departure of pjanic 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.989
 at the end of the year hoping that there are still 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.989
 of admirers
