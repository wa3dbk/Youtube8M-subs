00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.313
 - Being able to feel a
 beat is one of sort of

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.750
the fundamental characteristics
that we all share as humans.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:24.324 
  Music is unique in that
  it's found in every culture

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:27.427 
  and because it's just sound,
  it's very easy for people

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:29.796 align:start size:88% position:13%
from different
cultures or backgrounds

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.865
to be able to relate
to something instantly.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:40.974 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I wrote my very
 first piece of music,

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:42.942
 I believe, at the age of five

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.179  line:0%
  and it was this short little
  piece for piano and voice

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:48.515 line:0%
and it was about how my
mother was successful

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.785 line:0%
in putting together one
of those IKEA bookcases,

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:54.587 align:start size:88% position:13%
where my father had
not been so successful.

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.489 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I believe the reason
  was that my mom

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.792 size:88% position:44%
   had actually read
   the instructions.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.929
I prefer to work by hand
because it just gives me

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:04.864 align:start size:88% position:13%
sort of a physical
connection to the notes

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.499 size:88% position:44%
   that I'm writing.

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.636
 To write my music by
 hand, I sit at my desk

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.638
with these giant pieces of paper

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.442
   and rulers and pencils and
   erasers, lots of erasers,

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.744
 and I draw everything by hand

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.312
and I guess it brings out a bit

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:20.780
  of the perfectionist in me,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.516 
   but it also makes me care
   a lot about my music.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.188 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I hope that my music
  has a connection

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:31.324 size:88% position:44%
   to both the performer and
   for the audience members.

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.426 align:start size:88% position:13%
 As a performer myself,
 I can always tell

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.463
  whether a composer has paid
  attention to little details,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.398
whether that note's easy to play

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:40.600
   on the violin in a
   certain position,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.570
  but I'm also always thinking
  about what is the experience

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.339
   for my listener and so I
   hope that those two things

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:47.874 size:88% position:44%
   come through in my music.

00:01:50.577 --> 00:01:52.879
   Penn is actually a great
   environment for a composer

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.849 
   because we have three
   wonderful faculty members.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.550 align:start size:88% position:13%
 We also have a working
 connection with

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.385
 the Curtis Institute of Music

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:02.288 align:start size:88% position:13%
and so usually once a
year, we're able to have

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.258 
   our orchestral works read
   by the Curtis students

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:06.960
 and there's nothing
 like actually hearing

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.695
 your music performed.
