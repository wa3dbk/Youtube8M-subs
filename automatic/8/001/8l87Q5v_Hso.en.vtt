really<00:04:18.840> too<00:04:19.049> much<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.380> skiller<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.400> do

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
really too much of a skiller but I do

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.890 
really too much of a skiller but I do
I'm<00:04:20.669> pretty<00:04:20.880> intricate<00:04:21.180> past<00:04:21.510> it<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:21.840> it

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
I'm pretty intricate past it so it

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.570 
I'm pretty intricate past it so it
wasn't<00:04:22.289> really<00:04:22.320> too<00:04:22.590> much<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.860> a<00:04:22.919> fan<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.279> mean

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
wasn't really too much of a fan I mean

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.339 
wasn't really too much of a fan I mean
you<00:04:23.700> were<00:04:23.820> running<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.270> 4<00:04:24.450> 12<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.779> 2<00:04:25.020> which<00:04:25.200> I

00:04:25.339 --> 00:04:25.349 
you were running the 4 12 and 2 which I

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:25.800 
you were running the 4 12 and 2 which I
seen

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
seen

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.140 
seen
to<00:04:25.900> really<00:04:26.230> struggle<00:04:26.620> against<00:04:27.220> when<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.850> play

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
to really struggle against when I play

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.330 
to really struggle against when I play
online<00:04:28.360> just<00:04:28.930> basically<00:04:29.260> because<00:04:29.680> typically

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
online just basically because typically

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.010 
online just basically because typically
I<00:04:30.430> outsmart<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.330> players<00:04:31.570> who<00:04:31.690> I<00:04:31.750> play

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
I outsmart the players who I play

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.409 
I outsmart the players who I play
against<00:04:32.410> but<00:04:33.100> that<00:04:33.250> CDM<00:04:33.760> definitely<00:04:34.240> does

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
against but that CDM definitely does

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.550 
against but that CDM definitely does
take<00:04:34.630> care<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.840> things<00:04:34.930> and<00:04:35.110> maybe<00:04:35.260> that<00:04:35.470> was

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
take care of things and maybe that was

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.720 
take care of things and maybe that was
the<00:04:35.590> problem<00:04:35.680> cuz<00:04:36.070> yours<00:04:36.220> was<00:04:36.370> running<00:04:36.639> on

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
the problem cuz yours was running on

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.550 
the problem cuz yours was running on
field<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.240> just<00:04:37.720> don't<00:04:37.900> think<00:04:38.080> replace<00:04:38.320> work

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
field I just don't think replace work

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.440 
field I just don't think replace work
like<00:04:38.889> I<00:04:39.040> think<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.460> strikers<00:04:39.880> I<00:04:40.000> picked<00:04:40.240> with

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
like I think the strikers I picked with

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.140 
like I think the strikers I picked with
two<00:04:41.110> similar<00:04:41.950> as<00:04:42.100> well<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.490> Muslim<00:04:42.880> jiggle

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
two similar as well you Muslim jiggle

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.090 
two similar as well you Muslim jiggle
pasta<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.630> course<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.110> fairly<00:04:44.560> large<00:04:44.770> players

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
pasta of course to fairly large players

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.020 
pasta of course to fairly large players
to<00:04:45.850> target<00:04:46.270> men<00:04:46.419> not<00:04:46.720> really<00:04:47.080> Pacey<00:04:47.530> players

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
to target men not really Pacey players

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.460 
to target men not really Pacey players
and<00:04:49.030> I<00:04:49.090> feel<00:04:49.300> as<00:04:49.419> if<00:04:49.510> maybe<00:04:49.810> if<00:04:50.139> I'd<00:04:50.290> have

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
and I feel as if maybe if I'd have

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.860 
and I feel as if maybe if I'd have
paired<00:04:51.220> Yuma's<00:04:51.669> with<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.330> slightly<00:04:52.630> faster

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
paired Yuma's with a slightly faster

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.510 
paired Yuma's with a slightly faster
play<00:04:53.200> he<00:04:53.350> may<00:04:53.500> have<00:04:53.560> done<00:04:53.650> better<00:04:53.950> or<00:04:54.190> if<00:04:54.400> I

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
play he may have done better or if I

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.800 
play he may have done better or if I
pair<00:04:54.730> jigglypuff<00:04:55.240> style<00:04:55.450> of<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.600> slightly

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
pair jigglypuff style of a slightly

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.750 
pair jigglypuff style of a slightly
faster<00:04:56.050> play<00:04:56.350> he<00:04:56.530> made<00:04:56.560> them<00:04:56.830> better<00:04:56.919> I<00:04:57.190> guess

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
faster play he made them better I guess

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.270 
faster play he made them better I guess
it's<00:04:57.910> too<00:04:58.060> late<00:04:58.090> now<00:04:58.240> and<00:04:59.010> that's<00:05:00.010> just<00:05:00.100> the

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
it's too late now and that's just the

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.770 
it's too late now and that's just the
way<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.520> is<00:05:00.610> I<00:05:00.820> do<00:05:00.880> quite<00:05:01.180> like<00:05:01.240> for<00:05:01.510> once<00:05:01.630> you

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
way it is I do quite like for once you

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.090 
way it is I do quite like for once you
want<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.050> either<00:05:02.260> when<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.680> right<00:05:02.860> players

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
want to either when the right players

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.280 
want to either when the right players
are<00:05:03.340> chosen<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.960> course<00:05:04.960> one<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.139> the

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
are chosen of course one of the

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.629 
are chosen of course one of the
strongest<00:05:05.620> formations<00:05:06.100> and<00:05:06.190> also<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.430> team

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
strongest formations and also a team

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.640 
strongest formations and also a team
that's<00:05:06.820> why<00:05:06.940> it<00:05:07.479> is<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:07.660> expensive<00:05:08.020> to<00:05:08.380> buy<00:05:08.590> the

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
that's why it is so expensive to buy the

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.590 
that's why it is so expensive to buy the
formation<00:05:09.130> guts<00:05:09.310> oh<00:05:09.520> yeah<00:05:10.000> most<00:05:10.240> most

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
formation guts oh yeah most most

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.150 
formation guts oh yeah most most
definitely<00:05:10.990> I<00:05:11.050> mean<00:05:11.080> that<00:05:11.320> CDM<00:05:11.710> is<00:05:11.830> really<00:05:12.040> the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
definitely I mean that CDM is really the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.370 
definitely I mean that CDM is really the
lock<00:05:12.520> down<00:05:12.550> position<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.330> I<00:05:13.360> have<00:05:14.050> basically

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
lock down position that I have basically

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.900 
lock down position that I have basically
seen<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.889> there<00:05:14.979> you<00:05:15.040> guys<00:05:15.160> go<00:05:15.220> you<00:05:15.430> see<00:05:15.669> Sam's

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
team right there pretty nice unique

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.860 
team right there pretty nice unique
hybrid<00:05:18.040> very<00:05:18.460> very<00:05:18.700> happy<00:05:19.270> with<00:05:19.389> what<00:05:19.570> he<00:05:19.690> came

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
hybrid very very happy with what he came

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.930 
hybrid very very happy with what he came
up<00:05:20.080> with<00:05:20.139> is<00:05:20.620> definitely<00:05:21.040> pretty<00:05:21.220> cool<00:05:21.490> but<00:05:21.760> I

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
up with is definitely pretty cool but I

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.730 
up with is definitely pretty cool but I
mean<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.389> just<00:05:22.660> really<00:05:22.900> struggle<00:05:23.260> against<00:05:23.620> at

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
mean I just really struggle against at

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.020 
mean I just really struggle against at
formation<00:05:23.979> I<00:05:24.160> also<00:05:24.280> struggle<00:05:24.700> against<00:05:24.940> the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
formation I also struggle against the

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.550 
formation I also struggle against the
three<00:05:25.300> back<00:05:25.479> just<00:05:25.840> basically<00:05:26.139> because

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
three back just basically because

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.469 
three back just basically because
centre-backs<00:05:27.430> don't<00:05:27.639> typically<00:05:27.970> run<00:05:28.270> out<00:05:28.450> of

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
centre-backs don't typically run out of

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.420 
centre-backs don't typically run out of
formation<00:05:28.870> which<00:05:29.139> is<00:05:29.260> kind<00:05:29.470> of<00:05:29.500> funny<00:05:29.740> the

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
formation which is kind of funny the

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.469 
formation which is kind of funny the
left<00:05:30.640> backs<00:05:30.820> and<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.000> right<00:05:31.150> backs<00:05:31.330> are

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
left backs and the right backs are

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.940 
left backs and the right backs are
usually<00:05:31.780> sprinting<00:05:32.229> up<00:05:32.320> but<00:05:32.470> actually<00:05:32.800> my

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
usually sprinting up but actually my

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:34.830 
usually sprinting up but actually my
left<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.280> right<00:05:33.460> backs<00:05:33.640> played<00:05:33.850> solid<00:05:34.300> you

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
left and right backs played solid you

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.150 
left and right backs played solid you
know<00:05:34.900> I<00:05:34.960> did<00:05:35.140> have<00:05:35.289> one<00:05:35.530> front<00:05:35.800> who's<00:05:35.950> very

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
know I did have one front who's very

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.219 
know I did have one front who's very
pasty<00:05:36.460> and<00:05:36.729> like<00:05:37.330> you<00:05:37.450> said<00:05:37.600> before<00:05:37.870> I<00:05:37.900> Sam

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
pasty and like you said before I Sam

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.830 
pasty and like you said before I Sam
said<00:05:38.470> his<00:05:38.590> strikers<00:05:39.010> were<00:05:39.160> not<00:05:39.370> very<00:05:39.729> PC<00:05:40.000> my

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
said his strikers were not very PC my

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.630 
said his strikers were not very PC my
defense<00:05:41.229> was<00:05:41.320> rather<00:05:41.680> pacing<00:05:42.280> on<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.460> left

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
defense was rather pacing on the left

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.860 
defense was rather pacing on the left
back<00:05:42.820> and<00:05:42.940> right<00:05:43.090> back<00:05:43.270> side<00:05:43.479> so<00:05:43.600> I<00:05:43.630> was<00:05:43.780> able

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
back and right back side so I was able

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.040 
back and right back side so I was able
to<00:05:44.020> catch<00:05:44.260> up<00:05:44.440> with<00:05:44.470> him<00:05:44.710> most<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.640> the<00:05:45.729> time

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
to catch up with him most of the time

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.600 
to catch up with him most of the time
well<00:05:47.050> my<00:05:47.740> right<00:05:47.979> back<00:05:48.130> and<00:05:48.250> left<00:05:48.400> back<00:05:48.580> I

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
well my right back and left back I

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.550 
well my right back and left back I
believe<00:05:49.030> they<00:05:49.330> both<00:05:49.539> have<00:05:49.810> high<00:05:50.080> defensive

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
believe they both have high defensive

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.170 
believe they both have high defensive
workrate<00:05:50.890> server<00:05:51.250> they<00:05:51.610> didn't<00:05:51.820> get<00:05:51.910> forward

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
workrate server they didn't get forward

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.940 
workrate server they didn't get forward
much<00:05:52.360> at<00:05:52.510> all<00:05:52.660> but<00:05:52.960> they<00:05:53.289> didn't<00:05:53.530> offer<00:05:53.650> much

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
much at all but they didn't offer much

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.730 
much at all but they didn't offer much
in<00:05:54.010> the<00:05:54.250> defensive<00:05:55.169> part<00:05:56.169> of<00:05:56.289> things<00:05:56.470> because

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
in the defensive part of things because

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.710 
in the defensive part of things because
they<00:05:56.919> were<00:05:56.979> fairly<00:05:57.669> slow<00:05:58.030> i<00:05:58.060> believe<00:05:58.389> both

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
they were fairly slow i believe both

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.710 
they were fairly slow i believe both
have<00:05:58.960> below<00:05:59.229> 80<00:05:59.410> pace<00:05:59.740> mario<00:06:00.220> fernandez<00:06:00.690> 73<00:06:01.690> i

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
have below 80 pace mario fernandez 73 i

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.750 
have below 80 pace mario fernandez 73 i
believe<00:06:02.110> being<00:06:02.350> quite<00:06:02.560> specific<00:06:03.039> there<00:06:03.220> but<00:06:03.729> a

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
believe being quite specific there but a

believe being quite specific there but a
yes<00:06:04.090> a<00:06:04.120> fairly<00:06:04.510> disappointing<00:06:05.200> team<00:06:05.440> I<00:06:05.710> would
