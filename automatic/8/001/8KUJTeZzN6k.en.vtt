00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.840
 again it could now be about the following 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.880
 I wanted you a little bit more 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.369
 tell me how the thing is here 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.619
 I see a lot of people on land 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 Their sales share in ten years' shoes 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.439
 and jump on the thing as heels 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.830
 this will attack me cats fir tree 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.830
 knock on the 30 seconds on it and 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 So what are you waiting for from behind 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.899
 and did not burn anything because of it 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.550
 does not matter if you're 30 seconds long 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.770
 on this she purely beats the still 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.110
 makes joints broken and in the end so 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.780
 shit is just not noticeable 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.789
 You have to know the thing a bit 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.180
 you can learn which means on Saturday 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.980
 Get to know your gloves 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.710
 goes into the box from position 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.030
 In short, you're right-handed 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.250
 the left foot you know you are 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.809
 left-handed elsewhere I am now 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.579
 right-handed so the left is mine 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.520
 for hand the right one has a punch 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.729
 so ballack is now I weigh to the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.100

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.560
 all smartphones and there are cheap 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.560
 or free round counter interval 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.439
 Training counter waters up well 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.090
 google rows are looking for a customer 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.670
 timer what he's mostly on 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.110
 three minutes of fighting time set and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.560
 a minute break if the beginner 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.000
 hello you like on two routes 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.630
 Ramallah and two minutes break 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 Shit never overdo it that way 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.680
 what my Saturday said the box 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.820
 I do not have to be fully us right now 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.320
 pay attention to the cover 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.320
 everywhere first the bag strong 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.689
 how do the interviews behave ? 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.759
 I on top of a lot of schlager with 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.790
 the palm with the with down there here 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.180
 or tie up here and says we 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.270
 want 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.890
 insert mike tyson hooks and catch them 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.720
 first of all very relaxed with the basics 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.130
 move a bit , some said 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.530
 really believe then stand 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.510
 so forward 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.890
 that does not get rid of rheine you 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.370
 you have to move that's your enemy 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200
 So is moving and on the other hand why kisses 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.610
 it left so a must for hand 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.340
 you can not refuse simply 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.200
 so and direct the income strong first 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.700
 easy the first round you 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.170
 consequences to beat 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.030
 trying to find the angle 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.580
 my fist how much needs to be apple 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.400
 are not with small errors of 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 click away nice front 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 middle and index finger is the ankle 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.610
 this one hearty and pasty one 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.590
 move a bit and push the things 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.160
 I live today doing here and there 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:47.130
 nonsense as I said you can do that 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.500
 shoulder hurt the ligaments and the 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.450
 whole joints do not become so 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.610
 positively influenced so strong 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.520
 concentrated looks the dance-ag what does 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.140
 Well how can I say that it is not so 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.780
 hurts I do not want us now that 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.489
 wildest combos absolutely but first 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.769
 round simply continuously 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.120
 I look like I have this in my power 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.510
 were developed and that against rom 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.790
 pages seems look exactly the bit 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.890
 end up is good for debtors just because 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.959
 its like george foreman and here 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.209
 below the making of his descriptions 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.689
 to burn straight and continuously 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.030
 but if you are 30 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.890
 the shoulder we did not dissect 10 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.980
 calorie relatives since from boarding schools 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.629
 So first round nice clean boxing 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.079
 second round could be a bit harder 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:39.599
 when you are warm, be the most beautiful 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:42.599
 increase garden food bit if you 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.700
 that time through time thinks ahead 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:47.030
 My father is supposed to be with the saturday only 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.939
 Do three to four turns with each 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.769
 after two minutes fighting a break 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.319
 we want to feel for you otherwise 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.269
 53 minutes increased a blood break 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.209
 no idea how the local and box 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.040
 continuously has no wild attack 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.099
 and then I do not sit at any 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.769
 TV so at least 45 rounds 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:12.170
 you have yet to make trinket 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.170
 of course the job
