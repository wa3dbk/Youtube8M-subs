I<00:00:04.540> am<00:00:05.529> Greg<00:00:05.980> with<00:00:06.190> VR<00:00:06.370> technology<00:00:07.060> and<00:00:07.359> here<00:00:08.290> to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
I am Greg with VR technology and here to

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.500 
I am Greg with VR technology and here to
introduce<00:00:08.559> you<00:00:08.770> to<00:00:09.190> the<00:00:09.460> VXR<00:00:10.000> dive<00:00:10.240> computer

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
introduce you to the VXR dive computer

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.189 
introduce you to the VXR dive computer
this<00:00:11.469> is<00:00:11.530> a<00:00:11.680> 10<00:00:11.950> gasp<00:00:12.219> air<00:00:12.730> and<00:00:13.150> mixed<00:00:14.020> gas

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:14.199 
this is a 10 gasp air and mixed gas

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.439 
this is a 10 gasp air and mixed gas

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
to a dive options menu now let's say I

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400 
to a dive options menu now let's say I
want<00:01:09.640> to<00:01:09.700> go<00:01:09.880> to<00:01:09.940> that<00:01:10.180> dive<00:01:10.420> options<00:01:10.930> menu

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
want to go to that dive options menu

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.210 
want to go to that dive options menu
simple<00:01:12.310> push<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.670> release<00:01:12.940> of<00:01:13.210> both<00:01:13.420> buttons

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
simple push and release of both buttons

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.120 
simple push and release of both buttons
will<00:01:15.220> then<00:01:15.400> take<00:01:15.640> me<00:01:15.820> into<00:01:15.940> my<00:01:16.150> dive<00:01:16.390> options

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
will then take me into my dive options

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.380 
will then take me into my dive options
and<00:01:18.130> this<00:01:18.280> is<00:01:18.430> in<00:01:18.670> general<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:19.240> how<00:01:19.330> you

and this is in general just how you
navigate<00:01:19.990> around<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.070> computer<00:01:21.970> screens<00:01:22.330> is

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
navigate around the computer screens is

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.230 
navigate around the computer screens is
just<00:01:23.260> with<00:01:23.470> either<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.340> push<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:24.880> release<00:01:25.180> a
