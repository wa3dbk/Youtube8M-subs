been selling well but making these
episodes<00:05:02.310> they're<00:05:03.150> really<00:05:03.270> hurting<00:05:03.720> the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
episodes they're really hurting the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.580

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
series because this was done like a

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.159 
series because this was done like a
little<00:05:07.830> bit<00:05:07.919> differently<00:05:08.340> with<00:05:08.910> no<00:05:09.419> Finn<00:05:10.140> and

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
little bit differently with no Finn and

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.180 
little bit differently with no Finn and
Jake<00:05:11.330> this<00:05:12.330> would<00:05:12.480> be<00:05:12.600> like<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.960> lot<00:05:13.140> more

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190
