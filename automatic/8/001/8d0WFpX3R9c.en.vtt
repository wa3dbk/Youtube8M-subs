00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:20.790 
going to talk about greasing the Machine

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.340 
going to talk about greasing the Machine
why<00:00:21.450> that's<00:00:21.690> important

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
why that's important

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.020 
why that's important
grease<00:00:23.480> gives<00:00:24.480> us<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.720> nice<00:00:25.700> smooth<00:00:26.700> surface

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.030 
grease gives us a nice smooth surface

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.780 
grease gives us a nice smooth surface
and<00:00:27.360> I<00:00:27.420> should<00:00:27.660> say<00:00:27.780> our<00:00:27.900> nice<00:00:28.080> larysa<00:00:28.770> T<00:00:29.010> so

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:29.790 
and I should say our nice larysa T so

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.370 
and I should say our nice larysa T so
that<00:00:29.820> our<00:00:30.090> joints<00:00:30.480> don't<00:00:30.570> stick<00:00:30.930> and<00:00:31.170> squeak

off before we pump grease in how much
grease<00:01:03.839> well<00:01:04.110> typically<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.070> you're<00:01:05.130> doing

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
grease well typically if you're doing

this<00:01:05.430> daily<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.970> you're<00:01:06.180> supposed<00:01:06.480> to<00:01:06.630> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
this daily like you're supposed to it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.660 
this daily like you're supposed to it
doesn't<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.800> more<00:01:07.980> than<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.160> couple<00:01:08.220> pumps

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
doesn't take more than a couple pumps

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950 
doesn't take more than a couple pumps
you<00:01:08.910> put<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> grease<00:01:09.300> gun<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.630> here

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
you put a grease gun on here

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.690 
you put a grease gun on here
you<00:01:10.230> give<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> couple<00:01:10.710> pumps<00:01:11.010> you're<00:01:11.580> going

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you give it a couple pumps you're going

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.180 
you give it a couple pumps you're going
to<00:01:11.760> hear<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:13.350> start<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.920> squeeze

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
to hear it or see it start to squeeze

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.650 
to hear it or see it start to squeeze
out<00:01:14.430> that's<00:01:14.730> all<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> need<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.540> need

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
out that's all you need you don't need

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.330 
out that's all you need you don't need
to<00:01:15.840> over<00:01:16.020> grease<00:01:16.410> I<00:01:16.560> see<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.980> a<00:01:17.010> lot<00:01:17.220> on

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to over grease I see that a lot on

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.950 
to over grease I see that a lot on
machines<00:01:17.640> where<00:01:17.790> people<00:01:18.060> over<00:01:18.450> grease<00:01:18.750> on

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
machines where people over grease on

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
machines where people over grease on
them<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.260> then<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.070> allows<00:01:20.310> dirt<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
them and then that just allows dirt and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.220 
them and then that just allows dirt and
dust<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.120> collect<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.660> grease<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 
dust to collect to that grease and

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.870 
dust to collect to that grease and
that's<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.980> good<00:01:23.160> thing<00:01:23.220> either<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.700> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that's not a good thing either so a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.940 
that's not a good thing either so a
couple<00:01:24.450> squirts<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.140> until<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> hear<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
couple squirts are until you hear it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.530 
couple squirts are until you hear it
start<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.370> leak<00:01:26.520> out<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.150> starts<00:01:27.390> leak

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
start to leak out or see it starts leak

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.540 
start to leak out or see it starts leak

so it's got the cylinder I know it's got

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.590 
so it's got the cylinder I know it's got
grease<00:02:26.520> zerks<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.940> then<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.120> have<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.390> same
