through the view on this monitor so

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.560 
through the view on this monitor so
there's<00:00:35.160> two<00:00:35.370> things<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.090> need<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.480> get

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
there's two things that you need to get

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810 
there's two things that you need to get
started<00:00:36.810> you<00:00:37.170> need<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> video<00:00:37.620> system<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> you

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
started you need a video system and you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.210 
started you need a video system and you
need<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> plane<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:40.020> video<00:00:40.290> system<00:00:40.710> has<00:00:40.920> three

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
need a plane the video system has three

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.990 
need a plane the video system has three
components<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.330> has<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.050> camera<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:44.100> video

transmitter and receiver these are

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.030 
transmitter and receiver these are
generally<00:00:47.640> sold<00:00:47.880> as<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> set<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.560> monitor<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
generally sold as a set and a monitor to

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.330 
generally sold as a set and a monitor to
watch<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.700> video<00:00:50.970> on<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.380> camera<00:00:53.070> sits

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
watch the video on so this camera sits

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.000 
watch the video on so this camera sits
on<00:00:53.490> your<00:00:53.610> plane<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.380> transmits<00:00:55.380> live<00:00:55.590> video

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
on your plane and transmits live video

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
on your plane and transmits live video
through<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.520> video<00:00:56.880> transmitter<00:00:57.540> that's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
through the video transmitter that's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440 
through the video transmitter that's
received<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.220> ground<00:00:59.550> by<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.000> video

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
received on the ground by the video

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.050 
received on the ground by the video
receiver<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.320> transmits<00:01:02.130> live<00:01:02.370> video<00:01:02.700> through

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
receiver a transmits live video through

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.490 
receiver a transmits live video through
the<00:01:03.120> monitor<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.470> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the monitor so you can see here that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
the monitor so you can see here that
this<00:01:04.829> monitor<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.309> showing<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.210> live<00:01:06.509> video

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
this monitor is showing the live video

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.090 
this monitor is showing the live video
that's<00:01:07.290> coming<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.430> camera<00:01:08.850> right<00:01:09.210> now

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
that's coming from this camera right now

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.950 
that's coming from this camera right now
so<00:01:11.100> aside<00:01:11.340> from<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.670> video<00:01:11.880> system<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.810> need

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
so aside from the video system you need

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.410 
so aside from the video system you need
a<00:01:13.020> plane<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.830> want<00:01:14.010> plants<00:01:14.340> easy<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.909> fly<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
a plane you want plants easy to fly that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.120 
a plane you want plants easy to fly that
you're<00:01:15.570> comfortable<00:01:16.050> with<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.470> generally

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
you're comfortable with and generally

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.039

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
has a clear view of the sky people use

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.840 
has a clear view of the sky people use
three<00:01:20.010> types<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.460> planes<00:01:21.020> usually<00:01:22.020> either<00:01:22.290> a

plane<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:51.630> systems<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.320> testing

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
plane I have two systems on be testing

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.899 
plane I have two systems on be testing
out<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.070> I've<00:01:53.130> got<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> couple<00:01:53.490> different

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
out and I've got a couple different

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.780 
out and I've got a couple different
antennas<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.229> my<00:01:55.409> next

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
antennas so that's going to be my next

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.130 
antennas so that's going to be my next
video<00:01:56.790> coming<00:01:57.150> out<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.630> want<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:57.960> what

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
video coming out I just want to see what

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.530 
video coming out I just want to see what
will<00:01:58.229> give<00:01:58.380> me<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.560> best<00:01:58.890> range<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.330> best

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
will give me the best range and the best

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.090 
will give me the best range and the best
video<00:02:00.810> quality<00:02:00.869> I'm<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.590> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.830> using

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
video quality I'm just going to be using

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.999 
video quality I'm just going to be using
my<00:02:03.000> dx7<00:02:03.750> right<00:02:03.900> now<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.409> RC<00:02:04.830> controller

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
my dx7 right now for my RC controller

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.100 
my dx7 right now for my RC controller
just<00:02:05.580> because<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.000> don't<00:02:06.210> want<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:06.540> too<00:02:06.869> long

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
just because I don't want to do too long

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.899 
just because I don't want to do too long
range<00:02:07.380> right<00:02:07.560> now<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> future<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.489> would

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909 
range right now in the future I would

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.809 
range right now in the future I would
like<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.330> do<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:09.599> though<00:02:10.009> overall<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.669> want

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
like to do that though overall you want

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.819 
like to do that though overall you want
to<00:02:11.909> be<00:02:11.969> really<00:02:12.209> careful<00:02:12.389> flying<00:02:12.989> fpv<00:02:13.499> it's<00:02:13.709> a

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
to be really careful flying fpv it's a

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.460 
to be really careful flying fpv it's a
big<00:02:13.980> investment<00:02:14.159> for<00:02:14.639> you<00:02:14.849> both<00:02:15.749> in<00:02:15.900> terms<00:02:16.019> of
