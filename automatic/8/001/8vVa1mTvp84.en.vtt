[News articles on Nico have addresses of the form http://news.nicovideo.jp/watch/nw[number]]

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.710
I was on Nico the other day

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.780
I was on Nico the other day
Uh-huh

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.510

and they had this news about a couple-only vending machine
Uh-huh

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.780
So, I got to thinking

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.780
would I be able to use it if I do side step repetitions?

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.380
I think you should just use a normal vending machine

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.380
I think you should just use a normal vending machine
You're right

Huh

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.580
As a result, more than 14.2 billion yen was sent to the disaster area

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.580
