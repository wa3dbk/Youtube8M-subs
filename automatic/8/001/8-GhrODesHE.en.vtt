00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.690
 Hello, I want to show you how 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.440
 fit 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:15.030
 such an elastic edge made of 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:21.300
 no crochet stubs 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:25.970
 below the product it is elastic and very 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.150
 comfortable when knitting various styles and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.150
 so for a start 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.320
 knitting 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:42.930
 first we will tie in with you 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:51.300
 fasten another loop further pro knit 2 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:55.730
 air loops then into the second loop from 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.559
 introduce the hook into it hook 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.280
 pick up a working thread and stretch it 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 through this loop on the hook with us 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.439
 formed two loops further nakid and 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 knit the first loop of the pod 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:21.030
 wrap up again and now knit 3 prize. 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.560
 this is how we already had 1 air 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.869
 loop and immediately on it a column without nakida 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.570
 further knit as follows 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.560
 you spook pigtails on the left side here 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:41.390
 such a loop was formed in her 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.369
 we will introduce a hook under the want thread 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.460
 stretch through this loop and on the hook 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.990
 we formed two loops on and on 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:56.549
 knit the first loop . 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.869
 on the hook 2 loop back and again 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.530
 knit two jump loops together and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.890
 now knitting 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:10.290
 We will repeat the hook in the side 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:13.450
 loop's pigtail sc 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.620
 we stretch through the non-thread on the hook two 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.730
 we knit loops again first 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.590
 first loop with a hook 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:29.890
 Next nakid and knit two loops 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:31.780
 together and repeat the loop 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.870
 which is on the left side 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.820
 pigtails introduce hook picks 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:42.850
 I pull the working thread through the loop on 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:46.920
 the hook we have formed two loops again 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:50.080
 nakid and knit the first loop . 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.410
 Next nakid and now provyazyvaem two 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.410
 peaks 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.030
 and so knit on there number of loops 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.910
 which is necessary for further 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:39.250
 knitting products if you need it 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:42.760
 everything will connect round the neatly 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.440
 We look to the chain we do not 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.300
 twisted not twisted 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.010
 and so that connect on the loop 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:57.940
 first loop 1 last join 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:02.470
 connecting loop and then continue 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:06.100
 knitting in a circle for the beginning of the row we 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.200
 do air further knit there how 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.020
 you need a pattern politov on 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.900
 column further continue without nakida 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:20.290
 turii then some other selected vary 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.600
 pattern if you do not need to connect in 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.200
 a circle, that is, knitting will not be circular 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.010
 then you knit loops for lifting 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.930
 for example for single crochet 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.500
 3 air loops are made further 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.690
 unfold the canvas and you will knit 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.730
 next loop with one double crochet 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:45.180
 and so you will continue to knit until the end 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.180
 row 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:57.050
 is it if you knit back and forth 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.710
 if in a circle, I showed you how 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.850
 you continue knitting 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:10.460
 I'm finishing up this on a screw 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.460
 goodbye and see you soon
