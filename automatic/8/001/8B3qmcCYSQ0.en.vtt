just<00:03:57.460> kind<00:03:57.610> of<00:03:57.730> put<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:57.940> right<00:03:58.150> down<00:04:02.370> picking

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
just kind of put it right down picking

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.320 
just kind of put it right down picking
them<00:04:03.460> up<00:04:03.580> lay<00:04:03.820> them<00:04:04.090> down

them up lay them down
fine<00:04:06.540> now<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.600> gas<00:04:07.960> tanks<00:04:08.470> we've<00:04:08.950> got<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.250> deal

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
fine now the gas tanks we've got to deal

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.820 
fine now the gas tanks we've got to deal
with<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.790> gas<00:04:10.300> tank<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:10.840> crisp<00:04:11.170> could<00:04:11.709> you

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
with the gas tank and crisp could you

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.250 
with the gas tank and crisp could you
explain<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.370> little<00:04:12.490> bit<00:04:12.730> more<00:04:13.060> about<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.050> gas

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
explain a little bit more about the gas

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.650 
explain a little bit more about the gas
tank<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.890> know<00:04:14.950> this<00:04:15.459> has<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.730> pressure<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.480> used

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
tank you know this has a pressure I used

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.310 
tank you know this has a pressure I used
you<00:04:17.140> explain<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.709> grip<00:04:18.010> well<00:04:18.790> back<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.660> know

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
you explain it grip well back you know

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.080 
you explain it grip well back you know
in<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> early<00:04:20.590> motors<00:04:21.130> they<00:04:21.280> use<00:04:21.459> gravity<00:04:22.000> to

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
in the early motors they use gravity to

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.270 
in the early motors they use gravity to
bring<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.900> gas<00:04:23.110> into<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.500> carburetor<00:04:23.770> if

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
bring the gas into the carburetor if

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.120 
bring the gas into the carburetor if
they<00:04:24.460> said<00:04:24.700> they<00:04:25.060> always<00:04:25.240> had<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.740> gas<00:04:26.740> tanks

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
they said they always had the gas tanks

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.370 
they said they always had the gas tanks
on<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.400> top<00:04:27.580> of<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.820> motors<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.930> some<00:04:29.230> of

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
on the top of the motors and some of

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.860 
on the top of the motors and some of
them<00:04:29.500> into<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.860> late<00:04:30.420> you<00:04:31.420> know<00:04:31.540> into<00:04:31.780> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
them into the late you know into the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.460 
them into the late you know into the
late<00:04:32.020> 50s<00:04:32.530> still<00:04:32.800> had<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.280> but<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.470> early

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
late 50s still had that but in the early

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.010 
late 50s still had that but in the early
50s<00:04:36.190> they<00:04:36.400> brought<00:04:36.610> on<00:04:36.790> a<00:04:36.820> new<00:04:37.240> system<00:04:37.990> that

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
50s they brought on a new system that

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.580 
50s they brought on a new system that
was<00:04:38.410> called<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.770> pressure<00:04:39.010> pressure<00:04:39.580> system

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
was called a pressure pressure system

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.860 
was called a pressure pressure system
and<00:04:41.590> they<00:04:41.770> had<00:04:42.010> two<00:04:42.340> lines<00:04:42.640> going<00:04:42.940> to<00:04:43.120> him<00:04:43.450> and

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
and they had two lines going to him and

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.680 
and they had two lines going to him and
one<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.770> them<00:04:44.890> is<00:04:45.040> is<00:04:45.280> air<00:04:45.940> and<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.360> other<00:04:46.480> one

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
one of them is is air and the other one

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.510 
one of them is is air and the other one
is<00:04:46.840> fuel<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.169> what<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:47.650> did<00:04:47.800> was<00:04:47.860> take<00:04:48.220> there's

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
is fuel and what it did was take there's

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.600 
is fuel and what it did was take there's
a<00:04:48.580> little<00:04:48.930> there's<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:49.990> little<00:04:50.290> diaphragm<00:04:51.250> in

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
a little there's a little diaphragm in

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.270 
a little there's a little diaphragm in
the<00:04:51.700> motor<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.660> put<00:04:52.870> air<00:04:53.080> down<00:04:53.380> through<00:04:54.250> one

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
the motor that put air down through one

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.370 
the motor that put air down through one
of<00:04:54.460> the<00:04:54.669> tanks<00:04:55.150> hurt<00:04:55.750> through<00:04:56.080> one<00:04:56.230> of<00:04:56.260> the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
of the tanks hurt through one of the

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.070 
of the tanks hurt through one of the
lines<00:04:56.620> into<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.610> tank<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.210> pressurize<00:04:58.780> the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
lines into the tank and pressurize the

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.909 
lines into the tank and pressurize the
tank<00:04:59.350> and<00:04:59.669> then<00:05:00.669> it<00:05:00.880> pushed<00:05:01.630> like<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.470> gas<00:05:02.680> out

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
tank and then it pushed like the gas out

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.670 
tank and then it pushed like the gas out
of<00:05:03.040> that<00:05:03.340> taken<00:05:03.820> into<00:05:03.970> the<00:05:04.150> engine<00:05:04.530> and<00:05:05.530> then

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
of that taken into the engine and then

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.630 
of that taken into the engine and then
in<00:05:05.800> 1961<00:05:06.640> Evinrude<00:05:07.980> Evinrude<00:05:08.980> changed<00:05:09.430> that

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
in 1961 Evinrude Evinrude changed that

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.240 
in 1961 Evinrude Evinrude changed that
and<00:05:09.960> there's<00:05:10.960> no<00:05:11.110> more<00:05:11.290> pressure<00:05:11.530> tanks<00:05:12.070> and

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
and there's no more pressure tanks and

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.340 
and there's no more pressure tanks and
they<00:05:12.310> went<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.550> a<00:05:12.640> one<00:05:12.850> line<00:05:13.060> system<00:05:13.630> with<00:05:14.229> the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
they went to a one line system with the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.620 
they went to a one line system with the
bulb<00:05:14.560> that<00:05:14.800> gave<00:05:15.640> it<00:05:15.820> you<00:05:16.000> know<00:05:16.120> that<00:05:16.330> primed

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
bulb that gave it you know that primed

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.780 
bulb that gave it you know that primed
it<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.050> then<00:05:17.650> they<00:05:17.800> had<00:05:17.950> fuel<00:05:18.220> pumps<00:05:18.520> on<00:05:18.640> them

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
it and then they had fuel pumps on them

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.820 
it and then they had fuel pumps on them
from<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:19.060> point<00:05:19.300> on<00:05:19.510> so<00:05:19.870> this<00:05:20.080> is<00:05:20.140> this<00:05:20.650> is

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
from that point on so this is this is

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.440 
from that point on so this is this is
still<00:05:21.070> one<00:05:21.250> that's<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.610> pressurized<00:05:22.120> tank

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
still one that's a pressurized tank

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.120 
still one that's a pressurized tank
system<00:05:22.870> that's<00:05:23.169> really<00:05:23.500> interesting

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
system that's really interesting

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.790 
system that's really interesting
we've<00:05:24.490> got<00:05:24.610> two<00:05:24.820> there's<00:05:25.690> Mary<00:05:25.990> daughter<00:05:26.470> Mary

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
we've got two there's Mary daughter Mary

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.630 
we've got two there's Mary daughter Mary
