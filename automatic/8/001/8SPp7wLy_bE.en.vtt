or above the incremental benefit from
eight<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.210> thirty<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.780> huge<00:00:39.290> so<00:00:39.710> as<00:00:39.830> long<00:00:39.920> as

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
eight to thirty is huge so as long as

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.670 
eight to thirty is huge so as long as
you're<00:00:40.160> using<00:00:40.190> 30<00:00:40.730> or<00:00:40.940> above<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.600> it<00:00:42.170> has<00:00:42.290> UVA

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
you're using 30 or above and it has UVA

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.200 
you're using 30 or above and it has UVA
and<00:00:43.070> UVB<00:00:43.190> coverage<00:00:44.120> then<00:00:45.160> to<00:00:46.160> me<00:00:46.340> you're<00:00:47.030> using

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
and UVB coverage then to me you're using

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.720 
and UVB coverage then to me you're using
the<00:00:47.480> right<00:00:47.600> sunscreen<00:00:48.290> but<00:00:48.829> it<00:00:48.980> is<00:00:49.340> hard<00:00:49.640> to

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
the right sunscreen but it is hard to

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.880 
the right sunscreen but it is hard to
use<00:00:49.969> sunscreen<00:00:50.270> correctly<00:00:51.079> so<00:00:51.440> you've<00:00:51.649> got<00:00:51.800> to

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
use sunscreen correctly so you've got to

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.500 
use sunscreen correctly so you've got to
remember<00:00:52.100> you've<00:00:52.370> got<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.520> put<00:00:52.789> it<00:00:52.910> on<00:00:53.090> about

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
remember you've got to put it on about

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.170 
remember you've got to put it on about
30<00:00:53.930> minutes<00:00:54.289> before<00:00:54.469> you<00:00:54.739> leave<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.520> home<00:00:55.700> you

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
30 minutes before you leave the home you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.090 
30 minutes before you leave the home you
want<00:00:56.360> to<00:00:56.450> put<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:56.750> on<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.230> let<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:57.469> be<00:00:57.649> and<00:00:57.920> then

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
want to put it on and let it be and then

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.430 
want to put it on and let it be and then
you<00:00:58.129> have<00:00:58.370> to<00:00:58.520> reapply<00:00:58.940> for<00:00:59.420> most<00:00:59.899> people<00:01:00.289> it's

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
you have to reapply for most people it's

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.319 
you have to reapply for most people it's
about<00:01:00.620> every<00:01:00.980> two<00:01:01.219> hours<00:01:01.250> but<00:01:01.910> some<00:01:02.059> people

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
about every two hours but some people

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.150 
about every two hours but some people
need<00:01:02.510> it<00:01:02.629> even<00:01:02.960> more<00:01:03.140> often<00:01:03.320> than<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.739> if

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
need it even more often than that if

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.920 
need it even more often than that if
you're<00:01:04.339> in<00:01:04.520> the<00:01:04.640> water<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.360> you're<00:01:05.539> exercising

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
you're in the water if you're exercising

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.680 
you're in the water if you're exercising
you<00:01:06.590> need<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:06.920> more<00:01:07.399> often<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:08.060> think<00:01:08.509> that's

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
you need it more often I think that's

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.300 
you need it more often I think that's
the<00:01:08.810> biggest<00:01:08.990> mistake<00:01:09.259> people<00:01:09.500> make<00:01:09.830> is<00:01:10.280> they

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
the biggest mistake people make is they

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.279 
the biggest mistake people make is they
they're<00:01:11.030> really<00:01:11.060> great<00:01:11.570> about<00:01:11.780> putting<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:12.170> on

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
they're really great about putting it on

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.200 
they're really great about putting it on
before<00:01:12.649> they<00:01:12.770> go<00:01:12.950> but<00:01:13.220> then<00:01:13.399> you're<00:01:13.910> having

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
before they go but then you're having

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.330 
before they go but then you're having
fun<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.020> all<00:01:15.590> of<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.710> sudden<00:01:15.740> it's<00:01:16.100> six

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
fun and and all of a sudden it's six

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.999 
fun and and all of a sudden it's six
hours<00:01:16.460> later<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.500> have<00:01:18.649> a<00:01:18.679> sunburn

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
hours later and and you have a sunburn

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.190 
hours later and and you have a sunburn
what<00:01:19.610> I<00:01:19.640> find<00:01:20.090> more<00:01:20.270> effective<00:01:20.569> and<00:01:20.990> easier

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
what I find more effective and easier

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.620 
what I find more effective and easier
frankly<00:01:21.979> are<00:01:22.220> really<00:01:22.640> what<00:01:22.819> we<00:01:22.940> call<00:01:23.179> barrier

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
frankly are really what we call barrier

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.100 
frankly are really what we call barrier
methods<00:01:24.170> which<00:01:24.410> means<00:01:24.709> Sun<00:01:25.130> shirts<00:01:25.520> hats<00:01:26.240> and

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
just covering up the other things is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.320 
just covering up the other things is
just<00:01:30.080> not<00:01:31.039> going<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.459> tanning<00:01:31.789> beds<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.300> be

honest with you I mean tanning beds are
intense<00:01:34.880> amount<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.530> UVA<00:01:36.530> rays<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.729> that's

intense amount of UVA rays and that's

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:39.940 
intense amount of UVA rays and that's
really<00:01:38.479> what<00:01:38.750> we're<00:01:38.929> trying<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.229> prevent<00:01:39.500> to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
sometimes ease of melanoma a is for

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.860 
sometimes ease of melanoma a is for
asymmetry<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.619> an<00:02:09.860> irregular<00:02:10.399> mole<00:02:10.450> B<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.599> for

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
asymmetry so an irregular mole B is for

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.410 
asymmetry so an irregular mole B is for
borders<00:02:12.500> so<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.040> borders<00:02:13.370> don't<00:02:13.670> look<00:02:13.819> clear

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
borders so the borders don't look clear

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.440 
borders so the borders don't look clear
c<00:02:15.319> is<00:02:15.410> for<00:02:15.440> color<00:02:16.099> so<00:02:16.550> variations<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.300> color

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
c is for color so variations in color

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.140 
c is for color so variations in color
within<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.020> mole<00:02:18.349> D<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.099> for<00:02:19.310> diameter<00:02:19.610> if<00:02:20.030> you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
within the mole D is for diameter if you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.580 
within the mole D is for diameter if you
have<00:02:20.270> a<00:02:20.300> mole<00:02:20.569> that's<00:02:20.870> greater<00:02:21.140> than<00:02:21.319> five

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
have a mole that's greater than five

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.770 
have a mole that's greater than five
millimeters<00:02:22.250> which<00:02:22.910> is<00:02:22.940> about<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.300> quarter<00:02:23.570> of

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
millimeters which is about a quarter of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.210 
millimeters which is about a quarter of
an<00:02:23.930> inch<00:02:24.110> he<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:24.920> for<00:02:25.130> evolution<00:02:25.700> so

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
an inch he is for evolution so

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.520 
an inch he is for evolution so
an<00:02:26.280> area<00:02:26.610> that's<00:02:26.850> changing<00:02:27.390> over<00:02:27.600> time<00:02:27.990> so<00:02:28.440> it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
an area that's changing over time so it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.620 
an area that's changing over time so it
may<00:02:28.680> have<00:02:28.800> looked<00:02:29.430> pretty<00:02:29.760> normal<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.510> then

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
may have looked pretty normal and then

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.800 
may have looked pretty normal and then
starts<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.200> change<00:02:31.470> seeing<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.490> dermatologist

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
starts to change seeing a dermatologist

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.790 
starts to change seeing a dermatologist
especially<00:02:33.810> if<00:02:33.900> you're<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.170> high-risk

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
especially if you're in that high-risk

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.730 
especially if you're in that high-risk
population<00:02:35.550> is<00:02:35.820> very<00:02:36.180> important<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.170> even

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
population is very important and even

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.800 
population is very important and even
many<00:02:38.250> primary<00:02:38.520> care<00:02:38.760> doctors<00:02:39.270> are<00:02:39.450> actually

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
many primary care doctors are actually

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.510 
many primary care doctors are actually
very<00:02:40.050> good<00:02:40.140> at<00:02:40.470> looking<00:02:40.620> at<00:02:40.890> people's<00:02:41.190> skin

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
very good at looking at people's skin

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.760 
very good at looking at people's skin
and<00:02:41.790> knowing<00:02:42.300> what's<00:02:43.020> happen<00:02:43.260> or<00:02:43.410> Milland

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
what's not get into the gown everyone

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.720 
what's not get into the gown everyone

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
to the doctor's office but if you don't

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.840 
to the doctor's office but if you don't
no<00:02:49.770> one's<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.130> to<00:02:50.160> look<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.610> no<00:02:50.670> one's

going to see those areas that you may
miss<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:53.730> your<00:02:53.910> back<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.450> your<00:02:54.570> use<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.960> you
