so that people can see underneath it at

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.590 
so that people can see underneath it at
a<00:00:49.320> table<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.910> recommend<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.480> using

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
a table so I recommend not using

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990 
a table so I recommend not using
anything<00:00:52.380> lower<00:00:52.740> than<00:00:52.860> 20<00:00:53.340> inches<00:00:53.490> these

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
anything lower than 20 inches these

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.480 
anything lower than 20 inches these
happen<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.480> 24<00:00:55.200> inches<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.800> think<00:00:56.250> that's

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
happen to be 24 inches I think that's

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.540 
happen to be 24 inches I think that's
the<00:00:56.820> magic<00:00:57.210> number<00:00:57.240> for<00:00:57.750> me<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:59.070> can<00:00:59.220> even<00:00:59.370> go

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
the magic number for me you can even go

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.090 
the magic number for me you can even go
higher<00:00:59.940> than<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.450> 24<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
higher than this but 24 for me is the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.270 
higher than this but 24 for me is the
lowest<00:01:02.490> I<00:01:02.610> ever<00:01:02.790> want<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:04.830> if<00:01:05.040> I'm

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
lowest I ever want to go so if I'm

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
lowest I ever want to go so if I'm
arranging<00:01:05.820> flowers<00:01:05.999> in<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:07.049> vase<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
arranging flowers in this vase that

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
arranging flowers in this vase that
means<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.310> there's<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.149> be

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
means that there's only going to be

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
means that there's only going to be
three<00:01:09.749> or<00:01:09.780> four<00:01:09.899> stems<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.649> flowers<00:01:10.679> and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.060 
three or four stems of flowers and
typically<00:01:11.759> I<00:01:11.789> like<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> use<00:01:12.630> orchids<00:01:13.289> in<00:01:13.469> these

you're done remember that when you leave
the<00:02:07.979> same<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.459> has<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.880> happen<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.240> have<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
the same thing has to happen you have to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.179 
the same thing has to happen you have to
take<00:02:09.569> those<00:02:09.720> flowers<00:02:09.959> out<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.769> that<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.039> can

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:11.189 
take those flowers out so that you can

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:13.729 
take those flowers out so that you can

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
cannot take them away

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.390 
cannot take them away
fully<00:02:15.300> assembled<00:02:15.810> either<00:02:15.960> if<00:02:16.320> you<00:02:17.160> want

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
fully assembled either if you want

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.260 
fully assembled either if you want
something<00:02:17.850> bigger

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
something bigger

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.990 
something bigger
for<00:02:18.990> example<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.950> type<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.310> an<00:02:20.580> arrangement

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
for example this type of an arrangement

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.780 
for example this type of an arrangement
can<00:02:21.330> also<00:02:21.600> sit<00:02:22.200> on<00:02:22.440> top<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.190> skinny<00:02:23.490> vase

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
can also sit on top of this skinny vase

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.280 
can also sit on top of this skinny vase
but<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.240> have<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.690> something<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.140> make

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
but you have to do something to make

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.800 
but you have to do something to make
that<00:02:25.530> work<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.670> I've<00:02:26.970> created<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.750> little

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that work so I've created this little

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.610 
that work so I've created this little
what<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.320> call<00:02:28.410> adapter<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.720> six<00:02:31.350> inch

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
what I call adapter it's a six inch

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.370 
what I call adapter it's a six inch
floral<00:02:32.370> dish<00:02:32.610> these<00:02:33.150> are<00:02:33.330> called<00:02:33.510> lomi<00:02:33.840> dishes

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
floral dish these are called lomi dishes

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.430 
floral dish these are called lomi dishes
and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.250> used<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.970> riser<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.630> I've<00:02:36.960> glued<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
and I used a riser that I've glued to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.920 
and I used a riser that I've glued to
the<00:02:37.530> bottom<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.070> cut<00:02:38.340> short<00:02:38.730> this<00:02:39.510> fits

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
the bottom and I cut short this fits

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.340 
the bottom and I cut short this fits
right<00:02:40.290> inside<00:02:40.590> it's<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:41.760> perfect<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.140> that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
right inside it's just perfect so that

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920 
right inside it's just perfect so that
now<00:02:43.620> gives<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.510> floral<00:02:45.510> arrangement

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
now gives this floral arrangement

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.250 
now gives this floral arrangement
stability<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.710> then<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.790> would<00:02:48.180> design<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
stability and then I would design the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.170 
stability and then I would design the
arrangement<00:02:49.890> something<00:02:50.250> similar<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.760> this<00:02:50.940> in

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
arrangement something similar to this in

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.080 
arrangement something similar to this in
a<00:02:51.600> six<00:02:52.140> inch<00:02:52.380> dish<00:02:52.800> just<00:02:53.190> like<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:53.910> that's

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
a six inch dish just like the one that's

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.900 
a six inch dish just like the one that's
already<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.750> here<00:02:55.050> for<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> adapter<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.040> then

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
already in here for the adapter and then

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.620 
already in here for the adapter and then
you<00:02:57.090> put<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.510> right<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.620> up<00:02:59.090> the<00:03:00.090> six-inch

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
you put that right on to up the six-inch

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.810 
you put that right on to up the six-inch
dish<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.350> designed<00:03:01.800> in<00:03:02.010> will<00:03:02.459> fit

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
dish that you just designed in will fit

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.060 
dish that you just designed in will fit
directly<00:03:03.180> into<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> six-inch<00:03:04.320> dish<00:03:04.620> that's

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
directly into the six-inch dish that's

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.460 
directly into the six-inch dish that's
part<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.580> adapter<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.810> again<00:03:07.110> you<00:03:07.290> do

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
part of this adapter so again you do

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
part of this adapter so again you do
this<00:03:07.620> once<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.190> arrive<00:03:08.550> on<00:03:08.580> site<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.270> don't
