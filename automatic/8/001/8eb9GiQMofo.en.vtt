using<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> pickle<00:00:42.690> fork<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.930> use<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.350> right

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
using a pickle fork so I use this right

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.709 
using a pickle fork so I use this right
here<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.430> slides<00:00:47.760> nicely<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.390> there<00:00:48.539> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
here which slides nicely in there and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.459 
here which slides nicely in there and
then<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.840> pushes<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.820> arm<00:00:50.820> off<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.469> ball

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
then just pushes the arm off of the ball

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.250 
then just pushes the arm off of the ball
joint<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:54.000> bushing<00:00:54.360> press<00:00:54.809> straight<00:00:55.050> out

this<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.649> was<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> problem<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:03.470> ahead

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
this one was a problem and I ahead

this one was a problem and I ahead
here's<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.830> old<00:01:04.949> bushing<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> steel

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
here's the old bushing with a steel

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
here's the old bushing with a steel
sleeve<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.930> steel<00:01:07.260> sleeve<00:01:07.590> has<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
sleeve on it that steel sleeve has to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.710 
sleeve on it that steel sleeve has to
come<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.340> there<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> new<00:01:09.270> bushing

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
come out of there for the new bushing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.630 
come out of there for the new bushing
kit<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> work<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.159> found<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.580> 27<00:01:13.640> millimeter

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
kit to work and I found a 27 millimeter

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.960 
kit to work and I found a 27 millimeter
3/4<00:01:15.630> drive<00:01:15.869> socket<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:17.189> works<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.759> fine

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
3/4 drive socket that works just fine

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
3/4 drive socket that works just fine
for<00:01:18.270> pushing<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:19.759> use<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.710> press<00:01:22.710> back

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
for pushing that out I use a press back

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.190 
for pushing that out I use a press back
here<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:24.900> set<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.640> these

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
here to set that in there on these

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.800 
here to set that in there on these
pressure<00:01:28.200> armors<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.270> push<00:01:30.270> down<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> it

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
pressure armors and push down and it

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.499 
pressure armors and push down and it
took<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> lot<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> pressure<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.420> I'm

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
took a lot of pressure to do that so I'm

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.230 
took a lot of pressure to do that so I'm
warning<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.680> know<00:01:34.799> take<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> shop

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
warning you you know take it to a shop

if you don't have a press I know guys
have<00:01:38.640> done<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.880> put<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> socket<00:01:40.140> like<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.680> on

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
have done this put a socket like this on

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.190 
have done this put a socket like this on
here<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.729> bigger<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.299> on<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.600> back<00:01:42.810> and

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
here and a bigger one on the back and

here and a bigger one on the back and
then<00:01:43.590> run<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> bolt<00:01:44.159> through<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.880> just

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
then run a bolt through there and just

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
then run a bolt through there and just
tighten<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.509> down<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.079> force<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
tighten it down and kind of force this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
tighten it down and kind of force this
through<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.700> boy<00:01:47.880> I'll<00:01:48.030> tell<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.360> I

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
through there but boy I'll tell you I

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
through there but boy I'll tell you I
don't<00:01:48.540> think<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.990> would<00:01:49.140> work<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
don't think that would work with it the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.319 
don't think that would work with it the
amount<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> pressure<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.549> put<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.210> that's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
amount of pressure I put on here that's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.969 
amount of pressure I put on here that's
a<00:01:51.479> 20<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.470> 20<00:01:52.920> ton<00:01:53.159> Jack<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.060> had<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.890> know

a 20 on a 20 ton Jack and I had you know
what<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> pressure<00:01:57.240> on<00:01:57.479> air<00:01:57.719> tonnage<00:01:58.340> so

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
what a bit of pressure on air tonnage so

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.609 
what a bit of pressure on air tonnage so
that's<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> end<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.810> video<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> next

one<00:02:01.799> I'll<00:02:01.890> show<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> kit<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:05.060> bought

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
one I'll show you the kit that I bought

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
one I'll show you the kit that I bought
to<00:02:06.299> replace<00:02:06.329> these<00:02:06.960> bushings

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
to replace these bushings

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.270 
to replace these bushings
and<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.049> upper<00:02:10.649> bushing<00:02:11.069> where

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
and you can see this upper bushing where

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.210 
and you can see this upper bushing where
the<00:02:11.400> camber<00:02:11.849> bolt<00:02:12.090> goes<00:02:12.390> was<00:02:13.200> pretty<00:02:13.530> loose<00:02:13.799> it

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
the camber bolt goes was pretty loose it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
the camber bolt goes was pretty loose it
was<00:02:14.689> getting<00:02:15.689> a<00:02:15.720> little<00:02:15.810> bit<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.170> front-end

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
was getting a little bit of front-end

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.979 
was getting a little bit of front-end
shimmy<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.099> there<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.569> had<00:02:18.780> already

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
shimmy up there and I had already

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.520 
shimmy up there and I had already
replaced<00:02:19.709> my<00:02:20.099> steering<00:02:20.909> idler<00:02:21.299> arm<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:22.909> I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
replaced my steering idler arm and I

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.860 
replaced my steering idler arm and I
thought<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.799> was<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.010> problem<00:02:26.750> because<00:02:27.750> I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
thought that was the problem because I
