hey guys I'm getting ready to install my

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.980 
hey guys I'm getting ready to install my
Pro<00:00:02.490> Sport<00:00:02.550> gauge<00:00:03.179> and<00:00:03.480> just<00:00:03.629> wanted<00:00:03.899> to

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
Pro Sport gauge and just wanted to

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.499 
Pro Sport gauge and just wanted to
provide<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.799> as<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.640> helpful<00:00:06.180> guide

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
provide this video as a helpful guide

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.909 
provide this video as a helpful guide
for<00:00:06.839> people<00:00:06.990> who<00:00:07.230> are<00:00:07.319> looking<00:00:07.560> to<00:00:07.680> do<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
for people who are looking to do the

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.919 
for people who are looking to do the
same<00:00:07.950> I've<00:00:08.910> actually<00:00:09.090> never<00:00:09.389> installed<00:00:09.870> a

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
same I've actually never installed a

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.709 
same I've actually never installed a
gauge<00:00:10.110> before<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.250> this<00:00:11.690> might<00:00:12.690> not

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
gauge before so some of this might not

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.340 
gauge before so some of this might not
be<00:00:12.900> how<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.349> would<00:00:13.590> do<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:14.599> parts<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:16.260> I've

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
be how you would do it parts that I've

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.990 
be how you would do it parts that I've
assembled<00:00:16.650> here<00:00:16.920> may<00:00:17.100> not<00:00:17.130> actually<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.760> used

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
assembled here may not actually be used

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.359 
assembled here may not actually be used
but<00:00:18.869> based<00:00:19.199> on<00:00:19.410> my<00:00:19.470> assessment<00:00:19.920> of<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
but based on my assessment of the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.340 
but based on my assessment of the
instructions<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.510> from<00:00:21.720> talking<00:00:21.900> with<00:00:22.109> other

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
instructions and from talking with other

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.740 
instructions and from talking with other
members<00:00:22.710> online<00:00:22.970> it<00:00:23.970> looks<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.390> these<00:00:24.570> are

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
members online it looks like these are

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.170 
members online it looks like these are
some<00:00:25.080> pretty<00:00:25.289> basic<00:00:26.150> necessities<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
some pretty basic necessities that

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.080 
some pretty basic necessities that
you're<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.570> need<00:00:28.939> starting<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.060> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the way inside the car so I've bought

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.180 
the way inside the car so I've bought
the<00:01:00.210> same<00:01:00.390> diameter<00:01:00.719> sized<00:01:01.050> hose<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.859> if

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the same diameter sized hose here and if

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
the same diameter sized hose here and if
we<00:01:02.309> need<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> connect<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> tube<00:01:03.149> we're<00:01:03.539> gonna

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
we need to connect the tube we're gonna

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.929 
we need to connect the tube we're gonna
use<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.989> adapter<00:01:04.909> unfortunately<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
use this adapter unfortunately I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
use this adapter unfortunately I
couldn't<00:01:06.270> find<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.659> hose<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:06.990> was<00:01:07.140> longer<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
couldn't find a hose that was longer I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.710 
couldn't find a hose that was longer I
would<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.100> preferred<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.000> rather

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
would have preferred to have that rather

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
would have preferred to have that rather
than<00:01:09.960> use<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.200> connector<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.460> we'll<00:01:11.700> see<00:01:11.850> how

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
than use a connector but we'll see how

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.600 
than use a connector but we'll see how
it<00:01:12.000> goes<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:13.280> then<00:01:14.280> there's<00:01:14.460> some

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
it goes and then there's some

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.520 
it goes and then there's some

it<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.380> ECU<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.759> you're<00:01:38.909> going<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it to the ECU I think you're going to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.319 
it to the ECU I think you're going to
use<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.479> other<00:01:39.659> colors<00:01:40.079> besides<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.950> black

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
use the other colors besides the black

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.740 
use the other colors besides the black
the<00:01:42.329> black<00:01:42.509> being<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> grounding<00:01:44.750> this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the black being for the grounding this

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.270 
the black being for the grounding this
is<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> actual<00:01:46.409> boost<00:01:46.740> sensor<00:01:48.049> if<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.890> plan

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
is the actual boost sensor if you plan

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
is the actual boost sensor if you plan
to<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.610> guess<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.149> call<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> daisy<00:01:51.720> chain

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to I guess they call it daisy chain

to I guess they call it daisy chain
another<00:01:52.380> gauge<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.390> ahead<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
another gauge you can go ahead and

another gauge you can go ahead and
connect<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.670> gauge

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
connect this to the back of this gauge
