00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.420 
different between the spawn and your
normal<00:02:19.270> rate<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:20.320> major<00:02:20.560> thing<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.070> different

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
normal rate one major thing is different

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.950 
normal rate one major thing is different
is<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.790> interior<00:02:22.390> on<00:02:22.630> it

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
is the interior on it

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.500 
is the interior on it
there<00:02:23.890> is<00:02:24.070> no<00:02:24.280> seats<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.970> one's<00:02:25.180> kind<00:02:25.480> of

there is no seats this one's kind of

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.920 
there is no seats this one's kind of
like<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> Yeti<00:02:26.020> it's<00:02:26.560> got<00:02:26.860> a<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.930> molded

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
like the Yeti it's got a a just a molded

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.610 
like the Yeti it's got a a just a molded
in<00:02:32.080> body<00:02:33.120> your<00:02:34.120> guys<00:02:34.300> in<00:02:34.630> here<00:02:34.840> there's<00:02:35.380> just<00:02:35.530> a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
in body your guys in here there's just a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.030 
in body your guys in here there's just a
screw<00:02:35.890> in<00:02:36.070> piece<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.390> mean<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.350> it's<00:02:41.980> a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
screw in piece so I mean it's it's a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.010 
screw in piece so I mean it's it's a
range<00:02:42.250> minus<00:02:42.670> panels<00:02:43.060> they<00:02:43.390> put<00:02:43.570> your<00:02:43.720> body<00:02:43.930> on

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
range minus panels they put your body on

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.350 
range minus panels they put your body on
it<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.470> really<00:02:45.100> like<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.640> body<00:02:45.820> it's<00:02:46.180> not<00:02:46.240> a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
it I really like the body it's not a

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.750 
it I really like the body it's not a
licensed<00:02:46.810> body<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.950> makes<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.250> kit<00:02:48.430> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
licensed body so it makes the kit the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.930 
licensed body so it makes the kit the
RTR<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.450> little<00:02:49.720> cheaper<00:02:50.050> not<00:02:50.200> doing<00:02:50.410> license

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
RTR a little cheaper not doing license

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.550 
RTR a little cheaper not doing license
so<00:02:51.940> let's<00:02:52.330> get<00:02:52.450> into<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> few<00:02:52.870> things<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.350> don't

so let's get into a few things I don't

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.580 
so let's get into a few things I don't
really<00:02:53.770> care<00:02:54.100> for<00:02:54.160> on<00:02:54.520> this<00:02:55.110> one<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.200> them<00:02:56.410> is

number two thing I don't like on here is

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.410 
number two thing I don't like on here is
the<00:04:38.530> way<00:04:38.650> they<00:04:38.830> got<00:04:38.920> this<00:04:39.100> ESC<00:04:39.580> mounted<00:04:39.970> as<00:04:40.210> you

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
the way they got this ESC mounted as you

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.540 
the way they got this ESC mounted as you
can<00:04:40.570> see<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:41.170> just<00:04:41.200> wobbles<00:04:42.010> around<00:04:42.100> in<00:04:42.370> there

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
can see it just wobbles around in there

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.850 
can see it just wobbles around in there
I<00:04:42.990> don't<00:04:43.990> know<00:04:44.170> if<00:04:44.260> you<00:04:44.320> can<00:04:44.470> see<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.680> from<00:04:44.770> the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
I don't know if you can see it from the

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.480 
I don't know if you can see it from the
bottom<00:04:45.870> but<00:04:46.870> see<00:04:47.350> if<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.680> you've<00:04:48.220> got<00:04:48.370> to

bottom but see if I can you've got to

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.760 
bottom but see if I can you've got to
sit<00:04:48.730> there<00:04:48.930> nobody<00:04:49.930> get<00:04:50.020> my<00:04:50.170> camera<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.620> zoom

sit there nobody get my camera to zoom
in<00:04:50.980> on<00:04:51.010> it<00:04:53.520> there<00:04:54.520> we<00:04:54.610> go<00:04:56.010> right<00:04:57.300> there

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
in on it there we go right there

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.710 
in on it there we go right there
there<00:05:00.250> is<00:05:00.370> actually<00:05:00.760> a<00:05:00.790> on/off<00:05:01.420> switch<00:05:01.690> right

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
there is actually a on/off switch right

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.780 
there is actually a on/off switch right
here<00:05:02.080> which<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.560> kind<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.890> a<00:05:03.010> pain<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.280> get<00:05:03.550> to

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
here which is kind of a pain to get to

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.580 
here which is kind of a pain to get to
I'm<00:05:04.060> not<00:05:04.210> really<00:05:04.420> sure<00:05:04.690> why<00:05:04.900> they<00:05:04.930> mounted<00:05:05.500> it

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
I'm not really sure why they mounted it

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.430 
I'm not really sure why they mounted it
like<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:06.120> it's<00:05:07.120> this<00:05:07.660> whole<00:05:07.810> plate<00:05:08.140> that<00:05:08.320> the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
like that it's this whole plate that the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.250 
like that it's this whole plate that the
CSC<00:05:08.890> is<00:05:08.950> mounted<00:05:09.370> on<00:05:09.810> if<00:05:10.810> I<00:05:10.960> can<00:05:11.050> get<00:05:11.140> that

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
CSC is mounted on if I can get that

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.820 
CSC is mounted on if I can get that
closer<00:05:11.590> maybe<00:05:12.190> give<00:05:12.430> you<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> better<00:05:12.760> view<00:05:13.830> that

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
closer maybe give you a better view that

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.820 
closer maybe give you a better view that
whole<00:05:15.010> ESC<00:05:15.730> that<00:05:15.880> it's<00:05:16.030> mounted<00:05:16.180> on<00:05:16.830> that

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
whole ESC that it's mounted on that

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.860 
whole ESC that it's mounted on that
plate<00:05:18.130> it's<00:05:18.580> held<00:05:19.000> on<00:05:19.090> with<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:19.420> one<00:05:19.600> screw

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
plate it's held on with this one screw

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.960 
plate it's held on with this one screw
down<00:05:20.020> here<00:05:20.230> at<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.380> bottom<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:21.790> just

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
down here at the bottom and it just

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.620 
down here at the bottom and it just
allows<00:05:22.210> that<00:05:22.390> just<00:05:22.690> a<00:05:22.840> flip-flop<00:05:23.620> in<00:05:23.800> turn<00:05:24.630> I'm

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
allows that just a flip-flop in turn I'm

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.450 
allows that just a flip-flop in turn I'm
just<00:05:25.900> not<00:05:26.260> a<00:05:26.290> fan<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:27.070> mean<00:05:27.220> that's

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
just not a fan of that I mean that's

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.260 
just not a fan of that I mean that's
just<00:05:27.730> kind<00:05:28.090> of<00:05:28.180> crappy<00:05:29.670> if<00:05:30.670> I'm<00:05:30.850> bouncing

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
just kind of crappy if I'm bouncing

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.700 
just kind of crappy if I'm bouncing
across<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.660> rocks<00:05:31.900> and<00:05:32.110> stuff<00:05:32.290> I<00:05:32.410> don't<00:05:32.590> want

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
across the rocks and stuff I don't want

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.200 
across the rocks and stuff I don't want
this<00:05:32.800> thing<00:05:32.860> flip-flopping<00:05:33.670> around<00:05:33.730> in<00:05:34.060> here

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
this thing flip-flopping around in here

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.350 
this thing flip-flopping around in here
like<00:05:34.240> crazy<00:05:35.220> so<00:05:36.220> that's<00:05:36.700> gonna<00:05:36.820> be<00:05:36.910> fine<00:05:37.180> at<00:05:37.330> a

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
like crazy so that's gonna be fine at a

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.760 
like crazy so that's gonna be fine at a
new<00:05:37.480> position<00:05:37.660> in<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.170> new<00:05:38.290> home<00:05:40.680> it's<00:05:41.680> probably

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
new position in a new home it's probably

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.290 
new position in a new home it's probably
gonna<00:05:42.070> go<00:05:42.220> back<00:05:42.400> here<00:05:42.610> where<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.000> battery

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
gonna go back here where the battery

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.190 
gonna go back here where the battery
tray<00:05:43.480> is<00:05:44.130> this<00:05:45.130> receiver<00:05:45.520> box<00:05:45.790> I'm<00:05:46.600> yanking<00:05:47.050> it

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
tray is this receiver box I'm yanking it

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.710 
tray is this receiver box I'm yanking it
it's<00:05:47.830> coming<00:05:48.130> back<00:05:48.250> here<00:05:48.490> to<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.670> bag<00:05:48.850> when<00:05:49.690> I

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
it's coming back here to the bag when I

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.470 
it's coming back here to the bag when I
move<00:05:49.900> this<00:05:50.080> battery<00:05:50.440> up<00:05:50.530> here<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.860> front

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
move this battery up here to the front

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.730 
move this battery up here to the front
that'll<00:05:52.480> empty<00:05:52.720> up<00:05:52.840> this<00:05:52.960> whole<00:05:53.170> front<00:05:53.440> end<00:05:53.590> up

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
that'll empty up this whole front end up

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.260 
that'll empty up this whole front end up
here<00:05:53.980> and<00:05:54.130> I'll<00:05:54.190> probably<00:05:54.370> put<00:05:54.550> a<00:05:54.610> servo<00:05:55.000> style

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
here and I'll probably put a servo style

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.940 
here and I'll probably put a servo style
winch<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:56.020> there<00:05:56.200> instead<00:05:56.320> of<00:05:56.560> buying<00:05:56.770> a

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
winch in there instead of buying a

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.500
