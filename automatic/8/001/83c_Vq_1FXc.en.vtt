00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:16.199
 Hey everyone, how are you? 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.750
 select new here with you today to there 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.329
 one more milestone in the answer did not respond to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.970
 a question from my friend marcos paulo 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.339
 he asked me so, mark went well 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.300
 succinctly the first disc of a band 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.439
 how to proceed and how to proceed and frames 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.750
 what I can say to you is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.970
 next, it's early the band a band 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.769
 beginner musician 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.449
 I really do not know what quality you have 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.780
 I do not know how much time you play either. 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.239
 but let's just say so is what we 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.030
 Can you see today in Brazil different from 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.430
 some time ago you spend a lot 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 money studio nowadays you already 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.430
 is producing things and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.710
 studios that have a lower cost 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.809
 say so because today you do not have 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.090
 that need for you to get into a 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.970
 study that has a gigantic table 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.729
 manual today you have everything digital then 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.580
 Can you with a good computer and you? 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.289
 start to center everything there is you already 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.990
 need not look for a study that has 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:18.780
 A gigantic table is talking because in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.330
 In terms of Brazil, the cost is still 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.729
 very loud for us musicians who do not 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.190
 We do not have any sponsorship. 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.039
 participate in a large band or 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.289
 Let's say let's not say that 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.110
 our work is but the vast majority 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.020
 of people see smaller songs 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.360
 that way, let's say your band already 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.179
 has a certain color like say a 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 Identity Everyone Knows What They Want 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.399
 record all know what kind of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.890
 music that the band does all know 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.470
 The way the band wants to follow is good. 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.440
 before entering the studio to record 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.929
 you are aware of all the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.590
 songs you want to record and 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.289
 be musically intertwined in the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.780
 you have been sanitized to 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.349
 minimize the cost of studio hours 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.910
 something else to do is 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.270
 reformulated and formed smaller than one 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.040
 stop songs that are too big 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.310
 songs that are too small for 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.060
 do not stand out from the context of the cd that you 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.990
 they want to do 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.600
 generally good are you 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.310
 - one with a certain time is of each 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.410
 Music is no use, you make a song. 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.180
 a minute and a half and then make a 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.770
 six-minute music 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.410
 songs must have more or less 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.290
 certain size something else is also 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.520
 very important to do is to be 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.820
 with all 2 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.290
 now regulated instruments made one 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:50.200
 survey is the one to check out in the tiÃ£o before 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.540
 right has no tuning problems have not 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.550
 problem of the nation things like this 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.010
 something else that you should do 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.500
 check the cars to see if they do not 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.510
 the noise does not have a hiss it does not have a ramie 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.430
 also in part of the day has already included 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.110
 it is more to see the grounding of 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.330
 instruments not to reach the study 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.130
 make unwanted noise something else 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.800
 it is also that if you are leading 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.140
 more seriously do not you have a contact 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.750
 of a producer to talk to other 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.730
 people from other bands of the same style 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.730
 who have more knowledge than 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.950
 You guys so you can come and get 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.680
 You do not have any doubts. 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.590
 study cross and talk so look I came 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.150
 to record all right you know if already 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.960
 entered the studio where he knows how to 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.020
 it works 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.420
 I already recorded it today, you'll do it right. 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.850
 usually you do some sessions 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.280
 it's nothing at all recorded at once 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.680
 knows how to record the instruments of 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.320
 independently and then it will be 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.190
 they all start to be placed 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.260
 together in the mix and then the engineer 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.180
 sound is the producer starts to work 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.850
 together there to see what they want to take 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.240
 this file it cuts it takes or 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.460
 hit and then it will be mastered to 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.500
 have the final edit 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.170
 So, but I hope I have 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.540
 Gotta answer what you told me. 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.240
 asked if I hope I could help 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.370
 and hope my tips have help 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.680
 in something and once again I'm 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.600
 open for whatever you want to ask 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.500
 that's how you all are 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.990
 watching videos 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.430
 A big hug to everyone. 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.430
 together and you're laughing
