00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:17.680
 pursed glass and finger all mobile face 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:20.080
 cookies on glafi.com and hello to all 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.050
 friends with you again I husky rusher and 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.169
 today let's talk about the tank Jagdpanther it 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.269
 tank of the seventh level Fri-Sau 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:31.720
 What is the style of the game on this tank? 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.570
 many people think that this is the usual typical 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.600
 play style signed 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.379
 bush and nastrerivat on light 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.829
 but these friends are wrong with us here for both 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:48.070
 for fri-sau there are gorgeous filigree 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.550
 the lowest dynamics is 55 kilometers 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.440
 per hour maximum speed of our tank 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.809
 what does it tell us that we can 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.850
 move on maps and with impunity 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.519
 without light just because of its 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.800
 good speakers roll away 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.220
 to a place convenient for us and profitable 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.490
 positions so friends on yak panther not 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.340
 it's worth standing in one place and waiting for now 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.189
 someone will enlighten someone there 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.650
 better little by little 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.479
 advance and implement our dpm 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.180
 by the way about the smoke 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.780
 he is very good here we have average 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.540
 damage 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.689
 normal projectile and subcaliber 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.790
 is 310 units dont try us 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.100
 makes ordinary would be a mad projectile 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.200
 200 millimeters and subscale already 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.500
 punch as many as two hundred and forty-four 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.509
 so remember when i played this tank on 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.360
 seventh levels lugs enough 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.009
 completely and the tank thanks to its not 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.340
 Gold dependency so to speak 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.890
 very good farm and not noticed 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.719
 so that after the fight the turnout went some 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.079
 very good minus 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.700
 combat against such tanks as level 9 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.869
 there are eighth levels even if i 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.869
 used gold 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.270
 then I did not go into such a rough minus I 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.280
 left between the pros and cons but that is 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.750
 either to zero or with some small 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.450
 plus but this so that I have 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.130
 were the roughest minuses of 20-30 thousand on 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.820
 I did not notice this tank 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:19.580
 so friends are a good tank and I tell you all 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.400
 I advise you to use it correctly 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.830
 and implement it in full but such 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.110
 tanks here are like apt-1s just can't 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.870
 nothing to oppose this tank 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.260
 because there we even have a one-time 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.030
 damage 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.630
 still very good 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.540
 rate we've got one 1s and 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.290
 Tanks is quite a long time 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.180
 few they shoot for the whole fight and 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.220
 we have the rate of fire is all 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.170
 6 shots per minute on the jagdanser 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.450
 plus rammer will be 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.050
 around 8 shots per minute and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.630
 this friends are very good bloom with us 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.370
 imperceptible here and so the tank does not depend 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.950
 from being able to put on him 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.410
 pickup drives are better replaced by them 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.900
 better stereo 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.989
 or say the same mass network 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.930
 so friends let's let it down 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.380
 gradually end on the tank jagdpanther 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.150
 he has a good one does not have any 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.360
 booking only we have 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.000
 the reservation of the mask itself is tools 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.150
 there may still be no damage 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.060
 from opponents but we donâ€™t 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.989
 no booking therefore criticizes 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.989
 we are all 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.989
 we can easily set it on fire 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.299
 so well set fire that is us us 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.390
 transmission as well as all panthers 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.459
 that we have blitz friends there 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.620
 if not substituted and correct 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.769
 use this tank then he is on the seventh 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.950
 level is sheer imba and such 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.620
 tanks like su-152 can't just go 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.959
 compared with this tank it is capable of 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.720
 much and this is not like this tank is not 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.269
 take away therefore friends advise everyone 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.780
 try this tank and ride it 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.209
 enemies but with you was a locker ball hope 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.250
