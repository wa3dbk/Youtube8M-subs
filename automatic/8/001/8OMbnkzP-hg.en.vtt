that whenever it detects the UV rays are

interesting<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.869> wonder<00:01:52.200> exactly<00:01:52.380> how<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
interesting we wonder exactly how is it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.130 
interesting we wonder exactly how is it
going<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> work<00:01:53.490> with<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> case<00:01:54.540> number<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
going to work with a case number one and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
going to work with a case number one and
number<00:01:55.170> two<00:01:55.530> does<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.979> tip<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.430> fact<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
number two does this tip the fact of the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.819 
number two does this tip the fact of the
galaxy<00:01:57.299> note<00:01:57.329> 4<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.290> waterproof

galaxy note 4 is going to be waterproof

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.200 
galaxy note 4 is going to be waterproof
hopefully<00:01:59.549> that's<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.880> be<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> case

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
hopefully that's going to be the case

has more our sensor from sony and by the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.290 
has more our sensor from sony and by the
way<00:02:10.110> apple<00:02:10.770> has<00:02:10.800> used<00:02:11.220> sony<00:02:11.520> sensors<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
way apple has used sony sensors for the

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
way apple has used sony sensors for the
iphone<00:02:12.720> for<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> longest

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
iphone for the longest

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.130 
iphone for the longest
I'm<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.730> was<00:02:14.910> expected<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.690> apparently

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
I'm so that was expected but apparently

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.420 
I'm so that was expected but apparently
the<00:02:16.200> reason<00:02:16.560> why<00:02:16.680> they're<00:02:16.830> not<00:02:16.980> going<00:02:17.220> for<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the reason why they're not going for the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.700 
the reason why they're not going for the
newer<00:02:17.580> 20<00:02:17.970> megapixel<00:02:18.450> sensor<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.380> size

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
newer 20 megapixel sensor is the size

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.040 
newer 20 megapixel sensor is the size
constraints<00:02:20.130> on<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.670> iphone<00:02:21.120> 6<00:02:21.480> which<00:02:22.020> is

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
constraints on the iphone 6 which is

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.390 
constraints on the iphone 6 which is
interesting<00:02:22.650> when<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.890> consider<00:02:23.160> that's

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
interesting when you consider that's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520 
interesting when you consider that's
going<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.580> be<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> much<00:02:24.060> bigger<00:02:24.300> phone<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:24.960> from

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
going to be a much bigger phone but from

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.710 
going to be a much bigger phone but from
that<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.860> company<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.460> also<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.390> add<00:02:27.690> a

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that the company is also going to add a

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.320 
that the company is also going to add a
bigger<00:02:28.020> battery<00:02:28.580> 1810<00:02:29.580> milliamp<00:02:29.970> hours

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
bigger battery 1810 milliamp hours

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.420 
bigger battery 1810 milliamp hours
conversion<00:02:31.050> to<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.200> 1560<00:02:31.950> milliamp<00:02:32.280> hour

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
conversion to the 1560 milliamp hour

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
conversion to the 1560 milliamp hour
battery<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.970> we<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.240> on<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.540> iphone<00:02:33.840> 5s

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
battery that we have on the iphone 5s

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.140 
battery that we have on the iphone 5s
and<00:02:34.800> yeah<00:02:35.010> that<00:02:35.190> could<00:02:35.430> be<00:02:35.460> cool<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.120> a

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
and yeah that could be cool it is a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
and yeah that could be cool it is a
bigger<00:02:36.360> battery<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:37.080> then<00:02:37.290> again<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.890> is

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
bigger battery but then again is it is

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.410 
bigger battery but then again is it is
also<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.340> bigger<00:02:38.580> display<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.030> we<00:02:39.210> don't<00:02:39.360> know

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
also a bigger display so we don't know

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.060 
also a bigger display so we don't know
how<00:02:39.540> that's<00:02:39.750> going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.960> perform<00:02:40.290> though<00:02:40.860> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
how that's going to perform though the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.160 
how that's going to perform though the
a8<00:02:41.430> chip<00:02:41.610> might<00:02:42.120> have<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> lot<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.840> do<00:02:42.990> with<00:02:43.020> that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
a8 chip might have a lot to do with that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.350 
a8 chip might have a lot to do with that
we'll<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.740> how<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:43.920> goes<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.580> finally<00:02:45.210> for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
we'll see how that goes and finally for

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.180 
we'll see how that goes and finally for
