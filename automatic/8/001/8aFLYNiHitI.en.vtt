00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
you're gonna ask them for dry ice okay I

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.560 
you're gonna ask them for dry ice okay I
would<00:00:23.340> say<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> party<00:00:23.970> between<00:00:24.269> five<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it comes in a big block and you just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.030 
it comes in a big block and you just
drop<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.240> on<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> ground<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:30.929> yep<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.590> again

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
drop it on the ground and yep and again

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.709 
drop it on the ground and yep and again
go<00:00:32.219> touch<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.610> your<00:00:32.669> hands<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.180> 110

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
go touch it with your hands it's 110

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.049 
go touch it with your hands it's 110
degrees<00:00:33.780> below<00:00:34.230> zero<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> big

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
degrees below zero so all right so a big

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.850 
degrees below zero so all right so a big
be<00:00:36.270> set<00:00:36.480> dry<00:00:36.690> ice<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.079> here<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.559> kind<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
be set dry ice and here this is kind of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.350 
be set dry ice and here this is kind of
fun<00:00:38.010> here<00:00:38.190> watch<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:38.910> here's<00:00:39.090> our<00:00:39.180> big

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
fun here watch this so here's our big

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
fun here watch this so here's our big
piece<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.690> dry<00:00:39.840> ice<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
piece of dry ice and this is just a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.110 
piece of dry ice and this is just a
metal<00:00:40.980> bowl<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.610> put<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:41.969> metal

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
metal bowl so if we put it in the metal

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.639 
metal bowl so if we put it in the metal
bowl<00:00:42.360> here<00:00:47.329> I'm<00:00:48.329> done<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.780> number<00:00:49.469> that

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
bowl here I'm done with that number that

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.479 
bowl here I'm done with that number that
little<00:00:49.860> experiment

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
little experiment

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
little experiment
you<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:50.969> why<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.629> now<00:00:51.930> that's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
you know why is because now that's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
you know why is because now that's
frozen<00:00:52.440> carbon<00:00:52.890> dioxide<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.180> they<00:00:54.300> took

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
frozen carbon dioxide right so they took

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.240 
frozen carbon dioxide right so they took
the<00:00:54.570> ear<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.039> exhale<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.219> carbon

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the ear that we exhale the carbon

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.459 
the ear that we exhale the carbon
dioxide<00:00:56.610> they<00:00:57.390> compress<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.079> put<00:00:58.260> under

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
dioxide they compress it they put under

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
dioxide they compress it they put under
lots<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.859> extreme<00:00:59.760> temperature<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> that's

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
lots of extreme temperature and that's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.270 
lots of extreme temperature and that's
how<00:01:01.020> they<00:01:01.140> get<00:01:01.230> their<00:01:01.350> carbon<00:01:01.649> dioxide<00:01:02.129> so

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
how they get their carbon dioxide so

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
how they get their carbon dioxide so
that's<00:01:02.460> frozen<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.510> vibrates<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
that's frozen so it vibrates here and it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.080 
that's frozen so it vibrates here and it
makes<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.710> sound<00:01:04.920> vibrational<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.909> I'm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
makes that sound vibrational and I'm

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.340 
makes that sound vibrational and I'm
done<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.570> little<00:01:06.689> experiment<00:01:07.260> so

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
done with that little experiment so

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.960 
done with that little experiment so
we're<00:01:07.470> done<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:08.490> what's<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> most

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
we're done with that but what's the most

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
we're done with that but what's the most
famous<00:01:09.240> thing<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.689> do<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.380> dry<00:01:10.560> ice

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
famous thing to do with the the dry ice

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.890 
famous thing to do with the the dry ice
mark<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.330> frothing

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
mark what do we do is it's the frothing

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
mark what do we do is it's the frothing
exploding<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.100> getting<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.580> right<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.970> get

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
exploding so getting all right so get

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.640 
exploding so getting all right so get
the<00:01:15.390> big<00:01:15.540> container<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.229> alright<00:01:16.590> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the big container there alright so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.960 
the big container there alright so
here's<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.009> we're<00:01:17.100> gonna<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.610> drop

get<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.100> are<00:01:20.220> these<00:01:20.280> clouds<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:21.060> that

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
get is there are these clouds is that

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.070 
get is there are these clouds is that
very<00:01:21.390> Halloweeny

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
very Halloweeny

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
lights and we're going to play this game

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.380 
lights and we're going to play this game
because<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.430> love<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.670> little<00:01:26.939> black<00:01:27.150> light

light is on and now we've got this stuff

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.190 
light is on and now we've got this stuff
called<00:01:31.670> extreme<00:01:32.670> glow<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.390> or<00:01:33.890> atomic<00:01:34.890> glow
