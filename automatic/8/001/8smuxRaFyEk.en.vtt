00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.160
 among the men know how to qualify for the semi-finals in the Dutchman 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.139
 and if they themselves designed to the final image there he will be in this series at the 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.130
 best four have to end that is easier said than done it 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.459
 shift down and one already falls 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.490
 but it started well for twenty years 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.390
 and then we see how is this sport going a few seconds later from portal land 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.790
 in third position the speed is off the bike and his chances are 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.160
 and that is this sport in a nutshell keeping your eyes open no mistakes 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.870
 and like a madman to the finish four we go there again for a moment 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.620
 sp is the olympic champion 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.809
 and then Kroes said he found a safe place in the first four and that 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.230
 also applies to the graphic splendor in the other semifinal there are among others 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 A spokesman said New Zealand and there is no killing that's the absolute number 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.640
 one of the world they all recommend going to the final but we are going to go 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.270
 look 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.930
 what exactly went wrong with parts of gorcum is in orange on the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.039
 inside it fits well 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.990
 comes here in the air and then Thai that just wrong 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.530
 and here the speed is complete and then it is with one for both the Netherlands 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.580
 the final with favorites as winners of b and especially the history 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.020
 kill and the frenchman 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.130
 9 became Copenhagen world champion three weeks ago but he must allow the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.050
 americans niklas long quickly left is dordrecht to the front 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.969
 in the rainbow jersey 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.679
 but for wilders in the black suit the lead over and in the red slime 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:24.930
 although the beer was the winner of the first semi-final 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.100
 wilders the new sailor and 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.609
 be who an australian 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.809
 but there is that in the world now there are three again side by side 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.590
 ices for those other two they go the direction that the last left turn 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.310
 the rest the farmer comes by a dead person every day or not then there are two more 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.100
 but in the rest is still the full length for the Fransman m so 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 the victory goes to new zealand second dead 3 source 4 andrÃ© 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.800
 wilders and speed freak and also a man who regularly visits the gym 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.030
 winner in, among other things 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.710
 among women there is also no Dutch delegation in half 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.229
 finale but lieke klaus and knows not to break pots she ends in this 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.250
 series in seventh place and plays 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.990
 absolutely not in the fight for the first 4 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.490
 carrie from america finds the series and goes to the final just like his 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.810
 successor and Chinese do not do anything that are in the other semifinals and that 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.070
 Big names but the biggest name is the Colombian pattern 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.690
 world champion and number one in the global ranking she wants to be a sportswoman 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.060
 of the year, colombia and its target will be gold next year 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.420
 on this job 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.260
 then there will have to do better than move now because 4 but it is on 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.370
 about the same error as van gorcum and it's a done for mariana platform 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.890

 the chinese do not fall lightly they go here the tunnel in the flat are there again 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.810

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.220
 very strong she is left she will be in October 23 and he seems to be on his way to the 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.480
 victory but that is still going on 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.890
 from new zealand second in the world championship but who cares 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.480
 a surplus of thunders through and one this state they no longer give in failed 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.080
