00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.120
 perfect just beat the machine 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.400
 and already like being painful for ezekiel domain name 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
 little has to do with this 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.049
 and we will continue with the next election 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:22.799
 We are going to the United States that has already borrowed new domain name 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.890
 of the forest has created an area of ​​his eminence 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.279
 new arrests manually the server to register 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.100
 in the energy zone 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.740
 and then we're going to load the console for rental purposes including those from 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.830
 be fulfilled 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.160
 let's start with 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.570
 happened number one let's check wings 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020
 we are not going to see the console 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.410
 of wings 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 and is that others because the right to use Peruvian laws 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.230
 I do not put a device very much all the risks you currently have 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.410
 xd steven already appears in the records 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.690
 of domain local points and is that the registration in master bros 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.980
 Now we know that on Monday we are winning says he correctly made the 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.490
 domain name 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.310
 the second step 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.730
 blindly take out the reverse zone is less a critical step with this we give a 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.600
 domain controller 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.930
 the sacral healthy baby zone by default and it is important that 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.950
 the cream manually 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.930
 for this we are going to open the administration console dende nc 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.690
 who is here in these titles 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.550
 since currently we already have the direct zone 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.690
 which is the local point 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 but in the reverse area we do not have any 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 let's select right click new zone 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.840
 they are the primary and we are going to tell him to keep the sun that director and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 practical to replicate with no demos domain controllers 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.010
 next scene modes 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.870
 here in which we saw how in the edition of guides that we are using a 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.220
 9 2 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.890
 about 6 8 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.579
 i'm not going to put it pointed one 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.140
 why 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.059
 I'm going to do it because Alejandro commented his areas 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:14.119
 these good and we have enough I read in the supposed spasming direction 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:18.179
 and we want to be recorded all in the same month vuoso was injured next 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.379
 and we bring to the end 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.249
 here in the remittances area 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:28.889
 what seems to me at this moment the event happens is that it remains by default 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.499
 and we are going to force 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.019
 the record is Friday in husband 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.309
 Number 8 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.309
 that will execute this command 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:40.309
 and you get the one of Christ in goods 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.929
 we are human beings 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.889
 tells us that the record has already started is foolish 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:57.379
 and we are going to open and each one with his selection to refresh 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.509
 and although it appears to us who the area 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:00.909
 point 1 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.039
 and is that his name is lost 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.369
 of sorry the IP address of the domain controller 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:09.369
 now let's load the ones you want to verify that already 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:13.649
 that lawyer well the domain and we can see the administration of users already 

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:15.019
 what's wrong with it 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.120
 as the here have given administrative increases and in that director 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.120
 they use with cyrus 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:27.759
 here we have a domain name dominate local point and it is who dohmen controls 

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.040
 we have that is already in bs 0 1 as you control me 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.979
 is in this organizational unit is good 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.689
 and it is highly recommended 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:42.979
 who does not have a reputation that does not change the policies that in the hour 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.299
 to control domain move it in another 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.579
 there should always be here in this all domain controllers 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.799
 tomás mora who have filters still do not have anything 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.189
 we are going to continue 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:02.279
 step number 10 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.689
 we are going to start configuring the c0 server 2 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.049
 let's connect has served us that I have to pour the assignment to finish 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.159
 this is the server of c0 2 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.159
 we make the name here 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.819
 they are called c0 2 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.819
 We were going to review as this step 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.289
 the configuration and press for that second controller of 2010 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 let's see here the options of 13 31 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.610
 here the values ​​are very similar 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:41.989
 with the exception that it is that initially we are going to put to them that the 

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:44.090
 primary dns server them 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.830
 it will be 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.939
 the domain control that is already installed 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.849
 that the 192 168 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:52.999
 point 1 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:54.110
 point 10 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.759
 what is he about c 0 1 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.970
 let's go two here to equality add the suffix 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.289
 I already had it added 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.330
 let's go then there will be wings and we will add the other serve as incentive 22 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.180
 168 point 1 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.180
 point 10 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.669
 perfect 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.339
 already with the dt cptm configuration 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.389
 before sticking the machine to the domain we will verify that it is 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:29.909
 properly working on name resolution 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.270
 and that the machine can see the domain is correctly 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.509
 For that 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.729
 the first thing we are going to do is a pine forest that 0 1 by the name 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:42.740
 0 1 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.439
 i follow here the catfish the suffix 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:47.779
 what do we do a network card 

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:50.539
 and resolves the ip address correctly 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:53.539
 there is also another command that come out is local 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:59.439
 and let's see if we are connecting the correctly of needs that we are 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.199
 connected abc 0 1 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.689
 and the ip address is the 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.689
 a 1-1 dissolved 1 10 already with this 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.689
 we know that communication with a server is fine and they will be uploading 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.039
 correctly 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:11.960
 now 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.439
 let's dump the machine 

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.819
 to the domain 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.169
 we select here right click 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.110
 properties 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.370
 computer name and let's tell it belongs 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.889
 domain 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.889
 point looking 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.909
 everything is asked by the administrator if this window does not come out 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.969
 what to say that since the pudu successfully solve a dominance man and he 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.529
 is connecting with him 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.360
 now yes they are logging us appears is because we have some problem with dns or 

00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:49.289
 some problem with communication with the other server 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:52.289
 let's put the key is if the user 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:58.639
 this key 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.520
 and this user is the minister or domain that we just created is not the 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.520
 local key if not the Sunday we are not connecting 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.619
 here he will connect the machine to the domain and then he will ask us for clemency 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:13.279
 machine 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:15.779
 perfect the selected hockey 

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:18.110
 and we are going to check the machine 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.699
 not right now
