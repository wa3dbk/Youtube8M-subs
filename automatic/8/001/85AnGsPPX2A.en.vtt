00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.009
 Edward and and today I will show you how 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.610
 do portable charging for your phone 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.920
 power bank on y tube and after you a lot 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.809
 video about creating crib banks and all 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.400
 constantly use these columns to me 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.470
 it seems to be wrong as in 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.180
 crowns very small capacity think 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.070
 I already showed my videos how to make 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.529
 poverbank but it was a long time ago I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.240
 did not even have a bank not clear what 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.730
 so now show you how to do 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.949
 real good first bank 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.540
 I did not record the video camera, so Iâ€™ll show you 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.160
 in the pictures that for this we 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.320
 i need two for this 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.670
 batteries here are furman's chinese 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.610
 samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.399
 capacity of 2100 milliampere hours and took 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.010
 one 1200 nokia battery 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.649
 milliampere hours all these three batteries 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.719
 3 7 volts each of these battery lines 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.539
 decided to make one powerful that is with us 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.940
 you get one 5000 battery 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.980
 400 milliamper hours and she will 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.600
 give one point one volt 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.000
 just right for creating 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.739
 portable charge for phone so 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.780
 the most important thing is to connect all these three 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.520
 Batteries correctly according to the scheme I think you 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.200
 it will be clear how to connect the batteries 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.000
 be careful when you are 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.650
 run up batteries if wrong 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.400
 will connect they will be available 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.960
 sparkles 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.030
 so we have batteries 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 combined and it turns out one powerful 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.530
 each battery from the phone is 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.170
 the board is basically this board is placed 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 top where there are contacts themselves in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.829
 Some batteries have 3 contacts. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.509
 or four contacts in general, this one 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.909
 we need the top board like this 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130
 way to remove from our batteries and here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.680
 we will remain two contacts plus and minus 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.850
 we need to connect them and so everything 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.829
 batteries i right and 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.990
 sequence limit frame tube and 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.299
 we have one powerful all 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.369
 I soldered the contacts well with a soldering iron and 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.409
 on top I'm still on glue hot glue 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.420
 thanks to the hot glue will hold 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.119
 more reliably and not to use 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.009
 electrical tape after all connected 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.399
 battery contacts must be her 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.439
 check now should show about 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.180
 11.1 volt batteries may be slightly 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.840
 discharged so may show a little 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.810
 less 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.580
 as we see it shows almost 11 means 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 we connected all contacts correctly 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.569
 we created these micro me up 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.180
 for centuries 12 volts for just such from 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.400
 adapters since it works on the machine and 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.670
 cigarette lighter machine produces 12 volts 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.560
 this adapter works from 9 volts to 12 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.750
 volt in order to be able to turn on 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.849
 off the power bank I took the switch 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.450
 and for the case we will use the usual 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:31.610
 the box 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.610
 adapter for the machine we need to disassemble 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.040
 box, I will reduce the body a little 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.610
 use whatever your 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.200
 to wish 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.480
 now all these components we need 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.160
 attach in this box will be approximately 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.319
 so here so also I will add 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.599
 contacts to charge the powerbank itself 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.209
 for charging i will use here 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.140
 such are the plug and from the power supply so 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.730
 to start glue the battery then 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.950
 cut a hole for the adapter 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.780
 1 contact battery attached to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.780
 adapter and glue the adapter itself 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.750
 cut a hole for the switch 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.900
 we paste it, we glue it hot 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.040
 glue and in the correct sequence 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.560
 we connect to the adapter 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.600
 and to the battery using wires so 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.990
 make it work correctly and include our 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.990
 adapter 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:40.180
 and then check it turn on the indicator 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:44.350
 fired up means we all hooked up 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.200
 right now, it remains to attach 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.880
 connectors for charging poverbanka neigh 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.130
 we will be like this here 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.410
 we make two phone charges 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.940
 pins from plug to pins from 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.730
 charging add a drop of hot glue to 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.140
 Better held and we taped 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.970
 I think it would be better to attach to two 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.920
 wire which is in the middle 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.410
 but so, too, can now cut 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.850
 hole for 2 plugs in correct 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.980
 sequences we connect the plug 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.570
 Directly to the battery we insert into 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.390
 hole and carefully glue 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.890
 hot glue and so our poverbank ready 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.350
 as a cover, I decided to use 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.030
 such plastic packaging from wai 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.310
 file adapter it is just perfect 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.200
 approached for this box now check 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.419
 how it all works in theory everything should 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.070
 work ideally check immediately on two 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.800
 phones we connect cords 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.990
 push the button and our two phones 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.900
 being charged here appeared the indicator on 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.300
 one phone and second generally pover 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.370
 the bank is working perfectly testing it already 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.100
 a couple of days in general my phone capacity 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.890
 2100 milliampere hours charge twice 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.169
 one hundred percent and one time at 40 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.390
 percent to charge the bank itself 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.789
 I usually put him on the night and patrol he 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.289
 fully charged case itself poverbanka 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.280
 you can certainly have done a bit 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:02.470
 Better but also in the future 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.600
 will add the charge indicator itself 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.280
 powerbank I left a couple for the group 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.360
 quality photos crib 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.830
 come see if something is not clear 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.840
 Well that's all not forget 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.300
 like subscribe to my channel 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.319
 leave comments everyone thanks for 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.319
 view all bye
