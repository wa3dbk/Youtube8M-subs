00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:04.359
 bending is a technique that gives a criss-ate effect 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
 this technique consists in pushing upwards 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.689
 ooh pull down a rope 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.949
 so as to alter the starting musical note thus bringing it to a note 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.609
 higher than arrival 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:23.720
 the interval between these two notes can go from the semitone to even two 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.400
 thrones 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.820
 in choosing whether to push or pull the rope is completely personal 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.970
 besides being obviously bound to the physical limits of the instrument 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.800
 in fact we cannot expect to pull down the first race 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.860
 cap to push last short upwards so we'll go out of the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.250
 keyboard 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 the strength required for computer bending is not exercised as much by the fingers 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.960
 gasoline from the movement of the forearm 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.200
 which imprints and strength on the strings through the fingers 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.680
 like others this technique also lends itself well to being applied 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.150
 pentatonic 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 but let's go ahead let's see the examples 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.219
 then grab the handle and position the fingers 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.490
 and after playing an initial note we push the string upwards to 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 reach the desired note 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.930
 it is also possible rather than pushing the strings upwards to pull it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.520
 downward 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 in some cases it may be more convenient convenient 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400
 bending can also be done in reverse 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.550
 that is, we can start from the note reached with the stretched rope 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.100
 to subsequently release the rope until it returns to the original note 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.809
 obviously it is also possible to combine two styles 

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:34.809
 to get this kind of effect 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:57.449
 pushing the ropes with more than one finger we will divide the effort on each one 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:58.719
 of bending 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.930
 and therefore advised to use at least two fingers at least in the case in 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.369
 which we are going to act on loose ropes or if we are in the part 

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:08.689
 initial of the keyboard 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.689
 it is important to point out that the force required to count the bending is not 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.459
 that is cited by the fingers 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.869
 benzi from the movement of the forearm that imprints and the force on the strings 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.869
 through the fingers 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.879
 a very important thing is to have the right intonation 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.679
 so to practice before playing bending 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.679
 we listen to the destination note 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:12.999
 also on other cakes
