so<00:00:04.080> this<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.410> your<00:00:04.590> basic<00:00:05.130> style<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:06.180> hanging

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
so this is your basic style of hanging

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.990 
so this is your basic style of hanging
on<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.899> back<00:00:07.050> overflow<00:00:07.710> set<00:00:08.040> up<00:00:08.189> it<00:00:08.370> consists

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
on the back overflow set up it consists

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.870 
on the back overflow set up it consists
of<00:00:09.059> three<00:00:09.510> pieces<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.980> first<00:00:11.220> one<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
of three pieces the first one is the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.450 
of three pieces the first one is the
actual<00:00:12.030> box<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.840> hangs<00:00:13.080> onto<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.769> back<00:00:14.430> of

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
actual box that hangs onto the back of

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.230 
actual box that hangs onto the back of
the<00:00:14.760> tank<00:00:15.650> attached<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.130> box<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.910> this

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the tank attached to that box is this

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.179 
the tank attached to that box is this
overflow<00:00:18.689> box<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.470> here<00:00:19.740> with<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:19.949> teeth

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
overflow box right here with the teeth

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.130 
overflow box right here with the teeth
cut<00:00:20.490> into<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.089> and<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:22.470> third<00:00:22.800> piece<00:00:23.159> is<00:00:23.519> this

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
cut into it and the third piece is this

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.779 
cut into it and the third piece is this
you<00:00:25.140> tube<00:00:26.599> tubing<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:28.079> and<00:00:28.259> what<00:00:29.130> happens<00:00:29.550> is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
you tube tubing here and what happens is

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.410 
you tube tubing here and what happens is
you<00:00:30.029> fill<00:00:30.329> the<00:00:30.480> water<00:00:30.720> into<00:00:31.169> the<00:00:31.289> tank<00:00:31.529> it

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
you fill the water into the tank it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.580 
you fill the water into the tank it
overflows<00:00:33.420> into<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> box<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.510> then<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.989> flows

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
overflows into the box and then it flows

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.369 
overflows into the box and then it flows
through<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.250> tube<00:00:38.609> here<00:00:39.269> via<00:00:39.539> a<00:00:39.629> siphon<00:00:40.260> and

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
through this tube here via a siphon and

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.569 
through this tube here via a siphon and
we'll<00:00:40.559> show<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.769> in<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.129> minute

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
we'll show that in a minute

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.720 
we'll show that in a minute
water<00:00:42.239> flows<00:00:42.539> into<00:00:42.899> this<00:00:43.170> box<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.460> down

into the Sun most of your hang on back
style<00:00:47.359> overflows<00:00:48.359> will<00:00:48.839> have<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> slot<00:00:49.949> cut<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
style overflows will have a slot cut and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.310 
style overflows will have a slot cut and
a<00:00:51.629> wing<00:00:51.989> nut<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.589> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:53.129> raise<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:54.120> lower

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
a wing nut that you can raise or lower

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.919 
a wing nut that you can raise or lower
this<00:00:55.320> pre-filter<00:00:56.100> box<00:00:56.309> here<00:00:56.850> which<00:00:57.570> will

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
this pre-filter box here which will

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.610 
this pre-filter box here which will
raise<00:00:58.499> or<00:00:59.070> lower<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:00.239> water<00:01:00.629> level<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.440> your

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
raise or lower the water level in your

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.130 
raise or lower the water level in your
display<00:01:02.039> tank<00:01:02.339> so<00:01:03.239> we<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.480> our<00:01:03.600> tank<00:01:03.839> filled

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
display tank so we have our tank filled

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
display tank so we have our tank filled
with<00:01:04.230> water<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.580> also<00:01:05.760> need<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.360> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
with water and you also need to put a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
with water and you also need to put a
small<00:01:06.750> amount<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.050> water<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.980> backside<00:01:08.400> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
small amount of water on the backside of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.850 
small amount of water on the backside of
the<00:01:08.580> overflow<00:01:08.970> box<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.870> where<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the overflow box right here where the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.660 
the overflow box right here where the
u-tube<00:01:11.670> fits<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:13.200> we<00:01:13.260> need<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.920> create<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
u-tube fits into now we need to create a

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.460 
u-tube fits into now we need to create a
siphon<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.420> there's<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.810> air<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
siphon because there's just air in this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.920 
siphon because there's just air in this
tube<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.210> need<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.510> draw<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
tube right now so we need to draw the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.980 
tube right now so we need to draw the
air<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.620> of<00:01:19.680> here<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.430> draw<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> water<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.420> if

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
air out of here and draw the water up if

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320 
air out of here and draw the water up if
we<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.800> just<00:01:23.010> turn<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> return<00:01:24.000> pump

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
we are to just turn on the return pump

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.080 
we are to just turn on the return pump
right<00:01:24.660> now<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:25.950> overflow<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.610> tank

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
right now we would overflow the tank

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.480 
right now we would overflow the tank
because<00:01:27.660> the<00:01:28.080> water<00:01:28.350> would<00:01:28.620> not<00:01:28.830> be<00:01:29.160> able<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
because the water would not be able to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450 
because the water would not be able to
travel<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.300> through<00:01:30.330> this<00:01:31.080> piece<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.070> tubing

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
travel up through this piece of tubing

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.110 
travel up through this piece of tubing
here<00:01:32.730> so<00:01:33.720> how<00:01:33.870> do<00:01:33.930> we<00:01:34.050> do<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> is<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.580> take<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
here so how do we do that is we take a

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.380 
here so how do we do that is we take a
piece<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.660> airline<00:01:37.380> tubing<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.190> we<00:01:38.880> put<00:01:39.120> it<00:01:39.240> up

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
piece of airline tubing and we put it up

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.130 
piece of airline tubing and we put it up
inside<00:01:40.050> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.800> u-tube<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.690> suck

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
inside of the u-tube and then we suck

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.230 
inside of the u-tube and then we suck
the<00:01:43.170> air<00:01:43.530> out<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:44.070> tube<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.700> will<00:01:44.880> draw<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the air out of the tube it will draw the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.600 
the air out of the tube it will draw the
water<00:01:45.660> up<00:01:46.050> into<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> tubes<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> water

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
water up into the tubes and the water

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.510 
water up into the tubes and the water
will<00:01:47.850> flow<00:01:48.120> from<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.020> tank<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.830> through<00:01:50.400> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
will flow from the tank up through the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.970 
will flow from the tank up through the
tube<00:01:50.760> down<00:01:51.720> into<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.260> backside<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
tube down into the backside of the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.930 
tube down into the backside of the
overflow<00:01:53.280> box<00:01:53.750> now<00:01:54.750> what's<00:01:55.710> kind<00:01:56.220> of<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.460> bad

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
overflow box now what's kind of a bad

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.930 
overflow box now what's kind of a bad
thing<00:01:56.970> with<00:01:57.600> these<00:01:57.750> sort<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.140> setups<00:01:58.650> is<00:01:58.940> that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
thing with these sort of setups is that

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.350 
thing with these sort of setups is that
sometimes<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.870> lose<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.500> siphon<00:02:02.130> where<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
sometimes they lose the siphon where you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.570 
sometimes they lose the siphon where you
won't<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.720> any<00:02:03.930> water<00:02:04.230> up<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.310> tube

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
won't have any water up here in the tube

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.180 
won't have any water up here in the tube
that<00:02:06.450> happens<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.290> if<00:02:07.590> there's<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.920> power

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that happens like if there's a power

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.780 
that happens like if there's a power
outage<00:02:08.629> sometimes<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:10.190> if<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.430> water<00:02:11.670> level

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
outage sometimes or if the water level

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.770 
outage sometimes or if the water level
fluctuates<00:02:12.690> too<00:02:12.960> much

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
fluctuates too much

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.410 
fluctuates too much
something<00:02:14.410> gets<00:02:14.620> stuck<00:02:14.800> in<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.430> tube<00:02:15.820> that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
something gets stuck in this tube that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.350 
something gets stuck in this tube that
you<00:02:16.540> can<00:02:16.690> lose<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:17.050> siphon<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:19.000> return

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
you can lose the siphon and the return

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.180 
you can lose the siphon and the return
pump<00:02:19.600> keeps<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:20.080> pumping<00:02:20.440> water<00:02:20.650> into<00:02:21.070> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
pump keeps on pumping water into the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.150 
pump keeps on pumping water into the
tank<00:02:21.430> and<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.880> flows<00:02:22.180> over<00:02:22.450> onto<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.050> floor<00:02:23.160> so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
tank and it flows over onto the floor so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.670 
tank and it flows over onto the floor so
that's<00:02:24.280> kind<00:02:24.610> of<00:02:24.730> why<00:02:24.910> these<00:02:25.780> really<00:02:26.440> aren't

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
that's kind of why these really aren't

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.610 
that's kind of why these really aren't
the<00:02:26.830> best<00:02:27.570> option<00:02:28.570> out<00:02:28.690> there<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.380> much

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the best option out there it's much

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.920 
the best option out there it's much
better<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.190> your<00:02:30.400> tank<00:02:30.670> drilled<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.810> if

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
better to have your tank drilled but if

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.680 
better to have your tank drilled but if
you<00:02:32.050> don't<00:02:32.320> have<00:02:32.500> any<00:02:32.920> other<00:02:33.300> option<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.450> your

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
you don't have any other option on your

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.080 
you don't have any other option on your
tank<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.200> you<00:02:35.740> want<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.040> add<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.160> sump<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.910> is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
tank and you want to add a sump this is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.630 
tank and you want to add a sump this is
really<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.510> only<00:02:37.660> way<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.900> go<00:02:38.200> they<00:02:38.860> also<00:02:39.100> do

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
really the only way to go they also do

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.400 
really the only way to go they also do
make<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.240> pump<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:42.040> it's<00:02:42.910> a<00:02:43.060> water<00:02:43.660> lift<00:02:44.050> pump

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
make a pump that it's a water lift pump

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.470 
make a pump that it's a water lift pump
just<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.190> small<00:02:45.520> little<00:02:45.790> thing<00:02:45.850> sort<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.330> looks

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
just a small little thing sort of looks

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.270 
just a small little thing sort of looks
like<00:02:46.630> an<00:02:46.750> air<00:02:46.930> lift<00:02:47.140> pump<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:47.740> it's<00:02:47.860> actually

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
like an air lift pump but it's actually

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.390 
like an air lift pump but it's actually
it'll<00:02:48.760> draw<00:02:49.330> water<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.680> drill<00:02:50.950> a<00:02:50.980> hole<00:02:51.220> into

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
it'll draw water you drill a hole into

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.730 
it'll draw water you drill a hole into
the<00:02:51.520> top<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.180> piece<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.930> tubing<00:02:53.230> here<00:02:53.560> and

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
the top of this piece of tubing here and

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.550 
the top of this piece of tubing here and
glue<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.910> piece<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.540> rigid<00:02:55.900> airline<00:02:56.260> tubing

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
glue a piece of rigid airline tubing

hook up the tube to the pump and the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.220 
hook up the tube to the pump and the
pump<00:03:00.520> sucks<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.210> water<00:03:01.360> through<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.900> tube

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
pump sucks the water through the tube

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.770 
pump sucks the water through the tube
and<00:03:02.500> then<00:03:02.950> back<00:03:03.280> into<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.880> back<00:03:04.360> side<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.630> the

and then back into the back side of the
overflow<00:03:05.170> box<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.680> I'm<00:03:05.800> not<00:03:05.950> going<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.190> show

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
overflow box so I'm not going to show

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.150 
overflow box so I'm not going to show
that<00:03:06.400> right<00:03:06.760> now<00:03:06.970> but<00:03:07.270> look<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.930> up<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:08.650> you'll

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
so I'm going to get some get a siphon

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.730 
so I'm going to get some get a siphon
going<00:03:13.000> here<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.660> show<00:03:13.960> you<00:03:14.020> how<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.440> works

going here and show you how this works
so<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.340> have<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.580> piece<00:03:15.820> of<00:03:16.030> flexible<00:03:16.480> airline

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
so I have a piece of flexible airline

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.860 
so I have a piece of flexible airline
tubing<00:03:17.290> up<00:03:17.709> into<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.400> tube<00:03:18.700> here<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.360> you

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
tubing up into the you tube here and you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.260 
tubing up into the you tube here and you
want<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.140> try<00:03:20.290> to<00:03:20.350> get<00:03:20.500> it<00:03:20.650> as<00:03:20.770> high<00:03:21.120> into<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
want to try to get it as high into the

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.390 
want to try to get it as high into the
tube<00:03:22.750> as<00:03:22.990> you<00:03:23.440> possibly<00:03:23.920> can

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
tube as you possibly can

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.640 
tube as you possibly can
and<00:03:24.490> you<00:03:25.000> also<00:03:25.209> want<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.690> try<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:25.959> suck<00:03:26.320> all<00:03:26.620> of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and you also want to try to suck all of

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:37.610 
and you also want to try to suck all of
the<00:03:26.890> air<00:03:26.980> out<00:03:27.160> of<00:03:27.520> here<00:03:27.670> as<00:03:27.790> much<00:03:27.820> as<00:03:28.030> possible

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.729 

alright<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.250> water<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:40.409> flowing<00:03:41.409> on<00:03:41.680> to

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
alright so the water is flowing on to

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.890 
alright so the water is flowing on to
the<00:03:41.890> back<00:03:42.040> side<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.580> box<00:03:42.790> here<00:03:43.269> pulling

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
the back side of the box here pulling

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.670 
the back side of the box here pulling
down<00:03:44.260> into<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.890> tube<00:03:45.659> done<00:03:46.659> into<00:03:47.049> our<00:03:47.170> sump

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
down into the tube done into our sump

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:54.740 
down into the tube done into our sump
let's<00:03:48.670> get<00:03:48.849> our<00:03:48.970> return<00:03:49.330> pump<00:03:49.659> plugged<00:03:50.019> in

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.750 

alright<00:03:55.750> our<00:03:56.080> return<00:03:56.500> pump<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.250> pumping<00:03:57.519> the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
alright our return pump is pumping the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.229 
alright our return pump is pumping the
water<00:03:57.879> back<00:03:58.390> up<00:03:58.420> into<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.140> tank

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
water back up into the tank

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.710 
water back up into the tank
now<00:04:01.239> I<00:04:01.269> had<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.739> install<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:03.069> ball<00:04:03.430> valve<00:04:03.720> onto

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
now I had to install a ball valve onto

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.160 
now I had to install a ball valve onto
this<00:04:04.900> because<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:06.640> return<00:04:07.030> pump<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.720> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
this because the return pump and the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.759 
this because the return pump and the
overflow<00:04:09.099> are<00:04:09.489> not<00:04:09.849> matched<00:04:10.599> at<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.260> same

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
overflow are not matched at the same

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.140 
overflow are not matched at the same

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
gallon per hour rating the pump is much

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.930 
gallon per hour rating the pump is much
more<00:04:16.590> powerful<00:04:17.590> than<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.160> overflow<00:04:18.699> this

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
more powerful than the overflow this

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.260 
more powerful than the overflow this
overflow<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.810> only<00:04:20.709> rated<00:04:21.039> for<00:04:21.190> 300<00:04:21.880> gallons

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.400 
overflow is only rated for 300 gallons
per<00:04:22.479> hour<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:23.110> my<00:04:23.410> pump<00:04:23.770> is<00:04:24.449> rated<00:04:25.449> at<00:04:25.720> 600

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
per hour and my pump is rated at 600

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.689 
per hour and my pump is rated at 600
gallons<00:04:27.070> per<00:04:27.370> hour

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
gallons per hour

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.029 
gallons per hour
so<00:04:28.419> I've<00:04:28.570> restricted<00:04:29.229> the<00:04:29.320> water<00:04:29.530> flow<00:04:29.830> this

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
so I've restricted the water flow this

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.740 
so I've restricted the water flow this
really<00:04:30.460> isn't<00:04:30.639> the<00:04:30.820> right<00:04:30.880> way<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.300> do<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:31.539> you

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
really isn't the right way to do it you

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.219 
really isn't the right way to do it you
should<00:04:32.020> match<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.770> return<00:04:33.520> pump<00:04:34.199> to<00:04:35.199> your

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
should match the return pump to your

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.040 
should match the return pump to your
overflow<00:04:35.919> here<00:04:36.400> so<00:04:36.970> but<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.270> can<00:04:37.449> see<00:04:37.690> that

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
overflow here so but you can see that

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.560 
overflow here so but you can see that
the<00:04:38.410> water<00:04:38.950> is<00:04:39.310> flowing<00:04:39.729> through<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.330> tube

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
the water is flowing through the tube

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.610 
the water is flowing through the tube
here<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:41.250> then<00:04:42.250> over<00:04:43.240> this<00:04:43.599> wall<00:04:43.930> here<00:04:44.260> and

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
here and then over this wall here and

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.279 
here and then over this wall here and
this<00:04:44.860> area<00:04:45.070> here<00:04:45.610> you<00:04:46.150> can<00:04:46.300> put<00:04:46.539> a<00:04:46.780> sponge

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:47.289 
this area here you can put a sponge

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:49.529 
this area here you can put a sponge
pre-filter<00:04:48.160> over<00:04:48.820> this<00:04:48.940> part<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.330> pipe

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
pre-filter over this part of the pipe

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.200 
pre-filter over this part of the pipe
that's<00:04:49.720> why<00:04:49.960> there's<00:04:50.139> slots<00:04:50.470> cut<00:04:50.800> into<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.280> but

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
that's why there's slots cut into it but

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.540 
that's why there's slots cut into it but
it<00:04:52.360> runs<00:04:52.510> down<00:04:54.000> into<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.120> sump<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:56.550> then

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
it runs down into the sump and then

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.250 
it runs down into the sump and then
until<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.090> return<00:05:00.419> going<00:05:01.419> back<00:05:01.660> up<00:05:01.900> into<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
until the return going back up into the

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.949 
until the return going back up into the
tank

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:07.959 

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.639 

so<00:05:08.959> that<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.199> your<00:05:09.349> basic<00:05:09.679> operation<00:05:10.669> for<00:05:11.119> the

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:11.649 
so that is your basic operation for the

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:18.669 
so that is your basic operation for the
pain<00:05:12.649> on<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:12.979> back<00:05:13.159> type<00:05:13.580> ah<00:05:13.849> overflow<00:05:17.679> so

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:18.679 
pain on the back type ah overflow so

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:19.929 
pain on the back type ah overflow so
that<00:05:18.830> pretty<00:05:19.009> much<00:05:19.069> covers<00:05:19.369> the<00:05:19.729> four

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:19.939 
that pretty much covers the four

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.699 
that pretty much covers the four
different<00:05:20.089> styles<00:05:20.689> of<00:05:20.779> overflows<00:05:21.319> that<00:05:21.619> I

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:21.709 
different styles of overflows that I

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:24.100 
different styles of overflows that I
have<00:05:21.919> had<00:05:22.099> experience<00:05:22.699> in<00:05:22.939> I<00:05:23.149> will<00:05:23.779> notice

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
have had experience in I will notice

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.719 
have had experience in I will notice
that<00:05:24.289> none<00:05:24.529> of<00:05:24.559> them<00:05:24.800> use<00:05:25.009> a<00:05:25.039> pump<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.699> transfer

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
that none of them use a pump to transfer

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.629 
that none of them use a pump to transfer
the<00:05:26.360> water<00:05:26.629> from<00:05:26.990> the<00:05:27.139> display<00:05:27.649> tank<00:05:27.979> down

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
the water from the display tank down

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.820 
the water from the display tank down
into<00:05:28.999> the<00:05:29.119> sump<00:05:29.419> I've<00:05:29.599> had<00:05:29.749> some<00:05:29.990> people<00:05:30.169> ask

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
into the sump I've had some people ask

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.909 
into the sump I've had some people ask
me<00:05:31.279> that<00:05:31.369> question<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:32.379> I've<00:05:33.379> never<00:05:33.529> seen<00:05:33.860> it

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
me that question and I've never seen it

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.760 
me that question and I've never seen it
work<00:05:34.219> and<00:05:34.819> I<00:05:35.389> would<00:05:35.569> be<00:05:35.689> very<00:05:35.839> leery<00:05:36.199> of<00:05:36.289> doing

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
work and I would be very leery of doing

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.759 
work and I would be very leery of doing
so<00:05:37.069> using<00:05:37.999> basically<00:05:38.689> two<00:05:38.869> pumps<00:05:39.259> one<00:05:39.469> to<00:05:39.589> take

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:39.769 
so using basically two pumps one to take

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:41.439 
so using basically two pumps one to take
the<00:05:39.949> water<00:05:40.249> from<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.610> tank<00:05:40.789> down<00:05:41.059> into<00:05:41.330> the

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
the water from the tank down into the

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.999 
the water from the tank down into the
sump<00:05:41.719> and<00:05:41.869> the<00:05:41.929> other<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.289> return<00:05:42.619> the<00:05:42.830> water

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
sump and the other to return the water

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:45.399 
sump and the other to return the water
from<00:05:43.279> the<00:05:43.369> sump<00:05:43.550> to<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.789> tank<00:05:44.089> I<00:05:44.360> would<00:05:45.229> not

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
from the sump to the tank I would not

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.249 
from the sump to the tank I would not
want<00:05:45.649> that<00:05:45.769> just<00:05:46.610> for<00:05:46.819> the<00:05:46.879> case<00:05:47.119> of<00:05:47.149> if<00:05:47.959> there

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:48.259 
want that just for the case of if there

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.719 
want that just for the case of if there
was<00:05:48.349> a<00:05:48.379> power<00:05:48.649> failure<00:05:48.769> you're<00:05:49.490> probably

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729 
was a power failure you're probably

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.850 
was a power failure you're probably
going<00:05:49.969> to<00:05:50.029> end<00:05:50.209> up<00:05:50.419> with<00:05:50.629> a<00:05:50.689> big<00:05:50.990> mess<00:05:51.019> and<00:05:51.649> it's

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
going to end up with a big mess and it's

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.129 
going to end up with a big mess and it's
going<00:05:52.189> to<00:05:52.279> be<00:05:52.399> a<00:05:52.429> disaster<00:05:53.059> they<00:05:53.749> all<00:05:53.899> use

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:54.139 
going to be a disaster they all use

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.659 
going to be a disaster they all use
either<00:05:54.529> a<00:05:55.599> gravity<00:05:56.599> style<00:05:56.929> feed<00:05:57.319> such<00:05:58.159> as<00:05:58.189> the
