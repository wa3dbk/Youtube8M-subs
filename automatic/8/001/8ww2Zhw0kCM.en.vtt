00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:09.389
 eth as already always first hand for 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 all those who accompany one is better 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.880
 let's play 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.750
 I'm giving this news here that neither 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.090
 even the Brazilian publisher 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.400
 showed it's true I'm the spoil 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.439
 Pleasures I love Your Pleasure State Are 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.539
 spoiling the pleasure of the global game 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.320
 informing them that they bought the daybreak 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:32.160
 because it is simple for the company to 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.000
 developer of online game with posted 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 these days now simply an image 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.590
 which is now showing with all 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.649
 countries that bought the game and the date 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.629
 They bought the game and signed the contract. 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.200
 between china turkey and other countries 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:52.530
 We have Brazil bought the daybreak. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.180
 by global games 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.239
 in another image that I'm going to put now 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.149
 who is kind a soon a promo with a magician 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.760
 constellation direct action encounters 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.090
 Strange is this translation, I believe it is. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.130
 a tradition that the very adoption and made 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.970
 why translate the game name to 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.460
 rupture days understood i believe the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.220
 global games will not do this shit is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.729
 this crap to put the name of the game 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.880
 with break days put the name of the game 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.100
 no tie break why I think I gave break 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.229
 It's not one, it's nothing. Imagine the Brazilian. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.329
 Speak for the love of God, you understand. 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.240
 consequently the game will not have 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.280
 no one will call daybreak online 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.790
 Brazil was not called a baby 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.790
 dbr understood it will usually be like this 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.619
 which will continue well for what you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.710
 can be seeing there in training for who 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.740
 do not know how to break it is an action is 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.549
 best based on Tange Homs where he 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.790
 has a good pace and very high action 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.520
 the style c9 dragon style in s 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.460
 he is also called the dragon in this 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.369
 clone because of their action 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.259
 distanced and he anime graphics 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.170
 but I think the daybreak is a bit better 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.930
 because I like anne's chart more 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.880
 when he is more adult and not so chip 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.400
 not so child told dragon in this self 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.380
 I really liked to play said between 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.319
 other things that daybreak also have 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.480
 q combos and more common says that those who 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.880
 they play a monster over there and tetra 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.250
 Are you seeing the little man and leaving? 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.720
 drawing but it already appears knocking I guess 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.970
 very cool this magician is very cool 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.050
 I liked it, it felt sorry for him. 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.510
 classrooms but it is well 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.250
 in another thing I can tell the game 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.120
 will also have support for rotating 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.310
 directly from the web browser to develop 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.950
 already confirmed this I do not know if the global 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.750
 games will make this service available and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.940
 make the game via the web 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.549
 browser you can also download online 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.930
 you can play by the browser directly 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.720
 I do not know if they will make it available 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.569
 but something else is going to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.450
 My personal opinions on this game 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.180
 In Brazil I think the global games she 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.370
 made an extremely violent acquisition 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.590
 understood why they brought 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.410
 everything the Brazilian likes lately 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.670
 which is the action on which is the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.060
 anime, incredible as it may seem 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.790
 Brazilian like anime style is the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.350
 action of e 9 in Portuguese 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.410
 This game is going to bomb I'm sure 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.880
 of the global games really there I 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.340
 I think it took a lot on that acquisition and 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.459
 well I think the other poor people will have 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.829
 What are you going to have to shake a little more 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.260
 to be able to get a title that 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.049
 can you hit the front with 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.180
 two break because it is in fact a 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.010
 great title it closely resembles 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.390
 c 9 and up to the graph there is anime kÃª 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.750
 games with people who love dragon 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.079
 this one has to understand that it is only an angel but 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:03.090
 this is something that can be 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.100
 revealed many Brazilians with certainty 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.380
 go look this make a bullshit has a 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.950
 past of very big people who play and 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.319
 9 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.750
 another very large portion that plays 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.180
 in the chacretes with tears gracious 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.840
 having then you see une in Portuguese 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.060
 anime and action graphics in brazil and has 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.400
 sure that Brazilian players who 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.139
 just play games and in portuguese 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.870
 and they wonder if they stay here in the 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.970
 channel asking directly about whether the king 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.160
 of the crisis will have served in Portuguese 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.800
 if the c9 will always have 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.330
 Portuguese brazilian tea who gave the 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.440
 dragon in st 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.030
 well then your wish was more 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.669
 more or less, well, who does not have 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.669
 dog with cat then that was what 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.289
 happened daybreak in brazil 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.750
 I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:59.960
 You liked it there, it spoils you. 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:02.400
 global game released will do i already know 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.940
 How do you know why I 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.070
 I follow the display, my son, I just do not 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.850
 There's nothing you're doing that 's 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.110
 who does not understand the display is 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.680
 son of a bitch 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.780
 he is aiaia the guy can observe this 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.180
 To the house I just want to say it really is 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.849
 A very boring guy, well guys, I hope 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.210
 have enjoyed the novelty there without 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:39.690
 official dates for god's sake do not 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:42.030
 stay in the comments by asking brother 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.699
 game I have not even opened website I'm talking 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.979
 of the game will be released in Brazil before 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:49.710
 even the publisher itself gives some 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:52.260
 nothing seems to be about the game then 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.800
 Until the moment I posted this video 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.349
 no this game has no official date yet 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.840
 I did not understand website has no download 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.729
 You got nothing, you're only going to stay. 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.000
 knowing that this game will come to Brazil 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.500
 sure unless the 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.240
 chinese company 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.699
 the Brazilian company breaks the contract 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.010
 there if the contract has certain 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.169
 I believe that for global duck games not 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:20.610
 because this game is sure to be 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:23.250
 so one is going to be a big deal here 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.930
 in Brazil because it's going to be the 2nd action is 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.599
 It's best to enter Brazil, the 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.610
 first was the dolphin magic only that the 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.430
 big difference that I believe is 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.090
 between the world of magic and the tie-break are 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.380
 the graphics that 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:41.740
 one is more American style style 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.949
 and already stayed at the understood and hates break 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.350
 ever oriental, I never think that the 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.900
 He likes Brazilian graphics. 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.880
 Oriental has understood it is no wonder that games 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:59.460
 common online and jeter was in fact a 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:05.320
 Cabal forced that the lunia hub a big x 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:09.760
 flu fan are so successful here in 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.080
 Brazil then again is soon 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.419
 Congratulations, I hope he makes a good 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.889
 I work with this break 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.560
 I really hope you do a good job 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.060
 so that they can hurry and I hope to 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.280

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.370

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.010
 He explains that they also want 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.240
