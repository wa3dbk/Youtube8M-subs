this bit here the back is completely
closed<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.229> bootie<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> you

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
closed or it is like a bootie that you

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.060 
closed or it is like a bootie that you
cut<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> top<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> sides<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> thought

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
cut the top and the sides so I thought

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.109

they look really well and we had black
jeans<00:01:31.799> also<00:01:32.250> because<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.990> kind<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.439> maybe

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
jeans also because you kind of maybe

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.929 
jeans also because you kind of maybe
imagined<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.280> they<00:01:35.460> might<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> like

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
imagined that they might be like

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359 
imagined that they might be like
gladiators<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> go<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.259> way<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.159> your

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
gladiators and go all the way up to your

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.100 
gladiators and go all the way up to your
knees<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:40.790> yeah<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.030> normally<00:01:42.630> don't<00:01:42.780> pair

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
knees and yeah I normally don't pair

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.499 
knees and yeah I normally don't pair
them<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:44.250> skirts<00:01:44.729> because<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.210> summer<00:01:45.420> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
them with skirts because in the summer I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.319 
them with skirts because in the summer I
don't<00:01:45.780> really<00:01:45.990> wear<00:01:46.170> many<00:01:46.890> jeans<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:47.490> they

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
don't really wear many jeans but they

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.289 
don't really wear many jeans but they
are<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:49.020> versatile<00:01:49.500> pair<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> shoes

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
are a really versatile pair of shoes

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.460 
are a really versatile pair of shoes
because<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.540> are<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.840> close<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> back

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
because they are so close at the back

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.950 
because they are so close at the back
you<00:01:52.619> can<00:01:52.799> wear<00:01:53.189> them<00:01:53.430> maybe<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.360> bit<00:01:54.750> longer

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you can wear them maybe a bit longer

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.359 
you can wear them maybe a bit longer
than<00:01:55.170> if<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.649> were<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:55.890> playing
