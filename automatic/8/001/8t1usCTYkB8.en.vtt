00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
flop over to the side but I'm not sure

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.550 
flop over to the side but I'm not sure
if<00:05:32.280> I'm<00:05:32.400> doing<00:05:32.430> it<00:05:32.850> right<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:33.600> I<00:05:34.080> feel<00:05:34.410> like

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
if I'm doing it right so I feel like

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.890 
if I'm doing it right so I feel like
it's<00:05:34.710> kind<00:05:34.949> of<00:05:35.160> coming<00:05:35.430> out<00:05:35.520> weird<00:05:35.940> but<00:05:36.300> it's

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
it's kind of coming out weird but it's

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.339 
it's kind of coming out weird but it's
really<00:05:37.020> hard<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:38.880> build<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.419> survival<00:05:40.020> without

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
really hard to build in survival without

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:44.480 
really hard to build in survival without
falling<00:05:41.009> and<00:05:41.330> dying<00:05:42.330> and<00:05:42.919> not<00:05:43.919> being<00:05:44.160> able<00:05:44.310> to

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
falling and dying and not being able to

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.200 
falling and dying and not being able to
go<00:05:44.880> into<00:05:45.060> creative<00:05:45.720> to<00:05:45.960> build<00:05:46.229> things<00:05:46.830> in<00:05:47.669> high

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210 
go into creative to build things in high

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.770 
go into creative to build things in high
places<00:05:49.070> so<00:05:50.070> I'm<00:05:50.190> trying<00:05:50.490> to<00:05:50.550> be<00:05:50.699> as<00:05:50.849> careful<00:05:51.300> as

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
places so I'm trying to be as careful as

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.570 
places so I'm trying to be as careful as
possible<00:05:52.169> so<00:05:53.009> that<00:05:53.039> I<00:05:53.190> don't<00:05:53.310> fall<00:05:53.820> and<00:05:54.440> yeah

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
possible so that I don't fall and yeah

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.900 
possible so that I don't fall and yeah
so<00:05:56.580> let's<00:05:57.330> place<00:05:57.599> this<00:05:57.810> block<00:05:58.169> here<00:05:58.710> and<00:05:58.770> oh<00:05:59.340> oh

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
so let's place this block here and oh oh

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.060 
so let's place this block here and oh oh
that<00:06:00.780> could<00:06:00.960> have<00:06:00.990> been<00:06:01.169> bad<00:06:01.410> that<00:06:01.860> could<00:06:01.949> have

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
that could have been bad that could have

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.520 
that could have been bad that could have
been<00:06:02.160> so<00:06:02.400> bad<00:06:02.639> okay<00:06:03.060> so<00:06:03.720> we're<00:06:04.139> almost<00:06:04.320> done

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
been so bad okay so we're almost done

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.339 
been so bad okay so we're almost done
with<00:06:04.949> the<00:06:05.160> second<00:06:06.150> ear<00:06:06.360> so<00:06:06.840> let's<00:06:07.050> go<00:06:07.229> ahead

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
with the second ear so let's go ahead

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:10.339

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
and place the pink hardened clay on the

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:14.529 
and place the pink hardened clay on the
inside<00:06:10.830> and<00:06:11.599> let's<00:06:12.599> put<00:06:13.020> that<00:06:13.199> in<00:06:13.409> here<00:06:13.800> and

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
inside and let's put that in here and

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.080 
inside and let's put that in here and
oops<00:06:15.539> uh<00:06:15.750> I<00:06:16.050> place<00:06:16.500> that<00:06:16.710> in<00:06:16.979> the<00:06:17.070> wrong<00:06:17.250> area

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
oops uh I place that in the wrong area

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.149 
oops uh I place that in the wrong area
but<00:06:18.780> that's<00:06:18.900> okay<00:06:19.169> we<00:06:19.320> could<00:06:19.440> take<00:06:19.590> it<00:06:19.680> off<00:06:19.800> and

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
but that's okay we could take it off and

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.089 
but that's okay we could take it off and
let's<00:06:20.490> go<00:06:20.550> ahead<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:21.090> clean<00:06:21.389> up<00:06:21.800> all<00:06:22.800> the

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
let's go ahead and clean up all the

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:25.310 
let's go ahead and clean up all the
blocks<00:06:23.340> that<00:06:23.639> I<00:06:23.669> was<00:06:23.849> using<00:06:24.060> to<00:06:24.240> step<00:06:24.690> on<00:06:24.870> to

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
blocks that I was using to step on to

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.570 
blocks that I was using to step on to
build<00:06:26.250> off<00:06:26.490> of<00:06:26.520> and<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:27.990> think<00:06:28.349> we're<00:06:28.770> pretty

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
build off of and I think we're pretty

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.839 
build off of and I think we're pretty
much<00:06:29.729> done<00:06:30.330> with<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:31.020> outside<00:06:31.860> of<00:06:32.280> the<00:06:32.669> house

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
much done with the outside of the house

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.210 
much done with the outside of the house
I'll<00:06:33.240> probably<00:06:33.659> go<00:06:33.900> ahead<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.320> add<00:06:34.440> some<00:06:34.860> more

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
I'll probably go ahead and add some more

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.820 
I'll probably go ahead and add some more
things<00:06:35.789> eventually<00:06:36.449> but<00:06:36.720> so<00:06:37.110> far<00:06:37.409> I<00:06:37.710> think

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
things eventually but so far I think

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.550 
things eventually but so far I think
this<00:06:38.220> is<00:06:38.340> how<00:06:38.490> I<00:06:38.729> want<00:06:38.970> it<00:06:39.060> to<00:06:39.210> look<00:06:39.419> so<00:06:40.229> this<00:06:40.440> is

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
this is how I want it to look so this is

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.620 
this is how I want it to look so this is
how<00:06:40.710> the<00:06:40.770> outside<00:06:41.159> of<00:06:41.669> my<00:06:41.849> little<00:06:42.120> bunny<00:06:42.360> hole

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630
