hi<00:00:06.420> guys<00:00:06.629> welcome<00:00:06.990> back<00:00:08.330> today<00:00:09.330> I'd<00:00:09.420> like<00:00:09.450> to

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
hi guys welcome back today I'd like to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.140 
hi guys welcome back today I'd like to
talk<00:00:09.809> about<00:00:09.960> chord<00:00:10.889> voicings<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:12.950> particular

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
talk about chord voicings and particular

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.550 
talk about chord voicings and particular
concept<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.360> within<00:00:15.750> chord<00:00:16.109> voicings

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
concept with it within chord voicings

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.340 
concept with it within chord voicings
which<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.920> how<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:17.640> chords<00:00:18.390> simpler

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
which is how can we make chords simpler

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.490 
which is how can we make chords simpler
while<00:00:20.100> retaining<00:00:20.490> their<00:00:20.850> important<00:00:21.510> harmonic

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
while retaining their important harmonic

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.420 
while retaining their important harmonic
properties<00:00:24.439> let's<00:00:25.439> start<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.710> an<00:00:25.890> example

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
properties let's start with an example

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.150 
properties let's start with an example
and<00:00:27.050> suppose<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.199> won't<00:00:28.289> start<00:00:28.619> sound

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
and suppose it won't start sound

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.279 
and suppose it won't start sound
sophisticated<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.330> go<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.810> jazz<00:00:31.080> book

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
sophisticated so you go to a jazz book

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.569 
sophisticated so you go to a jazz book
and<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.619> look<00:00:31.769> up<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> most<00:00:32.160> complicated

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
and you look up the most complicated

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.850 
and you look up the most complicated
quarter<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:34.200> turns<00:00:34.440> out<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.620> be<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
quarter is and that turns out to be a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.880 
quarter is and that turns out to be a
thirteenth<00:00:35.370> chord<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.320> go<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.649> build

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
thirteenth chord so you go and you build

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.430 
thirteenth chord so you go and you build
a<00:00:38.070> thirteenth<00:00:38.520> chord<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.120> say<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> C<00:00:40.260> dominant

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
a thirteenth chord on say the C dominant

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.590 
a thirteenth chord on say the C dominant
scale<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.950> it<00:00:43.950> sounds<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.450> what

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
scale and it sounds like this so what

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.529 
scale and it sounds like this so what
you've<00:00:45.719> actually<00:00:45.870> done<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> you've<00:00:46.500> taken<00:00:47.539> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
you've actually done is you've taken the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.560 
you've actually done is you've taken the
scale<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:50.149> you've<00:00:51.149> built<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> chord<00:00:52.050> by

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
scale and you've built up the chord by

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.910 
scale and you've built up the chord by
playing<00:00:54.570> its<00:00:54.750> degree<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.320> get<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.710> start

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
playing its degree so you get to start

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.540 
playing its degree so you get to start
with<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> first<00:00:56.370> degree<00:00:56.870> the<00:00:57.870> third<00:00:58.430> then<00:00:59.430> you

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
with the first degree the third then you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.090 
with the first degree the third then you
have<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> fifth<00:01:00.199> the<00:01:01.199> seventh<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.940> ninth<00:01:04.100> ten

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
have the fifth the seventh the ninth ten

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
have the fifth the seventh the ninth ten
eleven<00:01:05.729> twelve<00:01:06.570> thirteen<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> C

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
eleven twelve thirteen so this is a C

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.010 
eleven twelve thirteen so this is a C
thirteenth<00:01:10.979> chord<00:01:11.280> now<00:01:14.240> this<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> usually<00:01:15.540> not

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
thirteenth chord now this is usually not

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.469 
thirteenth chord now this is usually not
played<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.340> C<00:01:17.580> 13th<00:01:17.939> chords<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.360> not

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
played you know C 13th chords are not

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
played you know C 13th chords are not
usually<00:01:18.840> play<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.170> way<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.490> couple<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
usually play this way for a couple of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.539 
usually play this way for a couple of
reasons<00:01:21.420> first<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.040> particular

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
reasons first of all this particular

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.880 
reasons first of all this particular
voicing<00:01:23.970> sounds<00:01:24.420> huge<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.290> sort<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.560> hugs

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
voicing sounds huge so it sort of hugs

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.390 
voicing sounds huge so it sort of hugs
up<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.369> frequency<00:01:27.030> range<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.280> doesn't<00:01:29.280> leave

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
up the frequency range and doesn't leave

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.550 
up the frequency range and doesn't leave
any<00:01:29.610> room<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:29.880> other<00:01:30.390> instruments<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.259> play

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
any room for other instruments to play

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.580 
any room for other instruments to play
in<00:01:32.450> our<00:01:33.450> second<00:01:33.720> reason<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.470> you're

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in our second reason is that if you're

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.230 
in our second reason is that if you're
playing<00:01:34.740> alone<00:01:35.070> you're<00:01:35.400> usually<00:01:35.549> using<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
playing alone you're usually using a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.350 
playing alone you're usually using a
left<00:01:36.570> hand<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:37.049> play<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:38.119> harmony<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
left hand to play the harmony and the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.770 
left hand to play the harmony and the
right<00:01:39.990> hand<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.290> play<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.500> melody<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.780> nobody

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
right hand to play the melody and nobody

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.030 
right hand to play the melody and nobody
has<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> hand<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.439> big

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
has a hand this big

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.630 
has a hand this big
not<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> mention<00:01:45.320> nobody<00:01:46.320> has<00:01:46.939> seven<00:01:47.939> fingers

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
not to mention nobody has seven fingers

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.859 
not to mention nobody has seven fingers
so<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.090> find<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.390> way<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.600> simplifying

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
so you have to find a way of simplifying

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.100 
so you have to find a way of simplifying
this<00:01:52.470> chord<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:54.180> simplification<00:01:54.540> will

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
this chord and this simplification will

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.819 
this chord and this simplification will
be<00:01:55.229> based<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.939> observation<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.829> while

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
be based on the observation that while

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.100 
be based on the observation that while
all<00:01:59.159> notes<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.909> degrees<00:02:00.210> were<00:02:00.509> created<00:02:00.990> equal

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
all notes and degrees were created equal

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
all notes and degrees were created equal
some<00:02:01.530> were<00:02:01.680> created<00:02:02.130> more<00:02:02.310> equal<00:02:02.700> than<00:02:02.729> others

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
some were created more equal than others

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.859 
some were created more equal than others
and<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:04.500> turns<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:04.920> can<00:02:05.130> omit<00:02:05.689> many<00:02:06.689> of

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and it turns out you can omit many of

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.480 
and it turns out you can omit many of
these<00:02:06.990> notes<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> C<00:02:07.829> 13

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
these notes in the C 13

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.400 
these notes in the C 13
while<00:02:10.490> still<00:02:10.880> retaining<00:02:11.030> its<00:02:11.450> unique

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
while still retaining its unique

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.610 
while still retaining its unique
harmonic<00:02:12.950> characteristics<00:02:14.380> I'm<00:02:15.380> going<00:02:15.560> to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
harmonic characteristics I'm going to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.930 
harmonic characteristics I'm going to
give<00:02:15.710> you<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.890> rules<00:02:16.100> and<00:02:16.280> I'm<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.670> I'm

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
give you the rules and I'm going to I'm

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.980 
give you the rules and I'm going to I'm
going<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.180> try<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.510> justify<00:02:17.780> them<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.750> most

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
going to try and justify them the most

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.700 
going to try and justify them the most
important<00:02:21.560> degrees<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.110> should<00:02:24.440> keep

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
important degrees that you should keep

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.040 
important degrees that you should keep
are<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.760> third<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:27.770> seventh<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:29.050> the

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
are the third the seventh and the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.380 
are the third the seventh and the
highest<00:02:30.320> degree<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.710> makes<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.430> chord<00:02:31.820> what

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
highest degree that makes the chord what

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.750 
highest degree that makes the chord what
it<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:32.960> this<00:02:33.080> case<00:02:33.290> is<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.500> C<00:02:33.770> 13th<00:02:34.190> cord<00:02:34.490> so

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
it is in this case is a C 13th cord so

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.760 
it is in this case is a C 13th cord so
it's<00:02:34.910> 13th<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.530> degree<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.660> we<00:02:38.990> can<00:02:39.530> omit

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
it's 13th is that degree so we can omit

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.890 
it's 13th is that degree so we can omit
everything<00:02:40.280> else<00:02:40.490> and<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:40.820> stay<00:02:41.660> with<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
everything else and just stay with the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.600 
everything else and just stay with the
3rd<00:02:42.490> 7th<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:43.730> 13th<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.100> still<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> bit<00:02:46.460> too

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
3rd 7th and 13th this is still a bit too

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.150 
3rd 7th and 13th this is still a bit too
large<00:02:46.820> so<00:02:47.300> I'm<00:02:47.390> going<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.680> transpose<00:02:48.680> this<00:02:48.890> e

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
large so I'm going to transpose this e

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.970 
large so I'm going to transpose this e
up<00:02:49.730> an<00:02:50.210> octave<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:51.610> end<00:02:52.610> up<00:02:52.730> with<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:52.970> shape

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.040 

so<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.430> is<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.610> perfectly<00:02:59.030> valid<00:02:59.090> voicing<00:02:59.900> of

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
so this is a perfectly valid voicing of

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:18.800 
so this is a perfectly valid voicing of
the<00:03:00.200> C<00:03:00.410> 13

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.800 

so<00:03:20.129> what<00:03:21.129> makes<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:21.459> permissible<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.360> throw

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
so what makes it permissible to throw

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.509 
so what makes it permissible to throw
almost<00:03:23.050> everything<00:03:23.620> away<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.099> we've<00:03:24.370> thrown

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
almost everything away so we've thrown

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.979 
almost everything away so we've thrown
away<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.349> root<00:03:26.349> 5th<00:03:26.800> 9th<00:03:27.489> 11th<00:03:28.150> we<00:03:28.629> actually

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
away the root 5th 9th 11th we actually

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.920 
away the root 5th 9th 11th we actually
threw<00:03:29.500> out<00:03:29.739> more<00:03:30.400> than<00:03:30.550> we<00:03:30.730> kept<00:03:30.970> we've

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
threw out more than we kept we've

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.089 
threw out more than we kept we've
omitted<00:03:32.620> 4<00:03:33.130> nodes<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.459> kept<00:03:33.670> 3<00:03:34.680> so<00:03:35.680> this<00:03:35.830> comes

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
omitted 4 nodes and kept 3 so this comes

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.440 
omitted 4 nodes and kept 3 so this comes
from<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.370> following<00:03:36.670> observation<00:03:37.239> let's

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
from the following observation let's

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.630 
from the following observation let's
take<00:03:37.599> a<00:03:37.630> 7th<00:03:38.050> chord<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.530> there<00:03:39.130> are<00:03:39.190> different

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
take a 7th chord and there are different

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.559 
take a 7th chord and there are different
types<00:03:39.819> of<00:03:39.970> 7th<00:03:40.299> chords<00:03:40.630> there's<00:03:40.870> a<00:03:40.959> C<00:03:41.200> major<00:03:41.380> so

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
types of 7th chords there's a C major so

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.330 
types of 7th chords there's a C major so
let's<00:03:43.569> take<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.750> seat<00:03:44.019> just<00:03:44.379> be<00:03:45.040> concrete

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
let's take a seat just be concrete

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.339 
let's take a seat just be concrete
there's<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.269> c7<00:03:47.260> C<00:03:47.739> minor<00:03:47.950> 7<00:03:48.690> C<00:03:49.690> minor<00:03:49.870> 7th

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
there's a c7 C minor 7 C minor 7th

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.910 
there's a c7 C minor 7 C minor 7th
augmented<00:03:50.950> C<00:03:51.250> minor<00:03:51.430> augmented<00:03:51.549> 7th<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:53.319> you

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
augmented C minor augmented 7th and you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.380 
augmented C minor augmented 7th and you
can<00:03:54.040> see<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:57.730> going<00:03:58.000> through<00:03:58.269> these

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
can see that just going through these

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.990 
can see that just going through these
different<00:03:58.900> shapes<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.980> only<00:04:00.280> two<00:04:00.430> notes<00:04:00.670> that

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
different shapes the only two notes that

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.960 
different shapes the only two notes that
change<00:04:01.769> are<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:03.130> 3rd<00:04:03.989> which<00:04:05.579> changes<00:04:06.579> between

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
change are the 3rd which changes between

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:15.630 
change are the 3rd which changes between
major<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:07.540> minor<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.019> the<00:04:08.500> 7th<00:04:14.459> so<00:04:15.459> that

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
major and minor and the 7th so that

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.940 
major and minor and the 7th so that
makes<00:04:15.880> them<00:04:16.150> the<00:04:16.630> notes<00:04:16.840> that<00:04:16.989> give<00:04:17.350> this<00:04:17.590> the

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
makes them the notes that give this the

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.250 
makes them the notes that give this the
core<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.609> you're<00:04:18.729> playing<00:04:19.030> it's<00:04:19.359> special

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
core that you're playing it's special

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.460 
core that you're playing it's special
harmonic<00:04:21.130> color<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.930> therefore<00:04:22.930> those<00:04:23.289> are

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
harmonic color and therefore those are

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.409 
harmonic color and therefore those are
the<00:04:23.560> notes<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.160> should<00:04:24.340> keep<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:27.419> upon

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
the notes that you should keep and upon

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.629 
the notes that you should keep and upon
extending<00:04:28.870> this<00:04:29.020> chord<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:32.430> turns<00:04:33.430> out<00:04:33.550> that

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
extending this chord it turns out that

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.150 
extending this chord it turns out that
the<00:04:34.030> most<00:04:34.180> important<00:04:34.630> part<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:35.020> that<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.620> note

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
the most important part is that the note

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.250 
the most important part is that the note
that<00:04:36.430> makes<00:04:36.700> this<00:04:36.850> chord<00:04:37.210> unique<00:04:37.539> the<00:04:38.080> more

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
that makes this chord unique the more

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.260 
that makes this chord unique the more
chord<00:04:38.650> no<00:04:38.950> that<00:04:39.130> makes<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.460> chord<00:04:39.729> gives<00:04:40.150> the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
chord no that makes the chord gives the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.969 
chord no that makes the chord gives the
chord<00:04:40.479> its<00:04:40.630> special<00:04:41.169> color<00:04:41.200> in<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.560> case<00:04:41.770> in

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
chord its special color in this case in

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.080 
chord its special color in this case in

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
a c-13 it has to be the 13th note if say

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.170 
a c-13 it has to be the 13th note if say
for<00:04:46.120> example<00:04:46.660> were<00:04:46.780> playing<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.139> c-13<00:04:47.440> with<00:04:47.889> a

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
for example were playing a c-13 with a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.779 
for example were playing a c-13 with a
sharp<00:04:49.180> 11<00:04:49.650> it's<00:04:50.650> not<00:04:50.860> just<00:04:51.039> a<00:04:51.130> regular<00:04:51.310> Levin

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
sharp 11 it's not just a regular Levin

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.140 
sharp 11 it's not just a regular Levin
button<00:04:52.120> go<00:04:52.750> vented<00:04:53.050> one

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
button go vented one

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.969 
button go vented one
you'd<00:04:56.150> probably<00:04:56.360> also<00:04:56.750> want<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:56.990> keep<00:04:57.259> this

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
you'd probably also want to keep this

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.890 
you'd probably also want to keep this
move<00:04:58.250> as<00:04:58.460> well<00:04:58.669> so<00:04:58.970> instead<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.270> playing<00:04:59.660> the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
move as well so instead of playing the

move as well so instead of playing the
c13<00:05:00.470> exists<00:05:01.160> you'd<00:05:01.940> also<00:05:02.180> add<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.720> Augmented

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
c13 exists you'd also add the Augmented

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:11.980 
c13 exists you'd also add the Augmented
eleventh<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:10.310> leads<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.699> the<00:05:11.419> concept<00:05:11.599> of<00:05:11.870> a

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
eleventh this leads to the concept of a

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.680 
eleventh this leads to the concept of a
tritone<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:13.039> concept<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.580> as<00:05:14.120> follows<00:05:14.479> if

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
tritone and the concept is as follows if

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.580 
tritone and the concept is as follows if
you<00:05:14.840> have<00:05:14.930> a<00:05:14.990> seventh<00:05:15.349> chord<00:05:15.729> c<00:05:16.729> c7<00:05:17.590> we've

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
you have a seventh chord c c7 we've

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.700 
you have a seventh chord c c7 we've
remarked<00:05:19.340> that<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:20.330> third<00:05:20.660> and<00:05:20.900> seventh<00:05:21.590> are

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
remarked that the third and seventh are

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.040 
remarked that the third and seventh are
the<00:05:21.860> most<00:05:22.039> important<00:05:22.490> notes<00:05:22.699> and<00:05:22.970> many<00:05:23.690> people

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
the most important notes and many people

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.180 
the most important notes and many people
omit<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:25.069> root<00:05:25.580> and<00:05:25.819> fifth<00:05:26.360> when<00:05:27.259> playing<00:05:27.530> 7th

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
omit the root and fifth when playing 7th

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.649 
omit the root and fifth when playing 7th
chords<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.669> just<00:05:31.090> stick<00:05:32.090> with<00:05:32.240> these<00:05:32.449> two

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
chords and just stick with these two

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.490 
chords and just stick with these two
third<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:33.319> seventh<00:05:33.620> degrees

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.860 

they're<00:05:36.949> called<00:05:37.190> Triton<00:05:37.699> and<00:05:37.909> the<00:05:38.479> reason<00:05:38.750> is

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
they're called Triton and the reason is

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.050 
they're called Triton and the reason is
that<00:05:38.900> there<00:05:39.409> are<00:05:39.470> exactly<00:05:39.710> three<00:05:39.860> whole<00:05:40.729> tones

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
that there are exactly three whole tones

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:48.990 
that there are exactly three whole tones
separating<00:05:41.960> them<00:05:42.169> so<00:05:42.500> it's<00:05:43.090> one<00:05:44.090> two<00:05:44.770> three

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.520 

so<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.060> got<00:05:50.210> to<00:05:50.330> conclude<00:05:50.930> with<00:05:51.110> an<00:05:51.200> example

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
so I got to conclude with an example

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.230 
so I got to conclude with an example
that's<00:05:51.740> taken<00:05:52.100> from<00:05:52.250> a<00:05:52.370> song<00:05:52.610> on<00:05:52.760> my<00:05:52.880> channel

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
that's taken from a song on my channel

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.230 
that's taken from a song on my channel
which<00:05:53.390> I've<00:05:53.570> called<00:05:53.810> the<00:05:54.050> Logitech<00:05:54.500> Blues<00:05:54.800> and

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
which I've called the Logitech Blues and

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.200 
which I've called the Logitech Blues and
this<00:05:56.240> song<00:05:56.480> has<00:05:56.810> a<00:05:57.740> harmonic<00:05:58.460> progression

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
this song has a harmonic progression

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:09.430 
this song has a harmonic progression
that<00:05:59.360> goes<00:05:59.750> like<00:05:59.930> this<00:06:00.110> so<00:06:08.200> what<00:06:09.200> I'm<00:06:09.290> actually

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 
that goes like this so what I'm actually

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.890 
that goes like this so what I'm actually
playing<00:06:09.830> here<00:06:10.190> is<00:06:10.370> a<00:06:10.430> C<00:06:10.790> sub<00:06:11.030> as<00:06:11.180> a<00:06:11.240> sorry<00:06:11.660> is<00:06:11.780> an

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
playing here is a C sub as a sorry is an

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:27.090 
playing here is a C sub as a sorry is an
e<00:06:12.050> 7th<00:06:13.240> to<00:06:14.240> an<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.450> 7th<00:06:16.990> to<00:06:17.990> a<00:06:18.020> d7<00:06:19.750> to<00:06:20.750> a<00:06:20.780> g7<00:06:23.620> to<00:06:24.620> see

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.260 

and<00:06:29.650> I'm<00:06:30.650> actually<00:06:30.830> taking<00:06:31.160> just<00:06:31.550> the<00:06:31.730> Tritons

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
and I'm actually taking just the Tritons

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.850 
and I'm actually taking just the Tritons
of<00:06:32.450> each<00:06:32.600> of<00:06:32.750> these<00:06:32.870> scores<00:06:33.170> so<00:06:33.470> instead<00:06:33.650> of<00:06:33.770> an

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
of each of these scores so instead of an

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.720 
of each of these scores so instead of an
e<00:06:33.980> 7th<00:06:34.400> I'm<00:06:34.520> just<00:06:34.820> playing<00:06:35.090> the<00:06:35.780> 3rd<00:06:36.490> m77<00:06:37.490> for<00:06:37.610> a

e 7th I'm just playing the 3rd m77 for a

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.440 
e 7th I'm just playing the 3rd m77 for a
seven<00:06:38.120> to<00:06:38.240> play<00:06:38.270> the<00:06:38.480> 3rd<00:06:38.840> and<00:06:39.050> 7th<00:06:40.330> instead<00:06:41.330> of

seven to play the 3rd and 7th instead of

a D 7th just bring this instead of

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.760 
a D 7th just bring this instead of
accusing<00:06:45.260> you<00:06:45.920> just<00:06:46.130> playing<00:06:46.400> this<00:06:47.770> so

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
accusing you just playing this so

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.750 
accusing you just playing this so
instead<00:06:49.670> of<00:06:49.730> this

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:07:00.010 

I'm<00:06:53.210> doing<00:06:53.570> something<00:06:53.780> that<00:06:58.720> I'm<00:06:59.720> even

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
I'm doing something that I'm even

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.480 
I'm doing something that I'm even
simplifying<00:07:00.500> it<00:07:00.650> more<00:07:00.920> because<00:07:01.160> I'm

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
simplifying it more because I'm

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.430 
simplifying it more because I'm
inverting<00:07:02.300> the<00:07:02.420> troit<00:07:02.660> on<00:07:02.840> you<00:07:02.930> if<00:07:03.170> I<00:07:03.260> play

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 
inverting the troit on you if I play

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.950 
inverting the troit on you if I play
this<00:07:03.820> if<00:07:04.820> I<00:07:04.940> play<00:07:05.090> this<00:07:05.270> it's<00:07:05.630> going<00:07:05.720> to<00:07:05.810> be<00:07:05.870> the

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
this if I play this it's going to be the

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.700 
this if I play this it's going to be the
same<00:07:06.170> thing<00:07:06.410> right<00:07:06.590> because<00:07:06.710> I'm<00:07:07.010> just<00:07:07.250> moving

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
same thing right because I'm just moving

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.460 
same thing right because I'm just moving
this<00:07:09.710> c-sharp<00:07:10.490> thing<00:07:10.810> up<00:07:11.810> or<00:07:12.080> down<00:07:12.230> an<00:07:12.350> octave

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470 
this c-sharp thing up or down an octave

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:18.310 
this c-sharp thing up or down an octave
in<00:07:12.830> octave<00:07:14.230> so<00:07:15.230> from<00:07:15.530> a<00:07:15.680> an<00:07:15.890> e7<00:07:16.760> I<00:07:17.030> go<00:07:17.750> to<00:07:17.810> an<00:07:17.990> a7

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:18.320 
in octave so from a an e7 I go to an a7

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.460 
in octave so from a an e7 I go to an a7
but<00:07:18.650> I<00:07:18.680> played<00:07:19.210> by<00:07:20.210> taking<00:07:20.540> the<00:07:20.660> G<00:07:20.840> down<00:07:20.990> dr.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.470 
but I played by taking the G down dr.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.580 
but I played by taking the G down dr.
Simon<00:07:22.040> working<00:07:22.370> it<00:07:23.200> so<00:07:24.200> a<00:07:24.230> seven<00:07:24.740> to<00:07:24.950> a<00:07:24.980> 7<00:07:25.100> to<00:07:25.910> d7

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
Simon working it so a seven to a 7 to d7

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:41.480 
Simon working it so a seven to a 7 to d7
to<00:07:28.120> g7<00:07:29.120> which<00:07:29.380> is<00:07:30.380> the<00:07:30.620> inverted<00:07:31.040> form<00:07:31.340> of<00:07:31.900> this

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.130 

so<00:07:42.490> that's<00:07:42.670> it<00:07:42.820> for<00:07:43.570> now<00:07:43.720> I<00:07:43.750> hope<00:07:43.870> you've

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:45.820
