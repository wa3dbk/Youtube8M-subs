00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
don't think so taking pork Dennis ice

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.100 
don't think so taking pork Dennis ice
cold<00:02:36.140> out<00:02:36.319> of<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.500> fridge<00:02:37.450> then<00:02:38.450> for<00:02:38.750> one<00:02:38.959> that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
cold out of the fridge then for one that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.140 
cold out of the fridge then for one that
you've<00:02:39.260> had<00:02:39.379> sitting<00:02:39.739> out<00:02:39.890> on<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.670> table<00:02:41.060> for

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
you've had sitting out on the table for

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.229 
you've had sitting out on the table for
a<00:02:41.209> half-hour<00:02:41.540> maybe<00:02:41.810> even<00:02:42.049> 45<00:02:42.319> minutes

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
a half-hour maybe even 45 minutes

a half-hour maybe even 45 minutes
probably<00:02:44.239> glass<00:02:44.569> side<00:02:44.900> by<00:02:45.049> side<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.379> they

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
probably glass side by side and they

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.890 
probably glass side by side and they
taste<00:02:45.709> like<00:02:45.769> different<00:02:46.190> beer<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:47.750> really

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
taste like different beer it's really

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
good very good point very good point

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.599 
good very good point very good point
you<00:02:51.709> did<00:02:51.890> great<00:02:52.040> what<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.370> think<00:02:52.519> your

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
you did great what do you think your

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.940 
you did great what do you think your
first<00:02:52.849> beer<00:02:53.060> well<00:02:53.480> I<00:02:53.510> mean<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.019> was<00:02:54.170> uh<00:02:54.440> you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
first beer well I mean it was uh you

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.780 
first beer well I mean it was uh you
know<00:02:55.040> with<00:02:55.220> your<00:02:55.400> help<00:02:55.609> it<00:02:55.849> was<00:02:56.000> easy<00:02:56.209> yeah<00:02:56.690> I

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
know with your help it was easy yeah I

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.940 
know with your help it was easy yeah I
think<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.849> was<00:02:58.970> just<00:02:59.120> an<00:02:59.299> initial<00:03:00.019> Sunday<00:03:00.680> that

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
think it was just an initial Sunday that

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.909 
think it was just an initial Sunday that
was<00:03:01.099> all<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.519> all<00:03:02.389> the<00:03:02.599> work<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.139> know<00:03:03.260> ends

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
was all the all the work you know ends

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.770 
was all the all the work you know ends
you<00:03:04.130> boil<00:03:04.609> everything<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.419> add<00:03:05.599> everything

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
you boil everything and add everything

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.309 
you boil everything and add everything
but<00:03:06.380> after<00:03:06.530> that<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:07.160> was<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:08.209> was<00:03:08.359> relatively

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
but after that it was it was relatively

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.949 
but after that it was it was relatively
maintenance<00:03:09.950> free<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.849> I<00:03:11.180> think<00:03:11.450> I<00:03:11.690> could<00:03:11.840> do

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
maintenance free so I think I could do

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.400 
maintenance free so I think I could do
it<00:03:12.079> again<00:03:12.169> yeah<00:03:13.010> I<00:03:13.190> mean<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.459> know<00:03:14.169> this<00:03:15.169> was<00:03:15.230> a

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
it again yeah I mean you know this was a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.270 
it again yeah I mean you know this was a
great<00:03:15.709> kit<00:03:16.040> it's<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:17.260> fantastic<00:03:18.260> way<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:18.859> start

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
great kit it's a fantastic way to start

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.650 
great kit it's a fantastic way to start
ruling<00:03:20.319> makes<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.440> very<00:03:21.680> easy<00:03:22.480> one<00:03:23.480> thing

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660

00:03:59.499 --> 00:03:59.509 
have to buy a dextrose as a priming

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:01.820 
have to buy a dextrose as a priming
sugar<00:03:59.539> I've<00:03:59.959> been<00:04:00.079> using<00:04:00.229> granulated<00:04:00.889> sure

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
sugar I've been using granulated sure

sugar I've been using granulated sure
for<00:04:02.220> priming<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.880> can't<00:04:03.090> tell<00:04:03.240> the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
for priming and I can't tell the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.760 
for priming and I can't tell the
difference<00:04:03.390> be<00:04:03.930> honest<00:04:04.200> with<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.500> enemy

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
difference be honest with the enemy

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.410 
difference be honest with the enemy
that's<00:04:05.099> way<00:04:05.340> cheaper<00:04:05.370> than<00:04:05.790> corn<00:04:06.120> sugar

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
that's way cheaper than corn sugar

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.740 
that's way cheaper than corn sugar
dextrose<00:04:07.290> same<00:04:07.560> thing<00:04:08.060> that<00:04:09.060> was<00:04:09.270> DME<00:04:09.720> and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
dextrose same thing that was DME and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.050 
dextrose same thing that was DME and
again<00:04:09.989> hot<00:04:10.200> malt<00:04:10.470> extract<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.700> then<00:04:11.819> one

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
again hot malt extract and then one

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.260 
again hot malt extract and then one
things<00:04:12.270> yeast<00:04:12.569> which<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:12.989> dollar<00:04:13.980> maybe<00:04:14.849> but

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
things yeast which is a dollar maybe but

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.390 
things yeast which is a dollar maybe but
at<00:04:15.390> least<00:04:16.040> $20<00:04:17.040> for<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:18.560> you<00:04:19.560> had<00:04:19.769> two

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
at least $20 for the can you had two

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.590 
at least $20 for the can you had two
powers<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.329> believe<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.840> dry<00:04:22.200> malt<00:04:22.470> extract

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
powers I believe the dry malt extract

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.960 
powers I believe the dry malt extract
that's<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:24.720> around<00:04:24.930> you<00:04:25.050> maybe<00:04:25.919> six<00:04:26.669> seven

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
that's it around you maybe six seven

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.560 
that's it around you maybe six seven
dollars<00:04:27.120> so<00:04:27.690> thirty<00:04:28.440> dollars<00:04:28.889> roughly<00:04:29.580> you

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
dollars so thirty dollars roughly you

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.770 
dollars so thirty dollars roughly you
know<00:04:30.750> as<00:04:31.110> opposed<00:04:31.620> this<00:04:32.370> kit<00:04:32.639> was<00:04:32.820> $40<00:04:33.570> I

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
know as opposed this kit was $40 I
