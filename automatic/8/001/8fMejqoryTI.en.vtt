00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
we'll do is we'll put a little bit of

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.930

right<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:08.300> top

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.410 

all<00:03:20.380> right<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.740> cocking<00:03:21.459> cleans<00:03:21.760> up<00:03:21.940> really

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
all right the cocking cleans up really

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.750 
all right the cocking cleans up really
well<00:03:22.569> with<00:03:22.750> just<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.050> damp<00:03:23.260> rag<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:27.370> can<00:03:27.520> see

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
well with just a damp rag you can see

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.280 
well with just a damp rag you can see
how<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.690> smear<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.319> caulk<00:03:29.620> into<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.310> seams

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
how you smear the caulk into the seams

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.970 
how you smear the caulk into the seams
to<00:03:32.290> make<00:03:32.470> them<00:03:32.650> look<00:03:33.990> nice<00:03:34.990> and<00:03:35.260> smooth<00:03:35.560> in<00:03:35.770> one

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
to make them look nice and smooth in one

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.420 
to make them look nice and smooth in one
piece<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.500> whip<00:03:38.980> off<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.459> excess<00:03:39.940> and<00:03:41.340> here<00:03:42.340> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
piece so whip off the excess and here it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.880 
piece so whip off the excess and here it
is<00:03:42.489> I<00:03:43.030> think<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.480> looks<00:03:43.660> pretty<00:03:43.840> good<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.500> little

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
is I think it looks pretty good a little

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.290 
is I think it looks pretty good a little
bit<00:03:45.010> of<00:03:45.130> paint<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:46.150> it'll<00:03:46.780> completely<00:03:47.500> match

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
bit of paint and it'll completely match

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.360 
bit of paint and it'll completely match
so<00:03:49.300> I'm<00:03:49.720> gonna<00:03:49.870> go<00:03:50.020> ahead<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.260> put<00:03:51.040> up<00:03:51.069> the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
so I'm gonna go ahead and put up the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.240 
so I'm gonna go ahead and put up the
second<00:03:51.700> shelf<00:03:51.910> now<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:53.380> here's<00:03:53.800> how<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.040> looks
