00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.640
 hello i want you my app today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.460
 demonstrate 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.160
 what's up to date this app looks in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.700
 regular intervals whether the developers 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.380
 from whatsup a new pre-release version 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:24.359
 without my app you had to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:29.060
 by hand on www.otcqx.com / android 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.269
 go and see if a new version 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.559
 ready 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:37.230
 download them but you have to 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.510
 it does everything by hand and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 At some point I thought that could be 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.149
 yes somehow automated in the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.149
 Run background 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.430
 One thing I have to say I'm not 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 whatsapp i get many mails where i am 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.840
 the mistake is pointed out 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.180
 located directly in whatsapp 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.750
 i am not a whats app developer i 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 just develop the program what 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.240
 see if a new whatsapp version for 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.930
 disposal is when a new whatsapp 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:17.240
 version has been released gets her 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.240
 a notification to the status line 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.450
 if we go for it you end up in 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.300
 my app whatsapp gets to date here 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.580
 again the overview of the available 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.710
 the local versions once 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.010
 which is now marked in red because they are 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.880
 is out of date with the note 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.950
 there is an update available 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.620
 because the server version of the now 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.590
 the most recent recently there was one 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.190
 play store update so that's not anymore 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.370
 quite as far behind but the lurking 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.950
 people who whatsup polo design already 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:03.050
 wanted to use long in advance 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:05.450
 that could even be months before that 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.840
 version in place tor landed it already 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.760
 work with the new core cpu here 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.250
 These buttons are once available 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.380
 To update 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.200
 So look again if new versions there 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.290
 are the download button about this 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.600
 button you can change the changelog from 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.780
 whatsapp you look so that you 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.560
 looks what changes in the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.050
 versions were made 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:38.300
 Here is a small section to my app 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.340
 where I also linked to the discussion so 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.560
 that here at google + like too 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.600
 feature requests can be sent 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.010
 listed a bit below 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.850
 which changes in which version 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:55.170
 were made by me and 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:03:00.600
 yes at the settings you have now 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.230
 recently the opportunity to join the team 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.520
 switch 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.460
 I will continue the function 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.580
 expand so that in the dax him yes 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.580
 really the synopsis of the version 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.700
 It gets dark here, therefore it always has to 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.700
 watch 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.270
 then you can just set this option 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.280
 if every time this app starts again 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.000
 to be looked at if a new one 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.860
 version is available from whatsapp 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.140
 your server version would become that 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:40.650
 wanted because on tablet android 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.450
 Tablets can not be whatsapp 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.520
 place for documents means that if you 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.790
 because on download went to a new 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.580
 one did not land in the pays tor 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.330
 that's why she gives up 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.990
 down here at play store updates 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:00.590
 to be notified or not 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.850
 yes you can activate or deactivate 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.739
 in general, if a new version 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.220
 land this notification up here 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.600
 should 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.550
 with sound or vibrations 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.580
 Notification requirement by default 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.450
 You can not choose yellow now 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.510
 maybe someday, too 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.109
 install 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.310
 thanks to this service at system startup ob 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.350
 to be started 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.480
 I'm also asked more often what that 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.330
 actually means that it so you 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.300
 if that is not activated what's up 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.919
 would have to call once to date 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.720
 and then it will be sequential 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:43.490
 Looked at this winter for new ones 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.560
 version is available 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.930
 yes and then for the people with one 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.520
 limited flat she still gives the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.550
 option that only to be looked at 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.419
 if you are in the wlan if 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.419
 you start the download 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.290
 then it takes quite a while with this 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.990
 download button that only appears if 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.820
 you really have a new update 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.940
 is available otherwise he is not 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.940
 on 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.710
 after the download is complete 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.440
 opens normally as usual the 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:32.010
 installation the possibility of 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:34.020
 some complain that the 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.280
 download is relatively slow because I have 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.470
 also no influence on it 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.470
 these are the servers of whatsapp 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.030
 the latest version will be installed 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:59.000
 by having the version directly from 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.800
 Whatsapp can come criss-cross 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.020
 that is, after a play 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:07.220
 Store update can be done without problems yes 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.650
 also the place tor version 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:13.729
 refresh and then open again 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:15.699
 switch server version back now 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.080
 always up to date 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:20.979
 I hope you like the program 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.979
 See you
