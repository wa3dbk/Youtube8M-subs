stock made famous with the high road and
we<00:00:55.540> are<00:00:55.659> combining<00:00:56.110> that<00:00:56.229> with<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:57.100> core<00:00:58.000> this

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
we are combining that with the core this

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.660 
we are combining that with the core this
is<00:00:58.479> the<00:00:58.659> turbine<00:00:59.229> core<00:00:59.559> which<00:00:59.769> is<00:00:59.799> what<00:01:00.489> you'll

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
is the turbine core which is what you'll

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.850 
is the turbine core which is what you'll
find<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:01.030> the<00:01:01.089> tropical<00:01:01.479> here<00:01:01.719> heat<00:01:02.079> series<00:01:02.379> so

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
find in the tropical here heat series so

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.310 
find in the tropical here heat series so
it's<00:01:03.460> a<00:01:03.549> great<00:01:03.760> cover<00:01:04.000> core<00:01:04.360> combination<00:01:05.170> and

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
it's a great cover core combination and

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.710 
it's a great cover core combination and
as<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.740> can<00:01:05.890> see<00:01:06.130> it<00:01:06.280> really<00:01:07.030> makes<00:01:07.270> this<00:01:07.450> ball

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
as you can see it really makes this ball

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.139 
as you can see it really makes this ball
roll<00:01:07.990> really<00:01:08.500> well<00:01:08.800> down<00:01:09.009> Lane<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.820> smooths

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
roll really well down Lane it smooths

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.480 
roll really well down Lane it smooths
the<00:01:10.270> lane<00:01:10.479> out<00:01:10.659> nice<00:01:11.020> it<00:01:11.619> doesn't<00:01:12.009> overreact

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
the lane out nice it doesn't overreact

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.820 
the lane out nice it doesn't overreact
to<00:01:12.909> friction<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.569> you're<00:01:14.229> just<00:01:14.380> gonna<00:01:14.560> see

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
to friction and you're just gonna see

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.219 
to friction and you're just gonna see
how<00:01:15.159> well<00:01:15.429> this<00:01:16.179> ball<00:01:16.420> rolls<00:01:16.750> throughout<00:01:17.110> this

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
how well this ball rolls throughout this

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.710 
how well this ball rolls throughout this
entire<00:01:17.590> video<00:01:17.830> clip<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:19.090> first<00:01:19.330> thing<00:01:19.539> that<00:01:19.569> I

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
entire video clip the first thing that I

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.120 
entire video clip the first thing that I
noticed<00:01:20.080> when<00:01:20.200> throwing<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:20.679> was<00:01:20.830> just<00:01:21.009> how

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
noticed when throwing this was just how

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.980 
noticed when throwing this was just how
well<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.460> cleared<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.819> heads<00:01:22.090> but<00:01:22.720> yet<00:01:22.869> it

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
well it cleared the heads but yet it

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.200 
well it cleared the heads but yet it
didn't<00:01:23.229> get<00:01:23.319> overly<00:01:23.649> snappy<00:01:24.190> down<00:01:24.369> Lane<00:01:24.670> it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
didn't get overly snappy down Lane it

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.669 
didn't get overly snappy down Lane it
actually<00:01:25.569> blended<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.020> lane<00:01:26.170> out<00:01:26.319> pretty

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
actually blended the lane out pretty

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.700 
actually blended the lane out pretty
well<00:01:26.800> for<00:01:27.009> a<00:01:27.399> lower<00:01:27.700> end<00:01:27.940> piece<00:01:28.210> which

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
well for a lower end piece which

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.529 
well for a lower end piece which
sometimes<00:01:29.710> in<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.100> lower<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.909> mid<00:01:31.090> line<00:01:31.330> you

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
sometimes in that lower to mid line you

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:32.880 
sometimes in that lower to mid line you
end<00:01:31.690> up<00:01:31.840> with<00:01:31.990> something<00:01:32.229> that<00:01:32.409> gets<00:01:32.679> a<00:01:32.770> little

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
end up with something that gets a little

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.830 
end up with something that gets a little
too<00:01:33.159> angular<00:01:33.399> down<00:01:33.729> Lane<00:01:33.970> this<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.390> not<00:01:34.569> one<00:01:34.810> of

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
too angular down Lane this is not one of

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.119 
too angular down Lane this is not one of
those<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.629> see<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.050> layout<00:01:38.379> I'm<00:01:38.530> using<00:01:38.739> up

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:39.129 
those so you see the layout I'm using up

00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:43.410 
those so you see the layout I'm using up
above<00:01:39.610> in<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.879> corner<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:41.459> this<00:01:42.459> layout<00:01:42.910> for

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
above in the corner and this layout for

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.040 
above in the corner and this layout for
me<00:01:43.629> works<00:01:44.170> out<00:01:44.379> really<00:01:44.679> well<00:01:45.330> in<00:01:46.330> comparing

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
me works out really well in comparing

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.169 
me works out really well in comparing
that<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.679> my<00:01:47.830> IQ<00:01:48.220> tour<00:01:48.369> pearl<00:01:48.759> you're<00:01:49.060> gonna

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
that to my IQ tour pearl you're gonna

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.089 
that to my IQ tour pearl you're gonna
see<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.750> end<00:01:50.259> up<00:01:50.379> having<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:50.679> move<00:01:50.890> a<00:01:50.979> little

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:51.099 
see I end up having to move a little

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:53.520 
see I end up having to move a little
deeper<00:01:51.250> on<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.729> lane<00:01:51.910> they<00:01:52.780> both<00:01:53.140> read<00:01:53.500> the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
deeper on the lane they both read the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.979 
deeper on the lane they both read the
lane<00:01:53.800> at<00:01:53.979> about<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.429> same<00:01:54.640> point<00:01:55.119> but<00:01:55.780> the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989 
lane at about the same point but the

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.020 
lane at about the same point but the
tour<00:01:56.170> pearl<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.709> able<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.069> blend<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.849> lane

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
tour pearl is able to blend the lane

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.960 
tour pearl is able to blend the lane
maybe<00:01:58.330> a<00:01:58.450> little<00:01:59.289> bit<00:01:59.440> better<00:01:59.709> overall<00:02:00.310> just

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
maybe a little bit better overall just

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.669 
maybe a little bit better overall just
because<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.420> his<00:02:01.569> of<00:02:01.840> it's<00:02:02.229> more<00:02:02.470> aggressive

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
because of his of it's more aggressive

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:04.410 
because of his of it's more aggressive
cover<00:02:03.129> stock<00:02:03.429> it<00:02:03.610> starts<00:02:03.910> reading<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.179> lane<00:02:04.390> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
cover stock it starts reading the lane a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.710 
cover stock it starts reading the lane a
little<00:02:04.720> earlier<00:02:05.129> as<00:02:06.129> far<00:02:06.789> as<00:02:06.910> its<00:02:07.119> transition

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
little earlier as far as its transition

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.040 
little earlier as far as its transition
period<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.610> drilling<00:02:09.910> does<00:02:10.239> play<00:02:11.019> into

that<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.590> some<00:02:11.800> degree<00:02:12.480> but<00:02:13.480> you<00:02:13.599> see<00:02:13.810> they<00:02:13.989> are

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
that to some degree but you see they are

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.650 
that to some degree but you see they are
comparable<00:02:15.220> they're<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> great<00:02:15.730> one<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.150> combo

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
comparable they're a great one to combo

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.229 
comparable they're a great one to combo
as<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.500> IQ<00:02:17.860> tour<00:02:18.040> pearl<00:02:18.400> starts<00:02:18.819> over<00:02:19.060> hooking

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
as the IQ tour pearl starts over hooking

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.759 
as the IQ tour pearl starts over hooking
a<00:02:19.420> little<00:02:19.660> bit<00:02:19.810> you<00:02:19.959> can<00:02:20.140> switch<00:02:20.379> to<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
a little bit you can switch to the

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:21.930 
a little bit you can switch to the
lights<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.280> you're<00:02:21.610> going<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.760> get<00:02:21.879> a

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
lights out and you're going to get a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.300 
lights out and you're going to get a
very<00:02:22.180> similar<00:02:22.569> ball<00:02:22.989> roll<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:23.920> being<00:02:24.220> able

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
very similar ball roll just being able

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.940 
very similar ball roll just being able
to<00:02:24.430> move<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.730> little<00:02:24.940> bit<00:02:25.030> further<00:02:25.209> right<00:02:25.950> and

to move a little bit further right and

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.520 
to move a little bit further right and
comparing<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.430> with<00:02:27.910> my<00:02:28.300> fire<00:02:28.599> road<00:02:28.870> you're

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
comparing that with my fire road you're

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.500 
comparing that with my fire road you're
gonna<00:02:29.650> see<00:02:29.920> my<00:02:30.069> fire<00:02:30.280> road<00:02:30.550> actually<00:02:30.760> reads<00:02:31.269> a

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
gonna see my fire road actually reads a

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.790 
gonna see my fire road actually reads a
little<00:02:31.659> bit<00:02:31.900> earlier<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.409> a<00:02:32.470> little<00:02:32.680> bit

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
little bit earlier and a little bit

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.979 
little bit earlier and a little bit
smoother<00:02:33.310> than<00:02:33.550> both<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:34.030> these<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.810> that's

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
smoother than both of these but that's

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.800 
smoother than both of these but that's
because<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.530> drilling<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:37.569> ball

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
because of the drilling this ball

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.850 
because of the drilling this ball
actually<00:02:38.019> I<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:39.819> drilled<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.840> read<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> lane

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
actually I have drilled to read the lane

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.400 
actually I have drilled to read the lane
a<00:02:41.890> little<00:02:42.190> bit<00:02:42.310> early<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:43.080> concert<00:02:44.080> and

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
a little bit early and concert and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.690 
a little bit early and concert and
conserve<00:02:44.830> some<00:02:45.069> energy

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
conserve some energy

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.410 
conserve some energy
and<00:02:45.930> not<00:02:46.930> get<00:02:47.650> flippy<00:02:48.069> so<00:02:48.700> because<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.390> that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
and not get flippy so because of that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.020 
and not get flippy so because of that
this<00:02:49.870> ball<00:02:50.080> ends<00:02:50.260> up<00:02:50.440> being<00:02:50.709> more<00:02:51.580> our<00:02:51.819> key

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
this ball ends up being more our key

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.369 
this ball ends up being more our key
than<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.360> would<00:02:52.480> typically<00:02:52.810> see<00:02:53.140> and

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
than you would typically see and

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.670 
than you would typically see and
comparing<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> three<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.760> see<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:56.019> the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
comparing the three you see that the

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.740 
comparing the three you see that the
lights-out<00:02:57.069> does<00:02:57.370> fall<00:02:57.670> reasonably<00:02:58.540> well

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
lights-out does fall reasonably well

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.250 
lights-out does fall reasonably well
between<00:02:59.200> these<00:02:59.440> two<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.019> great

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
between these two it's it's a great

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.720 
between these two it's it's a great
piece<00:03:02.560> it's<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.099> middle<00:03:03.340> of<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.519> line

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
piece it's in the middle of the line

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.339 
piece it's in the middle of the line
we're<00:03:04.209> gonna<00:03:04.269> slow<00:03:04.599> it<00:03:04.660> down<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.870> little<00:03:05.019> bit<00:03:05.200> so

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
we're gonna slow it down a little bit so

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.990 
we're gonna slow it down a little bit so
you<00:03:05.440> can<00:03:05.500> just<00:03:05.739> see<00:03:05.950> kind<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.340> what's<00:03:06.580> going<00:03:06.849> on

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
you can just see kind of what's going on

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.089 
you can just see kind of what's going on
in<00:03:07.180> between<00:03:07.330> the<00:03:07.599> two

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
in between the two

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.890 
in between the two
now<00:03:09.099> here's<00:03:09.519> my<00:03:09.580> normal<00:03:10.090> shot<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:10.810> gonna

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
now here's my normal shot this is gonna

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.380 
now here's my normal shot this is gonna
be<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.140> little<00:03:11.349> change<00:03:11.980> of<00:03:12.130> pace<00:03:12.280> here<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.880> normal

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
be a little change of pace here a normal

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.869 
be a little change of pace here a normal
shot<00:03:13.569> now<00:03:13.810> I'm<00:03:14.019> gonna<00:03:14.830> lower<00:03:15.190> my<00:03:15.400> axis<00:03:15.730> of

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
shot now I'm gonna lower my axis of

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.350 
shot now I'm gonna lower my axis of
rotation<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.480> see<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.900> trip<00:03:17.290> out<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> 410<00:03:18.360> now

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
rotation you see I trip out the 410 now

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.940 
rotation you see I trip out the 410 now
we're<00:03:19.510> going<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.660> increase<00:03:19.989> my<00:03:20.290> axis<00:03:20.830> of

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
we're going to increase my axis of

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.770 
we're going to increase my axis of
rotation<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.430> little<00:03:21.459> bit<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.360> you<00:03:22.450> see<00:03:22.630> how

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
rotation a little bit and you see how

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.600 
rotation a little bit and you see how
well<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.140> ball<00:03:23.319> recovers<00:03:23.799> down<00:03:24.010> Lane<00:03:24.310> and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
well this ball recovers down Lane and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.400 
well this ball recovers down Lane and
then<00:03:25.180> we're<00:03:25.450> gonna<00:03:25.540> go<00:03:25.720> a<00:03:25.750> little<00:03:25.959> bit<00:03:26.110> more

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
then we're gonna go a little bit more

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.589 
then we're gonna go a little bit more
add<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.040> little<00:03:27.280> more<00:03:27.489> side<00:03:27.760> rotation<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.510> you

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
add a little more side rotation and you

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.059 
add a little more side rotation and you
see<00:03:28.780> this<00:03:28.900> ball<00:03:29.079> just<00:03:29.349> comes<00:03:29.560> back<00:03:29.680> really

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
see this ball just comes back really

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.339 
see this ball just comes back really
hard<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.549> then<00:03:31.150> just<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.690> fun<00:03:31.720> we're<00:03:32.170> gonna

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
hard and then just for fun we're gonna

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.430 
hard and then just for fun we're gonna
go<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.190> absolute<00:03:33.640> extreme<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.360> this<00:03:35.290> one

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
go to the absolute extreme and this one

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.839 
go to the absolute extreme and this one
I<00:03:35.500> had<00:03:35.590> to<00:03:35.620> keep<00:03:35.769> in<00:03:35.950> a<00:03:35.980> little<00:03:36.310> bit<00:03:36.430> but<00:03:36.640> it

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
I had to keep in a little bit but it

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.330 
I had to keep in a little bit but it
still<00:03:37.090> rolls<00:03:37.299> down<00:03:37.959> lean<00:03:38.200> pretty<00:03:38.470> well<00:03:38.680> that's

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
still rolls down lean pretty well that's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.009 
still rolls down lean pretty well that's
all<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.819> time<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.030> have<00:03:40.269> so<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.750> good<00:03:40.870> one
