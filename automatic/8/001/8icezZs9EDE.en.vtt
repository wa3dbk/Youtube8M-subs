we're going to break it up and melt it
in<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:45.700> pan<00:00:45.970> I<00:00:46.239> don't<00:00:46.780> have<00:00:46.930> a<00:00:46.989> set<00:00:47.260> up<00:00:47.350> for<00:00:47.380> a

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
in a pan I don't have a set up for a

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.770 
in a pan I don't have a set up for a
double<00:00:47.860> boiler<00:00:48.010> so<00:00:48.250> I'm<00:00:49.210> just<00:00:49.390> going<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.540> try

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
double boiler so I'm just going to try

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.479 
double boiler so I'm just going to try
and<00:00:49.870> melt<00:00:50.020> this<00:00:50.200> slow<00:00:50.440> and<00:00:50.710> then<00:00:51.070> we'll<00:00:51.309> go
