but despite I'm having a pretty
uninteresting<00:03:07.230> can<00:03:07.650> design<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.610> really

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
uninteresting can design I really really

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.080 
uninteresting can design I really really
like<00:03:09.030> his<00:03:09.270> animal<00:03:10.200> mode<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.040> as<00:03:11.370> usually<00:03:11.850> start

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
like his animal mode so as usually start

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.390 
like his animal mode so as usually start
by<00:03:12.120> popping<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.660> top<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.080> then<00:03:13.890> you're<00:03:14.280> gonna

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
by popping the top and then you're gonna

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.850 
by popping the top and then you're gonna
unfold<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.060> into<00:03:15.270> four<00:03:15.480> parts<00:03:15.690> like<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.530> and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
unfold it into four parts like this and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.780 
unfold it into four parts like this and
then<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:18.060> have<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.420> cross<00:03:18.870> okay<00:03:19.739> Daisy<00:03:20.489> cross

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
then you have a cross okay Daisy cross

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.940 
then you have a cross okay Daisy cross
so<00:03:21.630> what<00:03:21.780> i<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:21.930> i<00:03:22.050> always<00:03:22.200> pull<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.739> power

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
so what i do i always pull this power

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.830 
so what i do i always pull this power
back<00:03:23.130> first<00:03:23.370> all<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.820> way<00:03:23.910> back<00:03:23.940> here<00:03:24.090> and

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
back first all the way back here and

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360 
back first all the way back here and
you'll<00:03:24.930> see<00:03:25.080> his<00:03:25.170> feet<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.950> then<00:03:26.040> pull<00:03:26.280> his

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you'll see his feet and then pull his

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.490 
you'll see his feet and then pull his
tail<00:03:26.550> up<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:27.720> pull<00:03:27.930> these<00:03:28.020> sides<00:03:28.290> down

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
tail up here now pull these sides down

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.190 
tail up here now pull these sides down
and<00:03:28.770> you'll<00:03:28.860> see<00:03:29.100> there'll<00:03:29.730> be<00:03:29.760> three<00:03:30.390> pegs

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
and you'll see there'll be three pegs

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.350 
and you'll see there'll be three pegs
here<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.770> then<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.459> holes<00:03:32.700> on<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.970> side<00:03:33.150> here

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
here and then the holes on the side here

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.590 
here and then the holes on the side here
snap<00:03:34.020> them<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.550> take<00:03:35.550> this<00:03:35.760> snap<00:03:36.270> it<00:03:36.420> on<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
snap them in take this snap it on the

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.930 
at first probably cuz I was holding in
the<00:05:16.570> air<00:05:16.690> like<00:05:16.870> this<00:05:17.070> but<00:05:18.070> you<00:05:18.340> can<00:05:18.370> also<00:05:18.610> hold

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
the air like this but you can also hold

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.730 
the air like this but you can also hold
down<00:05:19.120> both<00:05:19.480> horns<00:05:20.110> or<00:05:20.230> you<00:05:20.290> can<00:05:20.380> switch<00:05:20.620> off

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
down both horns or you can switch off

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.620 
down both horns or you can switch off
orange<00:05:21.100> you<00:05:21.160> can<00:05:21.280> easily<00:05:21.580> do<00:05:21.700> this<00:05:21.730> too<00:05:22.030> but

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
orange you can easily do this too but

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.780 
orange you can easily do this too but
sometimes<00:05:23.260> I<00:05:23.350> like<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.560> just<00:05:23.890> fall<00:05:24.250> down<00:05:24.280> both

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
sometimes I like to just fall down both

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.080 
sometimes I like to just fall down both
horns<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.419> and<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.740> it<00:05:27.070> just<00:05:27.280> seems<00:05:27.760> to<00:05:27.850> rest

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
horns and and and it just seems to rest

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.180 
horns and and and it just seems to rest
easier<00:05:28.540> more<00:05:29.320> so<00:05:29.530> if<00:05:29.620> you're<00:05:29.710> holding<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.070> up

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
easier more so if you're holding it up

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.040 
easier more so if you're holding it up
or<00:05:30.340> uncertain<00:05:30.729> like<00:05:30.880> uneven<00:05:31.090> surfaces<00:05:31.780> and

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
or uncertain like uneven surfaces and

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.909 
or uncertain like uneven surfaces and
just<00:05:32.650> there<00:05:33.430> it<00:05:33.520> goes<00:05:33.669> up<00:05:34.560> gonna<00:05:35.560> make<00:05:35.650> no

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919
