00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.540
 we are going to adjust in this chapter a 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.820
 little lighting since we're going to 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.200
 start with the creation of materials 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.660
 so what we're going to do now is going to 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.270
 be adjusting a bit the intensity of the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.269
 lights of both the exterior light and the 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.849
 of support to generate a more environment 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:27.369
 lit up when working with 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.779
 materials we are going to launch a render in 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.179
 low resolution 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.010
 for that we will load the pre set of 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.180
 interior no 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.980
 and we are going to launch a small render 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.110
 as it is the type of lighting that 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.540
 has left us since we have included in 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.610
 this case the curtain and that has 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.050
 subtracted enough lighting in that 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.120
 part of the cee 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.520
 it has been quite dark throughout 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.770
 this area is the least illuminated area like this 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.899
 that what we are going to do is expand a 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.820
 little the lighting of the light of 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.260
 support we go to the war of the 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.600
 lists are going to have to walk 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.300
 selecting on the screen we have light of 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.490
 light support selected let's put to 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.110
 zero as of 5 and the outside light the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.970
 let's go up a bit we're going to go up 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.220
 5 to see that the result is giving us 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.220
 we return to launch a render and we wait 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.730
 and as we see the image has improved in 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 As for lighting, maybe we would have 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.780
 to lower this light a little more 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.940
 support as it is illuminating us 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.010
 Too much is already entering us 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.890
 the light here what we are going to do is 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.740
 expand the outside light a little bit and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.440
 lower the support light let's put it 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.450
 at 0.25 right in the middle and the 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.670
 external light multiplier what 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.980
 let's put in 7 to see what result 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.880
 gives us to go adjusting the 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.880
 final lighting 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.610
 as we can see we have enough 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.350
 better illuminated this room although to the 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.930
 see these points it may seem that you do not 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.780
 the light is entering everything from the 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.090
 outside and when we give quality to 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.610
 you will see how this whole area is 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.520
 is more uniform in color as well as 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.370
 shadows now we have left we work well 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.950
 the materials so that the image is 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.950
 completely clear and with color
