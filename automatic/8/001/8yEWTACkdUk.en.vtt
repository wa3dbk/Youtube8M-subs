00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:12.570
 at 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.470
 we had like strategy on 2014 of 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.590

 or carriers of our range cf 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.830
 we had a very favorable reception from the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.290
 market share on our new engine 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.310
 and house mix on the carrier part 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.990
 especially through our program 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.060
 distri force so we are very satisfied 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.790
 the launch of this new mx11 engine 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.920
 on 2014 on 2015 we will continue to 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.420
 work our depth of range and 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.370
 responded favorably to all 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.870
 market expectations according to management 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.880
 that will give us the market obviously 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.950
 we wanted to gain market share 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.540
 also heavy vehicles that is not 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.030
 the point of excellence of the iveco brand 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.720
 in France we reached our 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.000
 goals since we won 0 3% 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.880
 of market share and we think about 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.830
 end the year on this gain of 0 3% in 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.600
 2015 we want to continue to progress 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.580
 of course on all segments 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.070
 but obviously first in heavy range 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.180
 especially in sales that are 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.680
 made by our network 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.090
 when we set up a 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.929
 important program for our 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.820
 network recruit 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:21.310
 and we start within two weeks 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.679
 our school of sales in the water with 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.749
 the goal of doubling our strength of 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.069
 specialized heavy truck sales by 15 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.630
 month in 2014 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.719
 the orientation of m &amp; a n was clearly 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.490
 the shipyards experienced building site in 2015 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.950
 we continue on the site but we 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.170
 also continues on the road on the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.729
 great driver with a real desire to 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.740
 highlight our thematic channel 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.310
 with very low values ​​of 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.249
 consumption 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.039
 we had focused on lacrosse 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.719
 in cabin stream space so a width 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.740
 of doctors as to flat floor this is 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.939
 exactly what we could 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.100
 find in the market actually 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.899
 we have other cabins of our 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700
 product palette by cons 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.499
 today there is a tradition I 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.670
 would say in France about the use of the 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.560
 cabin two meters fifty wide in 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.149
 2015 you focus on two 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.640
 types of products continue to 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.890
 strengthen our role our position 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.970
 in the tractor market and beyond 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.440
 the cabin two meters fifty us 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.569
 let's promote the cabin 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.000
 of my thirty seconds work axes 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.440
 major it will be the promotion of the wearer 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.390
 where we have market share is 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.640
 strengthened today we have a range that 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.760
 is complete you see her on the stand 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.530
 here to haunt so the goal is to 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.910
 develop the entire range in 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.230
 a range that is the most complete of the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.560
 market or one of the most complete 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.150
 market 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.190
 so the goal is really 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.050
 to use the full potential of the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.080
 range in 2014 was a great success 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.640
 in the post anjou is none of 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.110
 higher market in the pole than 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 in the tractor that is the first 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.400
 times for scania the one we have 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.920
 more potential in the tractor well 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.019
 obviously but the objective is 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.810
 contents is to evolve in the potter 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.550
 is obviously to do earlier 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.410
 growth in the tractor we have 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.380
 some leadership in the egg in 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.750
 the tractor field and so we 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.940
 let's go on year after year 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.739
 year to develop our market share 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.090
 in the porter and in the porters he 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.640
 are two categories 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.769
 there was construction with our 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.620
 range fm x none particularly 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.510
 and then there is the distribution more over 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.250
 conventional for that we did this 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.410
 famous road show this famous caravan 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.570
 which allowed us to meet more than 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.190
 5500 customers and discover at 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.230
 many of his clients besides this 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.160
 that we knew how to do in the 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.160
 carrier domain
