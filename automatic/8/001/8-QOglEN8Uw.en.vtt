00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.320
 now it turns out that I do not have control over 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.590
 my life nor about my happiness nor 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.230
 about nothing already is already has already left 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.210
 the fear of happiness what a mania that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.850
 they have conscious minds in putting themselves 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.520
 to think and of course they lack data because 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.700
 because the data I have, I do not 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.340
 they understand nothing I do not understand anything 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.530
 what I feel what I think he has 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.350
 thought he has felt it and he has calculated it 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.640
 before and who am I 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.890
 you understand what I mean, who 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.280
 It's me I've already told you a thousand times 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.620
 think you do not think that leave it to me 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 I get much better than you and I always 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.930
 it makes repeat the same thing to commit the same 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.780
 mistakes has this mania of not wanting 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.250
 change and I want to change I want 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.670
 be happier 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.920
 a moment moment so you're going to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.800
 change what works already I already have my 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.180
 behavior patterns and I know what else I 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.510
 It is convenient not to lose my balance 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510
 mental 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.720
 maybe good 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.120
 maybe I can change something 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.610
 he does not know but neural networks 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.670
 of the brain have a lot of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.190
 possibilities changed all the time what 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.380
 what happens that he does not realize mix 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.470
 the memories that you stored little things that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.340
 I'm learning I feel different according to 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.980
 no day and that in turn makes change 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.760
 you know how many neurons are here 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.350
 within one hundred billion and synapses that 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.710
 are they are connections between ones and 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.150
 another billion of millions you can 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.150
 imagine the things that can be done 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.150
 if even I can not imagine the 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.150
 unique 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.840
 Hey, you know what TV is saying 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.480
 that behavior patterns can be 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 change that the brain is plastic and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.830
 man if that same thing was going to explain 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.830
 but before life things are not
