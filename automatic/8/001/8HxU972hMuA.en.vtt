 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.959
 new round panel like heroes whine and 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.459
 I am now traveling with the gamma 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.160
 and the orders is determined again 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.279
 I can do incredible valid round 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990
 of course you say no 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.519
 Ok, let's see how it works 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.519
 Not only did not show round like that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.900
 Bomb and what is there to tell 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.849
 I have a small trailer on one 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.169

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.190
 So our new project from us 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690
 fritz and that plays a band too 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.680
 play 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.250
 yes, so I can not get a man 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.250
 thinks it is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.359
 You can do this new beginning in January 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.930
 february maybe yes so could 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.930
 expect it 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.820
 it comes to 50 0 to win the win 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.920
 would then there I think I 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.350
 Once the worst was done 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.680
 player what you expect differently and 50 0 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.680
 winning 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.979
 Yes 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.799

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.700
 that I have prepared so well 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.430
 Of course, I actually had 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.690

 the whole family of course 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.989

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.989
 now caught up with land and yes to 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:33.830
 example, my grandfather annoys me nicely 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:36.620

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.820
 who recognized me a little later and 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.110
 yes the problem is just that my grandfather 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.459
 Sometimes just a little bit 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.450
 I'm angry and just a room 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.450
 a place comes around a bit 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.730
 crumbly and yes that's pretty much 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.850
 ripped off if you just like that 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.220
 small video on the stage 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.850
 what do you want to do what i have anyway 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.850
 get hurt 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.040

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.910
 worst killstreak lie down with us 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.040
 now the two jacket de rossi 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.620
 what the opponents have all four flags 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.910
 Although we took a year 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.910
 actually much more is true 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.830
 I do not know I should not now 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.210
 drive the offensively lined up or oh come 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.770
 we have to lose engage 2 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.990
 what you have to think here is watching 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.250
 One hand lies in such simple 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.250
 really not retract what is going on 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.160
 these are I can not even to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.160
 christmas got so in principle 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.480
 I have yes to Christmas open channel 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.960

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.310
 get a camera and so movie is running 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.310
 lamps or what you call yes 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.940
 that's why there was not too much 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.010
 but I have it anyway 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.930

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.030

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.260
 actually only wanted and 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.370
 So I am completely satisfied now 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.209
 could sometimes seems to me so 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.760

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.530
 have to say it is still the ps4 and now 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.260
 xbox live at home come first time 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.790
 ps4 finds better but everyone himself 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.800
 I know the discussion between 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.370
 the two consoles honestly 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.530
 a little stupid 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.440
 Everyone just takes what's for him 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.360
 is best now 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.300
 and everyone has to know what they are 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.750
 I really want it now and I would 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.750
 personally 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.640
 it was so close no and i would 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.660
 personally still prefer the psp 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.669
 dismantle 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.620
 i'm buying this year so i believe 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.849
 I do not know any of the two consoles 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.069
 because of me 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:52.409
 Computer player is generally if that 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:54.119
 bistum have time here for something because 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.860
 I have to do so much for school 

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:57.809
 that's right and fair 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.639
 Of course I like to do that 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:01.020
 make videos on youtube and then pull 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.360
 Of course, I will come in once in a while 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.770
 little remains private with kumpels 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.770
 just no time for the ps4 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.870
 walter somehow somehow runs right 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.830
 bad for me i would too 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.449
 really do not wonder that it is there 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.830
 lose because nobody is the storm 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.960
 who cares any flags here 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.830
 took care of electricity 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.639
 Now I stand here now I 'm standing in 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.639
 the shit what should I do 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.690
 man 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.010
 to get it right 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.320
 this position is you shit for one 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.880
 garni behind that is again 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.020
 too much and then we just shoot 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.640
 from the left, if that's so shit me 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.600
 I wish I had a pistol now 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.070
 they were able to be on long 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.660
 created beautiful ballads with ghana 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.060
 it's just bad because the ball 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.360
 just like that the games just talk 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.130
 so that at least one killer buy 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.250
 because he was pretty cocky 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.250
 here 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.909
 OK 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:14.260
 no, right, a sniper with one 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.460
 plus 39 rp the cross and only us 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.120
 Do not win that okay then take it now 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:21.940
 at least once a flag 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.840
 I do not have it I drive 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.130
 just get in and out of them 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:29.800
 try to drive over heaps 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:34.930
 oh yeah the pro is back on the grid 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:40.470
 yes cool this bold you have seen it 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:43.950
 Where it landed I am relaxed 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:47.760
 that it had been worse 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.540
 So I know I'm not really running today 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.880
 but the dogs are also pretty 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.540

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.190
 Okay well then I say goodbye 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.510

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.900
 next round battlefield heroes like 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.640
