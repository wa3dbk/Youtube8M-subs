insiders I'm getting ready to do the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.260 
insiders I'm getting ready to do the
flex<00:00:03.389> test<00:00:03.720> on<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.290> lobster<00:00:05.100> jib<00:00:05.850> board<00:00:06.060> this

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
flex test on the lobster jib board this

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.040 
flex test on the lobster jib board this
is<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.420> 151<00:00:07.230> centimetre<00:00:07.680> board<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:09.050> regular

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
is a 151 centimetre board and a regular

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.499 
is a 151 centimetre board and a regular
camber<00:00:10.349> profile<00:00:10.920> super<00:00:11.370> mellow<00:00:11.700> camber<00:00:12.300> and

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
camber profile super mellow camber and

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.839 
camber profile super mellow camber and
then<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.259> also<00:00:13.440> got<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.980> spooned<00:00:14.280> edges<00:00:14.670> or

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
then it's also got the spooned edges or

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.390 
then it's also got the spooned edges or
raised<00:00:15.420> contact<00:00:15.990> points<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.220> got<00:00:17.369> a

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
raised contact points so it's got a

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.279 
raised contact points so it's got a
little<00:00:17.550> bit<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> 3d<00:00:18.240> profile<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> tips

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289

this board bends everywhere spending in
the<00:00:45.450> middle<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.870> board<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.320> bending

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the middle of the board it's bending

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
the middle of the board it's bending
under<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> inserts<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.020> bit

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
under the inserts and then a little bit

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.540 
under the inserts and then a little bit
more<00:00:49.530> even<00:00:49.829> after<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.280> inserts<00:00:52.550> torsionally

flat on the ground whoo so all the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.870 
flat on the ground whoo so all the
lobster<00:01:06.810> boards<00:01:07.140> come<00:01:08.100> equipped<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.580> what

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lobster boards come equipped with what

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
lobster boards come equipped with what
we<00:01:08.970> call<00:01:09.180> triple<00:01:09.600> base<00:01:09.780> which<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> raised

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
we call triple base which is the raised

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.950 
we call triple base which is the raised
contact<00:01:11.729> points<00:01:12.090> there's<00:01:12.210> actually<00:01:12.630> three

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
contact points there's actually three

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.929 
contact points there's actually three
different<00:01:13.140> base<00:01:13.560> profiles<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.369> each<00:01:14.610> tip

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
different base profiles on the each tip

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.140 
different base profiles on the each tip
and<00:01:15.210> tail<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.549> don't<00:01:17.729> feel<00:01:17.909> too

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and tail and I really don't feel too

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
and tail and I really don't feel too
much<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> difference<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> Flex<00:01:19.409> test

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
much of a difference on the Flex test

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.249 
much of a difference on the Flex test
with<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> triple<00:01:20.340> base<00:01:20.570> this<00:01:21.570> boards<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
with the triple base this boards just

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.990 
with the triple base this boards just
feeling<00:01:22.560> bendy<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.549> could<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.880> do<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
feeling bendy you could just do a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.490 
feeling bendy you could just do a
wheelie<00:01:24.270> down<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> mountain<00:01:25.049> we're<00:01:25.830> let<00:01:26.460> go

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
wheelie down the mountain we're let go

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.340 
wheelie down the mountain we're let go
all<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.939> lobster<00:01:30.180> 151<00:01:31.049> jib

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
all right so this is the lobster 151 jib

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.740 
all right so this is the lobster 151 jib
board<00:01:31.970> you're<00:01:32.970> gonna<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.240> able<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.600> those

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
board you're gonna be able to do those

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.370 
board you're gonna be able to do those
tail<00:01:34.110> presses<00:01:35.420> just<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.900> knife<00:01:37.350> through

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
tail presses just like a knife through

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.539 
tail presses just like a knife through
hot<00:01:37.799> butter<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:39.500> boom<00:01:40.500> look<00:01:41.460> at

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
hot butter on this thing boom look at

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
hot butter on this thing boom look at
that<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> could<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.119> bend<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> bend

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
that you could just bend it in to bend

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.300 
that you could just bend it in to bend
it<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.560> half<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.040> just<00:01:44.159> hold<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.610> whoo<00:01:46.310> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it in half and just hold it whoo the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
it in half and just hold it whoo the
ends<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.909> soft<00:01:48.240> though<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.630> feels<00:01:48.869> like

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
ends are so soft though it feels like

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
ends are so soft though it feels like
you<00:01:49.170> might<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> little<00:01:50.130> bit<00:01:50.310> wishy-washy

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
you might get a little bit wishy-washy

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
you might get a little bit wishy-washy
out<00:01:51.240> there<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.960> probably<00:01:52.259> strictly<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
out there so this is probably strictly a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.170 
out there so this is probably strictly a
jib<00:01:53.040> board<00:01:53.220> probably<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> big

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
jib board probably not for the big

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.420 
jib board probably not for the big
booters<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.890> imagine<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> land<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
booters I imagine if you land in the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.800 
booters I imagine if you land in the
back<00:01:56.640> seat<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.119> you're<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.509> gonna<00:01:57.600> keep

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
back seat on this you're just gonna keep

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.380 
back seat on this you're just gonna keep
