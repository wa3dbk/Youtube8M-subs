00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
the two wires that was going to work

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.170 
the two wires that was going to work
with<00:04:42.230> here<00:04:42.890> you<00:04:43.070> can<00:04:43.310> see<00:04:43.520> these<00:04:43.670> two<00:04:43.940> wires

with here you can see these two wires

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.900 
with here you can see these two wires
isolated<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.080> then<00:04:45.620> stripped<00:04:46.040> the<00:04:46.190> insulation

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
isolated I then stripped the insulation

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.850 
isolated I then stripped the insulation
off<00:04:47.060> about<00:04:47.420> half<00:04:47.720> inch<00:04:47.990> on<00:04:48.170> the<00:04:48.380> black<00:04:48.590> wire

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
off about half inch on the black wire

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.340 
off about half inch on the black wire
leaving<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.790> bare<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.330> I<00:04:50.360> could<00:04:50.630> solder<00:04:50.870> to<00:04:51.200> it

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
leaving it bare so I could solder to it

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.430 
leaving it bare so I could solder to it
then<00:04:51.950> I<00:04:52.250> cut<00:04:52.850> the<00:04:53.030> yellow<00:04:53.360> wire<00:04:53.720> about<00:04:54.080> four

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
then I cut the yellow wire about four

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.590 
then I cut the yellow wire about four
inches<00:04:54.770> from<00:04:55.040> the<00:04:55.220> connector<00:04:55.730> and<00:04:55.970> stripped

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
inches from the connector and stripped

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.570 
inches from the connector and stripped
about<00:04:56.870> an<00:04:57.050> inch<00:04:57.230> of<00:04:57.380> insulation<00:04:57.560> off<00:04:58.220> the<00:04:58.430> end

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
about an inch of insulation off the end

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.880 
about an inch of insulation off the end
of<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.820> wire<00:04:59.120> which<00:04:59.840> goes<00:05:00.170> to<00:05:00.350> the<00:05:00.440> connector

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
of the wire which goes to the connector

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.030 
of the wire which goes to the connector
I<00:05:01.130> also<00:05:01.670> taped<00:05:02.090> up<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.390> other<00:05:02.720> wire<00:05:03.050> end<00:05:03.350> bent

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
I also taped up the other wire end bent

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.460 
I also taped up the other wire end bent
it<00:05:04.220> back<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.790> push<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.600> back<00:05:05.630> into<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.230> bundle

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
it back and push it back into the bundle

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.770 
it back and push it back into the bundle
out<00:05:06.710> of<00:05:06.830> the<00:05:06.920> way<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:07.400> then<00:05:07.910> slid<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.360> two<00:05:08.480> and<00:05:08.630> a

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
out of the way I then slid it two and a

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.600 
out of the way I then slid it two and a
half<00:05:08.960> inch<00:05:09.230> piece<00:05:09.500> of<00:05:09.560> shrink<00:05:10.040> tubing<00:05:10.430> over

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
the yellow wire so that I could later

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.980 
the yellow wire so that I could later
use<00:05:13.100> it<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.430> cover<00:05:13.640> the<00:05:13.880> resistor<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:14.390> was<00:05:14.690> about

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
use it to cover the resistor I was about

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.600 
use it to cover the resistor I was about

I<00:05:16.640> took<00:05:16.940> it<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.510> point<00:05:17.840> eight<00:05:18.080> kilo<00:05:18.110> ohm<00:05:18.740> one

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
I took it to point eight kilo ohm one

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.490 
I took it to point eight kilo ohm one

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
tried to start the car it started and

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.290 
tried to start the car it started and
then<00:06:15.200> stopped<00:06:15.560> after<00:06:15.920> a<00:06:15.950> second<00:06:16.430> or<00:06:16.580> two<00:06:16.790> with

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
then stopped after a second or two with

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.630 
then stopped after a second or two with
the<00:06:17.450> security<00:06:17.990> light<00:06:18.230> on<00:06:18.470> that's<00:06:19.160> okay

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
the security light on that's okay

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.030 
the security light on that's okay
because<00:06:20.150> now<00:06:20.390> I<00:06:20.600> had<00:06:20.960> to<00:06:21.110> recalibrate<00:06:21.860> the

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:22.040 
because now I had to recalibrate the

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.190 
because now I had to recalibrate the
body<00:06:22.250> control<00:06:22.880> module<00:06:23.420> to<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:23.750> two<00:06:23.930> point

eight<00:06:24.350> kilo<00:06:24.410> ohm<00:06:25.100> resistor<00:06:25.760> I<00:06:26.000> did<00:06:26.510> that<00:06:26.690> by

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
eight kilo ohm resistor I did that by

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.540 
eight kilo ohm resistor I did that by
turning<00:06:26.960> the<00:06:27.470> ignition<00:06:27.590> key<00:06:28.130> to<00:06:28.160> the<00:06:28.430> off

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
turning the ignition key to the off

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.580 
turning the ignition key to the off
position<00:06:28.820> then<00:06:29.720> turned<00:06:30.080> into<00:06:30.260> the<00:06:30.470> on

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
position then turned into the on

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.880 
position then turned into the on
position<00:06:30.910> the<00:06:31.910> security<00:06:32.480> light<00:06:32.720> came<00:06:32.990> on<00:06:33.020> so<00:06:33.860> I

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
position the security light came on so I

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.890 
position the security light came on so I
waited<00:06:34.340> about<00:06:34.550> ten<00:06:34.910> minutes<00:06:35.120> with<00:06:35.450> the<00:06:35.600> qiyan

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
waited about ten minutes with the qiyan

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.620 
waited about ten minutes with the qiyan
on<00:06:36.050> until<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.590> light<00:06:36.830> went<00:06:37.070> off<00:06:37.220> then<00:06:37.970> turn

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
on until the light went off then turn

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.660 
on until the light went off then turn
the<00:06:38.810> ignition<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:39.440> off<00:06:39.620> before<00:06:40.070> attempting<00:06:40.640> to

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:40.670 
the ignition to off before attempting to

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.800 
the ignition to off before attempting to
start<00:06:41.060> the<00:06:41.240> engine

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.810 
start the engine

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.470

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
at that time the body control module

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.810 
at that time the body control module
would<00:06:44.960> have<00:06:45.169> memorized<00:06:45.680> the<00:06:45.889> new<00:06:46.100> value<00:06:46.520> for

would have memorized the new value for

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.090 
would have memorized the new value for
your<00:06:46.970> resistor<00:06:47.510> and<00:06:47.720> the<00:06:48.169> engine<00:06:48.620> started
