00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.250
 good to all colleagues and lovers of 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.500
 fishing today I want to show you 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.059
 of how to launch that has asked me for a 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.340
 Subscriber called to take which one 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.500
 I send a greeting from here and good before 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.439
 to show you how to launch I would like to 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.960
 explain why there are people who do not throw 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.840
 leds and is that one of the biggest reasons 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.390
 why people do not 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.970
 is because for example using a braid 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.970
 on average 1,020 and 2014 fishing 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.320
 move your hand a little bit 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.140
 it's about that according to him in the types of 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.120
 lures that we use 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.700
 we have to use is a measure of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.720
 braided then clear me for example 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.760
 a 0 28 a pretty fat braid 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.970
 and of course I can not a lady of 20 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.970
 grams because I'm going to leave it 15 meters 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.790
 20 meters I'm going to leave it man then what 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.280
 which is mainly about having the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.940
 braided ideal if for example we are going to 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.330
 use lures of 25 grams 30 35 40 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.330
 grams 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.310
 and good basically 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.630
 that two things makes the throw good 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.230
 that the decoy comes out of the first one is the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.920
 firmness that we have to lance 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.920
 if we have a very loose cast the lure 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.659
 it's not going to go very well 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.670
 and the second is that when we release let's go 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.250
 the lure just like that if there's no 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.640
 many people who release the lure like this 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.990
 if instead we release the lure like this 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.970
 just throwing thread with 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.580
 the lord does all this travel 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.970
 towards now 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.870
 and well then clarify that there are people who 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.660
 I've been asked 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:04.190
 it's true that if when you throw the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.540
 reel you look at it like this up throw 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.950
 jump higher 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.340
 to say that you're going to throw 50 meters 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.690
 the difference may vary between 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.680
 meters to 10 meters here sure they are 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.290
 using 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.030
 but there are concepts that are limited 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.680
 between 40 and 50 meters 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.170
 and as much as they put the roads and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:31.360
 well or doing cartwheels the lure is going to 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.810
 get to the same side like a haul 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.830
 good would be one 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.830
 will think carroll 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.970
 about 70 meters 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.650
 70 80 meters 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.950
 and well this is a greeting from 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.950
 farm
