00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.320
 hello everyone with you alex and in this video 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.109
 I will tell you how it will be by the day 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.240
 do a lot of movie jade in one 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.050
 almost no day at the same time 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.939
 salt and so still worth starting you 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.760
 going to five people 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.529
 everyone should have a minimum 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.570
 the amount of salt that is needed for 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.930
 goats but for example went on for 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 thousands splines and I had her 3 after 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.440
 what are you registering game go in 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.660
 her 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 take absolutely any peak that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 want for example went to the troll warlock 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.500
 gul not edge and thrust through 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.570
 choose your peak what video you want i 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.449
 This is for you soon because firstly not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.000
 sense to show you how we are about 15 minutes 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.250
 they killed me and plus my teammates 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.859
 skype began to carry nonsense we started 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 hysterical we made mistakes this 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 shows no sense and so are you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.240
 take down the required amount of damage 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.820
 which you want we for example demolished 10 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.850
 million for what give three and a half 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.000
 thousands of tokin for 5 million if not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.939
 I am mistaken give 2750 that is, if you 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 feel you won't get it right 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.360
 amount you can just stop at 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.210
 5 then what you do you choose 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.180
 one person than the Greeks two people 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.630
 one man who spend his salt 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.810
 instead of all one man who shower and 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.869
 so one person will write in the console 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.899
 drive anna's team and leave the game after 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.630
 This three more delta absolute even himself 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.229
 one person stays on the map here 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.079
 as soon as everyone came out he dies all 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.049
 characters map merges and 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.680
 complete in seconds 10 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:04.290
 you on the number j tokens and not 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.670
 will be removed well, if only there were not 5 people 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.039
 of course that is what we have you don't 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.470
 spending salt get three and a half 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.400
 thousands of jade pins 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.410

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.190
