cross<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.030> start<00:00:45.030> off<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> level<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
cross and start off on a level that you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.459 
cross and start off on a level that you
can<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> nice<00:00:47.520> full<00:00:47.910> range<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.360> motion<00:00:48.539> your

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
can get a nice full range of motion your

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.560 
can get a nice full range of motion your
shoulder<00:00:50.070> joint<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.550> what's<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
shoulder joint is what's going to be the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.299 
shoulder joint is what's going to be the
most<00:00:51.780> important<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.350> limiting<00:00:52.770> your<00:00:52.949> range<00:00:53.160> of

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
most important in limiting your range of

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.660 
most important in limiting your range of
motion

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
motion

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.400 
motion
so<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> started<00:00:54.449> you'll<00:00:54.629> notice<00:00:54.930> with<00:00:55.020> my<00:00:55.199> hands
