head<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.970> website<00:00:18.890> and<00:00:21.439> i'll<00:00:22.439> put<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
head to this website and i'll put the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.130 
head to this website and i'll put the
link<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.189> description<00:00:23.820> below<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:27.140> i've

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
link in the description below and i've

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.750 
link in the description below and i've
added<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> my<00:00:28.740> home<00:00:29.010> screen<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:29.369> i<00:00:29.429> think<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
added it to my home screen so i think it

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.530 
added it to my home screen so i think it
turns<00:00:29.970> into<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:30.539> sort<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:32.540> stupid

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
turns into like some sort of that stupid

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.270 
turns into like some sort of that stupid
fly<00:00:34.760> but<00:00:35.760> anyway<00:00:36.510> once<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.380> loads<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:38.219> i

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
fly but anyway once it loads or i

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
fly but anyway once it loads or i
suppose<00:00:38.610> i<00:00:38.910> could<00:00:38.969> just<00:00:39.180> send<00:00:39.390> us<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.570> safari<00:00:39.989> to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
suppose i could just send us a safari to

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.209 
suppose i could just send us a safari to
do<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.660> like<00:00:42.840> an<00:00:43.050> alternative<00:00:43.829> to

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
do this but it's like an alternative to
