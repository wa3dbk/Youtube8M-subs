00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 my 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.980
 hello to all of you is worth it 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 I would like to give a special review 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 attention how do you still connect to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.130
 server 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.630
 friend or there someone else 0 because 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.009
 suddenly your heart connected in the game 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.859
 garry's mod and so on the basis in previous 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.290
 I had a video made like this 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.180
 many do not understand how to do anything 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.469
 and many have various problems 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.390
 when connected and so in this video I 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.269
 I wanted time to pay attention to this 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.699
 problems and yet already summarize how 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.010
 connect harris to harris mod 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.859
 your friendâ€™s server or friend 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.320
 connected to your first thing we 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.160
 need to do this go to the start panel 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.469
 control and firewall windows 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.050
 Well, in general, not the essence of what you need 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.960
 go this way but as far as I know 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.130
 then on all vidos should be correct green 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.500
 windows firewall 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.759
 Well, about 8 certainly not sure but by 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.070
 about the rest it's one hundred percent so 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.360
 look for the enable and disable tab 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.100
 firewall windows here we click on it 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.390
 Further we tick off 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.930
 firewall windows 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.880
 go we are not yet recommended written 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.100
 just put ticks everywhere 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.659
 and click apply and easy as there 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.299
 will appear 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.549
 then after all the operation you did 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.680
 should run your program that is 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.740
 either logmein hamachi or tangle 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.780
 in england go into the room and your friend 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.170
 there also comes in hamachi done 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.890
 almost identical operation will want 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.530
 create 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.950
 network and your friend or friends 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.619
 join this network then after 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.240
 of this you must run the game and create 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.159
 server when you run the game you 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.200
 need to create a server for this 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.130
 click start a new game choose a card 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.040
 whatever you want then press 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.980
 tube player or in total 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.959
 players depending on how many players you are 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.580
 license then put a tick on the local 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.549
 server if you are a pirate is not 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.010
 leave i don't know why so me 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.450
 can not even ask because he 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.510
 I do not know why this is done I know what 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.140
 just so it works further erase your 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 settings as you need and further 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.510
 start the server after you 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.209
 started the server and logged in 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.690
 to check what your ip address is and 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.510
 port 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.209
 well, I just remember that I had 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.850
 comments such a question as I found out 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.970
 what is my port and so now I just 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.090
 I will show it for that 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.129
 look at sport and address 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.319
 local network is in principle 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.750
 the futility of soft ip what us 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.260
 local well in general we press the key 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.060
 tilde 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.569
 or just to the role of saying the letters and here 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.170
 then we write the status command like this 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:22.269
 it is written status press enter and and 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.250
 look here is the first line of this we 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.709
 host name ie garry's mod like it 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.870
 called forth is the version and in children and 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.849
 that's just the same our ip address and port 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.870
 port 27 015 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:41.319
 he goes according to the standard so that you 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.569
 I am waiting well connected you can about yourself 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.980
 write and throw just a general fact in 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.660
 that when you need to connect 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.840
 write the console here this command 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.660
 connect then write ip address but 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.150
 let's copy everything from here and everything to 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.730
 do not bother juice write your first 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.530
 ip address and then colon 27 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.519
 015 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.900
 then call enter or submit and 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.530
 starts connecting to your server 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.690
 friend if you have problems 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.700
 i.e 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.900
 connection failed ie most 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.090
 people arises 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.040
 author for interest in common 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.820
 error in principle it means that 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.520
 the server is either turned off or does not work well 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.140
 or maybe you better double-check 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.580
 maybe you made a mistake in 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.480
 and the address or is it you? 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.210
 put 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.370
 Che did not put a tick if you have 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:43.730
 licensed server here it can 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.880
 to be due to the fact that small 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.860
 in front of maur windows or maybe your 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.590
 antivirus on your antivirus program 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.910
 somehow blocks the connection in 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.790
 In general, now such antiviral programs 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.910
 went over stuffed with what even behind them 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.460
 Well, in general, then this is all 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.660
 with you was mister put and like 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.820
 subscribe to the channel 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:10.060

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.060
 I will answer with pleasure and so on for the time being.
