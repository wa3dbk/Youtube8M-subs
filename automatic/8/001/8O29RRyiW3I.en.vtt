00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.490
 once again the facies monster 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.510
 pig came to talk about him in 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.340
 the kingdom of hyrule 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
 and once again these lines that has to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.519
 sticking all the dirty work but this 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.410
 time will not be alone 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.199
 a sword with strange powers goes the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.400
 split into four identical characters 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.600
 the game takes the bulk of the engine 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.100
 graph that was turning the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 third installment on super nintendo 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.279
 lots of visual effects have 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.539
 obviously been added to take advantage of 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.920
 abilities of the gamecube but in 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.880
 all is relatively simple 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.800
 concretely the game is not a real 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.390
 zelda adventure full share it's 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.100
 plus a parallel episode that had for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.450
 purpose of harnessing the connectivity between the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.040
 gamecube and the game boy advance force 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.360
 world offers indeed to four players 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.219
 to take part in the adventure for little 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.320
 that each of the Mayas preceded a canoe of 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.700
 liaison then we play partly on 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 the main screen but as soon as one day 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.039
 in a cave 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.480
 he must focus on his laptop 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.480
 to continue on his way 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.750
 behind this possibility more 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.520
 that attractive we are disappointed in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.020
 realizing that freedom is fast 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.850
 reduced by more than narrow paintings 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.710
 Dummies that solve themselves the most 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 often solitary is a concept that 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.940
 promotes more competition than the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.140
 cooperation remains the battle mode that 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.850
 can all players on several 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.110
 tables and some mini-games that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.030
 will remind press that the series of 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:33.020
 mario party 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:33.020
 [Music] 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.380
 no doubt we know what we are playing 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.180
 there are all the key places in the series 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.770
 there are the musical themes that go with 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.210
 there are the palaces with the riddles of 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.650
 square and there are the bosses that you 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.869
 always waiting always hidden 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.619
 behind the same big doors that does not 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.240
 never change too much a zelda the 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.860
 possibility to play several and well 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.330
 obviously a plus we would however 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.520
 desired fewer constraints for 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.560
 fully having fun with this game and that one 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.789
 will see it soon after we understand that 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.440
 the progression will be based on 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.030
 the use of the four characters in 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.070
 at the same time the solutions are presented 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.989
 of itself except for one or two places 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.970
 really annoying even the palaces get 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.220
 finish quickly it requires a 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.760
 minimum of logic and a zest of reflex 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.760
 that's all 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.069
 [Music] 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.829
 it is nonexistent in this game if you 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.900
 play alone you can only have one 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.219
 object at once in addition to your sword to 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.599
 several each can choose the object 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.799
 which suits him but the game makes you 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.209
 clearly understand when you have to 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.900
 to drop one year in favor of a 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.519
 other for completely dropped 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.200
 the adventure aspect for the action aspect 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.790
 the game is a sequel of world cut in 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.140
 three levels with a lack ably a 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.019
 palace and a boss at the end 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.069
 freedom of movement 0 very often 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.069
 can not even go back 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.090
 bring cannes game boy advance and four 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.859
 connecting cables is a real challenge 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.120
 to say that only few players 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.010
 should be able to take advantage of this 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.299
 option which do not understand why the 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.829
 game is not absolutely play with the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.200
 classic joystick with the collection in 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.609
 option a split screen would have even been 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.599
 more appreciated than this species of 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.599
 utopian fantasy 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.979
 [Music] 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.550
 [Music] 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.320
 only the game is nice but without 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.210
 more to many it is too much 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.350
 difficult to access so we do not know 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.810
 too much where to place this attempt 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.340
 of evolution of the series the initial idea 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.870
 was good and the game itself is 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.280
 pleasant in outline but if 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.020
 it is to play alone it is better to 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.250
 fall back on the real games and if that's 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.480
 to play several so let 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.040
 to fall right away it's too hard to 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.690
 gather all the gear 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:03.169
 not to mention motivated buddies 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:03.169
