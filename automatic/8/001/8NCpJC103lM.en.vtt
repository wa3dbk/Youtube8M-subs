although the character remains the same

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.410 
although the character remains the same
there's<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.130> different<00:01:47.609> intensity<00:01:48.119> and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
there's a different intensity and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.899 
there's a different intensity and
different<00:01:49.259> approaches<00:01:50.039> but<00:01:50.399> this

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
different approaches but this

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.389 
different approaches but this
transformers<00:01:51.689> fall<00:01:52.109> of<00:01:52.289> Cybertron<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.340> a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
transformers fall of Cybertron is is a

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.940 
transformers fall of Cybertron is is a
lot<00:01:53.880> different<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.810> has<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.170> elements<00:01:55.859> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
lot different it has the elements of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.059 
lot different it has the elements of
emotion<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.750> there's<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.869> lot<00:01:58.319> of<00:01:58.349> relation<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
emotion and there's a lot of relation to

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.669 
emotion and there's a lot of relation to
character<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.789> so<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.599> game<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.469> only

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
character and so this game is not only

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.910 
character and so this game is not only
fun<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.159> do<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.390> seems<00:02:03.929> much<00:02:04.289> more<00:02:04.349> of<00:02:04.770> all

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
fun to do and it seems much more of all

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.940 
fun to do and it seems much more of all
of<00:02:05.549> involvement<00:02:06.119> into<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.509> story<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.739> I

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
of involvement into a story and then I

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.729 
of involvement into a story and then I
think<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.329> the<00:02:10.259> real<00:02:10.470> take

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
think that's going to be the real take

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:23.910 
think that's going to be the real take
for<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> i<00:02:11.190> think<00:02:11.459> till<00:02:12.390> all<00:02:12.720> are<00:02:13.260> one

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920
