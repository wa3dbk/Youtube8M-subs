allows you to set a recording interval

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.129 
allows you to set a recording interval
so<00:04:39.590> for<00:04:40.069> example<00:04:40.550> you<00:04:41.210> can<00:04:41.360> record<00:04:41.660> an<00:04:41.870> image

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
so for example you can record an image

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.469 
so for example you can record an image
every<00:04:42.590> 5<00:04:42.830> or<00:04:43.009> 10<00:04:43.190> seconds<00:04:43.699> instead<00:04:44.210> of<00:04:44.360> at<00:04:44.449> the

every 5 or 10 seconds instead of at the
full<00:04:44.720> frame<00:04:45.020> rate<00:04:45.639> this<00:04:46.639> can<00:04:46.819> save<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.060> lot<00:04:47.270> of

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
full frame rate this can save a lot of
