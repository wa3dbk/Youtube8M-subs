today we gonna give you a quick look at
the<00:00:13.980> hyperlapse<00:00:14.700> mobile<00:00:15.210> app<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.379> app<00:00:16.410> first

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
the hyperlapse mobile app the app first

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.099 
the hyperlapse mobile app the app first
surfaced<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.820> internet<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.480> few<00:00:18.720> days<00:00:18.900> ago

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
surfaced on the internet a few days ago

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.519 
surfaced on the internet a few days ago
and<00:00:19.470> today<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> have<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.600> app<00:00:22.140> actually

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and today we I have that app actually

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.300 
and today we I have that app actually
installed<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.369> our<00:00:23.519> 830<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:25.140> let's<00:00:25.590> head<00:00:26.039> down

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
installed in our 830 so let's head down

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.089 
installed in our 830 so let's head down
and<00:00:26.580> see<00:00:26.880> how<00:00:27.390> does<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:27.810> app<00:00:28.109> perform<00:00:28.619> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and see how does this app perform the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.790 
and see how does this app perform the
app<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.210> app<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.660> early<00:00:31.289> alpha

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
app is a the app is in early alpha

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.729 
app is a the app is in early alpha
version<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.739> might<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.940> be<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:37.170> same<00:00:37.500> app

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
version so it might not be the same app

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.369 
version so it might not be the same app
which<00:00:38.160> Microsoft<00:00:39.120> will<00:00:39.300> announced<00:00:40.200> for

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
which Microsoft will announced for

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.959 
which Microsoft will announced for
everyone<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> app<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.739> quite<00:00:44.219> simple<00:00:44.700> as<00:00:44.850> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
everyone the app is quite simple as you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.240 
everyone the app is quite simple as you
can<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.660> have<00:00:45.690> two<00:00:46.140> buttons<00:00:46.559> when<00:00:47.039> it's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
can see we have two buttons when it's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.250 
can see we have two buttons when it's
the<00:00:47.399> front<00:00:47.610> facing<00:00:48.000> camera<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.420> other<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.110> is

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the front facing camera and other one is

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.760 
the front facing camera and other one is
for<00:00:49.469> flashlights<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.730> an<00:00:51.059> off<00:00:51.180> switch<00:00:51.559> here<00:00:52.559> we

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
for flashlights on an off switch here we

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.160 
for flashlights on an off switch here we
have<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> record<00:00:53.399> button<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.960> can

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
have a record button so that we can

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.220 
have a record button so that we can
start<00:00:55.289> recording<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.989> type<00:00:57.989> layer

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
start recording of the type layer

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.740 
start recording of the type layer
hyperlapse<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.969> can<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
hyperlapse and you can see here is the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.470 
hyperlapse and you can see here is the
recording<00:01:01.289> time<00:01:01.530> for<00:01:02.070> how<00:01:02.699> much<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
recording time for how much time it is

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.299 
recording time for how much time it is
being<00:01:03.899> recorded<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
being recorded and here we have the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.260 
being recorded and here we have the
default<00:01:06.560> default<00:01:07.560> speed<00:01:08.189> selection<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.090> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
default default speed selection which is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.020 
default default speed selection which is
a<00:01:09.450> text<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.500> will<00:01:10.710> show<00:01:11.340> how<00:01:11.610> much<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
a text and it will show how much a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210 
a text and it will show how much a
second<00:01:12.600> how<00:01:12.840> much<00:01:13.020> minute<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.950> app<00:01:14.189> has

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
second how much minute the app has

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.100 
second how much minute the app has
recorded<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.860> x8x<00:01:16.860> speed<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.720> just

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
recorded at x8x speed so for not just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.469 
recorded at x8x speed so for not just
each<00:01:19.650> other<00:01:19.830> let's<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:20.610> cancel<00:01:21.119> this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
each other let's just cancel this

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.370 
each other let's just cancel this
recording<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:24.030> next<00:01:24.330> thing<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:25.259> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
recording the next thing we have here is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.670 
recording the next thing we have here is
the<00:01:25.619> three<00:01:26.280> dots<00:01:26.540> which<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.689> pretty<00:01:28.439> familiar

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
the three dots which are pretty familiar

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.440 
the three dots which are pretty familiar
in<00:01:29.220> every<00:01:29.909> app<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.530> actually<00:01:31.710> export

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
in every app and we can actually export

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.219 
in every app and we can actually export
import<00:01:33.450> sorry<00:01:33.750> import<00:01:34.560> any<00:01:34.710> video<00:01:35.159> from<00:01:35.850> our

import sorry import any video from our

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.859 
import sorry import any video from our
libraries<00:01:37.250> so<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.850> quickly<00:01:39.450> create

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
libraries so that we can quickly create

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.160 
libraries so that we can quickly create
a<00:01:40.079> hyperlapse<00:01:40.829> video<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:45.020> there<00:01:46.020> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a hyperlapse video of that and there is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.249 
a hyperlapse video of that and there is
nothing<00:01:46.320> very<00:01:46.740> much<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.729> app<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:49.049> show

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
nothing very much in this app to show

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
nothing very much in this app to show
you<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:50.369> app<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.860> very<00:01:52.860> early<00:01:53.220> stage<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.360> it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you the app is in very early stage so it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.160 
you the app is in very early stage so it
will<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.799> changed<00:01:56.399> as<00:01:56.640> per<00:01:57.390> Microsoft's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
will be changed as per Microsoft's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.709 
will be changed as per Microsoft's
requirement<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.399> now<00:01:59.640> you<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.570> check

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
requirement for now you can just check

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.800 
requirement for now you can just check
out<00:02:00.869> our<00:02:00.930> sample<00:02:01.729> in<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.820> sample<00:02:03.149> hyperlapse

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
out our sample in a sample hyperlapse

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:14.910 
out our sample in a sample hyperlapse
video<00:02:04.079> we<00:02:04.740> click<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.390> app

so<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> very<00:02:36.450> interesting<00:02:36.920> app<00:02:37.920> for

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
so this is a very interesting app for

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.789 
so this is a very interesting app for
every<00:02:38.730> user<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.299> we<00:02:39.870> will<00:02:40.049> be<00:02:40.200> seeing<00:02:40.500> how
