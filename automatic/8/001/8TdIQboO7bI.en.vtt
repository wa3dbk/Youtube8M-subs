because this arrived just a few minutes

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.490

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
little cardboard thing at the top but

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.910 
little cardboard thing at the top but
simple<00:00:37.660> packaging<00:00:38.020> I<00:00:38.170> don't<00:00:38.500> really<00:00:38.680> care

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
simple packaging I don't really care

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.290 
simple packaging I don't really care
because<00:00:39.370> it's<00:00:39.610> what's<00:00:39.790> inside<00:00:39.970> that<00:00:40.120> counts

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
because it's what's inside that counts

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.500 
because it's what's inside that counts
and<00:00:40.830> first<00:00:41.830> looks<00:00:42.400> at<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.700> server<00:00:43.060> I'm<00:00:43.270> quite

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
and first looks at the server I'm quite

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.700 
and first looks at the server I'm quite
impressed<00:00:43.810> I<00:00:43.930> gotta<00:00:44.080> say<00:00:44.200> I'm<00:00:44.320> quite<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.530> Chris

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710

precise and it's good centering and the

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.690 
precise and it's good centering and the
gears<00:00:49.990> it<00:00:50.200> sounds<00:00:51.070> like<00:00:51.220> it's<00:00:51.400> titanium

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
gears it sounds like it's titanium

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.820 
gears it sounds like it's titanium
because<00:00:52.120> it's<00:00:52.270> got<00:00:52.960> grittiest<00:00:53.380> feel<00:00:53.650> feels

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
because it's got grittiest feel feels

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.320 
because it's got grittiest feel feels
like<00:00:53.950> a<00:00:54.040> sand<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:54.490> it<00:00:54.580> which<00:00:54.670> is<00:00:54.700> not<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:55.030> bad

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:55.330 
like a sand in it which is not a bad

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.030 
like a sand in it which is not a bad
thing<00:00:55.600> because<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.410> means<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.710> gears<00:00:56.890> it's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
thing because it means the gears it's

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.750 
thing because it means the gears it's
very<00:00:57.220> hard<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.700> it<00:00:57.760> hasn't<00:00:57.910> worn<00:00:58.210> smooth<00:00:58.570> so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
very hard and it hasn't worn smooth so

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.070 
very hard and it hasn't worn smooth so
initially<00:01:00.760> I'm<00:01:01.000> quite<00:01:01.390> impressed<00:01:01.810> with<00:01:01.900> the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
initially I'm quite impressed with the

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.890 
initially I'm quite impressed with the
Civic<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:02.620> is<00:01:02.920> yeah<00:01:03.880> a<00:01:03.910> little<00:01:04.390> bit<00:01:04.509> heavy<00:01:04.750> for

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
Civic it is yeah a little bit heavy for

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.420 
Civic it is yeah a little bit heavy for
a<00:01:04.930> standard<00:01:05.259> silver<00:01:05.409> but<00:01:05.650> hey<00:01:05.799> it's<00:01:05.979> ten<00:01:06.250> and<00:01:06.400> a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
a standard silver but hey it's ten and a

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.950 
a standard silver but hey it's ten and a
half<00:01:06.490> kilogram<00:01:06.970> centimetres<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.450> talk<00:01:07.720> and

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
half kilogram centimetres a talk and

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.570 
half kilogram centimetres a talk and
it's<00:01:08.350> quite<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> bit<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:09.100> can<00:01:09.159> put<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.400> in<00:01:09.520> a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
it's quite a bit you can put this in a

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.149 
it's quite a bit you can put this in a
thirty<00:01:09.790> CC<00:01:10.180> model<00:01:10.480> or<00:01:10.900> even<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.110> 50<00:01:11.380> CCS<00:01:11.830> model

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
thirty CC model or even a 50 CCS model

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.740 
thirty CC model or even a 50 CCS model
and<00:01:12.370> it<00:01:12.700> will<00:01:12.850> probably<00:01:13.030> do<00:01:13.270> the<00:01:13.420> job<00:01:13.600> quite

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
and it will probably do the job quite

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.660 
and it will probably do the job quite
well<00:01:13.930> if<00:01:14.409> it<00:01:14.620> lives<00:01:14.890> up<00:01:15.040> to<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.280> other<00:01:15.400> claims

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
well if it lives up to the other claims

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.700 
well if it lives up to the other claims
so<00:01:16.060> what<00:01:16.659> I'm<00:01:16.750> going<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:16.960> do<00:01:17.110> now<00:01:17.260> put<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.620> on

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
so what I'm going to do now put it on

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.920 
so what I'm going to do now put it on
the<00:01:17.800> bench<00:01:17.950> run<00:01:18.580> it<00:01:18.670> to<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:18.820> barrage<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.510> tests

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
the bench run it to a barrage of tests

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.990 
the bench run it to a barrage of tests
and<00:01:20.170> see<00:01:20.380> how<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.650> performs<00:01:21.040> but<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.850> course

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
and see how it performs but of course

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.399 
and see how it performs but of course
that<00:01:22.090> doesn't<00:01:22.240> tell<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.659> whole<00:01:22.690> story<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:23.140> can

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
that doesn't tell the whole story I can

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.840 
that doesn't tell the whole story I can
verify<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.830> speed<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.400> torque<00:01:24.430> and<00:01:24.760> what

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
verify the speed and the torque and what

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.370 
verify the speed and the torque and what
sort<00:01:25.000> of<00:01:25.030> stuff<00:01:25.150> in<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.330> accuracy<00:01:25.720> but<00:01:26.200> what

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
sort of stuff in the accuracy but what

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.600 
sort of stuff in the accuracy but what
you<00:01:26.470> want<00:01:26.650> to<00:01:26.710> know<00:01:26.770> is<00:01:26.890> how<00:01:27.040> well<00:01:27.340> does<00:01:27.490> it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
you want to know is how well does it

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.800 
you want to know is how well does it
perform<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.000> year<00:01:28.120> and<00:01:28.210> how<00:01:28.300> long<00:01:28.570> does<00:01:28.750> it

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
perform in the year and how long does it

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.080 
perform in the year and how long does it
last<00:01:28.960> because<00:01:29.560> a<00:01:29.950> lot<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.340> these<00:01:30.460> servos<00:01:30.850> I

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
last because a lot of these servos I

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.630 
last because a lot of these servos I
found<00:01:31.659> they<00:01:31.990> go<00:01:32.140> great<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.890> bench<00:01:33.070> put<00:01:33.490> out

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
found they go great on the bench put out

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.550 
found they go great on the bench put out
great<00:01:34.120> torque<00:01:34.510> figures<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:34.840> things<00:01:34.900> but<00:01:35.080> once

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
great torque figures and things but once

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.660 
great torque figures and things but once
you<00:01:35.650> get<00:01:35.710> them<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:35.979> air<00:01:36.130> it's<00:01:36.370> not<00:01:36.400> long

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
you get them in the air it's not long

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.950 
you get them in the air it's not long
before<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.060> magic<00:01:37.270> smoke<00:01:37.450> comes<00:01:37.659> over<00:01:37.840> the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
before the magic smoke comes over the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
gears it goes all rectly and they become

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.480 
gears it goes all rectly and they become
a<00:01:39.700> useless<00:01:40.000> so<00:01:40.360> over<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.470> next<00:01:41.500> few<00:01:41.799> weeks<00:01:42.130> or

gonna put it on rudder which is the most

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.620 
gonna put it on rudder which is the most
hard<00:01:50.500> work<00:01:50.830> servo<00:01:51.460> and<00:01:51.729> at<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.390> end<00:01:52.510> of<00:01:52.540> it

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
hard work servo and at the end of it

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.050 
hard work servo and at the end of it
time<00:01:52.840> I'll<00:01:53.049> do<00:01:53.530> a<00:01:53.590> retrospective<00:01:54.040> so<00:01:54.820> we<00:01:54.940> got<00:01:55.030> a

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
time I'll do a retrospective so we got a

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.310 
time I'll do a retrospective so we got a
preview<00:01:55.210> a<00:01:55.420> review<00:01:55.750> then<00:01:55.930> a<00:01:55.960> retrospective

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
preview a review then a retrospective

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.500 
preview a review then a retrospective
we'll<00:01:56.710> have<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.860> look<00:01:56.979> at<00:01:57.070> how<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.580> stood<00:01:58.030> up<00:01:58.060> to

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
we'll have a look at how it stood up to

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.810 
we'll have a look at how it stood up to
the<00:01:58.630> test<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.930> time<00:01:59.170> vibration<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.310> heavy

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
the test of time vibration and heavy

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.640 
the test of time vibration and heavy
loads<00:02:01.060> net<00:02:01.780> will<00:02:01.900> tell<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.170> if<00:02:02.260> it's<00:02:02.380> really<00:02:02.619> a

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
loads net will tell you if it's really a

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.500 
loads net will tell you if it's really a
good<00:02:02.830> server<00:02:03.130> or<00:02:03.250> not<00:02:03.400> so<00:02:03.970> in<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.299> meantime

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510
