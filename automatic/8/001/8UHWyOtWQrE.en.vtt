00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.020 

I<00:00:00.650> think<00:00:01.650> that<00:00:01.770> there's<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.070> another

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
I think that there's a another

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.120 
I think that there's a another
revolution<00:00:03.660> coming<00:00:03.900> I'm<00:00:04.350> not<00:00:04.560> sure<00:00:04.770> what<00:00:05.009> its

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
revolution coming I'm not sure what its

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.460 
revolution coming I'm not sure what its
gonna<00:00:05.220> look<00:00:05.340> like<00:00:06.020> but<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.049> think<00:00:07.259> it's<00:00:07.350> gonna

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
gonna look like but I think it's gonna

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.259 
gonna look like but I think it's gonna
be<00:00:07.590> very<00:00:07.740> interesting<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:09.089> gonna

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
be very interesting and it's gonna

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.659 
be very interesting and it's gonna
unfold<00:00:09.599> over<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.900> next<00:00:10.139> ten<00:00:10.410> years<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.980> I

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:11.669 
unfold over the next ten years and I

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:13.999 
unfold over the next ten years and I
think<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:12.030> needs<00:00:12.209> to<00:00:12.329> be<00:00:12.419> a<00:00:13.230> spiritual

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
think it needs to be a spiritual

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.120 
think it needs to be a spiritual
revolution<00:00:14.369> I<00:00:17.779> think<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:19.230> our<00:00:19.380> systems<00:00:19.830> are

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
revolution I think that our systems are

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.609 
revolution I think that our systems are
broken<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.730> don't<00:00:21.599> think<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.380> political

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
broken I don't think that our political

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.829 
broken I don't think that our political
system<00:00:22.910> will<00:00:23.910> ever<00:00:24.060> work<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.419> don't<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:24.720> how

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:24.839 
system will ever work I don't think how

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.429 
system will ever work I don't think how
matter<00:00:25.259> how<00:00:25.470> great<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:25.949> man<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.210> cloned<00:00:27.689> JFK

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
matter how great a man if you cloned JFK

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.779 
matter how great a man if you cloned JFK
and<00:00:28.560> Abraham<00:00:28.949> Lincoln<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.460> made<00:00:29.609> them

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
and Abraham Lincoln and made them

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.460 
and Abraham Lincoln and made them
president<00:00:30.320> it<00:00:31.320> wouldn't<00:00:31.859> matter<00:00:32.570> our<00:00:33.570> system

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
president it wouldn't matter our system

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.950 
president it wouldn't matter our system
is<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:34.980> too<00:00:35.280> corrupt<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.150> too<00:00:36.270> broken<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
is just too corrupt and too broken I

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.250 
is just too corrupt and too broken I
think<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:38.120> science<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.300> corrupt<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.810> broken

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
think that science is corrupt and broken

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.380 
think that science is corrupt and broken
I<00:00:40.470> think<00:00:40.710> health<00:00:41.220> and<00:00:41.430> nutrition<00:00:41.970> I<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
I think health and nutrition I think the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
I think health and nutrition I think the
economic<00:00:42.960> systems<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.850> international

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
good intentions but these are gonna

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.430 
good intentions but these are gonna
break<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.220> more<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.450> more<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.110> more<00:00:58.170> we're

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
break down more and more and more we're

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.110 
break down more and more and more we're
going<00:00:58.560> to<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.680> these<00:00:58.890> wild<00:00:59.160> pendulum<00:00:59.790> swings

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
going to see these wild pendulum swings

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
going to see these wild pendulum swings
because<00:01:00.420> people<00:01:00.900> are<00:01:00.990> scrambling<00:01:01.560> for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
because people are scrambling for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.650 
because people are scrambling for
answers<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.670> doesn't<00:01:06.060> work<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
answers and it just it doesn't work so

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.650 
answers and it just it doesn't work so
the<00:01:06.780> young<00:01:07.050> people<00:01:07.080> are<00:01:07.590> gonna<00:01:07.770> need<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.660> like

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.720 

you<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.260> enough<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.710> enough<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.190> guys<00:01:20.340> you

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
you know enough is enough you guys you

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.430 
you know enough is enough you guys you
guys<00:01:20.850> screwed<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.480> up<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.780> need<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> take<00:01:22.230> our

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
guys screwed it up we need to take our

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.970 
guys screwed it up we need to take our
our<00:01:22.950> planet<00:01:23.550> back<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.470> part<00:01:25.800> of<00:01:25.920> that

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:25.980 
our planet back and I think part of that

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.930 
our planet back and I think part of that
journey<00:01:26.810> part<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.550> revolution<00:01:29.550> needs<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
journey part of that revolution needs to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.680 
journey part of that revolution needs to
be<00:01:30.060> spiritual<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.810> think<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:33.540> word

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
be spiritual I think that the word

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.230 
be spiritual I think that the word
spiritual<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.290> very<00:01:34.470> loaded<00:01:34.710> weird<00:01:35.159> word<00:01:35.460> but

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
spiritual is very loaded weird word but

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.649 
spiritual is very loaded weird word but
I<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.050> needs<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.350> be

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
I think it needs to be

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.359 
I think it needs to be
with<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:39.109> heart<00:01:39.469> based<00:01:39.740> wisdom<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:42.289> this<00:01:43.039> heart

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
with a heart based wisdom and this heart

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.830 
with a heart based wisdom and this heart
based<00:01:43.609> wisdom<00:01:44.030> needs<00:01:44.210> to<00:01:44.299> go<00:01:44.420> hand<00:01:44.659> in<00:01:44.780> hand

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
based wisdom needs to go hand in hand

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.050 
based wisdom needs to go hand in hand
with<00:01:45.079> science<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.829> with<00:01:46.249> social<00:01:46.579> activism

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
with science and with social activism

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.080 
with science and with social activism
and<00:01:47.390> love<00:01:47.899> for<00:01:48.079> our<00:01:48.140> planet<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.640> love<00:01:49.819> for<00:01:50.000> our
