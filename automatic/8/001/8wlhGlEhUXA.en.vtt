00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi this is written from the video site test.com 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.390
 today the test of the superior or 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 strings at higher forcing so 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.440
 signed with a milk protein the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.000
 commercial arguments of this product and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
 are pretty simple since they promise 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.520
 a fairly simple mix and texture 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 creamy so nice in the mouth so there 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:34.230
 obviously everything and I had everything is focused 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:35.940
 on taste then at the level of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.040
 ingredients so we have a matrix 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.940
 of milk proteins to know of a where 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.399
 is concentrated isola the hydrolysis ah 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.530
 obviously good proportions are not 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.140
 not specified so that's good that's 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.730
 quite common we also find that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.710
 it succeeds in peptides of vitamins to 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.110
 the advanced that glutamine price under the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.850
 normal form is intercepted by ester 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.469
 digestive that little chance that it 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.300
 happens either in the muscles 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.129
 so the wish peptide order 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.690
 precisely the largest quantities 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.299
 would get to the muscles and therefore play his 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.520
 role in recovery especially in 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.409
 France and it's interesting at the level 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 Sons monsters have 5 grams 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.540
 powder 73 grams of protein 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.700
 so knowing that there are different types 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 of proteins inside and bomb at the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.330
 Sacra is a good guy who makes 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.790
 actually we have a lot more of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.650
 weck concentrate something else so that's 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.420
 rather average 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.240
 then we are in the race is 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.740
 actually there are a lot of carbs 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 since we are almost at 16 g 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.240
 so that's a choice to make a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.650
 care you prefer the taste be you 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.060
 take a protein with lucille methÃ© 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.000
 with a taste that will be a bit more 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.729
 more bland or here at 12 is a classic 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.570
 not graduated so I have pretty much a little 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.329
 over 250 milliliters of water in oral 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.590
 Visibility tests 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.149
 so obviously it stays bigger 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.360
 thing inside since when I 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.860
 you have this product I test it thoroughly I 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.660
 did not say 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.450
 you have 900 points a few 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.650
 grams up to 2 kg 27 and so in 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.760
 mix it up and mix it up we have a 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.350
 little bit of foam but you see 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.110
 it disappears very very quickly 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.200
 we see here a level of visibility more 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.330
 that correct since there are no lumps 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.970
 so my personal opinion since the age is 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.070
 still just to taste them our tastes 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.900
 chocolate is good enough I like it 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.280
 but I think it's really 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.750
 sweet then just that is explained by 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.240
 the presence in particular of a strong 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.490
 proportion of carbohydrates strong points 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.940
 of this product first of all we have 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.190
 good visibility and finally it's a 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.959
 here in peace little of glutamine it's this 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.600
 who differentiates it from others produce 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.140
 two of this type at the points level 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.180
 low 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.580
 so you have a concentration in 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.320
 protein is rather average 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.570
 and for some the construction of the site 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.959
 can be a bit high so to see 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.280
 and finally no information as to 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.890
 proportions the different types of 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.230
 proteins inside so in the end we 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.430
 has a product going on in the hands 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.220
 of what is currently being proposed 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.840
 market let's say it's all played out at 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.380
 texture level of taste which is 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.080
 rather actually pleasant on the palate 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.190
 and so if you have tested this product if 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.260
 you want to give your opinion 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.120
 not to go to the site in the article 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.310
 which is much more complete and 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.870
 do not hesitate to note but I will 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.250
 also invites us to support one are 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.010
 social networks including about 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.660
 facebook and so that we win in 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.280
 visibility and we can offer you 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.930
 more and more products tested 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.790
 that's all for me and I tell you to 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.790
 very soon on vidot test.com hi
