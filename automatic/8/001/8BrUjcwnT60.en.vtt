00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.350
 more than 2000 years have passed since his 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.830
 own story changed the story of the 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.340
 world 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.880
 today on an irrational and violent planet 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.619
 where discrimination still prevails where 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.930
 we have not managed to be able to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.410
 understand us as a human race its 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.199
 word remains as current as 2000 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.060
 years and it is a path of truth and life 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.140
 for all the beings that live in the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.090
 earth his name jesus de nazaret is not 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 presented more than as a man of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.160
 humble origin that did not need weapons 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.430
 nor did he use terrorism to make himself 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.589
 fight his words and his example were 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.339
 more than powerful to start a 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:52.229
 colossal war against everything 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:53.510
 denigrates and what the condition outrages 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.179
 human 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.000
 against the suffering inflicted upon 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.850
 man for the same man and against the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.030
 torment of evil jesus was a man 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.250
 exceptional as no leader the 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.190
 congruence of his words and deeds 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.039
 made the difference he did what 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.590
 he said and with that he taught the principles 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.899
 fundamentals of coexistence and 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.630
 well-being among men their 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.600
 teachings have gotten that despite 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.210
 our brutality and foolishness the world 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.520
 do not destroy yourself 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.430
 his voice has transcended beyond his 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.290
 epoch so that it does not go out in the 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.690
 humanity the weak flame of the 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.700
 mercy that still has his 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.159
 thought has been essential for 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.140
 even thousands fight around the world to 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.270
 avoid the war by ending the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.000
 hunger and the plague to end the 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.180
 poverty for annihilating suffering by 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.540
 make this a better world for 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 live around you untie thousands of 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.090
 controversial the truth is that even outside 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.640
 any religious connotation jesus 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.979
 had for the whole of humanity a 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.179
 universal commitment filled with more 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.459
 pure and disinterested love there are those who 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.950
 they exalt his figure as a divine prophet 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.540
 and still there are those who only see it as 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.750
 one more man and they are determined to demonstrate 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.959
 the defects that as such could have there 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.230
 who even question 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.810
 the historical veracity of its facts 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.640
 lindes the indisputable is that even today 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.530
 after humanity has reached 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.010
 the greatest technological advances 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.959
 highest scientific reasoning more 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.840
 beyond any religious creed or 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.160
 ideological thinking despite the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.370
 petty interests of some 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.770
 rulers who believe themselves more than god and 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.300
 of the convictions that have engulfed the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.150
 land in mercy and the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.100
 desperation in misery your message 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.000
 of peace and hope is still the most 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.640
 clear and forceful loves your neighbor 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.910
 as yourself because who loves 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.150
 Understanding respects respects and is not capable 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.370
 of causing harm no doubt the impact of 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.600
 jesus in the history of mankind is 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.970
 impressive even those who do not believe in him 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.760
 they are partakers of its footprint and its cry 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.610
 for forgiveness 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.780
 he gets up in the middle of a time in the 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.060
 in which cruelty dominates the world the 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.829
 the first time it was heard that all 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.230
 human beings are equal before the 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.230
 God's eyes no matter what 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.560
 condition or in the lands of galilea in 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.440
 voice of Jesus of Nazareth as he no 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.500
 it's better or worse because nobody is who 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.629
 to judge his fellow man his gospel 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.939
 of equality and respect for life is the 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.220
 basic principle of human rights 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:53.239
 that today protect all people 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.310
 against the extermination and segregation 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.920
 solidarity with which the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.280
 clemency with which he welcomed and forgiveness 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.459
 that is being condemned granted are the 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.040
 ineffable signs of a doctrine that 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.709
 He rose in the cruellest times of 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.739
 pain and all this because with what 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.230
 foundation with the sole foundation of 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.060
 unconditional love for all 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.850
 today we hold on waiting for a 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.960
 answer of a miracle when the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.970
 reality is that for two thousand years 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.729
 we have the answer in the words of 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.819
 Jesus the miracle of love is in 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:35.220
 we ourselves would need to carry out 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.220
 his teachings to get it
