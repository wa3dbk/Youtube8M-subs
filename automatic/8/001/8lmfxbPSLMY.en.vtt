00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.520
 'Czech' Perez presented this afternoon at the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.880
 city ​​of mexico the new compact of 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.650
 mercedes the sl and I take the opportunity to talk 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.050
 of what happened during the grand prize of 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.449
 bahrain the last weekend where 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.000
 brushed the car of his teammate jenson 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.670
 button when trying to overtake it 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.920
 the fifth Czech position assured that the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.620
 relationship between both is good and that the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.270
 problems raised during the race 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.460
 they were resolved immediately after 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.620
 of that we had the opportunity to talk 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.870
 which was very good for me for the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 team for de jenson in many sides 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.199
 who commented not that I had asked 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.930
 apologies from jenson in no time 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.640
 it was like that he does not ask for any apology I think 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.560
 that was not necessary and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.830
 more than anything the apology we owed 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.050
 both the team did not and that's how 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.490
 we talked and I apologized to the team 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.920
 because we risk a lot we are very 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.630
 aggressive the two 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.310
 but there is no time to ask 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.530
 no apology and the relationship with that 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.659
 it's not good it has not been easy for me 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.850
 arrival at mclaren has been hard I'm in 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.530

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.990
 church that has been quite hard 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.509
 with me and with an English partner 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.119
 then there are practically moments 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.860
 where I feel lonely but it's my country that 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.009
 motivates me to move forward that is the 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.380
 objective not for Barcelona we can 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.909
 have a quality jump all the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.830
