00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
part so there's not as much of a mess

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
part so there's not as much of a mess
necessarily<00:01:14.909> several<00:01:15.390> kids<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

household fostering duties often become

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
household fostering duties often become
a<00:01:18.030> family<00:01:18.360> affair<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:19.140> asked<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.950> clean

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
a family affair I asked them to clean

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.590 
a family affair I asked them to clean
the<00:01:20.310> litter<00:01:20.490> box<00:01:20.729> obviously<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.420> go<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the litter box obviously they go to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.679 
the litter box obviously they go to
school<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.110> they<00:01:22.200> can't<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.650> full<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.689> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
school so they can't do it full time and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.450 
school so they can't do it full time and
then<00:01:25.229> whenever<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:25.799> food<00:01:26.130> or<00:01:26.310> water

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
then whenever they see food or water

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.819 
then whenever they see food or water
empty<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> asked<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.200> mostly<00:01:28.530> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
empty I asked them to do it but mostly I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.440 
empty I asked them to do it but mostly I
feel<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.729> kittens<00:01:30.060> need<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.329> be

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
feel like the kittens need to be

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420 
feel like the kittens need to be
socialized<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> feel<00:01:31.740> like<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> big<00:01:32.189> part

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
socialized and so I feel like a big part

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.920 
socialized and so I feel like a big part
of<00:01:32.490> what<00:01:32.640> they're<00:01:32.820> doing<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.270> playing<00:01:33.750> with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
of what they're doing is playing with

of what they're doing is playing with
the<00:01:34.020> kittens<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> socializing<00:01:35.070> them<00:01:35.189> even

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the kittens and socializing them even

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.460 
the kittens and socializing them even
though<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:36.119> it's<00:01:36.299> not<00:01:36.450> work<00:01:36.689> it's<00:01:36.900> still

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
though to them it's not work it's still

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.410 
though to them it's not work it's still
necessary<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.579> still<00:01:38.820> something<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
necessary and it's still something I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.060 
necessary and it's still something I
can't<00:01:39.689> always<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.650> very<00:01:40.860> helpful

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
can't always do and it's very helpful

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039
