as<00:00:11.130> well<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.670> I'm<00:00:12.179> sure<00:00:12.389> was<00:00:12.570> probably<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
as well so I'm sure was probably the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.140 
as well so I'm sure was probably the
same<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.349> them<00:00:13.500> as<00:00:13.650> well<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:14.969> good

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
same for them as well but it was good

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.120 
same for them as well but it was good
yeah<00:00:15.630> you're<00:00:15.839> always<00:00:16.139> doing<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.830> think

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
yeah you're always doing that I think

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.380 
yeah you're always doing that I think
you<00:00:17.250> just<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> make<00:00:17.850> sure<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
you just have to make sure that you

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
you just have to make sure that you
don't<00:00:18.510> keep<00:00:18.750> adding<00:00:19.199> without<00:00:19.470> subtraction

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
don't keep adding without subtraction

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890 
don't keep adding without subtraction
you<00:00:20.250> know<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.789> able<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.060> manage

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
you know you have to be able to manage

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.630 
you know you have to be able to manage
the<00:00:21.990> package<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.529> way<00:00:22.680> every<00:00:23.070> scheme<00:00:23.430> your

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the package that way every scheme your

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.439 
the package that way every scheme your
face<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:24.359> bit<00:00:24.689> different<00:00:25.400> so<00:00:26.449> you're

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
face is a little bit different so you're

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.580 
face is a little bit different so you're
going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.869> adapt<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.470> bit

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
going to have to adapt a little bit

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.040 
going to have to adapt a little bit
accordingly<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:30.240> definitely<00:00:30.449> want<00:00:30.810> guys

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
accordingly but you definitely want guys

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.040 
accordingly but you definitely want guys
to<00:00:31.430> to<00:00:32.430> not<00:00:32.579> be<00:00:32.759> confused<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.960> think

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to to not be confused you know I think

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.720 
to to not be confused you know I think
particularly<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.829> football<00:00:35.219> where<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.460> have

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
particularly in football where you have

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.580 
particularly in football where you have
it's<00:00:36.000> probably<00:00:36.980> one<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> most<00:00:39.590> heavily

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it's probably one of the most heavily

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.799 
it's probably one of the most heavily
coach<00:00:41.129> dominated<00:00:41.850> sports<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.360> because<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
coach dominated sports just because the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.110 
coach dominated sports just because the
schemes<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> you're<00:00:43.530> doing<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.090> think

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
schemes that you're doing so I think

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.750 
schemes that you're doing so I think
there's<00:00:45.390> always<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> tendency<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.500> I

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
there's always a tendency for that I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.830 
there's always a tendency for that I
don't<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.820> they<00:00:48.120> still<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> ton<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
don't know they still have a ton of

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.930 
don't know they still have a ton of
talent<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.559> speed<00:00:49.980> spread<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.670> out<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:52.940> don't

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
talent on a speed spread you out I don't

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.060 
talent on a speed spread you out I don't
know<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> they're<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.379> know<00:00:55.410> hugely

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
know that they're you know hugely

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.459 
know that they're you know hugely
different<00:00:56.370> than<00:00:56.640> they<00:00:56.760> were<00:00:56.789> there<00:00:57.239> still

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
different than they were there still

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.410 
different than they were there still
multi-dimensional<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.120> you<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
multi-dimensional and you know have a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
multi-dimensional and you know have a
quarterback<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.899> can<00:01:01.170> run<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.859> hurt

quarterback that can run and and hurt

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you that way as well so they're pretty

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.399 
you that way as well so they're pretty
talented<00:01:05.580> again<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.210> execution<00:01:06.840> looking<00:01:07.290> at

not<00:01:11.400> mastered<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.060> things<00:01:12.390> we've<00:01:12.570> got<00:01:12.720> too

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
not mastered these things we've got too

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.770 
not mastered these things we've got too
much<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.909> be<00:01:14.909> able<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.119> match<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.659> with

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
much in be able to match that up with

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.490 
much in be able to match that up with
your<00:01:15.900> game<00:01:16.080> plan<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:19.110> know<00:01:19.200> he's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> little

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
your game plan you know he's a little

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.740 
your game plan you know he's a little
bit<00:01:19.770> different<00:01:20.220> than<00:01:20.520> Pat<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.330> mean<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.570> think

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
bit different than Pat I mean I think

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.539 
bit different than Pat I mean I think
they're<00:01:21.869> both<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.470> difficult<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.250> their<00:01:23.400> own

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
they're both very difficult in their own

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.050 
they're both very difficult in their own
their<00:01:24.030> own<00:01:24.060> way<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.900> sure<00:01:25.080> um<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:26.070> think

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
their own way that's for sure um I think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.429 
their own way that's for sure um I think
they<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.390> thrown<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.049> bit<00:01:28.229> more

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
they have thrown it a little bit more

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.840 
they have thrown it a little bit more
with<00:01:28.619> him<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> throwing<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.340> down<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> field

with him and throwing it down the field
a<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.090> bit<00:01:30.240> more<00:01:30.540> but<00:01:30.869> he's<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.509> he<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.720> run

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900

I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.630> again<00:01:52.020> we'll<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.680> how<00:01:52.740> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
I think so again we'll see how that

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.310 
I think so again we'll see how that
bears<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.549> Thursday<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.990> feel<00:01:55.200> like

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
bears out on Thursday but we feel like

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.359 
bears out on Thursday but we feel like
everybody's<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.860> getting<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
everybody's kind of getting back to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.179 
everybody's kind of getting back to
where<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.579> need<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:57.290> I<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:59.130> know

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
where they need to be I don't know

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
where they need to be I don't know
probably<00:01:59.460> old<00:01:59.700> lion<00:01:59.969> quarterback<00:02:00.630> probably<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
probably old lion quarterback probably a

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.600 
probably old lion quarterback probably a
little<00:02:01.200> bit<00:02:01.380> harder<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.549> terms<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.320> but

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
little bit harder in terms of that but

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.160 
little bit harder in terms of that but
there<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.939> lot<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.180> flexibility<00:02:06.930> it's

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
there can be a lot of flexibility it's

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.930 
there can be a lot of flexibility it's
like<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> said<00:02:07.740> it's<00:02:07.890> not<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.280> lining<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:08.879> a

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
like I said it's not just lining up in a

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.330 
like I said it's not just lining up in a
spot<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.330> running<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.690> route<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.379> there

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
spot and running a route because there

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.949 
spot and running a route because there
can<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.550> changes<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.750> then<00:02:12.840> there

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
can be changes to that and then there

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.380 
can be changes to that and then there
can<00:02:13.110> be

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
can be

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.790 
can be
change<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.600> based<00:02:13.840> off<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.110> what<00:02:14.230> kind<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.650> look

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
change is based off of what kind of look

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.520 
change is based off of what kind of look
you're<00:02:14.980> getting<00:02:15.190> from<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.430> defense<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:16.530> when

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
you're getting from the defense and when

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.140 
you're getting from the defense and when
you<00:02:17.709> really<00:02:18.280> start<00:02:18.580> getting<00:02:18.610> into<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
you really start getting into the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.740 
you really start getting into the
details<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.319> route<00:02:21.330> that's<00:02:22.330> what<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.569> comes

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
details of a route that's what it comes

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.449 
details of a route that's what it comes
down<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.350> can<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> quarterback<00:02:24.040> tie<00:02:24.280> his

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
down to is can the quarterback tie his

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.070 
down to is can the quarterback tie his
footwork<00:02:24.910> into<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.300> route<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.510> throw<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:25.990> on

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
footwork into the route and throw it on

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.449 
footwork into the route and throw it on
time<00:02:26.410> knowing<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.950> you're<00:02:27.100> going<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.250> be

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
time knowing that you're going to be

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.660 
time knowing that you're going to be
somewhere<00:02:27.880> based<00:02:28.209> off<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.170> that's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
somewhere based off of that and that's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.410 
somewhere based off of that and that's
that's<00:02:30.670> where<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> ball<00:02:31.300> that's<00:02:31.510> two<00:02:31.750> feet<00:02:32.020> off

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
that's where a ball that's two feet off

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.500 
that's where a ball that's two feet off
comes<00:02:34.420> into<00:02:34.660> play<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:36.430> know<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.790> level<00:02:37.300> of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
comes into play so you know the level of

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.270 
comes into play so you know the level of
specificity<00:02:37.780> can<00:02:38.470> be<00:02:38.590> pretty<00:02:38.770> policy

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
specificity can be pretty policy

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.160 
specificity can be pretty policy
consistency<00:02:40.090> over<00:02:40.120> time<00:02:40.330> will<00:02:40.780> bear<00:02:40.959> that<00:02:41.140> out

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
consistency over time will bear that out

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.430 
consistency over time will bear that out
you<00:02:41.770> know<00:02:42.330> hopefully<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.600> continues<00:02:43.750> but

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
you know hopefully that continues but

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.380 
you know hopefully that continues but
you<00:02:45.160> know<00:02:45.250> clearly<00:02:45.520> definitely<00:02:45.970> last<00:02:46.150> week

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
you know clearly definitely last week

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.170 
you know clearly definitely last week
was<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.600> huge<00:02:47.080> step<00:02:47.320> in<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.500> right<00:02:47.560> direction

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
was a huge step in the right direction

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.759 
was a huge step in the right direction
they<00:02:49.180> will<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:49.810> all<00:02:50.080> versions<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.459> all<00:02:51.790> that

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
they will do all versions of of all that

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.680 
they will do all versions of of all that
very<00:02:53.769> seldom<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.400> see<00:02:54.489> teams<00:02:55.060> these<00:02:55.360> days

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
very seldom do you see teams these days

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.259 
very seldom do you see teams these days
that<00:02:56.080> are<00:02:56.280> straight<00:02:57.280> even<00:02:57.459> teams<00:02:57.850> or<00:02:58.060> straight

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
that are straight even teams or straight

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.670 
that are straight even teams or straight
odd<00:02:58.480> teams<00:02:58.780> I<00:02:59.019> mean<00:02:59.050> everybody's<00:02:59.470> playing

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
odd teams I mean everybody's playing

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.840 
odd teams I mean everybody's playing
some<00:02:59.980> version<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.420> out<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.570> that
