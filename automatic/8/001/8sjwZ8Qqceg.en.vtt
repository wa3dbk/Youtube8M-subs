00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.300
 I discovered epidemiology by 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.070
 medical professors interested 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.779
 a lot to medicine based on 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.790
 evidence 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.700
 it inspired me a lot, it gave me the 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.899
 taste of pushing towards epidemiology this 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.820
 which fascinates me the most 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.349
 epidemiology and when it comes to me a 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.180
 research idea then consumed at 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.800
 build a project to verify the 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.090
 hypotheses 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.489
 during my doctorate I'm going to do a 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.530
 randomized clinical trial then 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.149
 reported in clinic that when 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.730
 does some tests in women 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.339
 infertile which involves washing the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.929
 uterine cavity women including +15 in 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:47.179
 the months following this examination 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.219
 so what are we going to do we will go see 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:51.079
 if women who experience this 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.059
 intervention falls older than 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.159
 those who do not receive this 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.559
 intervention the water presently one is 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:01.159
 building the project is very 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.379
 stimulating for me the epidemiologist and 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.120
 to research is to learn how to use 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.520
 methods do projects of 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.070
 search for quality and then power 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.869
 to advance science 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.570
 the epidemiology dr what it got me 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.750
 allowed more than the mastery it's from 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.280
 push my knowledge further 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.600
 it also allowed me to meet 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.149
 people I can work with 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.130
 later on and then acquire the tools that 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.079
 will allow to stay up to date then 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.990
 continue to progress in this area - 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.490
 took me my doctorate that allows me to 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.439
 to keep a balance is sport 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.329
 I really like mountain biking 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.450
 I think friends have us a lot 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.880
 as well 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 to have a balanced life I love our 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.119
 also after a good job what I will say to 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 someone who wants to register in 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.270
 epidemiology is that it is a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.909
 program that is made for people 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.429
 curious who wish to have a career 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.950
 stimulating fact that they are interested in 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.759
 find interventions to improve 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.759
 people's health 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.140
