00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
course in EVGA fashion this is probably

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.990 
course in EVGA fashion this is probably
the<00:01:59.500> game<00:01:59.680> yep<00:02:00.330> game<00:02:01.330> poems<00:02:02.550> poster<00:02:03.550> that<00:02:03.940> you

a<00:02:32.040> look<00:02:32.310> at<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:32.940> car<00:02:33.239> let's<00:02:34.019> see

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
a look at this car let's see

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520 
a look at this car let's see
it's<00:02:34.709> wow<00:02:35.129> it's<00:02:35.430> heavy<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.239> is<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.659> steel<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.500> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
it's wow it's heavy this is a steel so a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.610 
it's wow it's heavy this is a steel so a
lot<00:02:37.650> heavier<00:02:38.040> than<00:02:38.220> my<00:02:38.340> EVGA<00:02:38.849> GTX<00:02:39.299> 780<00:02:39.989> Super

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
lot heavier than my EVGA GTX 780 Super

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.589 
lot heavier than my EVGA GTX 780 Super
clock<00:02:40.799> with<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> CX<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.700> feels<00:02:41.909> a<00:02:42.030> lot<00:02:42.180> meteor

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
clock with a CX this feels a lot meteor

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.599 
clock with a CX this feels a lot meteor
now<00:02:43.109> there's<00:02:43.319> probably<00:02:43.560> a<00:02:43.799> reason<00:02:43.829> for<00:02:44.400> that

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
now there's probably a reason for that

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.270 
now there's probably a reason for that
there<00:02:45.569> is<00:02:45.599> more<00:02:46.079> to<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.470> card<00:02:46.739> it's<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.069> just

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
there is more to this card it's not just

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.599 
there is more to this card it's not just
a<00:02:47.370> rebadged<00:02:48.079> 780<00:02:49.079> it's<00:02:49.739> actually<00:02:50.129> been<00:02:50.310> beefed

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
a rebadged 780 it's actually been beefed

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.839 
a rebadged 780 it's actually been beefed
up<00:02:50.849> quite<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.569> bit<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.849> completely

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
up quite a bit and this is completely

up quite a bit and this is completely
sealed<00:02:54.569> on<00:02:54.750> this<00:02:54.900> side<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:56.099> this<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.700> side

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
sealed on this side so this is the side

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.490 
sealed on this side so this is the side
that<00:02:57.000> we<00:02:57.180> want<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.599> enter<00:03:00.139> take<00:03:01.139> a<00:03:01.170> look<00:03:01.379> at

imagination says this card is heavier it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.539 
imagination says this card is heavier it
needed<00:03:42.780> more<00:03:42.900> support<00:03:43.109> because<00:03:43.560> how's<00:03:44.370> your

needed more support because how's your

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.430 
needed more support because how's your
computer<00:03:44.910> usually<00:03:45.269> sit<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.989> card<00:03:46.230> usually

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
computer usually sit the card usually

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.500 
computer usually sit the card usually
sits<00:03:46.859> sideways<00:03:47.310> just<00:03:47.579> like<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.150> all<00:03:48.180> that

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
sits sideways just like this so all that

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.960 
sits sideways just like this so all that
weight<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.019> pulling<00:03:49.620> down<00:03:49.799> that's<00:03:50.639> a<00:03:50.730> pretty

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
weight is pulling down that's a pretty

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.900 
weight is pulling down that's a pretty
smart<00:03:51.239> move<00:03:51.359> not<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.769> mention<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.609> this

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
smart move not to mention that this

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.559 
smart move not to mention that this
thing<00:03:54.180> looks<00:03:54.419> like<00:03:54.599> it's<00:03:54.840> ready<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.620> go<00:03:55.879> on<00:03:56.879> a

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
thing looks like it's ready to go on a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.309 
thing looks like it's ready to go on a
multitude<00:03:58.079> of<00:03:58.319> layers<00:03:59.099> so<00:03:59.489> the<00:04:00.209> ACS<00:04:00.870> cooling

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
multitude of layers so the ACS cooling

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.000 
multitude of layers so the ACS cooling
these<00:04:01.859> things<00:04:02.129> are<00:04:02.280> supposedly<00:04:02.730> 70<00:04:03.419> times

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
these things are supposedly 70 times

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.189 
these things are supposedly 70 times
stronger<00:04:05.299> 25%<00:04:06.299> lighter<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.690> mean<00:04:07.049> they've

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
stronger 25% lighter I mean they've

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.629 
stronger 25% lighter I mean they've
dumped<00:04:07.590> off<00:04:07.709> a<00:04:07.739> lot<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.220> weight<00:04:08.340> from<00:04:08.430> these

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
dumped off a lot of weight from these

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.800 
dumped off a lot of weight from these
things<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.120> ball<00:04:09.329> bearings<00:04:09.690> are

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
things and the ball bearings are

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.619 
things and the ball bearings are
scheduled<00:04:10.319> or<00:04:10.739> set<00:04:10.949> to<00:04:11.069> last<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.609> to<00:04:11.669> 12<00:04:12.209> years

so<00:04:13.530> I've<00:04:13.680> run<00:04:13.889> the<00:04:14.250> GTX<00:04:14.879> 770<00:04:15.239> and<00:04:15.479> the<00:04:15.750> 780

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
so I've run the GTX 770 and the 780

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.189 
so I've run the GTX 770 and the 780
previous<00:04:16.620> these<00:04:16.949> things<00:04:17.280> run<00:04:17.659> extremely<00:04:18.659> cool

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:19.199 
previous these things run extremely cool

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.409 
previous these things run extremely cool
and<00:04:19.560> almost<00:04:20.459> dead<00:04:20.699> silent

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419

cooling<00:04:56.719> but<00:04:57.259> now<00:04:57.409> we're<00:04:57.560> gonna<00:04:57.650> go<00:04:57.800> down<00:04:57.949> to<00:04:58.129> a

cooling but now we're gonna go down to a
single<00:04:59.650> 780ti<00:05:00.759> I'm<00:05:01.759> really<00:05:02.060> impressed<00:05:02.509> with

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
single 780ti I'm really impressed with

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.149 
single 780ti I'm really impressed with
the<00:05:02.870> weight<00:05:03.050> of<00:05:03.080> this<00:05:03.319> card<00:05:03.560> actually<00:05:03.919> that's

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 
the weight of this card actually that's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.679 
the weight of this card actually that's
always<00:05:04.370> a<00:05:04.520> good<00:05:04.759> sign<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.270> last<00:05:05.419> thing<00:05:05.599> you

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:05.689 
always a good sign the last thing you

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.149 
always a good sign the last thing you
want<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.900> get<00:05:06.050> is<00:05:06.229> something<00:05:06.469> high<00:05:06.740> in<00:05:06.949> and

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
want to get is something high in and

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.540 
want to get is something high in and
it'd<00:05:07.250> be<00:05:07.279> super<00:05:08.000> flimsy<00:05:08.599> and<00:05:08.750> fragile

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
it'd be super flimsy and fragile

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.439 
it'd be super flimsy and fragile
