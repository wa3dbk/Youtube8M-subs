00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:07.939 
new features in it very simple interface

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:09.820 
new features in it very simple interface
up<00:00:08.599> front<00:00:08.870> but<00:00:09.139> when<00:00:09.230> it<00:00:09.380> starts<00:00:09.710> you're

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
up front but when it starts you're

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.850 
up front but when it starts you're
eating<00:00:10.070> image<00:00:10.280> 1<00:00:10.510> which<00:00:11.510> is<00:00:11.629> a<00:00:11.660> blend<00:00:12.019> of<00:00:12.290> some

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
eating image 1 which is a blend of some

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.180 
eating image 1 which is a blend of some
aura<00:00:13.070> imaging<00:00:13.549> and<00:00:13.879> they<00:00:13.999> hit<00:00:14.150> the<00:00:14.299> pickup

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
aura imaging and they hit the pickup

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.210 
aura imaging and they hit the pickup
quickly<00:00:16.190> move<00:00:16.370> 2<00:00:16.520> to<00:00:16.550> 3<00:00:17.539> so<00:00:18.350> you<00:00:18.380> have<00:00:18.590> three

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
quickly move 2 to 3 so you have three

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.820 
quickly move 2 to 3 so you have three
presets<00:00:19.730> built<00:00:20.210> in<00:00:20.420> and<00:00:20.660> then<00:00:21.260> you<00:00:21.500> can<00:00:21.680> go

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
presets built in and then you can go

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.800 
presets built in and then you can go
back<00:00:21.860> to<00:00:22.100> pick<00:00:22.640> up<00:00:22.790> and<00:00:23.000> use<00:00:23.120> just<00:00:23.540> straight

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
back to pick up and use just straight

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.390 
back to pick up and use just straight
pick<00:00:24.050> up<00:00:24.370> the<00:00:25.370> other<00:00:25.570> surface<00:00:26.570> features<00:00:26.990> are

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
pick up the other surface features are

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.100 
pick up the other surface features are
here<00:00:28.930> once<00:00:29.930> we<00:00:30.110> get<00:00:30.230> out<00:00:30.410> of<00:00:31.480> ok<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:32.540> we<00:00:32.719> do<00:00:32.899> have

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
here once we get out of ok so we do have

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.930 
here once we get out of ok so we do have
a<00:00:33.170> mid<00:00:34.160> contour<00:00:34.910> ok<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:35.629> it<00:00:36.320> is<00:00:36.609> we<00:00:37.609> don't<00:00:37.699> see

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
a mid contour ok and it is we don't see

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.369 
a mid contour ok and it is we don't see
that<00:00:38.089> on<00:00:38.269> the<00:00:38.359> face<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:38.870> you'll<00:00:38.989> hear<00:00:39.199> that

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
that on the face but you'll hear that

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.439 
that on the face but you'll hear that
very<00:00:39.530> quickly<00:00:39.859> so<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.820> function<00:00:41.239> of<00:00:41.329> this

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
very quickly so the function of this

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.459 
very quickly so the function of this
knob<00:00:41.659> very<00:00:41.960> similar<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.670> f1<00:00:43.670> analog<00:00:44.329> so<00:00:45.260> we<00:00:45.350> are

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
knob very similar to f1 analog so we are

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.309 
knob very similar to f1 analog so we are
moving<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.550> mid<00:00:46.789> sweep<00:00:47.059> there<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.659> then<00:00:48.109> over

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
moving the mid sweep there and then over

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:49.720 
moving the mid sweep there and then over
on<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.499> other<00:00:48.530> side<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:49.129> have<00:00:49.280> your<00:00:49.309> face

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
on the other side you have your face

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.989 
on the other side you have your face
control<00:00:50.179> volume<00:00:50.899> control<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:51.469> tuner<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.609> that

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:52.999 
control volume control and tuner so that

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:56.469 
control volume control and tuner so that
is<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.690> nuts<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.019> bolts<00:00:54.409> of<00:00:54.559> f1<00:00:55.550> or<00:00:55.969> A+

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
is the the nuts and bolts of f1 or A+

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.840 
is the the nuts and bolts of f1 or A+
you<00:00:57.050> have<00:00:57.199> some<00:00:57.379> tone<00:00:57.559> control<00:00:58.010> we've

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
you have some tone control we've

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.450 
you have some tone control we've
pre-selected<00:00:59.659> three<00:00:59.929> images<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.620> sound

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
pre-selected three images that sound

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.910 
pre-selected three images that sound
fantastic<00:01:02.179> again<00:01:02.899> a<00:01:02.929> little<00:01:03.199> bit<00:01:03.319> of<00:01:03.409> imaging

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
fantastic again a little bit of imaging

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.210 
fantastic again a little bit of imaging
and<00:01:04.220> some<00:01:04.460> pickup<00:01:04.760> in<00:01:04.909> there<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.950> quick<00:01:06.950> press

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
and some pickup in there a quick press

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.399 
and some pickup in there a quick press
just<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.180> quick<00:01:08.360> depression<00:01:08.810> and<00:01:08.960> release<00:01:09.200> will

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
just a quick depression and release will

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.060 
just a quick depression and release will
get<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:10.299> into<00:01:11.299> your<00:01:11.540> face<00:01:11.719> so<00:01:12.020> plus<00:01:12.590> or<00:01:12.710> minus

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
get you into your face so plus or minus

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.679 
get you into your face so plus or minus
and<00:01:13.430> then<00:01:13.939> if<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.390> hold<00:01:16.090> then<00:01:17.090> you'll<00:01:17.240> be<00:01:17.390> into

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
and then if you hold then you'll be into

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.139 
and then if you hold then you'll be into
your<00:01:17.750> mode<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:19.340> that'll<00:01:19.640> shut<00:01:19.820> off<00:01:19.969> your

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
your mode so that'll shut off your

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:27.490 
your mode so that'll shut off your
output<00:01:20.539> and<00:01:20.570> you'll<00:01:20.780> be<00:01:26.020> back<00:01:27.020> right<00:01:27.259> out<00:01:27.469> of

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
output and you'll be back right out of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.300 
output and you'll be back right out of
that<00:01:27.710> now<00:01:27.950> I'm<00:01:28.100> back<00:01:28.250> into<00:01:28.549> my<00:01:29.329> regular<00:01:29.479> mode<00:01:30.310> I

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
that now I'm back into my regular mode I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.429 
that now I'm back into my regular mode I
think<00:01:31.759> it<00:01:31.850> makes<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.210> easier<00:01:32.869> for<00:01:32.899> people<00:01:33.170> to

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
think it makes it easier for people to

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.249 
think it makes it easier for people to
accept<00:01:34.310> initially<00:01:34.880> have<00:01:35.420> fun<00:01:35.630> with<00:01:35.840> right<00:01:36.109> off

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
accept initially have fun with right off

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.209 
accept initially have fun with right off
the<00:01:36.409> bat<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.100> now<00:01:37.399> as<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.180> guys<00:01:38.450> know<00:01:39.219> with

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
the bat and now as you guys know with

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.330 
the bat and now as you guys know with
aura<00:01:40.490> the<00:01:41.210> f1<00:01:41.570> or<00:01:41.689> all<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.530> system<00:01:43.070> all<00:01:43.219> of

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
aura the f1 or all of that system all of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.359 
aura the f1 or all of that system all of
that<00:01:43.520> software<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.750> still<00:01:44.869> behind<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.859> system

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
that software is still behind the system

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.010 
that software is still behind the system
so<00:01:46.939> we<00:01:47.060> go<00:01:47.179> in<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.539> we<00:01:47.600> do<00:01:47.780> a<00:01:47.810> little

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
so we go in and we do a little

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.260 
so we go in and we do a little
conversion<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:49.429> we<00:01:49.460> can<00:01:49.789> get<00:01:49.909> right<00:01:50.090> into

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
conversion and we can get right into

00:01:50.270 --> 00:02:01.530 
conversion and we can get right into
regular<00:01:50.869> aura

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.600
