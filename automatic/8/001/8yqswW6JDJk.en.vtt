00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
a bunch of stuff to it let's start with

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.790 
a bunch of stuff to it let's start with
under<00:00:38.490> the<00:00:38.610> hood<00:00:38.820> we<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:39.810> a<00:00:39.840> TRD<00:00:40.230> Toyota

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
under the hood we put a TRD Toyota

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
under the hood we put a TRD Toyota
supercharger<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.900> what<00:00:42.900> was<00:00:43.020> really

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
supercharger on it what was really

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.780 
supercharger on it what was really
tricky<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.890> install<00:00:44.310> is<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
tricky with this install is this is a

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.880 
tricky with this install is this is a
flexible<00:00:45.300> vehicle<00:00:45.810> you<00:00:46.440> can't<00:00:46.680> put
