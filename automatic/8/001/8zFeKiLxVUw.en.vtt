00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 fashion for the construction of country houses and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.560
 cottages do not pass make them usually 2 or 3 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.219
 storey 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.290
 to climb up you need a ladder but 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.190
 it takes up a lot of internal volume 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.560
 which itan is in short supply to save 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 space will help such here 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.789
 design 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.380
 spiral staircase compared to normal 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.060
 it takes 4 times less space 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.679
 creating a spiral staircase begins with 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.649
 drawing 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.680
 it performs in the design office at 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.579
 this takes into account the interior features 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.050
 the customerâ€™s wishes and room dimensions 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.200
 drawing hangs on a special stand 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.329
 metal products shop for workers 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.149
 forgot nothing and didn't confuse 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.550
 spiral staircase design consists of 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.870
 central rack metal pipe 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.989
 specific diameter 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 as well as the steps of the auxiliary racks and 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.739
 railing 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.140
 they are made of metal 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.930
 bending it on a roll you machine 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.100
 right arc 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.610
 metal cladding steps 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.520
 first of all 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.649
 he is sent to the guillotine so local 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.399
 wit called machine 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.710
 cuts metal to size 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:26.470
 edges of the resulting triangle bend 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.990
 on a special machine it is necessary so that 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.390
 blanks appeared so-called ribs 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.909
 stiffness and it could be put on 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.110
 the frame of the stair is like a cover the frame itself 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.170
 makes of pipe with rectangular 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.119
 cross section for this from metal 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.220
 profile on a special band saw 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.179
 machine tools cuts the right amount 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.360
 blanks 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.429
 a certain size then they are welded 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.209
 among themselves getting just such 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.959
 triangular design 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:58.599
 according to the previously developed 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.700
 design the central part of our stage 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.069
 will be glass 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.379
 so you and the frame are welded in advance 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:08.530
 special plaques which will be 

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:10.450
 do not install glass securely 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.239
 afraid that she will crack under the household 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.519
 it is a special high strength glass 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.750
 who are able to withstand half a ton 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.060
 yves secret of triplex reliability 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.940
 called material technology it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.940
 manufacturing 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.320
 super glass consists of several 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.730
 taped between each other then with 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.920
 using electric welding 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.080
 frame so-called attachment 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.270
 galvanized steel glasses 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.610
 they will be needed when mounting the ladder 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.830
 glasses make in advance for a very simple 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.540
 principle cut into a lathe 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.090
 metal pipe like sausage 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.720
 when blanks of all 26 components 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.140
 ready them collects a whole screw 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.350
 the ladder first thing on the metal 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.110
 frame put on the workpiece steps 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.230
 galvanized and bend the triangle and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.240
 screw it with screws then inward 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.430
 steps are inserted in advance cut by 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.130
 sizing triangle of extra strong 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.130
 glass and firmly fixes it with screws 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.410
 can now be removed from the protective steps 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.750
 film which during assembly 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.870
 protected from scratches polished 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.870
 surface 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.300
 theoretical ladder ready her can 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.640
 deliver to customer and assemble on site 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:39.720
 but practically you must first hold 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.150
 control assembly at the enterprise in the floor 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.050
 drill three holes in which 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.489
 secures the so-called anchor bolts 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.700
 comparing with other assembly bolts 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.120
 they are much larger and it is not 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.700
 surprisingly because anchor is very important 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.130
 function they have to endure very 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.959
 heavy loads to these bolts firmly 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.830
 screw the central rack 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.900
 she is the main pillar of the stairs to 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.959
 rack string all the steps and 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.420
 holds them together passing the pipe 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.700
 through glasses welded to them 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.000
 further on the outside of the stairs 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.790
 secure the auxiliary racks and 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.130
 pull them along the top of the railing, they are not 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.610
 only serve as a fencing but also attach 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.190
 stiffness designs at the final 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.040
 stage the ladder is checked for strength 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.590
 no do not jump on it and do not reset 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.420
 half a ton and givi and just makes sure 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.620
 the fact that all the details clearly stood on their 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.490
 places and fasteners durable and reliable here 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.640
 perhaps all 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.640
 Now a spiral staircase it may be ready 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.020
 disassemble and lead the customer he can 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.840
 be sure that the stairs 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.840
 made not only beautiful but also durable
