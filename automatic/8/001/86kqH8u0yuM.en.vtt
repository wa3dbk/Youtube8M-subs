00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.837
 Does anyone even know who he is, where he is 

00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:36.097
 and what was that before? 

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:40.565
 Big pok, god, girl, egg? 

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:43.787
 It does not matter - it is what it is. 

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:47.379
 Anyone who knows flight, though without wings, 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.069
 it has a cloud and a city, 

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:55.377
 old, young, bird, mouse, no matter what, 

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:57.952
 if you are your own king. 

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:02.080
 Whoever knows, knows, 

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.053
 and we know, 

00:01:06.553 --> 00:01:10.099
 without wings, in the castle, 

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:21.926
 We're sleeping, we're flying. 

00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:27.710
 Everything is what it is, where it goes, it does not know, 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.152
 but each one goes his own way, 

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:35.493
 one on foot, the other lies, 

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:38.388
 and the third in three. 

00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:41.916
 I am, you are, he is, she is, 

00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:45.168
 in singular and plural, 

00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:49.013
 if we are two, we are without words, 

00:01:49.013 --> 00:01:52.023
 let's dive. 

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:56.360
 Whoever knows, knows, 

00:01:56.422 --> 00:01:59.492
 and we know, 

00:01:59.492 --> 00:02:03.280
 without wings, in the castle, 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.050
 sleeping, lonely. 

00:02:31.468 --> 00:02:35.276
 Everything is what it is, where it goes, it does not know, 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.120
 but each one goes his own way, 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.820
 one on foot, the other lies, 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.952
 and the third for two.
