00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
playing some 66 standoff hard point is

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.250 
playing some 66 standoff hard point is
you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.080> already<00:00:19.260> see<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.900> yeah<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.080> end<00:00:22.199> up

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
you can already see and yeah we end up

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
you can already see and yeah we end up
coming<00:00:22.470> back<00:00:22.619> from<00:00:22.859> about<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.279> 200<00:00:23.970> point

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
coming back from about a 200 point

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.730 
coming back from about a 200 point
deficit<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.810> think<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> score<00:00:25.350> was<00:00:25.439> actually

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
deficit I think the score was actually

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.419 
deficit I think the score was actually
201<00:00:26.609> 21<00:00:27.320> when<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.470> started<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> come<00:00:29.099> back<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
201 21 when we started to come back and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.620 
201 21 when we started to come back and
actually<00:00:29.580> start<00:00:29.789> sitting<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> hill<00:00:30.420> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
actually start sitting on the hill I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450 
actually start sitting on the hill I
believe<00:00:31.349> there<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.619> those<00:00:31.920> probably<00:00:32.369> was

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
believe there was those probably was

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.680 
believe there was those probably was
about<00:00:32.610> halfway<00:00:32.850> through<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.270> game<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.480> would

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
about halfway through the game I would

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.720 
about halfway through the game I would
say<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:34.980> end<00:00:35.219> up<00:00:35.280> taking<00:00:35.640> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
say and we actually end up taking the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.150 
say and we actually end up taking the
lead<00:00:35.940> i<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.719> say<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:36.989> about<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.350> little

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
lead i would say what about a little

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.619 
lead i would say what about a little
over<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.550> minute<00:00:38.760> left<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.510> pretty

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
over a minute left so it's pretty

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.150 
over a minute left so it's pretty
comfortable<00:00:39.930> there<00:00:40.290> weren't<00:00:40.440> there<00:00:40.860> were<00:00:40.950> any

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
comfortable there weren't there were any

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.290 
comfortable there weren't there were any
like<00:00:41.280> chai<00:00:41.520> ours<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.059> don't<00:00:42.270> think

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
like chai ours in here I don't think

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.450 
like chai ours in here I don't think
really<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.960> wasn't<00:00:43.649> really<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> struggle<00:00:44.250> or

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
really I wasn't really a struggle or

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
really I wasn't really a struggle or
anything<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:46.469> far<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.680> like

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
anything like that and as far as like

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
anything like that and as far as like
the<00:00:46.950> gameplay<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.340> concerned<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.360> actually

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the gameplay is concerned I actually

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540 
the gameplay is concerned I actually
start<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.410> Owen<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.460> just

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
start up Owen one because I was just

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.130 
start up Owen one because I was just
like<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.789> FK<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.300> camping<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.719> building

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
like a FK you know camping this building

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.770 
like a FK you know camping this building
trying<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.649> wait<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.250> their<00:00:53.370> points<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> I

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
trying to wait for their points and I

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.049 
trying to wait for their points and I
actually<00:00:54.870> ended<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.170> dying<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.579> end

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
actually ended up dying and then I end

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.000 
actually ended up dying and then I end
up<00:00:57.120> finishing<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> game<00:00:57.750> 34<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.350> one<00:00:58.500> but<00:00:58.980> i

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
up finishing the game 34 and one but i

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.410 
up finishing the game 34 and one but i

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
don't think i got the nuclear because

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.150 
don't think i got the nuclear because
i'm<00:01:00.510> running<00:01:00.719> lightning<00:01:01.109> why<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.829> least<00:01:02.070> i

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
i'm running lightning why at least i

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
i'm running lightning why at least i
didn't<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> nuclear<00:01:02.789> metal<00:01:03.000> pop<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.390> when

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
didn't see the nuclear metal pop up when

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.840 
didn't see the nuclear metal pop up when
i<00:01:04.290> was<00:01:04.470> watching<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.920> back<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.250> bit<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
i was watching it back a little bit so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.580 
i was watching it back a little bit so
i'm<00:01:06.479> pretty<00:01:06.659> sure<00:01:06.840> i<00:01:06.869> didn't<00:01:07.140> get<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> nuclear

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
i'm pretty sure i didn't get the nuclear

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.810 
i'm pretty sure i didn't get the nuclear
but<00:01:07.710> i<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:07.920> die<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> rest<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> game

version cuz i think that's gonna be a
lot<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.689> entertaining<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.560> i<00:02:08.550> guess<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> lot

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
lot more entertaining and i guess a lot

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.420

good but I think it'll be better as
overall<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.920> series<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.720> now<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
i don't know i have to see how it works

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.830 
i don't know i have to see how it works
out<00:02:38.130> i'm<00:02:38.790> assuming<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.480> people<00:02:39.570> will

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
out i'm assuming that people will

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.180 
out i'm assuming that people will
actually<00:02:40.080> sit<00:02:40.410> on<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.590> hardpoint<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.070> league

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
actually sit on the hardpoint in league

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.370 
actually sit on the hardpoint in league
play<00:02:41.450> because<00:02:42.450> that's<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.690> huge<00:02:42.930> problem<00:02:43.080> that

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
play because that's a huge problem that

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.140 
play because that's a huge problem that
we<00:02:43.470> had<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.709> 66<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.550> people<00:02:44.790> wouldn't<00:02:44.940> sit

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
we had in 66 is that people wouldn't sit

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.199 
we had in 66 is that people wouldn't sit
on<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.720> um<00:02:46.170> if<00:02:47.100> people<00:02:47.670> do<00:02:47.820> end<00:02:47.970> up<00:02:48.030> sitting

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
on it so um if people do end up sitting

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.580 
on it so um if people do end up sitting
on<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.450> league<00:02:48.600> play<00:02:48.630> I<00:02:48.810> should<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.350> five

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
on in league play I should have five

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.830 
on in league play I should have five
episodes<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.190> league<00:02:50.370> play<00:02:50.400> maybe<00:02:51.300> even<00:02:51.390> more

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
episodes of league play maybe even more

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
I don't know and then after that is

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.190 
I don't know and then after that is
where<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.580> wasn't<00:02:57.090> really<00:02:57.180> sure<00:02:57.300> what<00:02:57.540> game

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
where I wasn't really sure what game

modes I should do now I could do multi

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.199 
modes I should do now I could do multi
team<00:03:00.120> hardpoint<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.640> problem<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.150> that

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
team hardpoint but the problem with that

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.630 
team hardpoint but the problem with that
is<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:03.510> there's<00:03:03.840> two<00:03:04.050> teams<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.920> they're

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
is that there's two teams so they're

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.100 
is that there's two teams so they're
going<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.970> be<00:03:06.060> fighting<00:03:06.300> over<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.720> hardpoint

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
going to be fighting over the hardpoint

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.050 
going to be fighting over the hardpoint
whether<00:03:07.410> or<00:03:07.650> not<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:07.830> let<00:03:08.220> them<00:03:08.370> get<00:03:08.550> on<00:03:08.610> or<00:03:08.910> not

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
whether or not I let them get on or not

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.370 
whether or not I let them get on or not
so<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.360> don't<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:09.660> think<00:03:09.840> that's<00:03:10.140> going<00:03:10.320> to

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
so I don't really think that's going to

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.410 
so I don't really think that's going to
work<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.830> now<00:03:11.270> what<00:03:12.270> i<00:03:12.300> could<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:13.020> is<00:03:14.420> whenever

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
work out now what i could do is whenever

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.229 
work out now what i could do is whenever
I<00:03:15.630> happen<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.290> get<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.590> late<00:03:16.800> join<00:03:17.100> when<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.030> man

I happen to get a late join when I man

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.610 
I happen to get a late join when I man

a<00:03:28.920> cational<00:03:29.430> episode<00:03:29.850> 4<00:03:30.090> multiplied<00:03:30.390> here<00:03:30.630> and

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
a cational episode 4 multiplied here and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.900 
a cational episode 4 multiplied here and
there<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.500> just<00:03:32.130> hope<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.459> you

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
there like that and just hope that you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.360 
there like that and just hope that you
know<00:03:33.090> they're<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.720> up<00:03:33.900> because<00:03:34.560> other<00:03:35.310> than

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
know they're there up because other than

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.470 
know they're there up because other than
that<00:03:35.549> I<00:03:35.580> don't<00:03:35.670> really<00:03:35.850> know<00:03:35.970> how<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.150> multi

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
that I don't really know how to do multi

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.420 
that I don't really know how to do multi
so<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.410> was<00:03:37.560> thinking<00:03:37.709> about<00:03:37.980> what<00:03:38.160> other<00:03:38.310> games

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
so I was thinking about what other games

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.940 
so I was thinking about what other games
I<00:03:38.700> could<00:03:38.880> do<00:03:39.260> now<00:03:40.260> obviously<00:03:40.440> we<00:03:40.739> could<00:03:40.890> do

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
I could do now obviously we could do

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.250 
I could do now obviously we could do
domination<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:42.060> think<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.600> don't<00:03:43.019> really<00:03:43.110> think

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
domination I think I don't really think

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.630 
domination I think I don't really think
domination<00:03:43.739> would<00:03:43.830> be<00:03:43.890> too<00:03:44.070> difficult<00:03:44.250> it

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
domination would be too difficult it

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.370 
domination would be too difficult it
probably<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.060> same<00:03:45.239> as<00:03:45.269> like<00:03:45.450> 66<00:03:46.019> harpo<00:03:46.320> I

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
probably the same as like 66 harpo I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.820 
probably the same as like 66 harpo I
think<00:03:46.560> we<00:03:46.650> pretty<00:03:46.830> easy<00:03:47.570> now<00:03:48.570> TDM<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.440> was<00:03:49.680> thing

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
think we pretty easy now TDM I was thing

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.289 
think we pretty easy now TDM I was thing
about<00:03:49.950> TDM<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.640> would<00:03:50.790> actually<00:03:50.940> probably

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
about TDM that would actually probably

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.170 
about TDM that would actually probably
be<00:03:51.510> more<00:03:51.630> challenging<00:03:51.920> but<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.220> personally

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
be more challenging but I personally

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.640 
be more challenging but I personally
don't<00:03:54.450> want<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> sit<00:03:54.959> there<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.380> take

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
don't want to sit there and like take

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.920 
don't want to sit there and like take
debts<00:03:55.950> and<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.250> don't<00:03:56.459> know<00:03:56.640> anyone<00:03:57.480> who<00:03:57.750> really

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
debts and I don't know anyone who really

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.020 
debts and I don't know anyone who really
wants<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.320> sit<00:03:58.590> there<00:03:58.769> and<00:03:58.920> fuck<00:03:59.730> up<00:03:59.880> there

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
wants to sit there and fuck up there

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.080 
wants to sit there and fuck up there
Katie<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.480> shin<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.959> go<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.410> oh<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.739> 20<00:04:02.070> so<00:04:02.760> I

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
Katie and shin and go like oh in 20 so I

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.350 
Katie and shin and go like oh in 20 so I
don't<00:04:03.299> know<00:04:03.360> about<00:04:03.480> that<00:04:03.600> one<00:04:04.049> I<00:04:05.269> don't<00:04:06.269> know

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
don't know about that one I don't know

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.699 
don't know about that one I don't know
maybe<00:04:06.630> there's<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.989> different<00:04:07.110> way<00:04:07.350> to<00:04:07.380> do<00:04:07.560> that

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
maybe there's a different way to do that

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.590 
maybe there's a different way to do that
I'll<00:04:07.860> think<00:04:08.040> about<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.850> don't<00:04:09.510> really

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
I'll think about it but I don't really

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.880 
I'll think about it but I don't really
know<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.780> would<00:04:10.019> another<00:04:10.380> way<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> do<00:04:10.739> that

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
know that would another way to do that

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.500 
know that would another way to do that
now<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.700> was<00:04:12.000> thinking<00:04:12.329> about<00:04:12.450> that

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
now the one I was thinking about that

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.120 
now the one I was thinking about that
would<00:04:12.780> be<00:04:12.870> pretty<00:04:13.049> easy<00:04:13.170> for<00:04:13.410> me<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.650> do<00:04:13.890> would

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
would be pretty easy for me to do would

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.729 
would be pretty easy for me to do would
be<00:04:14.160> free<00:04:14.549> for<00:04:14.820> all<00:04:14.989> you<00:04:15.989> know<00:04:16.109> cuz<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.560> can

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.530 
i have to come back from like 25 kills
down<00:04:32.010> i<00:04:32.040> think<00:04:32.370> that<00:04:32.520> would<00:04:32.610> be<00:04:32.730> pretty<00:04:32.910> good<00:04:33.240> I

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
down i think that would be pretty good I

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.510 
down i think that would be pretty good I
could<00:04:34.410> probably<00:04:34.530> maybe<00:04:34.950> I<00:04:35.190> don't<00:04:35.400> think

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
could probably maybe I don't think

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.670 
could probably maybe I don't think
you're<00:04:35.700> 29<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.480> would<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:37.170> don't<00:04:37.410> know<00:04:37.500> that's

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
you're 29 that would I don't know that's

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.830 
you're 29 that would I don't know that's
just<00:04:37.800> me<00:04:38.790> getting<00:04:38.970> dirty<00:04:39.240> kills<00:04:39.480> by<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.690> time

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
just me getting dirty kills by the time

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.090 
just me getting dirty kills by the time
someone<00:04:40.080> gets<00:04:40.170> one<00:04:40.440> kill<00:04:40.650> like<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:40.920> don't<00:04:41.010> know

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
someone gets one kill like I don't know

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.460 
someone gets one kill like I don't know
if<00:04:41.220> that's<00:04:41.340> possible<00:04:41.520> but<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:41.940> think<00:04:42.120> 25<00:04:42.540> would

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
if that's possible but I think 25 would

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.570 
if that's possible but I think 25 would
be<00:04:43.560> a<00:04:43.590> real<00:04:43.800> challenge<00:04:43.830> that<00:04:44.370> could<00:04:44.490> probably

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
be a real challenge that could probably

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.210 
be a real challenge that could probably
be<00:04:44.760> possible<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.420> could<00:04:46.020> probably<00:04:46.170> do<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.380> so

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
be possible so could probably do that so

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.410 
be possible so could probably do that so
I<00:04:47.280> was<00:04:47.400> thinking<00:04:47.520> probably<00:04:47.700> free-for-all

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
I was thinking probably free-for-all

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.570 
I was thinking probably free-for-all
will<00:04:49.140> be<00:04:49.290> the<00:04:49.410> next<00:04:49.560> one<00:04:49.830> after<00:04:50.010> i<00:04:50.220> do<00:04:50.340> league

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
will be the next one after i do league

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.430 
will be the next one after i do league
play<00:04:50.820> so<00:04:50.880> i'm<00:04:51.000> going<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.180> finish<00:04:51.510> up<00:04:51.750> to<00:04:51.870> 6v<00:04:52.140> six

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
play so i'm going to finish up to 6v six

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.260 
play so i'm going to finish up to 6v six
then<00:04:52.710> i'm<00:04:52.800> gonna<00:04:52.890> do<00:04:53.010> league<00:04:53.190> play<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.760> then

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
then i'm gonna do league play and then

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.370 
then i'm gonna do league play and then
I'm<00:04:54.360> gonna<00:04:54.450> probably<00:04:54.630> do<00:04:54.780> free-for-all<00:04:55.350> and

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
I'm gonna probably do free-for-all and

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.890 
I'm gonna probably do free-for-all and
then<00:04:55.770> after<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.460> don't<00:04:56.850> know<00:04:57.090> but<00:04:57.390> that'll

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
then after that I don't know but that'll

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.080 
then after that I don't know but that'll
be<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> long<00:04:58.290> time<00:04:58.500> down<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.770> road<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.910> know

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
be a long time down the road so you know

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.340 
be a long time down the road so you know
we'll<00:05:00.300> figure<00:05:00.450> it<00:05:00.600> out<00:05:00.690> when<00:05:00.810> we<00:05:00.870> come<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.230> that

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
we'll figure it out when we come to that

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:02.510 
we'll figure it out when we come to that
but<00:05:01.380> though<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.890> was<00:05:01.980> kind<00:05:02.130> of<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.220> idea<00:05:02.280> i

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
but though that was kind of the idea i

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.460 
but though that was kind of the idea i
had<00:05:02.700> for<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.330> then<00:05:03.780> also<00:05:03.960> for<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.290> free

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
had for that and then also for the free

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.230 
had for that and then also for the free
fräulein<00:05:04.950> i'll<00:05:05.430> definitely<00:05:05.640> be<00:05:05.910> able<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.150> do<00:05:06.210> a
