 Yes Saturday, July 26, 2014 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.780
 From now on, in the city of Mitsuke, Niigata 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.780
 I'm going to fireworks display 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.100

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:30.160
 Tere who says 83rd star mine raises 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 Probably people who raise fireworks in the space bar 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:42.090
 I think as long as you know is the kana not the first time in Japan 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:48.330
 Also I have also seen StarMine of Sarasa's one of my friends after 158 number 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.530
 I think that some people have come to look for this fireworks and search for Yu-Tele. 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.070
 Because 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.070
 I would like to introduce some channels 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:04.100
 With children's toys mainly for boys 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.100
 Anpanman's Momo Chaya 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.630

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.520

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.630
 I'm flying upside down 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.130

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.490
 store 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.510
 It is a secret dragon 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.060
 For fireworks display 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:03.340
 I will bring you a real 3ds ds 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:06.939
 It is fun because I think to be able to various people and passing communication 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.300
 Those who have not been registered for Yu- Tele yet 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.750
 If it is good 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.630
