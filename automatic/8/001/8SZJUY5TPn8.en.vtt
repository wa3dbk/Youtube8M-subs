during<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.170> race<00:01:45.320> Caravan<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.640> very

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
during the race Caravan it's very

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.399 
during the race Caravan it's very
important<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.450> really<00:01:47.870> want<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.049> low<00:01:48.200> number

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
important you really want a low number

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.140 
important you really want a low number
so<00:01:48.830> if<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.010> riders<00:01:49.280> get<00:01:49.400> a<00:01:49.430> flatter<00:01:49.729> they<00:01:50.000> need

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
so if the riders get a flatter they need

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.030 
so if the riders get a flatter they need
some<00:01:50.330> food<00:01:50.570> or<00:01:50.780> some<00:01:50.960> water<00:01:51.200> it's<00:01:51.740> really

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
some food or some water it's really

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.020 
some food or some water it's really
important<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.400> be<00:01:52.520> at<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.670> front<00:01:52.850> of<00:01:52.970> that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
important to be at the front of that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.490 
important to be at the front of that
group<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.420> cars<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.049> can<00:01:54.170> see<00:01:54.320> them<00:01:54.470> a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
group of cars so that you can see them a

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.830 
group of cars so that you can see them a
lot<00:01:54.680> quicker<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.220> get<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.030> them<00:01:56.180> a<00:01:56.210> lot<00:01:56.420> faster

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
lot quicker and get to them a lot faster

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.060 
lot quicker and get to them a lot faster
on<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.110> bike<00:01:57.260> rack<00:01:57.440> we've<00:01:57.619> got<00:01:57.740> space<00:01:58.010> for

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
on the bike rack we've got space for

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.649 
on the bike rack we've got space for
four<00:01:58.460> bikes<00:01:58.700> how<00:01:58.940> do<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.119> determine<00:01:59.270> which

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
four bikes how do we determine which

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.480 
four bikes how do we determine which
ones<00:01:59.869> go<00:02:00.080> up<00:02:00.229> there<00:02:00.440> well<00:02:00.619> mechanic<00:02:01.220> since<00:02:01.369> on

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
ones go up there well mechanic since on

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.859 
ones go up there well mechanic since on
them<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.000> rear<00:02:02.180> on<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.450> passenger<00:02:02.840> side

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
them in the rear on the passenger side

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.440 
them in the rear on the passenger side
so<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:04.040> bike<00:02:04.250> that<00:02:04.430> he<00:02:04.610> can<00:02:04.760> get<00:02:04.850> to<00:02:05.030> quickest

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
so the bike that he can get to quickest

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.510 
so the bike that he can get to quickest
is<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.930> passenger<00:02:06.350> side<00:02:06.380> outside<00:02:06.799> today

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
is on the passenger side outside today

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.089 
is on the passenger side outside today
that<00:02:07.909> was<00:02:08.119> Peter<00:02:08.959> Sagan<00:02:09.379> on<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.649> other<00:02:09.830> side

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
that was Peter Sagan on the other side

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.320 
that was Peter Sagan on the other side
the<00:02:10.369> other<00:02:10.399> bike<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:10.879> you<00:02:10.909> can<00:02:11.060> get<00:02:11.180> to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
the other bike that you can get to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.970 
the other bike that you can get to
quickest<00:02:11.659> was<00:02:11.810> Daniel<00:02:12.140> loss<00:02:12.260> how<00:02:12.890> do<00:02:12.950> you

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
quickest was Daniel loss how do you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.380 
quickest was Daniel loss how do you
determine<00:02:13.250> who<00:02:13.519> goes<00:02:13.640> in<00:02:13.819> between<00:02:13.939> on<00:02:14.239> those

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
determine who goes in between on those

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.000 
determine who goes in between on those
other<00:02:14.540> two<00:02:14.720> slots<00:02:15.019> well<00:02:15.230> what<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.620> try<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.830> do

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
other two slots well what you try to do

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.130 
other two slots well what you try to do
is<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.220> try<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.430> cover<00:02:16.640> your<00:02:16.849> sizes<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:17.810> three

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
is you try to cover your sizes if three

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.440 
is you try to cover your sizes if three
riders<00:02:18.319> are<00:02:18.530> size<00:02:18.740> 56<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.790> might<00:02:19.940> put<00:02:20.120> cameron

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
riders are size 56 you might put cameron

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.710 
riders are size 56 you might put cameron
where

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
where

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.150 
where
they're<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.620> cover<00:02:21.980> those

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
they're so that you can cover those

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.500 
they're so that you can cover those
three<00:02:22.460> guys<00:02:22.640> take<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> look<00:02:23.270> at<00:02:23.360> what<00:02:23.450> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
three guys take a look at what the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.650 
three guys take a look at what the
mechanic<00:02:23.870> seized<00:02:24.080> during<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.350> race<00:02:25.660> he's

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
mechanic seized during the race he's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.970 
mechanic seized during the race he's
sitting<00:02:26.900> on<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.050> other<00:02:27.080> side<00:02:27.230> obviously<00:02:27.560> but

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
sitting on the other side obviously but

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.350 
sitting on the other side obviously but
he's<00:02:28.190> got<00:02:28.340> his<00:02:28.430> two<00:02:28.790> sets<00:02:29.090> of<00:02:29.180> wheels

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
he's got his two sets of wheels

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.210 
he's got his two sets of wheels
positions<00:02:29.960> so<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:30.290> don't<00:02:30.470> move<00:02:30.770> about<00:02:31.010> when

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
positions so they don't move about when

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.950 
positions so they don't move about when
the<00:02:31.310> car<00:02:31.760> is<00:02:31.790> taking<00:02:32.120> those<00:02:32.210> really<00:02:32.690> fast

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
the car is taking those really fast

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.720 
the car is taking those really fast
turns<00:02:33.290> which<00:02:33.530> they<00:02:33.680> always<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.310> circuit

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
turns which they always do on a circuit

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.270 
turns which they always do on a circuit
like<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.390> finishing<00:02:35.750> straight<00:02:35.780> today<00:02:36.280> we

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
like the finishing straight today we

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.280 
like the finishing straight today we
also<00:02:37.430> have<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> mechanics<00:02:38.180> reduced<00:02:38.840> tool<00:02:39.050> bag

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
also have the mechanics reduced tool bag

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.940 
also have the mechanics reduced tool bag
