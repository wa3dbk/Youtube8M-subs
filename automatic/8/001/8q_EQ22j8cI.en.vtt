millimeters left on each wick now
something<00:00:09.840> round<00:00:10.200> about<00:00:10.410> there<00:00:11.630> sort<00:00:12.630> of

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
something round about there sort of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.480 
something round about there sort of
better<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.170> little<00:00:13.440> bit<00:00:13.530> longer<00:00:13.769> I've

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
better to have a little bit longer I've

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.359 
better to have a little bit longer I've
made<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.120> 12<00:00:17.000> weaves<00:00:18.170> here<00:00:19.170> up<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.770> count<00:00:20.220> them

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
made it 12 weaves here up in count them

you<00:00:22.710> get<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> spiral<00:00:23.960> now<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.260> decided<00:00:25.920> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
you get you a spiral now I decided to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.849 
you get you a spiral now I decided to
join<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:27.119> use<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.539> loop<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.050> fixing<00:00:28.410> loop<00:00:28.619> I

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
join to use the loop the fixing loop I

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.550 
join to use the loop the fixing loop I
bought<00:00:29.580> some<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.939> these<00:00:30.119> from<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.810> marine<00:00:31.260> shop

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
bought some of these from a marine shop

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.200 
bought some of these from a marine shop
just<00:00:32.309> triangles<00:00:33.000> made<00:00:33.660> out<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.969> think<00:00:35.969> it's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
just triangles made out of I think it's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.150 
just triangles made out of I think it's
about<00:00:36.480> three<00:00:37.020> possibly<00:00:37.649> even<00:00:37.770> four

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
about three possibly even four

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.330 
about three possibly even four
millimeters<00:00:39.200> 316<00:00:40.200> stainless<00:00:40.649> steel<00:00:43.100> now<00:00:44.100> I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
millimeters 316 stainless steel now I

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.979 
millimeters 316 stainless steel now I
did<00:00:44.610> make<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> bit<00:00:45.120> hard<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.390> myself<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
did make it a bit hard for myself on the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.990 
did make it a bit hard for myself on the
first<00:00:46.200> one<00:00:46.440> rather<00:00:47.250> than<00:00:47.370> attaching<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
first one rather than attaching it

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.880 
first one rather than attaching it
straight<00:00:48.300> across<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:48.960> weaving<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.680> I

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
straight across here and weaving it in I

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
straight across here and weaving it in I
decided<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.820> try<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.149> clever<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.510> do<00:00:51.719> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
decided to try and be clever and do it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.810 
decided to try and be clever and do it
diagonally<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.160> caused<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.640> some

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
diagonally which has caused me some

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
diagonally which has caused me some
problems<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.590> how<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.100> this

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
problems it's up to you how you do this

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.060 
problems it's up to you how you do this
but<00:00:56.789> basically<00:00:57.559> because<00:00:58.559> i<00:00:58.680> was<00:00:58.800> going

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
but basically because i was going

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.070 
but basically because i was going
diagonally<00:01:00.109> decided<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> take<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.870> on

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
diagonally decided to take the one on

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.539 
diagonally decided to take the one on
this<00:01:04.559> side<00:01:05.930> underneath<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:10.280> over<00:01:11.280> into

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
this side underneath here and over into

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
this side underneath here and over into
its<00:01:12.380> second<00:01:13.380> position<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.299> then<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.570> i

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
its second position and then this one i

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
its second position and then this one i
decided<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.299> just<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.720> outside<00:01:19.970> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
decided to go just to the outside and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
decided to go just to the outside and
then<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.750> same<00:01:21.990> with<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.159> from

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
then the same with this this one from

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.109 
then the same with this this one from
this<00:01:23.520> bottom<00:01:23.939> corner<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:25.500> through<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
this bottom corner go through the

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.490 
this bottom corner go through the
triangle<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.770> then<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.950> its<00:01:29.100> second<00:01:29.549> position

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
triangle and then to its second position

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.190 
triangle and then to its second position
and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> bottom<00:01:32.900> just<00:01:33.900> over

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
and then the one on the bottom just over

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.490 
and then the one on the bottom just over
to<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> outside<00:01:36.170> then<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.850> tricky<00:01:39.240> bit

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
to the outside then the tricky bit

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
to the outside then the tricky bit
starts<00:01:40.500> again<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.090> goes<00:01:42.899> over<00:01:44.750> now

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
starts again this one goes over now

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.319 
starts again this one goes over now
we've<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.200> go<00:01:46.490> inside<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.549> triangle<00:01:48.000> as

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
we've got to go inside the triangle as

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:56.270 
we've got to go inside the triangle as
well<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:50.270> over<00:01:51.860> under<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.960> down<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> far

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
well and over under and down to the far

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.680 
well and over under and down to the far
corner<00:01:58.009> here

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
corner here

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.280 
corner here
it's<00:02:01.470> looking<00:02:01.680> complicated<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.580> it<00:02:03.290> anyway

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it's looking complicated in it anyway

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:14.470 
it's looking complicated in it anyway
this<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.310> goes<00:02:05.550> over<00:02:07.280> under<00:02:08.280> over<00:02:11.870> and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
this one then goes over under over and

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.060 
this one then goes over under over and
somehow<00:02:15.650> fumble<00:02:16.650> fumble<00:02:18.620> again<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
somehow fumble fumble again on the

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.490 
somehow fumble fumble again on the
inside<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.610> triangle<00:02:21.180> once<00:02:22.140> you've<00:02:22.350> got

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
inside of the triangle once you've got

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.290 
inside of the triangle once you've got
it<00:02:22.530> tied<00:02:22.830> off<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.310> won't<00:02:23.400> look<00:02:23.640> so<00:02:23.850> bad<00:02:24.090> it'll

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
it tied off it won't look so bad it'll

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.720 
it tied off it won't look so bad it'll
be<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.660> better<00:02:25.040> right<00:02:26.040> over<00:02:27.800> under<00:02:31.730> under

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
be a bit better right over under under

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:47.650 
be a bit better right over under under

right<00:03:21.380> there's<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> bit<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.590> luck<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:23.160> should<00:03:23.790> all

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
right there's a bit of luck I should all

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.830 
right there's a bit of luck I should all
start<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:27.440> decide<00:03:28.440> which<00:03:28.620> ones<00:03:28.920> are<00:03:29.040> which<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
start to decide which ones are which and

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.550 
start to decide which ones are which and
on<00:03:31.140> that<00:03:31.290> side<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.590> one's<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.250> side

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:05.140 

you

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.110 

and<00:04:08.420> pull<00:04:09.420> those<00:04:09.599> all<00:04:09.810> tight<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.549> then<00:04:11.549> repeat

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
and pull those all tight and then repeat

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.789 
and pull those all tight and then repeat
the<00:04:12.239> pattern<00:04:12.420> again<00:04:12.749> only<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.200> time<00:04:13.260> because

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
the pattern again only this time because

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.050 
the pattern again only this time because
we<00:04:13.950> think<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.189> little<00:04:14.280> bit<00:04:14.430> further<00:04:14.670> on<00:04:14.849> the

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
we think a little bit further on the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.800 
we think a little bit further on the
inside<00:04:15.510> we<00:04:16.259> go<00:04:16.440> around<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.709> outside<00:04:17.220> edge

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
inside we go around the outside edge

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.810 
inside we go around the outside edge
okay
