like last year I think that one of my
biggest<00:02:57.190> focuses<00:02:57.700> is<00:02:57.819> attacked<00:02:58.180> early<00:02:58.540> and

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
biggest focuses is attacked early and

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.120 
biggest focuses is attacked early and
attack<00:02:58.930> often<00:02:59.319> because<00:02:59.620> i<00:02:59.680> went<00:02:59.829> to<00:02:59.920> too<00:03:00.040> many

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.830 
attack often because i went to too many
ball<00:03:00.370> pools<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.150> unfortunately<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.780> lost

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
ball pools and unfortunately I lost
