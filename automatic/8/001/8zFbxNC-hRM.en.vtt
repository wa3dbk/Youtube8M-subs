00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
changed when I say dramatically like I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.000 
changed when I say dramatically like I
take<00:00:35.820> less<00:00:36.480> than<00:00:36.750> half<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.500> was<00:00:37.590> taking

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
take less than half of what I was taking

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.080 
take less than half of what I was taking
at<00:00:38.730> first<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:39.989> crazy<00:00:40.649> about<00:00:41.399> vitamins

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
at first I was just crazy about vitamins

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.750 
at first I was just crazy about vitamins
and<00:00:42.480> trying<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> make<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.260> hair<00:00:43.559> grow<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.190> now

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and trying to make my hair grow and now

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.360 
and trying to make my hair grow and now
I<00:00:44.789> figured<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.780> less<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.469> more

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
