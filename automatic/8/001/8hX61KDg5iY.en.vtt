00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.860
 hello at the end of August you have to think 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.480
 in the spring and do the work of 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.010
 garden recovery that sure 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.130
 after winter you need a good 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.560
 maintenance one of the most 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.990
 damaged is the grass affected by 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.910
 frost the excess water the fungi the 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.529
 soil compaction that's why we have 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.220
 to do work so that he recovers 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.220
 in September 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.010
 the first thing is to circumvent this means 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.350
 nail a fork but not 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.290
 superficially it has to be with 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.510
 force at least 5 centimeters with 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 this will get oxygen to the roots and 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.800
 decompact we have the ground 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.550
 and course as well as being compacted 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.010
 It has dirt with a texture of chalk 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.410
 like this it is advisable to apply a 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.660
 soil improver that contains lime for 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.370
 counteract the effect of clay and 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.370
 So achieve lighter soil 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.840
 to continue with the recovery of 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.030
 grass you have to fertilize can be one 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.550
 immediate delivery or other delivery 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.610
 controlled this fertilizer will have an action 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.890
 during three months 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.930
 These fertilizers provide high 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.610
 nitrogen content what stimulates 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.610
 the development and vigor of the lawn 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.259
 we also throw a layer of earth of 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.090
 doha to renew organic matter and 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.539
 let's water to incorporate all the 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.539
 products 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.970
 towards the end of winter there are several 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.550
 species that start to bloom as 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.080
 the Danes and the camellias to all these 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.510
 species you have to apply a 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.370
 potassium-rich fertilizer that 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.100
 stimulates flowering and extends 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.470
 until spring 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.080
 potassium what it does is improve the 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.759
 quality and quantity of flowers for the 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.860
 rest of the species that bloom in 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.120
 spring and summer we can expect a 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.400
 little to apply this credit 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.560
 he dafne is a foliage bush 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.540
 persistent that does not grow more than one meter 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.879
 tall and has a very flowering 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.220
 perfumed is very good for gardens 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.470
 small and to keep flowerpots what 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.930
 that is delicate does not tolerate well the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.340
 transplants and grows better sheltered by 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.340
 trees and large bushes 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.459
 there are many plants that can be 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.760
 suffered from frost and symptoms 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.579
 they are foliage loss apex and leaves 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.650
 burned color to decay 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.540
 in general if in the place where you 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.969
 lives have occurred of the frequent 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.030
 You can recover your plants by applying a 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:54.129
 mustache mul before this type of products 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.560
 It provides natural hormones that 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.569
 increase the root volume so 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.900
 that the plant increases the absorption of 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.939
 nutrients and water with this has higher 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.310
 defenses that allows you to recover from 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:09.099
 situations like freezing droughts or 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.260
 Pest attacks after frost 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.480
 and winter you have to cut all the 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.579
 foliage damaged either because it burned 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.760
 with the cold or because it was attacked by a 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.760
 plague 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.909
 we also have to cut the hedges 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.989
 they have grown throughout the year and 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.269
 so that they continue doing 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.280
 correctly during spring and summer 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.819
 we have to cut everything that comes out 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.819
 of its form 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.920
 if we pay the height of the hedge we will be 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.860
 stimulating it to increase its thickness with 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.520
 more dense foliage and if by 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.460
 contrary 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.360
 we reduce the thickness of its foliage 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.360
 we will increase its height 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.459
 in relation to getting more foliage 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.769
 leafy we have the question of 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.840
 constanza de coyhaique who tells us 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.329
 that has a very high camellia but with 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.000
 little body what you have to do is 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.260
 put soil in the planter 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.170
 apply a fertilizer rich in potassium 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.390
 and once it finishes blooming cut 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.579
 all the flowers dry and blunt all 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.819
 the branches in this way his camellia 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.530
 it will take more body we have a question 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.539
 from elizabeth who wants to know how 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.880
 disinfect the soil of their gardens 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.729
 because it has many ants the best is 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.380
 apply a total insecticide now if 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.690
 his problems are only the ants 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.910
 you can apply a specific insecticide 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.440
 looking for the places where they concentrate 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.300
 and following the paths that form 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.669
 around the house 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.710
 let's not miss the last weeks of the 

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.940
 winter because what we do now the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.250
 plants will thank you in the 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.199
 spring where they will be healthier and with 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.060
 more flowers that's all for today we'll see 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.409
 next week in another do it yourself 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.409
 same homecenter dreams
