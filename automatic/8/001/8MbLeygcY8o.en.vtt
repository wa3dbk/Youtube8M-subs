00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
all the stats will run for a few other

all the stats will run for a few other
headline<00:01:50.340> figures<00:01:50.900> it's<00:01:51.900> got<00:01:52.080> a<00:01:52.110> 3.8<00:01:53.070> litre

Carrera S engine and if you come into
this<00:04:44.019> car<00:04:44.349> expecting<00:04:45.389> something

this car expecting something

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:50.279 
extraordinary like the gt3 s motor then

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.459 
extraordinary like the gt3 s motor then
you<00:04:51.279> know<00:04:51.399> it<00:04:51.610> doesn't<00:04:52.089> give<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:52.599> that<00:04:52.629> but

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
you know it doesn't give you that but

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:55.499 
you know it doesn't give you that but
that<00:04:53.709> would<00:04:53.919> require<00:04:54.509> completely

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
that would require completely

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.539 
that would require completely
