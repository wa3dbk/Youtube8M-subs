00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
front of the loss valve you can see the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.620 
front of the loss valve you can see the
trumpet<00:01:56.040> they're<00:01:56.219> very<00:01:56.430> attractive<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.360> where

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
trumpet they're very attractive is where

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
trumpet they're very attractive is where
these<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> made<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.590> maximize<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.399> sound<00:01:59.670> of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
these and made to maximize the sound of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.760 
these and made to maximize the sound of
course<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.750> boost<00:02:00.960> pressure<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.439> released

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
course as the boost pressure is released

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.340 
course as the boost pressure is released
when<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> piston<00:02:02.939> moves<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.840> down<00:02:03.899> here

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
when the piston moves up and down here

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.200 
when the piston moves up and down here
you<00:02:04.380> might<00:02:04.649> almost<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.430> able<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> make<00:02:05.820> out<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
you might almost be able to make out a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.760 
you might almost be able to make out a
little<00:02:06.570> bit<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.930> color<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.469> brass

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
little bit of the color of the brass

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.520 
little bit of the color of the brass
piston<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.870> super<00:02:12.870> sound

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
piston so a super sound

this<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.010> how<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:24.120> valve<00:02:24.330> fits<00:02:24.660> in<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
this is how the the valve fits in the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.280 
this is how the the valve fits in the
red<00:02:25.350> top<00:02:25.590> of<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.250> s13<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> very<00:02:28.050> easy
