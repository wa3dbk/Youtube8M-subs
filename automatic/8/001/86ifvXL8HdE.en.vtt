00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello to underwater hunters and divers in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.019
 In this video review we will perform an autopsy 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.309
 and try to turn on the flashlight fry in 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.340
 163 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.230
 here we are initially looking at 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.810
 specifications on the box 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:27.720
 it means it emits 2960 lumens work 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:35.630
 26 hours on the minimum mode 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.630
 entirely of metal and is of Case 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.370
 two 163 is made entirely of metal 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.750
 we see three LEDs here 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:01:04.729
 see how the mode will change it 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:19.610
 maximum mode is average this 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:34.250
 niche also last name included 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:35.960
 charging cable and car charger in 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.060
 This pocket has special straps 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.460
 so you can wear 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.110
 flashlight on yourself along with the cover 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 lights have small dimensions here is mine 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:52.460
 hand thanks to this he applied 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.789
 underwater at least surf anri free 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.979
 can be understaffed with two 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.890
 light yellow filters or 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:06.170
 scattering which will improve 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.819
 visibility in a muddy river or dissipate 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.459
 light which turn will not 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.580
 scare red 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:15.580
 thanks to this mounting method 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:21.050
 special blend light filter 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.090
 eliminates the possibility of water flowing in 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.950
 lantern you do not need to spin any 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.480
 screwdrivers do not twist anything just 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:33.010
 to the driver and I'll show you everything now 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.010
 This one is a big light filter. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:44.540
 first children and then pull on the lights 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.540
 well so ups 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.580
 but so the substrate is simple 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.640
 so time to hunt they are homemade
