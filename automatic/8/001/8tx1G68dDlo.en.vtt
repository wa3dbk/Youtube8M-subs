00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.660
 I wanted to enjoy summer 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.800
 imagined it had to be a little I like 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.800
 alright here but hear you 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.530
 we call you we are a group that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.070
 comes from cork 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.690
 it existed for ten years and there 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.610
 now we are in a form a little 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.840
 different for two years and we're going out a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.700

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.480
 project me it's jérôme I'm the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.500
 singer me it's jean paul guitarist 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:31.350
 it's mathieu bouké me it's damien 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.340
 violinist and me it's ben drummer and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.370
 so there is still a guitarist who 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.330
 called soft soft and it's not his 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.910
 true name but there you go 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.010
 and what do I forget philippe 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.990
 philippe the bass player the big and beautiful 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.780
 philippe his costs that we come 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.570
 mainly brussels group 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.850
 now exists for a year under his 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.970
 current form 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.229
 and here I am, I am guitarist nicolas 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.670
 guitarist also granted 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.360
 accordionist from time to time 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.049
 yohanan the singer and this madness to 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.050
 the former bassist and drummer 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.979
 concretely it's a bit of a year 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.780
 we're going to say the year we're trying to 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.000
 to put forward a maximum 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.800
 to make a maximum of two stepping stones 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.750
 aisles to take each other the most 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.250
 of experience by the most scenes have 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.500
 met as many people as possible create 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.760
 contacts and make them move the 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.989
 machine what is it really the goal was 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.780
 really to launch to realize a 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.849
 trick to really get to something 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.530
 great result that would put flames 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.000
 what we are not at all is zeco dish 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.670
 we are very happy to be here 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.489
 and that's a chance it's not given to 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.610
 everyone so I encourage you to 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.320
 persevere 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.790
 do is always turns out to be the 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.590
 music is never that we stop 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.410
 not to learn for art to go anymore 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.090
 far and I believe there is no artist 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.620
 who can say to himself now I will do the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.580
 scene that I wanted it's good I take 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.170
 my retirement what festival we all have 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.190
 all made as festivalgoers I 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 think we made it some too 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.890
 especially nico and fred that we do not 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.180
 badly we did not hurt I had come 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.470
 that I came once at the end of 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.180
 once in a while weekends a day 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.250
 but the four days I had not done 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.320
 super often I think nico is a 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.600
 little more experience but I 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.790
 do from 2003 to 2008 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.130
 this is 2003 it was a very good year 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.300
 and it was heat wave is even worse than 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.220
 this year i think besides the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.780
 firefighters I have of course the last arena 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.600
 water public with the spear a meaning all 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.890
 this is a good memory and that makes 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.959
 pleasure to be there because because we 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.319
 look at it and it's a tube I believe 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.079
 still be in the place 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.400
 we would be super obviously it's a 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.290
 organization of sick people 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.310
 count as a festival there is said 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.760
 already that it's still a big 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.379
 machine 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.790
 so when we're behind and we 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:43.769
 is born as an artist we still take 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.719
 since it 's a bazaar that it's all 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.430
 the organization and what put in 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:50.459
 work and it's great what's it at 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.930
 Beyond the atmosphere is it's a 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.750
 quite a pretty incredible experience and 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.370
 unforgettable to live I think here we go 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.290
 also have a small p of five titles 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.019
 which will come out in the fall of the two winters 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.579
 in my opinion and if we still have some 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.010
 small at it was so we will try 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.180
 to advance the schmilblick and see 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.799
 so it'll be nice to have 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.180
 breasts to the east something to 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.040
 show to make listen with 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.680
 owls are recorded we did 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.090
 here in June 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.919
 and that's it yeah I think it's 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.359
 do their best to try to 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.970
 keep having fun while 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.449
 communicates tries maximum mika 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:27.050
 maximum forgiveness and touch a maximum of 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:32.639
 more and more public what are there and 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:35.840
 take our foot here I have a small 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.840

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.940
