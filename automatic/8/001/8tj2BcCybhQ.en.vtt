00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.629
 as you can see I do not have 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.339
 super hot this morning 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.660
 but hey it's okay I'm in a 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.500
 corner of France that I appreciate 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.650
 particularly 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.059
 we are in auvergne aya patrice mestari 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.660
 who gave me an appointment to go 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.660
 sing with him 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:34.449
 you go there you're fine 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:38.180
 we did not have a great sunrise 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.100
 we will take the opportunity to know 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.409
 a little more about you on the east was presenting 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.750
 and well I'm Patrice I mestari 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:46.460
 am a pro photographer I'm doing photography 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.670
 for a little fifteen years and 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.100
 start a little make pictures 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.809
 landscapes sir redirect very 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.600
 quickly on dani handle 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.869
 I did a lot of time so all 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.559
 mountain animals exclusively the 

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:05.900
 marmot chamois and then and 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.549
 then after little by little I got 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.439
 really get clear in the landscape is 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.610
 there yes I have progressed a lot and then I 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.000
 maybe I'm a little bit locked up 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.140
 in there but that was really 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.470
 for me really had to evolve 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.880
 quite quickly and then 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.310
 now I 'm not redirecting a little 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.070
 little green to do anything that is 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.040
 nature so including animals in 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.600
 the framework of my job I am obliged to 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.350
 do a little bit else because 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.270
 not just landscape photos 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.060
 natures clearly I still have not enough 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.160
 of customers so it does not happen to me 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.110
 a few weddings so I limit myself 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.360
 I'm trying this year for example to 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.590
 do 5 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.730
 so here I have them almost looped so 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.010
 it is rather happy then 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.170
 in addition to these types of benefits there 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.630
 I can do king shows that's it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.660
 can be cs 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.980
 shooting a little bit with family 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.340
 everything that revolves around the portrait 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.080
 social picture of things like that then 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.420
 next to that I also organized 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.990
 photo opportunities in France as at 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.930
 overseas 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.800
 so there first in France it will be 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.710
 the vercors at friends' and then then 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:24.730
 there will be travel trips photo in 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:29.680
 Scotland is also in Norway on the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.430
 Lofoten I see here I thy 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.320
 do not know in fact 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.610
 can you introduce us a little 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.880
 of material that you have yeah bah listening 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:45.160
 I have with regard to the case it is 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.670
 of the fuji it is of the mix t1 the gemmi 1,55 of 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.460
 8 just out it's a good 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.020
 small optics that all tropicalized 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.230
 so it's pretty good the year 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.180
 conditions a little rotten and what 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.709
 benefits you get from this case at this 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.750
 that the sale and has always been at fuji 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.020
 where were you at deutsche 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.600
 mark 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.820
 no, but the thing is I was in 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.650
 did I start the photo so a 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.709
 fifteen years I had material 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.170
 cannon since from the beginning and then 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.860
 I was not bad 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.280
 problems 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.060
 so I decided everything 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.270
 resell and then do not throw in fuji 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.370
 it was a bit risky bet what you 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.920
 as for tea type of habit 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.480
 Well, that's not always easy 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.490
 to change brands 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.850
 and then know what is 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.850
 if you want to be happy with it so I got 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.470
 the chance that the brand but lent a 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.570
 housing to be able to test it 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.260
 so that's still not all 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.160
 brands are able to do that and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.640
 when I saw that it was my listening 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.340
 I really have not convinced me 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.230
 but in any case in terms of quality of 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.680
 service behind I really found that 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.740
 well 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.770
 so then the case did the rest 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.290
 and but here I switched it that makes it 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.510
 now to a month and a half after that of 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.040
 all the way the material for me it's 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.150
 a c is just a working tool so 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.630
 indeed he has to answer to 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.750
 needs 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.780
 after that I'm concentrating on 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.500
 volunteering the landscape the emotions the 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.910
 felt and 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.970
 I think it's really the most 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.970
 important
