designs<00:02:15.150> themselves<00:02:15.420> is<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.530> use<00:02:16.980> them<00:02:17.250> as

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
designs themselves is to use them as

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.470 
designs themselves is to use them as
actual<00:02:18.350> holder<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:20.040> flowers<00:02:20.550> for<00:02:21.150> instance

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
actual holder for flowers for instance

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.260 
actual holder for flowers for instance
in<00:02:21.660> these<00:02:21.780> peony<00:02:22.550> because<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.580> wanted<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.150> only

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
in these peony because I wanted to only

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.350 
in these peony because I wanted to only
use<00:02:24.569> three<00:02:24.930> stems<00:02:25.530> here<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.130> order<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.000> make<00:02:27.180> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
use three stems here in order to make it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.140 
use three stems here in order to make it
so<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.930> looks<00:02:28.140> more<00:02:28.350> interesting<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.459> to

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
so that it looks more interesting is to

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.809 
so that it looks more interesting is to
plug<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:31.050> opening<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.860> vase<00:02:32.040> with<00:02:32.520> the

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
plug the opening of the vase with the

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.780 
plug the opening of the vase with the
faceted<00:02:33.510> replica<00:02:34.020> diamond<00:02:34.830> which<00:02:35.280> makes<00:02:35.580> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
faceted replica diamond which makes it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.180 
faceted replica diamond which makes it
stay<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.120> place<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.319> also<00:02:37.530> gives<00:02:38.040> you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
stay in place and and it also gives you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.030 
stay in place and and it also gives you
a<00:02:38.220> level<00:02:38.520> up<00:02:39.060> higher<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.260> design<00:02:40.709> that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
a level up higher in this design that

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.640 
a level up higher in this design that
the<00:02:41.190> lights<00:02:41.430> will<00:02:41.670> catch<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.270> reflect<00:02:43.260> which

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the lights will catch and reflect which

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.310 
the lights will catch and reflect which
makes<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.250> very<00:02:44.459> stunning<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.360> higher<00:02:45.600> that

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
makes it very stunning up higher that

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.620 
makes it very stunning up higher that
one<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.739> well<00:02:46.769> look<00:02:47.250> at<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.459> use<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.360> and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
one as well look at the use of the and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.930 
one as well look at the use of the and
thorium<00:02:49.230> by<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.620> way<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.250> combination<00:02:50.519> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
thorium by the way in this combination a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.759 
thorium by the way in this combination a
little<00:02:51.239> bit<00:02:51.360> more<00:02:51.510> garden<00:02:51.900> air<00:02:52.019> collection

today<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.760> can<00:02:54.150> design<00:02:54.330> with<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.019> mix<00:02:55.290> which

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
today you can design with the mix which

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.890 
today you can design with the mix which
makes<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:56.489> much<00:02:56.640> more<00:02:56.880> interesting<00:02:57.209> to

idea<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:09.350> then<00:04:10.350> back<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.190> our<00:04:11.780> table<00:04:12.780> setting

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
idea and then back to our table setting

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.500 
idea and then back to our table setting
napkin<00:04:14.280> ring<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.850> then<00:04:15.570> to<00:04:17.299> another<00:04:18.299> replica

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
napkin ring and then to another replica
