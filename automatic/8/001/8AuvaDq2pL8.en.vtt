00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.199
 hi gamer here then mount today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:19.949
 it's raspberry and the trot ok to me 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.900
 they don't like the taller one 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 brand learned when elected the sachet 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.019
 you could see your eyes then 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.400
 today's topic because they say it 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.680
 a lot of it really weighed one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 what we think of the seventh season 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.710
 what we are on grey's series 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.140
 anatomy of the of the manor of 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.340
 early pokemon do not understand what I should 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.920
 think about something you still don't 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.600
 exists before just speak I want 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 greet all my class because 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 otherwise I will repay in a group 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.860
 hello to all the second square apart 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.600
 then there was success 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.969
 struggling to rumble on the net then 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.399
 network means ready and consequently the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.750
 rest of the network over a year but 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.440
 pokémon generations that should 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.940
 to call oneself plus plus minus is called e 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.790
 should be inspired by some areas 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.250
 of Japan is said should be a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 how much read a legion completely 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.360
 insular where the islands are those cards 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.689
 in thun in the south but tomatsu divers 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.630
 water absolutely for walter and have 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.280
 already released a bit of max 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.890
 giving the image the starters that they are 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.200
 obviously fake m from we say zero 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.549
 because they will also stay because in 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.979
 there are great states that go 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.329
 different if basically 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.020
 it is basically false for the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.850
 moment nothing is known but I hope so 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.040
 of what this week 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 I hope they do something nice well 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.729
 then with the sixth you had the excuse of 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.420
 few pokemon made it to you by saying 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.250
 i love making 3d models it will be done now but now 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.149
 just want something serious i want 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.030
 another 150 pokémon a damn things of the 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.310
 but with her it was already white 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.409
 they were on certain black and white if it exists 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.369
 in reality they can not not so ugly 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.159
 those who added reached 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.799
 few but not to say place on the ground of 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.380
 xy if I 'm not mistaken, I wouldn't want to 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.190
 making mistakes because they stared wasn't mica 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.140
 bad no 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.720
 however they were not filissine 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.440
 in short, here's what I want to be 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.140
 that is what you want them to do 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.530
 that add more mega 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.989
 first thing so that smog on does not 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.680
 always cry that there is a mega stronger 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.470
 our 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.980
 I want smog to realize that 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.489
 mega are something that serves precisely to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.160
 boosting your exact I would like something 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.000
 that works well for the competitors ie 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.620
 I wish I'm damned competitive with gold 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.570
 and that's to say the new pokémon I want that 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.750
 almost all are compatible with the 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.750
 competitor a few excuses a few little excuses 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.700
 however I don't know that I was just one 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.140
 person passes though I keep hoping 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.030
 in a pokemon plus trio I saw the la 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.650
 graphics that you can get to those who do 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.140
 can reach on 3ds and grace 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.310
 xenoblade and cabbage 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.410
 I would like too much of an exclusive right 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.079
 being foreign and just walking away 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.329
 to say to malakal in short, I get up and do it 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.150
 walk away because I don't want it 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.340
 next they never will assume it 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.750
 never that otherwise I take the uil says but 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.460
 on them 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.080
 I'm leaving and fair grateful though I 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.230
 would really like something really 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.950
 no a world this ship is better than a big one 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.940
 one day with the plot I don't have it 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.920
 however riemer you say you was in 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.600
 tasks you think about 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.190
 I can even there you can the game e 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.750
 of course there also write short 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.910
 the topics you want them to 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.100

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.459
 yes who you want us to talk to 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.240
 next videos something just nintendo 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.989

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.670
 Enough is enough, then later begins 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.070
