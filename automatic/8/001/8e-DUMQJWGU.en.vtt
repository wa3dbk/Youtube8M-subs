00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.990 
for how the data is collected by a CT
scanner<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.949> main<00:01:02.160> problem<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.579> them<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
scanner the main problem with them is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.880 
scanner the main problem with them is
that<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.420> require<00:01:03.600> basically<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.710> use

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that they require basically that you use

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.680 
that they require basically that you use
a<00:01:04.920> higher<00:01:05.190> x-ray<00:01:05.610> dose<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.179> use<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> lower

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
a higher x-ray dose if you use a lower

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.570 
a higher x-ray dose if you use a lower
x-ray<00:01:07.080> dose<00:01:07.289> so<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.890> really<00:01:08.160> noisy

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
x-ray dose so you get a really noisy

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.880 
x-ray dose so you get a really noisy
image<00:01:09.090> kind<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> grainy<00:01:09.990> exposure<00:01:10.590> in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
image kind of like a grainy exposure in

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.859 
image kind of like a grainy exposure in
photography<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.210> just<00:01:12.509> simply<00:01:12.780> not

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
photography and that's just simply not

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.960 
photography and that's just simply not
acceptable<00:01:13.530> quality<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.399> doctors<00:01:14.820> today

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
acceptable quality and so doctors today

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.090 
acceptable quality and so doctors today
have<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> higher<00:01:15.990> dose<00:01:16.320> than<00:01:16.590> they

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
have to use a higher dose than they

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.830 
have to use a higher dose than they
would<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.460> our<00:01:17.880> groups<00:01:18.210> been<00:01:18.390> working<00:01:18.690> for

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
would like our groups been working for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.419 
would like our groups been working for
about<00:01:18.929> a<00:01:19.020> decade<00:01:19.229> with<00:01:19.619> GE<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.039> make<00:01:20.220> what's

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:20.429 
about a decade with GE to make what's

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:21.859 
about a decade with GE to make what's
called<00:01:20.490> model-based<00:01:21.240> image<00:01:21.720> reconstruction

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
called model-based image reconstruction

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.889

the noise and the data and that's a very
important<00:01:28.829> part<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.399> put<00:01:29.549> all

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.660 
use it in the emergency room you can't
even<00:01:49.259> use<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.770> every<00:01:50.009> single<00:01:50.189> patient

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
even use it on every single patient

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.920 
even use it on every single patient
because<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.030> only<00:01:51.240> takes<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.600> couple<00:01:51.630> minutes

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
because it only takes a couple minutes

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.770 
because it only takes a couple minutes
to<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.409> CT<00:01:52.740> scan<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.670> key<00:01:54.090> part<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.630> our

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to have a CT scan so the key part of our

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.270 
to have a CT scan so the key part of our
research<00:01:54.930> right<00:01:55.320> now<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.649> trying<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> make<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
research right now is trying to make the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.830 
research right now is trying to make the
algorithms<00:01:56.759> faster<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.299> we<00:01:57.390> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> bring

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
algorithms faster but we want to bring

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.319 
algorithms faster but we want to bring
it<00:01:57.930> down<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.799> minute<00:01:59.369> or<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.820> computing

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
it down to a minute or two of computing

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.630 
it down to a minute or two of computing
time<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.259> every<00:02:01.680> patient<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.250> benefit

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
time so that every patient can benefit

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
time so that every patient can benefit
from<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.329> would<00:02:03.479> be<00:02:03.630> standard

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
from this and this would be standard

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.170 
from this and this would be standard
equipment<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:04.950> every<00:02:05.219> CT<00:02:05.520> scan<00:02:05.759> every

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
equipment with every CT scan every

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.520 
equipment with every CT scan every
patient<00:02:06.210> would<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.810> able<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.140> much<00:02:07.320> lower

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
patient would be able to have much lower

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.580 
patient would be able to have much lower
dose<00:02:07.859> and<00:02:08.130> higher<00:02:08.549> quality<00:02:09.030> images

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
dose and higher quality images

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:20.850 
dose and higher quality images
result<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.979> these<00:02:10.129> sophisticated<00:02:10.670> algorithms
