00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
just testing ideas to see whether we

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.390 
just testing ideas to see whether we
could<00:04:18.370> get<00:04:18.640> things<00:04:18.940> moving<00:04:19.739> behind<00:04:20.739> other

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
could get things moving behind other

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.890 
could get things moving behind other

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
objects and generally in a room type

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.290 
objects and generally in a room type

you<00:06:35.880> did<00:06:36.030> you<00:06:36.210> don't<00:06:36.420> use<00:06:36.660> usual<00:06:37.290> this<00:06:37.380> happen

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
you did you don't use usual this happen

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.140 
you did you don't use usual this happen
because<00:06:37.770> you<00:06:37.920> are<00:06:38.010> you<00:06:38.130> mark<00:06:38.310> them<00:06:38.460> another

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
because you are you mark them another

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.940 
because you are you mark them another
you<00:06:39.300> synthesize<00:06:39.600> I<00:06:40.020> don't<00:06:40.230> use<00:06:40.350> a<00:06:40.410> keyboard<00:06:40.830> or

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
you synthesize I don't use a keyboard or

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.660 
you synthesize I don't use a keyboard or
anything

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:41.670 
anything

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.520 
anything
what's<00:06:42.480> the<00:06:42.570> reason<00:06:42.720> from<00:06:43.020> just<00:06:43.320> more

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
what's the reason from just more

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.280 
what's the reason from just more
flexibility<00:06:44.220> this<00:06:44.370> gives<00:06:44.910> you<00:06:45.000> an<00:06:45.140> old<00:06:46.140> and

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
flexibility this gives you an old and

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.070 
flexibility this gives you an old and
more<00:06:46.410> open<00:06:46.590> mind<00:06:46.860> I<00:06:47.130> would<00:06:47.640> say<00:06:47.930> yeah<00:06:48.930> because

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
more open mind I would say yeah because

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.050 
more open mind I would say yeah because
it<00:06:49.320> so<00:06:49.800> that's<00:06:49.980> the<00:06:50.070> video<00:06:50.160> you're<00:06:50.730> thinking

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
it so that's the video you're thinking

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.310 
it so that's the video you're thinking
along<00:06:51.180> the<00:06:51.330> lines<00:06:51.360> of<00:06:51.570> the<00:06:51.690> computer<00:06:52.080> and<00:06:52.230> not

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
along the lines of the computer and not

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.659 
along the lines of the computer and not
along<00:06:52.560> the<00:06:52.590> lines<00:06:52.860> of<00:06:52.980> a<00:06:53.070> keyboard<00:06:53.280> of

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
along the lines of a keyboard of

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.540 
along the lines of a keyboard of
whatever<00:06:54.150> instrument<00:06:54.770> is<00:06:55.770> that's<00:06:56.070> the<00:06:56.280> reason

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550 
whatever instrument is that's the reason

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.490 
whatever instrument is that's the reason
why<00:06:56.790> you<00:06:56.850> reckon<00:06:57.210> your<00:06:57.300> musics<00:06:57.630> than<00:06:58.290> anything

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
why you reckon your musics than anything

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.740 
why you reckon your musics than anything

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
good spine that fits anymore

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.010 
good spine that fits anymore
is<00:07:06.580> this<00:07:06.939> the<00:07:07.120> atmosphere<00:07:07.509> that<00:07:07.659> you<00:07:07.750> wanted
