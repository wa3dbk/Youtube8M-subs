magazines and videos websites that maybe

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.479 
magazines and videos websites that maybe
even<00:00:35.059> went<00:00:35.270> through<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.570> few<00:00:35.840> teachers<00:00:36.489> looking

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
even went through a few teachers looking

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.080 
even went through a few teachers looking
for<00:00:37.730> a<00:00:37.760> way<00:00:37.970> to<00:00:38.030> gain<00:00:38.360> a<00:00:38.390> better<00:00:38.750> understanding

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
for a way to gain a better understanding

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.360 
for a way to gain a better understanding
yeah<00:00:41.090> through<00:00:41.360> all<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.780> those<00:00:41.900> methods<00:00:42.370> you

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
yeah through all of those methods you

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.560 
yeah through all of those methods you
were<00:00:43.580> able<00:00:43.970> to<00:00:44.120> retain<00:00:44.629> some<00:00:45.230> skills<00:00:46.210> licks<00:00:47.210> a

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
were able to retain some skills licks a

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.259 
were able to retain some skills licks a
few<00:00:48.170> chords<00:00:48.470> maybe<00:00:49.280> in<00:00:49.430> some<00:00:49.699> theory<00:00:50.059> they

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
few chords maybe in some theory they

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.090 
few chords maybe in some theory they
could<00:00:50.449> probably<00:00:50.809> help<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:51.320> here<00:00:51.500> here

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
could probably help you here here

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000 
could probably help you here here
but<00:00:52.940> when<00:00:53.150> it<00:00:53.269> comes<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:53.989> application<00:00:54.830> of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
but when it comes to the application of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.479 
but when it comes to the application of
these<00:00:55.190> things<00:00:55.550> over<00:00:55.909> a<00:00:56.180> song<00:00:56.650> that<00:00:57.650> moves<00:00:58.040> and

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
these things over a song that moves and

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.090 
these things over a song that moves and
changes<00:00:58.720> this<00:00:59.720> is<00:00:59.930> like<00:01:00.050> pinning<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.589> tail<00:01:00.620> on

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
changes this is like pinning the tail on

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.860 
changes this is like pinning the tail on
the<00:01:01.129> donkey<00:01:01.250> with<00:01:01.790> all<00:01:02.030> of<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.300> information

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.610 

this<00:01:05.870> is<00:01:06.080> because<00:01:06.470> as<00:01:06.979> we<00:01:07.070> learn<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:07.940> apply

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:08.620 
this is because as we learn to apply

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.710 
this is because as we learn to apply
things<00:01:09.620> to<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.070> neck<00:01:10.310> we<00:01:10.850> lose<00:01:11.090> sight<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
things to the neck we lose sight of the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.350 
things to the neck we lose sight of the
fact<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.560> guitar<00:01:12.950> has<00:01:13.370> a<00:01:13.400> system<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.180> its

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
fact that the guitar has a system of its

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.310 
fact that the guitar has a system of its
own<00:01:15.610> you<00:01:16.610> can<00:01:16.640> build<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.360> sturdy<00:01:17.600> building

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
own you can build a sturdy building

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.660 
own you can build a sturdy building
without<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.340> solid<00:01:19.670> foundation<00:01:20.090> first<00:01:21.369> same<00:01:22.369> is

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
without a solid foundation first same is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.539 
without a solid foundation first same is
true<00:01:22.820> with<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.210> guitar<00:01:23.770> it's<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.890> lot<00:01:25.100> easier

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
true with the guitar it's a lot easier

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.609 
true with the guitar it's a lot easier
to<00:01:25.880> apply<00:01:26.210> things<00:01:26.840> that<00:01:27.170> we<00:01:27.350> learn<00:01:27.619> on<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:29.030> a

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
to apply things that we learn on to a

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.349 
to apply things that we learn on to a
foundation<00:01:30.619> that<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.130> know<00:01:31.369> then<00:01:31.969> we<00:01:32.149> know

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
foundation that we know then we know

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.929 
foundation that we know then we know
where<00:01:32.869> they<00:01:33.020> are<00:01:33.200> how<00:01:33.829> to<00:01:33.890> get<00:01:34.250> there<00:01:34.579> and<00:01:34.820> how

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
where they are how to get there and how

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.550 
where they are how to get there and how
to<00:01:35.000> use<00:01:35.329> them<00:01:35.539> in<00:01:36.490> order<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.700> have<00:01:38.000> a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
to use them in order to have a

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.870 
to use them in order to have a
comprehensive<00:01:39.560> understanding<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.820> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
comprehensive understanding of the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.450 
comprehensive understanding of the
guitar<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:42.469> must<00:01:42.740> first<00:01:42.979> know<00:01:43.399> the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
guitar you must first know the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.639 
guitar you must first know the
foundation<00:01:45.310> second<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.729> must<00:01:46.969> know<00:01:47.649> the

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
foundation second you must know the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.959 
foundation second you must know the
foundation<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.670> how<00:01:49.850> it<00:01:50.149> moves<00:01:50.450> both

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
foundation and how it moves both

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:54.849 
foundation and how it moves both
horizontally<00:01:52.969> and<00:01:53.229> vertically<00:01:54.229> on<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.500> neck

horizontally and vertically on the neck

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.840 
horizontally and vertically on the neck
as<00:01:55.210> different<00:01:56.210> things<00:01:56.240> happen<00:01:56.899> in<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.170> music

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
as different things happen in the music

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.810 
as different things happen in the music
if<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.329> understand<00:01:59.929> that<00:02:00.429> then<00:02:01.429> you'll<00:02:01.670> have

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
if you understand that then you'll have

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.580 
if you understand that then you'll have
a<00:02:01.880> better<00:02:02.210> understanding<00:02:02.329> of<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.409> whole

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
a better understanding of the whole

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.399 
a better understanding of the whole
where<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.700> why<00:02:04.939> to<00:02:05.359> apply<00:02:05.689> all<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.170> things

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
where and why to apply all the things

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.740 
where and why to apply all the things
that<00:02:06.679> we<00:02:06.859> learn<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.969> system<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:10.630> lot<00:02:11.630> of

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
that we learn to the system a lot of

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.770 
that we learn to the system a lot of
people<00:02:12.050> know<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.410> foundation<00:02:13.300> but<00:02:14.300> not<00:02:14.569> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
people know the foundation but not the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.390 
people know the foundation but not the
system<00:02:15.230> of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
system of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.810 
system of
so<00:02:17.400> stay<00:02:17.700> tuned<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.950> those<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.340> who<00:02:20.550> don't
