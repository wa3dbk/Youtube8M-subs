 Announcements of the 6th edition of the ministry of architecture 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.519

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.469

 we look at him from the outside he 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.790
 represents one full house 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.890
 and small to him attach to with such 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.660
 by a small bridge the house itself has not 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 square and have small 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.700
 rounding bulge also has 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.399
 balcony here such here we have a house, I think 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.250

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:57.570

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:01.910
 wise here and tried to do something 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 really beautiful compact here 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.860
 here we have with you fireplace fireplace with 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.030
 here we have such a smoke 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.369
 must come from here over there now I 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 decided not to do the pipe as usual 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.090
 do a little bit different in their 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.950
 technology we have a fireplace sofas 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.700
 the most such beautiful standard kitchen 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.560
 that's how i like to do say there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.610
 basement basement we have a small 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.490
 the warehouse has an enchanted room in 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.110
 which we can enchant a thing and on 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.470
 small level 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.149
 while pushing the lever we can 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.149
 enchant item and level 30 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.270
 there is a lift to the second floor bedroom 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.040
 the most necessary thing 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.480
 the house is a bit empty 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.210
 spaces but i think empty 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.230
 space never hurts us 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.520
 wonderful balcony you can 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.100
 admire at something 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.510
 and moving to another part of the house is ours 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.280
 alchemy tower 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.260
 I decided to call it that because 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.300
 here apart from the whole house you can 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.780
 sit chemically create different 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:26.010
 potions whatever you want 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.480
 water to collect in the flask in the water but 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.080
 all it will end you can lift 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.230
 head up and take in the water from here 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.030
 so here everything is wonderful beautiful 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.020
 the loft I didn't do in this house because 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.410
 I see no point in it 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.390
 I think the announcement is over the house I think so 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.400
 did you like if you liked 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.020
 Be sure to write in the comments if 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.030

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.530

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.120
