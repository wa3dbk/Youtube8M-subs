little<00:01:08.850> hairspray<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.330> make<00:01:09.540> sure<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.979> this

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
little hairspray to make sure that this

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.760 
little hairspray to make sure that this
texture<00:01:11.520> lasts<00:01:11.760> now<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:13.140> around<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.530> face

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
texture lasts now right around the face

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.850 
texture lasts now right around the face
I<00:01:14.040> always<00:01:14.400> take<00:01:14.790> those<00:01:15.000> sections<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.290> roll

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
I always take those sections and roll

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090 
I always take those sections and roll
them<00:01:17.070> away<00:01:17.189> from<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> face<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.710> want<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.860> top
