00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:05.100
 good evening this is the tenth installment of a basic course in blender 3d treviso 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.899
 has made version 2. 5 4 of the program 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.119
 in this episode we will finally move on to editing mode to modify the 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.559
 mac structure 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.479
 yes no in fact we have traslator voted and resized the streaks but not the 

00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:19.880
 we have transformed by changing its fortune 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.289
 we have worked in a mode known as few world direct way 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.730
 to change the structure of the meches we must enter a mode of 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.909
 delta edit processing world 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.240
 literally change mode 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.920
 to do this we have to select the meches that interests us and press the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.830
 tab key 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.480
 can choose edit mode from selector to the world 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 present in the debby every 3d navigation window 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.829
 to return to object mode we can press tab again 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.160
 can choose world today from the mo selector 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.610
 certain commands seen from the object mode 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.630
 how does 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.829
 rls 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.120
 remain the same in edited mode 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.840
 although in this case they will serve to transform the vertices of the mac 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.159
 while other commands 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.090
 of this mode are entirely 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.660
 let's proceed with or 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.060
 the meches I consist of texts there xpeed an interface 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.920
 a vertex is a single. in the 3d space with its own coordinate 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.469
 and that it can be connected to another vertex by means of a segment 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.020
 we do not have 3 or more edges to form a closed figure 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.740
 necessarily a face 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.320
 a face is a surface enclosed between three or four vertices and can be there 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.180
 how not to be there 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.680
 to better understand this concept let's take up the creation of the match on 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.910
 circle seen in previous installments 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.120
 the default circle 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.810
 3 in reality the only circumference without filling 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.030
 while selecting film we will indicate to blender to create also the surface is 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.390
 enclosed within the circumference 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.080
 that is the faces made up of points on the circumference 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.660
 it is a vertex placed in the center of the circle 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.870
 obtaining the real circle bottom surface of the facets 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.480
 render b 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.250
 with the selected circle we can pass unpublished world to observe the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.900
 structure 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.709
 we now select the base cube with other goods and we award you a pub 

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:15.619
 initially as we enter the mode and the chings we will have all the vertices of 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.639
 shin of which the faces of the goods selected 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.889
 in fact they will appear highlighted 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.589
 the selection of the sub-parts of a commodity takes place unpublished world with 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:28.769
 same silly as most seen north mobs to select u2 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:33.089
 with a click of the right mouse button and we can select a vertex 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.509
 with a we can select or deselect all vertices i 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.090
 edges and faces while with marbles c 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.190
 we can activate the selection to go to rectangular or accent 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.999
 multiple selection can also be carried out using crack cysts 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.959
 of the right mouse button as to select multiple matches e 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.179
 simultaneously up 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.269
 keep in mind also that the selection unpublished world that 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.309
 for example we select two vertices te 

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.449
 then another 2 perhaps through the rectangular sections 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.499
 the new selection will also include the vertices chosen previously 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.489
 once I've selected some vertices like I'm doing in this one 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.519
 how much I envy we can neglect can make the selection climb here 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.199
 voices present in consciousness 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.669
 fire 18 kg 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.489
 r and ex 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:21.499
 holding g 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:26.180
 ros we can also specify an axis to constrain the transformation is a 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.569
 numerical value to indicate the entity 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.969
 for example cont stx vero. 5 we will become the size of the long selection 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:37.969
 the x axis with the effect of approaching the vertices while with gimp 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:39.210
 y -2 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.169
 we will move the selected vertices of two units along the y axis 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.369
 in the negative direction 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:47.629
 opening the windows transform with n 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.780
 we could parametrically specify the position of the center of gravity 

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:52.050
 of the selection 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.749
 entering the values ​​in the media metrics yez fields 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.449
 values ​​can refer to the center of blender's virtual universe 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.039
 or to the center of gravity of the goods 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:05.439
 depending on whether the local castellar bulb blob box is selected under i 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.209
 numeric buttons pics yez 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.439
 we can also delete one or more vertices by selecting tremendous x 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.199
 not so long ago 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.180
 or by clicking on the did it in the tuscia 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.769
 dive photo the selection of the elements regarding the vertices of a commodity 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.009
 it is taken individually and in groups 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.220
 but this operation can become boring and time-consuming 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:28.770
 uselessly found if we have to select a lot of edges and 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:29.569
 I do 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.210
 in this case it is better to pass 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.449
 to edge selection and face selection mode 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.530
 by clicking on the relevant buttons in the age of the navigation window 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.009
 3d yahoo like I'm doing right now by 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.479
 the same commands listed above are valid for the selection of 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.059
 elements 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:50.609
 this involves right-clicking maybe some cispel to perform 

00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:51.620
 multiple selections 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.400
 or abi or c 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.830
 only this time they will cover whole edges I have stuffed 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.880
 and also x will have the effect of deleting these elements 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.180
 these buttons are mode and 20 tests 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.240
 they are not present in one day 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.129
 the entries in the window on the right are also different 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.300
 now 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.360
 I believe he does 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.170
 indicate the number of corner vertices and face respectively 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.800
 that make up a mesh 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.449
 each with two values ​​separated by a stroke 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.719
 where the first value indicating how many are the selected elements 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.839
 the second indicates the total of the mac 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:30.039
 to return to the object mode and translate count the scaling the flow 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.309
 thus modified, simply press tab and make the desired changes 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.060
 keep in mind that almost certainly the local origin of the modified goods 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.680
 it is not the same as its center of gravity 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.389
 here it is convenient to select origin pluviometers 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.499
 via sciocca gente has its origin in the Tuscia area 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:49.289
 to update the tour 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.259
 in this episode I would also like to talk about a 3d computer graphic concept 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.419
 that of normal uber alles 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.879
 a normal one has a surface 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.879
 is a perpendicular outgoing vector given to 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.880
 with some modifications this definition can also be extended to 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.949
 I don't cry surfaces 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.360
 and it is also possible to define the normal habbos 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.710
 a normal and therefore a vector with a verse 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.180
 and the display of a geometry depends on the norm 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.939
 if we are observing the known with the normal outgoing 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:21.119
 this rendered gross area 

00:06:21.119 --> 00:06:24.479
 however on any surface it is possible to identify two normals 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:25.169
 birds 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.770
 if one for each side 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.650
 in computer graphics, oriented surfaces or surfaces are used 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.389
 'where with a convention 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.759
 defined by precise mathematical rules 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.210
 Some negative electronic configurations can be called positive 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.089
 other 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.019
 in particular one normal will be positive while the other sarah nile 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.629
 the normals will help us define the inside of what the outside is 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:49.849
 in the closed doors 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.399
 via specify which faces of an object must participate in the process 

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.319
 to say 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.719
 to view the positive normals of the various faces that make up one 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:06:59.280
 mashup 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.330
 just select it 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.789
 pass unpublished world 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:04.710
 open the windows transform panel 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.569
 in a 3d navigation window 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:07.630
 and select 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.789
 at the bottom of the me cdisplay section 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:13.039
 tris norm the synonym overtech 

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.330
 depending on what you want to see 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.729
 ie normal faces or vertices hey choose the segment size 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:23.750
 chelle rae will present in the 3d marian windows the norm value of times 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.259
 to reverse the direction of a normal one, select the face that is 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:29.819
 interested and click on 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:30.870
 feedback 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.619
 in the section names moved in tuscia 

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:37.489
 it's time there is not much else to say about the normals but these concepts 

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:38.080
 who sleep 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.199
 useless later 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.839
 when we will talk about some modifiers of people's goods and r 

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:45.849
 well for this installment is everything 

00:07:45.849 --> 00:07:50.210
 in the next we will see how to create new vertex edges face eww mi 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.629
 by instructions 

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:53.820
 how to connect two or more cream vertices 

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.690
 an edge 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.940
 how to fill alpha 3 or more edges with compressed air creating a face e 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.330
 even more
