00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 so hello everyone to the next snapshot 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.000
 Presentation this week is the net 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.040
 already 13 09 a outside and with these 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.170
 snap shot camera off latest really 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 make crazy shield around it so 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.470
 I'm just going to express that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.020
 let's have a look 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.949
 bizarre construction approach 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.560
 these are witches ozelot on it rides on 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 I want to ride the ocelot 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.310
 somehow doing that is still somewhere 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.679
 here I still wanted to get it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.690
 that the witch rides on a bed so 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.860
 sometimes bat and then the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.540
 all fly together that would be on 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.770
 have been funny but somehow I have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.450
 then distributed correctly 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.280
 or somehow not completely succeed 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
 in addition, now equal you can 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.489
 from now on mops do not stack each other 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 let ride 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.520
 this is relatively simple with a filter 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.770
 from inmate I'll tell you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.809
 So entities units stuck knew 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.730
 region around mike has been able to put on it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.230
 then it will be just too 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.430
 whimsical I just got it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.760
 Here's a little bit crafted and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.350
 the next plus cat + fisherman 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.689
 then just stacked on top of each other 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.090
 connected to a city ​​and then you can 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.320
 These newest riding on each other thus 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.380
 the spring does not have to work out more 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.460
 but that would be at least once step 1 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.960
 you can like it with juices 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.759
 look at the filter itself and drag 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.259
 such a crazy sheep marica after 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.700
 maybe a guest with the cat and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.530
 a fine on it that we then 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.439
 bombing matter 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.909
 okay that leaves anyway to point 1 what 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.729
 actually so the essential biggest 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.350
 change was 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.329
 It was like that the next time 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.900
 you if you sat down in my heart 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.009
 and then lured out the 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 sympathetic again a bit 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.729
 strangely then it was always like that 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.829
 you then stood next to the main cup now 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.869
 I can do the following again 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.140
 go in and then I'm still 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.159
 my card and still drive so 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.930
 Now the but goes again 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.430
 So that has now been changed that is 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.079
 if you run out and log in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.049
 you stand next to the entrance remains 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.340
 I'll sit in there next 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.860
 just need to make eight times that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.680
 now with pon an elvis of eggs from 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.210
 spiders also spin recently 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.509
 rider gets that was not so 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.459
 Of course combining a rare earth a 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.129
 moment we get him something 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.260
 I should now a little bit 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.010
 until then for the file of his 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.680
 come out 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.420
 that was not possible before 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.040
 and is therefore new accordingly 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.489
 so you can get it right away 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.610
 Also skeleton rider from Bavaria from 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.510
 spin out and although I have then 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.769
 still heard of a bug the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.239
 has now been fixed could 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.159
 namely here such a hopper for example 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.170
 Throw in six and then there's out of the 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.670
 corporate no output signal comes 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.359
 accordingly, since newest at this time 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.980
 but it was fixed from there 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.299
 and lastly, a still bugfix 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 not only a problem with the 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.690
 Captain the last time with the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.790
 funnel and if you have the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.829
 example in the amboss had renamed in 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.150
 which names a corresponding I 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.590
 do not listen 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.510
 Let's call it we just take it 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.579
 just had then placed 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.450
 otherwise there was still hopper so it 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.030
 has not changed meanwhile 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.379
 Okay, that's okay, too, so the western changes 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.329
 actually not too moderate 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.940
 a lot of new stuff besides a little bit crazy 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.349
 sheep what will actually be the skin so 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.879
 which will then attack push us too 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.349
 probably now but I believe that 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.669
 I will end up with less of a suicide 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.799
 because then partly the mobs 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.569
 rage damaged and self-okay 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.099
 well that would have been immaterial of 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.720
 this little overview i hope that 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.250
 update as soon as possible then it is 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.900
 Of course nobody knows exactly what is coming 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.060
 Of course, I 'm looking forward to the last one 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.040
 update 1.5 for the dresser with computers 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.329
 and hopper as possible by doing so too 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.829
 already say the next episode 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.449
 I thank for watching or 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.639
 next snapshot presentation in general 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.709
 or tutorial what do i know each one has 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.340
 Quantity is uploaded or any amount is 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.199
 already done 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.199
 then we 'll see each other the next shot
