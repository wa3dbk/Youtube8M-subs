00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:15.370

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:25.060
 turret is here and we get 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 in one of the tables as far back as possible 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:31.259
 without falling 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.840
 you will see that you can be there what 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.550

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.540

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:45.370

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.980
 that they give you but 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.960
