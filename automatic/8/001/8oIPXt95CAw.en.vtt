00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.509
 hi all guys and well on the coach hd 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.840
 today we will see a new spal builder 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.370
 new training for low cost series 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.470
 although this I must say that it is not 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.470
 just yours that I post a little bit 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.210
 more than the others but nothing 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.269
 so excessive compared to the teams that 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.940
 I usually see on fifa word let's go 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.420
 immediately to see what team it is 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:57.039
 let's find out together is a module 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.660
 that I really like that 4 3 1 2 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:04.089
 and it is a bpl or barclays true is now 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.860
 pro and fortissimo barclays 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.220
 let's start right away with the goalkeeper 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.250
 mignolet of the Belgian liverpool is a lot 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:17.830
 strong appropriate statistics of works 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:20.320
 83 84 of reflexes 81 of reference that is 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.000
 really strong based on 2005 100 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.429
 is not perhaps the best goalkeeper of the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.970
 barclays, however, really makes his beauty 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:28.179
 figure 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:32.860
 now let's move to the center of defense 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:37.119
 with vertonghen also Belgian of the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.459
 tottenham at 72 speed attempts to 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.890
 peels are seven of 81 defense shots 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:45.009
 82 head 74 on the way does not do from 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.959
 3000 is really a tough bone is a 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.780
 pillar of defense that never loses 

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:51.759
 undermine truly truly exceptional 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.619
 let's think of the teammate who 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.739
 this time a francesco we reviewed 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.810
 we have known that always in the for 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:01.209
 regarding tottenham 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.240
 then he spits it and kabul 78 speed 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:08.349
 and eighty of defense 83 of 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.899
 Header pump from 2,700 crises is 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.239
 really a bargain are two giants who 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.300
 together they really make the difference 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.430
 not strong to the nth degree they succeed 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.190
 to very well to compensate 1 with the fast 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.140
 of the other with the physical presence of the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.630
 therefore communicate well in defense when 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.700
 regards the full back left hand 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.470
 we have walkers that have content 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.180
 speed assumed meeting has been blocked 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.599
 defense of the product of a header 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.360
 and 70 passing counted to 3000 is 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.489
 really very fast he can make up for it 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.440
 to do the two phases in attack than in 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.110
 defense and will never leave you uncovered 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.600
 on the other hand we have the left side 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.610
 armero ex napoli plays aston villa 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.239
 now he is Colombian compact at 1000 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.519
 so really a small piece of 90's 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.200
 evening speed under leasing 74's 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.100
 defense you are always passing through 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.630
 he also knows how to do both phases 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.390
 you will often find in attack maybe a 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.230
 serve the tips with a big one with a 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.730
 passage 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.380
 let's move on to the midfield with 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.329
 Pauline central midfield and 81 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.579
 of opera or the general with po from 5600 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:18.459
 those instead of, however, cited by 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.890
 thrilling 68 defense 81 shots 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.630
 head took steps and 70 's 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.760
 Ray Shooting This is the player 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.680
 phenomenal and complete in all 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.820
 breakers is really the center 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.480
 admin that serves for this 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.220
 training 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.019
 let's now turn to his partner 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.260
 team has been trying hard to accept 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.380
 complete which is fellaini 81 of oberon is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.829
 bought I do not remember his control 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.750
 I think 6300 of 71 speed 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.230
 using passages and was held there 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.510
 home of the 31 defense ming and 85 suddenly 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.620
 of head it is present of passages 72 of 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.630
 shooting collars 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.670
 really a giant because it is very high 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.040
 boys is very high the pains all of him 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.690
 then he also tests a great pussy 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.430
 physics then in midfield together with 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.560
 Paulines or will really make a difference 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.060
 then he would perhaps have it thicker in the cap ad 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.810
 an illness to make some shots from outside 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.519
 area 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.139
 or to intercept balloons but 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.239
 especially black then we will work 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.950
 really important now we come to the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.169
 teammate a little more offensive 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.060
 this but also the 10 or 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.190
 lots of balloons that are fernandinha 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.250
 of the magister cv and Brazilian natalie 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.220
 shooting speed 76 of passage 81 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.620
 of dribbling 70 defense and 54 leading 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.200
 it's just 4000 credits compact 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.320
 so this trio is really very strong 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.690
 of wax midfield we know how to defend 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.000
 steal the ball that then attack to give 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.590
 comfort to the playmaker and to the 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.580
 public consists of the fundamentals 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.070
 in this team 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.389
 let's see immediately and eriksen eriksen who has 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:50.470
 82 of general potential 83 of of 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.530
 shooting speed 74 of passage 80 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.320
 almost dribbling and 4 stars then 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.990
 carry with both feet with go to 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.840
 5,500 really is a pillar because with 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.800
 both feet can score cross and 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.150
 serve the tips 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.600
 This is a Rockets team 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.120
 really strong than to see the 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.120
 I prefer compared to the 3 5 2 that i 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.110
 profits are always and always in absolute 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.970
 to be raised in the third division 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.260
 with this team I'm doing seen in 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.570
 world many satisfactions above all 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.280
 with people who know maybe man of the match 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.680
 or women of the year 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.570
 let's now turn to the cap that the bug 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.340
 women par excellence bandages chiÃ² 31 of 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.410
 over all speed 81 of shooting range e 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.410
 75 dribbling and 83 leading 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.510
 truly a 5,500 phenomenon spent 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.190
 very good 4 star weak foot then 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.440
 he too can shoot both with the text and 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.050
 with the left without problems to more than 90 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.880
 of physical strength of 90 of finalization 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.280
 so there is not at the door 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.560
 never wrong but with butt foot ass 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.450
 will always mark now because I am not a 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.880
 little of eni discos that we already have 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.289
 known already seen in the team 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.729
 French is that I had to bring 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.350
 because it seems common because they are 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:03.669
 really strong you need to be usable 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:07.210
 also in the compact bpl 3,100 with 91 of 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.070
 speed of 50 75 dribbling that has 82 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.690
 of head we have two strikers who 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.780
 save to pull up to start 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.910
 gave a very fast kind of me a 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.320
 little less mind than in this case rai 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.630
 I also have right-wing forces then 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.750
 we have two attackers who have 1 82 1 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.330
 83 of head and are therefore fast for 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.099
 this we say that the fullbacks 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.710
 they will often go up from various cans 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.210
 pass because he died not in 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.610
 all extreme this is a training 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.960
 that is yes and central games though 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.969
 always remember detergents that 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.129
 they can move forward and then steal the ball 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:39.780
 this is what we say the conclusion 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:41.520
 of this video is ransom that this 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.719
 sculpted you liked it if you have any 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.120
 advice from a few days from 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.710
 replace or insert with respect to a 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.930
 another to write it down here I will 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.740
 Always thank you for your contribution 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.620
 you make them grow 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.360
 I love you put a like so then
