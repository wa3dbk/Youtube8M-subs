00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
we've actually got a bed on wider the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.450 
we've actually got a bed on wider the
top<00:01:57.330> of<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.600> top<00:01:58.020> end<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.290> our<00:01:58.380> range<00:02:00.890> so<00:02:01.890> this

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
top of in top end of our range so this

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.100 
top of in top end of our range so this
result<00:02:02.850> will<00:02:02.970> come<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.270> soon<00:02:03.300> and<00:02:03.720> we<00:02:03.869> come

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
result will come in soon and we come

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.010 
result will come in soon and we come
back<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.470> later<00:02:04.790> after<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.820> few<00:02:06.060> more<00:02:06.180> races

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.620 

okay<00:02:10.020> we've<00:02:10.259> had<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.610> small<00:02:11.610> loss<00:02:11.820> here<00:02:14.360> trap<00:02:15.360> to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
okay we've had a small loss here trap to

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.800 
okay we've had a small loss here trap to
won<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.410> race<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.980> lost<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.430> bet<00:02:17.810> you'll

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
won the race so we lost the bet you'll

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.810 
won the race so we lost the bet you'll
see<00:02:19.050> now<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.290> recovery<00:02:19.980> has<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.400> kicked<00:02:20.580> in

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
see now the recovery has just kicked in

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.979 
see now the recovery has just kicked in
so<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.750> law<00:02:21.900> says<00:02:22.200> one<00:02:22.530> pound<00:02:22.769> fifty<00:02:22.950> five

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
so the law says one pound fifty five

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.479 
so the law says one pound fifty five
we're<00:02:24.989> gonna<00:02:25.110> would<00:02:25.410> cover<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.709> in<00:02:25.890> two<00:02:26.190> bets

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
we're gonna would cover that in two bets

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.610 
we're gonna would cover that in two bets
hopefully<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.980> loss<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.430> split<00:02:29.700> by<00:02:30.620> fifty

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
hopefully that loss is split by fifty

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.120 
hopefully that loss is split by fifty
percent<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:33.380> these<00:02:34.380> are<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.590> settings<00:02:34.920> down

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
percent so these are the settings down

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.960 
percent so these are the settings down
here<00:02:35.660> so<00:02:36.660> half<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.050> 155<00:02:37.860> ears<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:38.730> others

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
here so half of 155 ears what others

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.340 
here so half of 155 ears what others
will<00:02:41.970> simply<00:02:42.510> something<00:02:42.750> pen<00:02:43.110> 78<00:02:43.650> pens<00:02:43.950> plus

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
will simply something pen 78 pens plus

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.030 
will simply something pen 78 pens plus
the<00:02:46.350> 50<00:02:46.530> pence<00:02:46.910> stake<00:02:48.260> which<00:02:49.260> we're<00:02:52.040> staking

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the 50 pence stake which we're staking

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.000 
the 50 pence stake which we're staking
anyway<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:53.940> that<00:02:54.840> gives<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.350> next<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.680> cat<00:02:55.860> 1

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
anyway so that gives the next a cat 1

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.280 
anyway so that gives the next a cat 1
pound<00:02:56.220> 28<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.630> parent<00:02:57.930> I'm<00:02:58.049> sure<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.230> will

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
pound 28 and one parent I'm sure it will

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.360 
pound 28 and one parent I'm sure it will
be<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.769> bet<00:02:58.980> for<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.190> next<00:02:59.459> two<00:02:59.610> bets<00:03:01.370> so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
be the bet for the next two bets so

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.550 
be the bet for the next two bets so
we'll<00:03:02.700> see<00:03:02.880> how<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.060> go<00:03:03.170> come<00:03:04.170> back<00:03:04.230> in<00:03:04.500> a<00:03:04.530> few

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
we'll see how we go come back in a few

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.800 
we'll see how we go come back in a few
