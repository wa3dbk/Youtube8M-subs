single-stage enamel and the reason why

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.590 
single-stage enamel and the reason why
is<00:01:16.079> because<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.159> thicker<00:01:17.520> paint<00:01:17.970> alright

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600

hundreds<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.150> Isis<00:03:23.510> go<00:03:23.660> six<00:03:23.930> hundred<00:03:24.320> you<00:03:24.470> know

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
hundreds in Isis go six hundred you know

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.259 
hundreds in Isis go six hundred you know
if<00:03:24.680> they<00:03:24.830> if<00:03:24.860> you<00:03:25.220> think<00:03:25.489> four<00:03:25.760> hundred<00:03:26.090> grits

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
if they if you think four hundred grits

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.990 
if they if you think four hundred grits
too<00:03:26.450> far<00:03:26.930> too<00:03:27.320> coarse<00:03:27.830> for<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.190> use<00:03:28.730> six

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
too far too coarse for you use six

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.330 
too far too coarse for you use six
hundred<00:03:29.360> honestly<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.290> my<00:03:30.320> opinion<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:31.010> like

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
hundred honestly in my opinion I like

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.720 
hundred honestly in my opinion I like
400<00:03:32.330> but<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.750> think<00:03:33.200> four<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.920> six<00:03:34.160> hundred<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.700> a

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
400 but I think four to six hundred is a

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.850 
400 but I think four to six hundred is a
great<00:03:35.150> range<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.840> put<00:03:36.049> your<00:03:36.230> base<00:03:36.410> coat<00:03:36.590> clear

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
great range to put your base coat clear

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.490 
great range to put your base coat clear
coat<00:03:36.890> over<00:03:37.070> anything<00:03:38.320> smoother<00:03:39.320> than<00:03:39.440> that

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
coat over anything smoother than that

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.770 
coat over anything smoother than that
finer<00:03:40.220> than<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.549> like<00:03:41.030> eight<00:03:41.239> hundred

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
finer than that like eight hundred

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.880 
finer than that like eight hundred
thousand<00:03:42.470> grit<00:03:42.680> 1200<00:03:43.549> 1500<00:03:43.970> grit<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.660> not<00:03:45.560> good

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
thousand grit 1200 1500 grit is not good

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.340 
thousand grit 1200 1500 grit is not good
because<00:03:46.370> your<00:03:47.209> paint<00:03:47.540> is<00:03:47.720> just<00:03:47.959> not<00:03:48.140> going<00:03:48.290> to
