new<00:00:20.640> thing<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.939> guess<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.420> highlights

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460

battle<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.980> battle<00:00:50.670> first<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
battle on battle first of all I think a

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.029 
battle on battle first of all I think a
lot<00:00:51.570> more<00:00:51.899> people<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.649> want<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.860> see

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
lot more people are going to want to see

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.889 
lot more people are going to want to see
these<00:00:53.360> second<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:56.059> second<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.270> it's

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
these second of all second of all it's

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.119 
these second of all second of all it's
just<00:00:58.079> easier<00:00:58.410> for<00:00:58.440> me<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.710> do<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.070> now

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
just easier for me to do this now

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.229 
just easier for me to do this now
because<00:00:59.489> they<00:00:59.579> don't<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.090> record

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
because they don't have to like record

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.900 
because they don't have to like record
the<00:01:00.570> chat<00:01:00.780> part<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> um<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.370> yeah<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the chat part of it um and yeah so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.039 
the chat part of it um and yeah so
there's<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.329> like<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> know<00:01:03.690> simple

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
there's some like you know simple

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109 
there's some like you know simple
graphics<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> stuff<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.880> could

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
graphics and stuff like that this could

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
graphics and stuff like that this could
probably<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:07.140> whole<00:01:07.350> thing<00:01:07.560> right<00:01:07.740> here

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
probably this whole thing right here

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.160 
probably this whole thing right here
this<00:01:08.130> could<00:01:08.340> probably<00:01:08.640> go<00:01:09.180> away<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> little<00:01:10.020> bit

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
this could probably go away a little bit

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.410 
this could probably go away a little bit
quicker<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:11.430> stays<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.939> screen<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.299> guess

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
quicker it stays on the screen I guess

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.850 
quicker it stays on the screen I guess
for<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:12.900> too<00:01:13.049> long<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.290> mean<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.680> sees

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
for a little bit too long I mean it sees

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.890 
for a little bit too long I mean it sees
on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> screen<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> entire<00:01:14.850> time<00:01:15.659> until

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
on the screen for the entire time until

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
on the screen for the entire time until
you<00:01:16.049> make<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> new<00:01:16.409> move<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:17.280> not<00:01:17.490> completely

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
you make a new move I'm not completely

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.940 
you make a new move I'm not completely
certain<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.659> um<00:01:19.970> yeah<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.180> I'm<00:01:21.630> just<00:01:21.890> having<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
certain but um yeah so I'm just having a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.350 
certain but um yeah so I'm just having a
random<00:01:23.250> battle<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.700> really<00:01:24.030> don't<00:01:24.210> care

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
random battle here I really don't care

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.560

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
obviously it doesn't do anything the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.340 
obviously it doesn't do anything the
