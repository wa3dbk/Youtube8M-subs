00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.099
 Each as movement of the world seen from Kinshicho 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.099
 History of money 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:26.480
 The supply and demand of modern history gold seen in the price together with has been your description 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:32.140
 The final chapter of this video is the rise and fall of future gold coins 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.140
 I will explain the gold investment for Japanese people 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.740
 As a factor of the rise and fall of the future gold price 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:57.610
 First of all as a rising factor 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:01:00.340
 Due to the growing distrust of the currency, the Greek fiscal issue last summer made the euro and the currency more 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:07.590
 Increase in distrust of the whole 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.590
 If the site happens to have the gold coin amount recorded a record high 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:20.229
 In addition, inflation concerns such as rising oil prices demand for gold to protect assets from declining currency values 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.229
 Will increase 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:35.460
 And part of the excess liquidity fund from global monetary easing will flow into the gold market 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:39.720
 Price rise will occur when 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.950
 Currently implemented as a policy of monetary easing 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.170
 Regular interest rate policy too 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.310
 No interest rate 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.310
 The charm of gold 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.950
 Will increase 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:03.620
 Although the growth and economic growth of the demand of the central bank has settled down 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.620
 Demand for gold investment will grow in China and India 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:13.550
 On the other hand, as a factor of decline 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:20.690
 The opposite situation to the one mentioned above 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:23.600
 The debt problems in the euro area and the financial problems in the US 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.870
 Economic stability in the West will occur 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:33.150
 Occurred 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.150
 When the tightening of monetary was raised it is carried out interest rate 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:44.470
 An increase in the other stable supply quantity is is recycled in a sharp rise in price 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.470
 Or when it becomes to oversupply 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:59.930
 There may be cases where imf , hedge funds, etc. have sold gold all at once 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:02.550
 Because of such things, that the price of gold recorded the highest price ever in economic news etc 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.170
 If you can bear 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.170
 The factor of this time is 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:18.510
 Is it a chance? 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:25.260
 It is and Kinkaku and might be heading to obtain is interesting, such as lead thinking 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:27.709
 Finally, I want to get the story from me explain the situation on the gold investment for the Japanese 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.709
 I will 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:41.950
 Layer has been known that the feeling is very unique to investors of gold in Japan 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:44.030
 When you see the water of the gold spot investment demand of Japan and the world you see 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.750
 I think it will be 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:52.390
 Gold price is around $ 200 per troy in Europe and the US 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:56.380
 Around 1000 yen per gram in Japanese yen 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:04:00.530
 Japanese investors buy a lot of money from a sense of affordability 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:10.040
 It was known as the Japanese bar Ken Hunter 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:12.250
 And it recorded the world's largest annual gold investment demand from 1999 to 2001 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:18.100
 It is 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:24.910
 Since 2006 , Japan has become a gold exporter 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:26.980
 This is because the price purchased at the time for ¥ 1,000 was more than tripled 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.550
 by the way 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:37.330
 It is because we are selling the profit confirmation 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:40.630
 However, young investors worry about the future of pensions and investors who have been receiving stock etc. due to the financial crisis 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:44.470
 As gold investment in the age group is increasing 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:50.020
 A former Japan representative of 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.540
 e Toshima Itsuo of economic list which has a gold column in the money section of 2 e 1000 series 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.330
 Is so 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:59.389
 Comments from the experience of 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.389
 Japan's debt is 900 trillion yen 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.620
 Over 200% of Japan's gdp 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:16.910
 This can be seen from the chart of international comparisons of debt balances 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:18.610
 There is concern among Japanese individual investors while very Mari for that project is in line departure 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:27.099
 I will 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:35.470
 At the present stage, how can Japanese individual investors hold financial assets of 1,400 enteritis ? 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:42.780
 Kudzu physicians have determined that the Japanese government bond rating is stable or highly credible 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:45.070
 However, there are people who are concerned that this financial asset has been scrapped as the population ages 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.060
 Sell ​​government bonds 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.070
 Holding physical assets such as gold 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:57.980
 Or prepare for the worst case in the future 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:06:04.040
 It is said that there is a tendency to move assets outside the country considering the possibility of 20 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:09.300
 This is also the voice of Japanese customers who use the Brion Vault service 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:14.780
 Individuals in Italy and Spain are currently on the turn of the bank 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:21.410
 I seriously worry that the time will go down and withdraw the savings 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:25.169
 In such a situation, Japanese individual investors like using our company to buy money 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:32.999
 I hope you won't get driven 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:39.539
 But is never winter the body is that the momentum held for assets distributed in preparation for the future 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:43.009
 This work can give you a glimpse of the world's microcosms as it might not be 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:43.009
 It is days I think while doing 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:52.540
 This time for a long time 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.540
 Thank you for your time
