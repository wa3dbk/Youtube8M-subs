00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
twin keeping one of the cyber granular

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.180 
twin keeping one of the cyber granular
just<00:01:34.820> use<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.240> core<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.560> theory<00:01:36.770> that<00:01:36.890> his

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
just use the core the theory that his

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.400 
just use the core the theory that his
job<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.759> use<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.479> cyber<00:01:38.720> dragon<00:01:39.080> make<00:01:39.200> cyber

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
job and use a cyber dragon make cyber

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
job and use a cyber dragon make cyber
twin<00:01:39.680> he'll<00:01:40.490> be<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.810> 5,600<00:01:41.810> double<00:01:42.200> attacker<00:01:42.590> so

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
twin he'll be a 5,600 double attacker so

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.490 
twin he'll be a 5,600 double attacker so
that<00:01:43.550> comes<00:01:43.790> in<00:01:43.910> handy<00:01:44.060> because<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:45.350> use

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
that comes in handy because you use

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.530 
that comes in handy because you use
cyber<00:01:45.740> dragon<00:01:46.160> to<00:01:46.460> take<00:01:47.000> down<00:01:47.210> your

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
cyber dragon to take down your

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.050 
cyber dragon to take down your
opponent's<00:01:47.869> monster<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:49.190> he<00:01:49.250> has<00:01:49.520> one<00:01:49.850> and

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
opponent's monster if he has one and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.690 
opponent's monster if he has one and
then<00:01:50.390> attack<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.780> recce<00:01:51.200> for<00:01:51.500> fifty<00:01:52.490> six

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
then attack the recce for fifty six

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.430 
then attack the recce for fifty six
hundred<00:01:52.940> times<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.479> that's<00:01:53.780> ten<00:01:54.080> thousand

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
hundred times to that's ten thousand

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.460 
hundred times to that's ten thousand
twelve<00:01:54.619> hundred<00:01:54.800> damage<00:01:55.340> right<00:01:55.520> there

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
twelve hundred damage right there

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.719 
twelve hundred damage right there
another<00:01:57.470> reason<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.830> use<00:01:57.950> our<00:01:58.130> twin<00:01:58.490> as

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
another reason to use our twin as

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.340 
another reason to use our twin as
opposed<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.149> cyber<00:01:59.360> n<00:01:59.600> is<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.899> fact<00:02:00.080> that<00:02:00.170> your

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
opposed to cyber n is the fact that your

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.560 
opposed to cyber n is the fact that your
opponent<00:02:00.470> may<00:02:00.680> have<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.860> lot<00:02:01.039> of<00:02:01.070> Life<00:02:01.250> Points

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
opponent may have a lot of Life Points

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.330 
opponent may have a lot of Life Points
let's<00:02:02.570> say<00:02:02.750> use<00:02:02.990> upstart<00:02:03.470> Goblin<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:04.070> try<00:02:04.280> to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
let's say use upstart Goblin to try to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.100 
let's say use upstart Goblin to try to
make<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.520> turbo<00:02:04.940> version<00:02:05.180> of<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.570> deck<00:02:05.840> right

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
make a turbo version of this deck right

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.740 
make a turbo version of this deck right
well<00:02:06.979> then<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.580> just<00:02:07.610> gave<00:02:08.030> them<00:02:08.149> life<00:02:08.330> points

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
well then you just gave them life points

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.430 
well then you just gave them life points
so<00:02:09.619> eight<00:02:09.830> thousand<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.850> not<00:02:11.180> enough<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:12.230> take

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
so eight thousand is not enough to take

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.979 
so eight thousand is not enough to take
him<00:02:12.620> down<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.160> one<00:02:13.280> turn<00:02:13.519> so<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.570> might<00:02:14.720> want

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
him down and one turn so you might want

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.289 
him down and one turn so you might want
to<00:02:15.019> use<00:02:15.110> cyber<00:02:15.440> twin<00:02:15.680> dragon<00:02:15.799> instead<00:02:16.299> since

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
to use cyber twin dragon instead since

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.520 
to use cyber twin dragon instead since
