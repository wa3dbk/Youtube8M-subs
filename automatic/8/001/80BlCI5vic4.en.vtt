00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.450
 on youtube today I have 5 things that 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.450
 hate of skype 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.660
 but waiting 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.710
 now listen to my list if you do not like it 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.210
 see our video of 5 things that I love 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.079
 is cairo 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.820
 number 5 the skyrim attack apparently 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.610
 the only effective way to kill 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.010
 someone is the close body attack to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.470
 body was a swords program the most 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.500
 near 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:46.460
 if you want to attack with magic an enemy 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.560
 to forget you if you do not have the expertise 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.050
 at a high level 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.910
 people have no chance against 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.640
 they also remain after using your bow 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.440
 because if you do not have the distance or the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.989
 adequate stealth will result 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.460
 I do not know maybe a little more options to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.549
 the time to attack melee that does not 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.760
 be so repetitive something that I do not like 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.780
 so much of skype 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.770
 number 4 the loading screens with the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.880
 loading times of this game are 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.470
 eternal seems to last a long time 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.390
 I think that my playing time is not 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.510
 fall by a quarter 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.650
 of that waiting for it to end 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:38.940
 load the portal game why it takes 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.000
 so much wey number 3 the voices of the is 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.950
 karim apparently 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.540
 to more than half of the people in 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.800
 skyrim 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.800
 they have the same voice 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.890
 I already know that it is impossible that in a game 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.760
 so big everyone has different voices 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.520
 but sometimes it confuses you to talk almost 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.500
 all the same I think in the version in 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.380
 Spanish is much worse the voices are 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.619
 they repeat much more but it's something that they do not 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.280
 I like it 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:14.860
 number 2 clichÃ©s bucks errors that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.570
 you have to see how many times you have not 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.040
 come to a place and been ready to 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.250
 start the mission when suddenly 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.900
 I can see that the game has an error and 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.380
 you can not continue or you can not do 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:30.580
 nothing and when reviewing your game you 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.370
 realize that your save file is 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.110
 unusable because you've gone from that and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.910
 now you have to stop in the mission 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.140
 you have to play completely all the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.640
 missions or it's too frustrating 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.160
 number one what I hate most download 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.970
 that is such a great game that makes me 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.180
 adore him having thousands of hours of play 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:58.100
 stop beautiful landscapes 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:02.470
 in a fair epic music 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.470
 besides thousands of mythical creatures 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.080
 the coolest culture the dragons 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.270
 and what to say about the story 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.710
 apparently it is very little but suddenly 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.070
 you are in thousands of stories 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.680
 secondary that when reviewing 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:24.470
 how much game time you take are 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.440
 too many hours and hours very good 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.900
 without taking into account the hills 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.940
 before but they are things that make you love 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.320
 this game 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.300
 and well all anti tav 5 more if in 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.370

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.640
 download these according to my list 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.230
 continue or do not leave a comment I was 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.120
 forgot something else that is very frustrating 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.160
 in this game they also leave in the part 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.060
