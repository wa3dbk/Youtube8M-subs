all three of the flags because it will

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.660 
all three of the flags because it will
screw<00:02:23.930> up<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.140> spawn<00:02:24.410> it'll<00:02:25.160> start<00:02:25.400> spawning

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
screw up the spawn it'll start spawning

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.360 
screw up the spawn it'll start spawning
everywhere<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.630> anywhere<00:02:26.980> it's<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.070> lucky

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
everywhere and anywhere it's a lucky

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.920 
everywhere and anywhere it's a lucky
kill<00:02:28.610> right<00:02:28.850> there<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.300> then<00:02:29.390> now<00:02:29.630> he's<00:02:29.660> going

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
kill right there and then now he's going

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.770 
kill right there and then now he's going
inside<00:02:30.320> this<00:02:30.500> building<00:02:31.060> luckily<00:02:32.060> they<00:02:32.390> didn't

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
inside this building luckily they didn't

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.450 
inside this building luckily they didn't
rush<00:02:32.990> too<00:02:33.200> far<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.950> they<00:02:34.100> would<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.340> rushed

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
rush too far if they would have rushed

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.240 
rush too far if they would have rushed
in<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.730> back<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.210> spawn<00:02:35.480> was<00:02:35.750> good<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.140> see<00:02:36.440> but

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
in the back to spawn was good to see but

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.770 
in the back to spawn was good to see but
I<00:02:37.280> guess<00:02:37.700> these<00:02:37.820> people<00:02:38.210> are<00:02:38.270> smart<00:02:38.600> they

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
I guess these people are smart they

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.750 
I guess these people are smart they
stayed<00:02:39.050> in<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.440> big<00:02:39.680> room<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:40.250> then<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:40.580> in

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
stayed in this big room and then go in

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.340 
stayed in this big room and then go in
that<00:02:40.940> room<00:02:41.000> right<00:02:41.330> there<00:02:41.390> or<00:02:41.810> back<00:02:42.110> the

corridor<00:02:42.830> if<00:02:43.460> like<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.820> said<00:02:44.090> if<00:02:44.210> they<00:02:44.330> would

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
corridor if like I said if they would

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.030 
corridor if like I said if they would
have<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.840> would<00:02:44.990> have<00:02:45.140> switched<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.530> sponsor

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
have it would have switched the sponsor

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.320 
have it would have switched the sponsor
right<00:02:46.130> now<00:02:46.280> he's<00:02:46.460> just<00:02:46.670> in<00:02:46.820> their<00:02:47.000> spawn

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
right now he's just in their spawn

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.840 
right now he's just in their spawn
pretty<00:02:48.260> much<00:02:48.470> destroying<00:02:49.280> them<00:02:49.430> right<00:02:49.700> there

kill<00:03:26.540> streaks<00:03:26.810> are<00:03:27.040> 54<00:03:28.040> predator<00:03:28.370> missle<00:03:28.640> a

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
kill streaks are 54 predator missle a

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.080 
kill streaks are 54 predator missle a
chopper<00:03:29.510> gunner<00:03:29.540> 11<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.980> nuke<00:03:31.220> which<00:03:31.940> is

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
chopper gunner 11 and the nuke which is

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.120 
chopper gunner 11 and the nuke which is
the<00:03:32.270> first<00:03:32.660> time<00:03:32.840> I've<00:03:32.989> ever<00:03:33.020> seen<00:03:33.440> anyone<00:03:33.770> use

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
the first time I've ever seen anyone use

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.000 
the first time I've ever seen anyone use
that<00:03:34.760> set<00:03:35.060> up<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.360> get<00:03:35.420> a<00:03:35.570> nuke<00:03:35.720> but<00:03:36.530> it<00:03:36.830> worked

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
that set up to get a nuke but it worked

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.150 
that set up to get a nuke but it worked
for<00:03:37.190> him<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:38.440> was<00:03:39.440> actually<00:03:39.590> very<00:03:39.770> proud<00:03:40.130> of

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
for him and I was actually very proud of

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.010 
for him and I was actually very proud of
him<00:03:40.370> because<00:03:40.430> usually<00:03:40.820> he<00:03:41.209> screws<00:03:41.630> up<00:03:41.810> nukes

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
him because usually he screws up nukes

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.380 
him because usually he screws up nukes
all<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.290> time<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.850> he<00:03:43.850> actually<00:03:44.000> got<00:03:44.209> this

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
all the time and he actually got this

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.180 
all the time and he actually got this
one<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.870> it<00:03:45.019> looked<00:03:45.230> really<00:03:45.470> good<00:03:45.800> because<00:03:46.160> I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
one and it looked really good because I

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.820 
one and it looked really good because I
he's<00:03:47.120> just<00:03:47.330> just<00:03:47.660> roaring<00:03:48.260> them<00:03:48.560> again

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
he's just just roaring them again

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.470 
he's just just roaring them again
high-rise<00:03:49.280> if<00:03:49.610> you<00:03:49.850> went<00:03:50.030> for<00:03:50.150> a<00:03:50.180> new<00:03:50.330> clean

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
high-rise if you went for a new clean

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.610 
high-rise if you went for a new clean
high-rise<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.080> would<00:03:51.200> probably<00:03:51.350> be<00:03:51.530> the

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
high-rise it would probably be the

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.380 
high-rise it would probably be the
easiest<00:03:51.650> math<00:03:52.220> because<00:03:52.730> like<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.060> said<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.360> can

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
easiest math because like I said you can

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.610 
easiest math because like I said you can
spawn<00:03:53.959> trap<00:03:54.230> them<00:03:54.670> but<00:03:55.670> as<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.810> rate<00:03:57.019> he<00:03:57.230> goes

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
spawn trap them but as the rate he goes

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.699 
spawn trap them but as the rate he goes
and<00:03:58.160> how<00:03:58.280> good<00:03:58.550> your<00:03:59.330> not<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.510> best<00:03:59.840> and<00:04:00.170> now

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
and how good your not the best and now

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.180 
and how good your not the best and now
this<00:04:00.920> isn't<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.340> best<00:04:01.489> video<00:04:01.910> but<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:03.190> enjoyed

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
this isn't the best video but I enjoyed

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.560 
this isn't the best video but I enjoyed
watching<00:04:04.340> him<00:04:04.640> play<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.090> was<00:04:05.300> trying<00:04:05.540> to

watching him play it I was trying to

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.900 
watching him play it I was trying to

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
was running out of ammo so he picked up

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.380 
was running out of ammo so he picked up
this<00:04:13.080> guy's<00:04:13.260> red<00:04:13.590> dot<00:04:13.800> I<00:04:14.070> mean<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.850> guy<00:04:15.030> scar

with a red dot and right there's a

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.250 
with a red dot and right there's a
chopper<00:04:18.120> gunner<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.630> think<00:04:18.840> he<00:04:18.959> was<00:04:19.080> going<00:04:19.230> to

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
chopper gunner I think he was going to

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.540 
chopper gunner I think he was going to
call<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.560> there<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.860> I<00:04:19.890> told<00:04:20.100> him<00:04:20.160> not<00:04:20.280> to<00:04:20.430> he's

call it there and I told him not to he's
like<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:20.820> know<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:21.090> know<00:04:21.480> so<00:04:22.140> what<00:04:22.470> he<00:04:22.560> does<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.740> he

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
like I know I know so what he does is he

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.470 
like I know I know so what he does is he
doesn't<00:04:23.460> look<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.670> left<00:04:23.820> which<00:04:24.030> was<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> mistake

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
doesn't look to left which was a mistake

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.840 
doesn't look to left which was a mistake
but<00:04:24.960> luckily<00:04:25.170> didn't<00:04:25.560> get<00:04:25.680> shot<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.430> he<00:04:26.520> jumps

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
but luckily didn't get shot and he jumps

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.550 
but luckily didn't get shot and he jumps
over<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> edge<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.780> i<00:04:27.930> was<00:04:28.050> i<00:04:28.200> was<00:04:28.380> gonna

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
laugh if he fell off but I caused it in

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.480 
laugh if he fell off but I caused it in
his<00:04:30.510> chopper<00:04:30.810> gunner<00:04:30.990> and<00:04:31.170> owned<00:04:31.710> high-rise<00:04:32.190> a

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
his chopper gunner and owned high-rise a

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.370 
his chopper gunner and owned high-rise a
chopper<00:04:32.760> gunner<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.540> best<00:04:33.720> killstreak<00:04:34.020> to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
chopper gunner is the best killstreak to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.750 
chopper gunner is the best killstreak to
use<00:04:34.500> over<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.920> ac-130<00:04:35.400> because<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.570> can

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
use over the ac-130 because you can

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.090 
use over the ac-130 because you can
destroy<00:04:38.990> murder<00:04:41.600> all<00:04:42.600> those<00:04:42.870> other<00:04:43.110> words<00:04:43.410> you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
destroy murder all those other words you

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.520 
destroy murder all those other words you
can<00:04:44.250> just<00:04:44.430> go<00:04:44.700> to<00:04:44.760> town<00:04:45.180> on<00:04:45.570> these<00:04:45.720> people<00:04:46.050> as

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
can just go to town on these people as

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.020 
can just go to town on these people as
you<00:04:46.710> can<00:04:46.740> see<00:04:47.070> they<00:04:47.400> can't<00:04:47.610> come<00:04:47.790> out<00:04:47.880> of<00:04:47.970> this

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
you can see they can't come out of this

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.580 
you can see they can't come out of this
building<00:04:48.270> there's<00:04:48.660> they're<00:04:49.050> trapped<00:04:49.380> in

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
building there's they're trapped in

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.860 
building there's they're trapped in
there<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:50.010> you<00:04:50.820> can<00:04:50.970> just<00:04:51.150> keep<00:04:51.330> shooting<00:04:51.630> in

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
there and you can just keep shooting in

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.240 
there and you can just keep shooting in
the<00:04:51.990> doorway<00:04:52.410> shooting<00:04:52.890> in<00:04:52.980> through<00:04:53.130> the

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
the doorway shooting in through the

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.070 
the doorway shooting in through the
windows<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:53.820> you're<00:04:54.390> going<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.600> get<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.780> lot<00:04:55.050> of

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
windows and you're going to get a lot of

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.910 
windows and you're going to get a lot of
kills<00:04:55.730> if<00:04:56.730> they<00:04:56.940> did<00:04:57.150> come<00:04:57.360> out<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.780> blow<00:04:58.740> it

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
kills if they did come out and blow it

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.280 
kills if they did come out and blow it
up<00:04:59.070> it<00:04:59.550> would<00:05:00.240> be<00:05:00.390> the<00:05:00.420> best<00:05:00.660> thing<00:05:00.840> but<00:05:01.140> it's

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
up it would be the best thing but it's

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.560 
up it would be the best thing but it's
very<00:05:01.500> hard<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:02.130> as<00:05:02.610> you<00:05:02.790> can<00:05:02.910> see<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.120> flew<00:05:03.330> on

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
very hard and as you can see it flew on

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.150 
very hard and as you can see it flew on
the<00:05:03.630> Left<00:05:03.960> which<00:05:04.380> I<00:05:04.530> made<00:05:04.740> it<00:05:04.860> even<00:05:04.980> easier<00:05:05.250> and

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
the Left which I made it even easier and

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.460 
the Left which I made it even easier and
it's<00:05:08.160> just<00:05:08.430> insane<00:05:08.820> how<00:05:09.060> much<00:05:09.240> damage<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.380> the

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
it's just insane how much damage to the

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.370 
it's just insane how much damage to the
chopper<00:05:10.740> gunner<00:05:10.950> can<00:05:11.130> do<00:05:11.250> on<00:05:11.460> this<00:05:11.610> map

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
chopper gunner can do on this map

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.100 
chopper gunner can do on this map
chopper<00:05:13.380> gunner<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.680> very<00:05:13.860> good<00:05:14.100> and<00:05:14.610> a

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
chopper gunner is very good and a

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.970 
chopper gunner is very good and a
easiest<00:05:16.110> way<00:05:16.230> to<00:05:16.290> get<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.500> new<00:05:16.620> gives<00:05:16.860> the

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
easiest way to get a new gives the

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.430 
easiest way to get a new gives the
chopper<00:05:17.250> gunner<00:05:17.660> but<00:05:18.660> right<00:05:18.870> now<00:05:18.990> you<00:05:19.050> can't

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
chopper gunner but right now you can't

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.010 
chopper gunner but right now you can't
really<00:05:19.620> get<00:05:19.740> any<00:05:19.860> more<00:05:19.980> people<00:05:20.190> there<00:05:21.180> in<00:05:21.690> the

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
really get any more people there in the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.190 
really get any more people there in the
back<00:05:22.260> so<00:05:22.590> now<00:05:22.890> he<00:05:22.950> needs<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.700> five<00:05:24.330> more<00:05:24.690> kills<00:05:24.960> I

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
back so now he needs a five more kills I

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.550 
back so now he needs a five more kills I
think<00:05:26.450> I'm<00:05:27.450> not<00:05:27.690> sure<00:05:27.870> he<00:05:28.050> needs<00:05:28.230> a<00:05:28.350> couple

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
think I'm not sure he needs a couple

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.680 
think I'm not sure he needs a couple
more<00:05:28.710> kills<00:05:29.040> stop<00:05:29.940> we're<00:05:30.060> gonna<00:05:30.180> do<00:05:30.390> it<00:05:30.540> and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
more kills stop we're gonna do it and

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.890 
more kills stop we're gonna do it and
there<00:05:31.140> is<00:05:31.260> another<00:05:31.620> one<00:05:31.970> by<00:05:32.970> now<00:05:33.390> he's<00:05:33.570> back<00:05:33.750> in

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
there is another one by now he's back in

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.110 
there is another one by now he's back in
the<00:05:33.930> spawn<00:05:34.200> just<00:05:34.500> uh<00:05:34.700> picking<00:05:35.700> people<00:05:35.850> off

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
the spawn just uh picking people off

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.760 
the spawn just uh picking people off
that<00:05:36.420> are<00:05:36.540> coming<00:05:36.840> out<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:36.990> thing<00:05:37.320> but<00:05:37.530> as<00:05:37.650> you

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
that are coming out of thing but as you

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.580 
that are coming out of thing but as you
can<00:05:37.860> see<00:05:38.070> his<00:05:38.400> teammates<00:05:38.850> uh<00:05:39.120> did<00:05:40.080> go<00:05:40.290> back

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
can see his teammates uh did go back

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.650 
can see his teammates uh did go back
there<00:05:40.890> so<00:05:41.190> i<00:05:41.490> think<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.850> spawns<00:05:42.210> are<00:05:42.540> gonna

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
there so i think the spawns are gonna

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.170 
there so i think the spawns are gonna
slow<00:05:43.350> down<00:05:43.560> or<00:05:43.950> start<00:05:44.700> spawning<00:05:44.940> them

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
slow down or start spawning them

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.830 
slow down or start spawning them
elsewhere<00:05:46.850> because<00:05:47.850> you<00:05:48.060> will<00:05:48.240> hear<00:05:48.420> in<00:05:48.540> a<00:05:48.600> few

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
elsewhere because you will hear in a few

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.870 
elsewhere because you will hear in a few
seconds<00:05:49.320> at<00:05:49.560> the<00:05:49.590> they're<00:05:50.010> taking<00:05:50.370> beat<00:05:50.640> yeah

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
seconds at the they're taking beat yeah

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.220 
seconds at the they're taking beat yeah
right<00:05:51.090> here<00:05:51.270> they've<00:05:51.450> taken<00:05:51.570> be<00:05:51.870> and<00:05:52.110> that

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
right here they've taken be and that

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.440 
right here they've taken be and that
means<00:05:52.470> that<00:05:52.680> spawn<00:05:53.280> probably<00:05:53.850> spawn<00:05:54.120> them<00:05:54.270> out

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
means that spawn probably spawn them out

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.560 
means that spawn probably spawn them out
by<00:05:54.690> be<00:05:55.040> because<00:05:56.040> of<00:05:56.070> the<00:05:56.460> enemy<00:05:56.970> went<00:05:57.180> back<00:05:57.360> too

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
by be because of the enemy went back too

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.250 
by be because of the enemy went back too
far

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.500 

and<00:06:00.560> now<00:06:01.310> I<00:06:01.340> told<00:06:01.700> him<00:06:01.790> to<00:06:01.940> go<00:06:02.060> kill<00:06:02.300> the<00:06:02.390> guy

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
and now I told him to go kill the guy

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.380 
and now I told him to go kill the guy
because<00:06:03.110> I<00:06:03.140> guys<00:06:03.590> by<00:06:03.830> all<00:06:03.980> by<00:06:04.280> himself<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.910> I
