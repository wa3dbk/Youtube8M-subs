00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.650 

but<00:02:45.170> meanwhile<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> suggest<00:02:45.620> doing<00:02:46.040> is<00:02:46.660> you

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
but meanwhile I suggest doing is you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.449 
but meanwhile I suggest doing is you
just<00:02:47.870> literally<00:02:48.530> brush<00:02:49.069> it

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.550 

if<00:02:55.060> your<00:02:55.180> beginners<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:55.780> especially<00:02:56.200> hard

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
if your beginners is especially hard

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.250 
if your beginners is especially hard
together<00:02:56.769> accurately

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.840 

so<00:03:01.260> as<00:03:01.350> long<00:03:01.470> as<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.710> really<00:03:01.890> hit<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.160> six<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
so as long as you really hit a six the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.670 
so as long as you really hit a six the
for<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.690> children<00:03:04.020> three<00:03:04.260> orders<00:03:04.500> get

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
for the children three orders get

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.250 
for the children three orders get
smashed<00:03:04.980> up

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:16.660 

okay<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.980> aji<00:03:12.190> looks<00:03:13.190> like<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:15.220> well<00:03:16.220> do<00:03:16.520> is

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
okay and aji looks like that well do is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.280 
okay and aji looks like that well do is
I<00:03:16.940> will<00:03:17.000> put<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:19.160> little<00:03:19.340> annotation<00:03:19.610> in<00:03:20.290> which

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
I will put a little annotation in which

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.720 
I will put a little annotation in which
will<00:03:23.080> show<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.620> tablature<00:03:25.070> Phrygian

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
will show you the tablature Phrygian

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.000 
will show you the tablature Phrygian
okay<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.540> go<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:27.020> first<00:03:27.260> way<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.590> goes

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
okay so it go the first way it goes
