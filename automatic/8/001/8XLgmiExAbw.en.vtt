00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:08.470 

adding<00:00:06.709> shadows<00:00:07.189> to<00:00:07.370> the<00:00:07.490> object<00:00:08.059> and<00:00:08.299> your

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
adding shadows to the object and your

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.449 
adding shadows to the object and your
drawing<00:00:08.690> is<00:00:09.019> a<00:00:09.049> great<00:00:09.440> way<00:00:09.650> to<00:00:09.680> create<00:00:10.250> an

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:10.459 
drawing is a great way to create an

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.369 
drawing is a great way to create an
illusion<00:00:10.760> of<00:00:11.059> depth<00:00:11.360> so<00:00:11.780> in<00:00:12.019> this<00:00:12.170> lesson

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:12.379 
illusion of depth so in this lesson

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.939 
illusion of depth so in this lesson
we're<00:00:12.889> going<00:00:13.010> to<00:00:13.070> learn<00:00:13.250> how<00:00:13.459> to<00:00:13.490> do<00:00:13.670> just<00:00:14.000> that

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:14.949 
we're going to learn how to do just that

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.689 
we're going to learn how to do just that
so<00:00:15.949> to<00:00:16.010> begin<00:00:16.369> with<00:00:16.640> I<00:00:16.820> drew<00:00:17.210> this<00:00:17.539> simple

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
so to begin with I drew this simple

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.000 
so to begin with I drew this simple
rectangular<00:00:19.699> box<00:00:20.240> right<00:00:20.599> here<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:21.010> we're

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
rectangular box right here and we're

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.189 
rectangular box right here and we're
going<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.280> add<00:00:22.520> a<00:00:22.820> cast<00:00:23.090> shadow<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.630> it<00:00:23.750> the

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
going to add a cast shadow to it the

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.320 
going to add a cast shadow to it the
first<00:00:24.470> thing<00:00:24.619> you<00:00:24.770> need<00:00:24.949> to<00:00:24.980> do<00:00:25.190> is<00:00:25.369> determine

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
first thing you need to do is determine

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.510 
first thing you need to do is determine
the<00:00:26.630> location<00:00:26.990> of<00:00:27.350> your<00:00:27.410> light<00:00:27.770> source<00:00:28.039> so<00:00:28.279> for

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
the location of your light source so for

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.760 
the location of your light source so for
this<00:00:28.640> one<00:00:28.820> I'm<00:00:29.390> going<00:00:29.449> to<00:00:29.930> have<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.529> light

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
this one I'm going to have the light

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.310 
this one I'm going to have the light
source<00:00:31.070> be<00:00:31.400> in<00:00:31.640> front<00:00:32.059> of<00:00:32.239> the<00:00:32.539> object<00:00:32.840> and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
source be in front of the object and

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.250 
source be in front of the object and
sort<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.160> in<00:00:34.370> far<00:00:35.120> away<00:00:35.210> in<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.600> distance<00:00:35.989> so

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
sort of in far away in the distance so

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.849 
sort of in far away in the distance so
I'm<00:00:36.769> just<00:00:37.010> going<00:00:37.129> to<00:00:37.159> put<00:00:37.339> it<00:00:37.460> right<00:00:37.699> over<00:00:37.940> here

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
I'm just going to put it right over here

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.259 
I'm just going to put it right over here
so<00:00:39.859> now<00:00:40.039> that<00:00:40.100> you<00:00:40.309> have<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.640> location<00:00:41.120> the

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
so now that you have the location the

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.610 
so now that you have the location the
light<00:00:41.420> source<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.899> next<00:00:42.140> thing<00:00:42.289> we<00:00:42.409> need<00:00:42.440> to

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
light source the next thing we need to

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.160 
light source the next thing we need to
do<00:00:42.829> is<00:00:43.039> locate<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.879> shadow<00:00:44.210> vanishing<00:00:44.929> point

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
do is locate the shadow vanishing point

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.020 
do is locate the shadow vanishing point
and<00:00:45.319> the<00:00:45.800> shadow<00:00:46.039> vanishing<00:00:46.609> point<00:00:46.850> is

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
and the shadow vanishing point is

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.450 
and the shadow vanishing point is
exactly<00:00:47.420> that<00:00:47.899> it's<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.530> vanishing<00:00:49.249> point

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
exactly that it's the vanishing point

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.270 
exactly that it's the vanishing point
that<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:50.420> straight<00:00:50.929> lines<00:00:51.229> of<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.010> shadow

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
that the straight lines of the shadow

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.610 
that the straight lines of the shadow
will<00:00:52.729> converge<00:00:53.179> to<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:53.719> we're<00:00:54.139> treating<00:00:54.499> the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
will converge to so we're treating the

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.430 
will converge to so we're treating the
shadow<00:00:54.859> of<00:00:55.039> the<00:00:55.129> object<00:00:55.519> just<00:00:55.699> like<00:00:55.850> any<00:00:56.059> other

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
shadow of the object just like any other

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.410 
shadow of the object just like any other
object<00:00:57.440> laying<00:00:58.129> flat<00:00:58.429> on<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.760> ground<00:00:58.969> and<00:00:59.239> it

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
object laying flat on the ground and it

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.239 
object laying flat on the ground and it
has<00:00:59.600> straight<00:00:59.870> lines<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.379> it's<00:01:00.620> receding

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
has straight lines and it's receding

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:03.939 
has straight lines and it's receding
away<00:01:01.309> from<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.850> observer<00:01:02.179> so<00:01:03.019> once<00:01:03.499> again<00:01:03.709> any

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
away from the observer so once again any

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.240 
away from the observer so once again any
parallel<00:01:04.670> lines<00:01:04.940> receding<00:01:05.659> away<00:01:05.890> will<00:01:06.890> seem

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
parallel lines receding away will seem

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.210 
parallel lines receding away will seem
to<00:01:07.549> converge<00:01:07.909> towards<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.420> vanishing<00:01:08.990> point

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
to converge towards a vanishing point

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.950 
to converge towards a vanishing point
the<00:01:10.220> good<00:01:10.340> news<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.060> vanishing

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
the good news is that the vanishing

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.650 
the good news is that the vanishing
point<00:01:12.170> is<00:01:12.320> very<00:01:12.650> easy<00:01:12.980> to<00:01:13.280> locate<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:13.910> all

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
point is very easy to locate it's all

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.330 
point is very easy to locate it's all
you<00:01:14.810> have<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:15.020> do<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:15.350> go<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.950> your<00:01:16.160> light

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
you have to do is go to your light

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.630 
you have to do is go to your light
source<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.880> draw<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.510> straight<00:01:17.570> line<00:01:18.640> down

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
source and draw a straight line down

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.340 
source and draw a straight line down
from<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.240> light<00:01:20.390> source<00:01:20.420> until<00:01:21.050> you<00:01:21.140> hit<00:01:21.290> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
from the light source until you hit the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.830 
from the light source until you hit the
horizon<00:01:21.920> line<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.310> there<00:01:23.150> you<00:01:23.420> will<00:01:23.600> have

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
horizon line and there you will have

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.840 
horizon line and there you will have
your<00:01:24.200> shadow<00:01:24.620> vanishing<00:01:25.280> point<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:25.700> it's

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
your shadow vanishing point so it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.520 
your shadow vanishing point so it's
going<00:01:25.940> to<00:01:26.000> be<00:01:26.150> right<00:01:26.330> there<00:01:26.660> so<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.290> shadow

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
going to be right there so the shadow

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.140 
going to be right there so the shadow
vanishing<00:01:28.070> point<00:01:28.280> will<00:01:28.490> always<00:01:28.910> be

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
vanishing point will always be

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.900 
vanishing point will always be
vertically<00:01:29.750> aligned<00:01:30.140> with<00:01:30.980> your<00:01:31.490> light

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
vertically aligned with your light

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.620 
vertically aligned with your light
source<00:01:33.070> so<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.250> next<00:01:34.460> step<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.210> determine

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
source so the next step is to determine

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.020 
source so the next step is to determine
how<00:01:35.810> long<00:01:36.200> our<00:01:36.470> shadow<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:37.070> going<00:01:37.310> to<00:01:37.460> be<00:01:37.640> so<00:01:37.970> to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
how long our shadow is going to be so to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.480 
how long our shadow is going to be so to
do<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.570> we're<00:01:39.110> going<00:01:39.290> to<00:01:39.350> draw<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.950> straight

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
do that we're going to draw a straight

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.420 
do that we're going to draw a straight
line<00:01:40.520> from<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.300> light<00:01:41.480> source<00:01:41.800> through<00:01:42.800> each

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
line from the light source through each

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.750 
line from the light source through each
one<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.180> these<00:01:44.510> three<00:01:44.990> upper<00:01:45.530> corner<00:01:45.980> of<00:01:46.160> our

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
one of these three upper corner of our

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.750 
one of these three upper corner of our
object<00:01:47.830> so<00:01:48.830> we<00:01:49.010> have<00:01:49.040> straight<00:01:49.400> line<00:01:49.550> going

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
object so we have straight line going

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.220 
object so we have straight line going
from<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.000> light<00:01:50.150> source<00:01:50.180> through<00:01:50.750> each<00:01:50.960> one

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
from the light source through each one

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.110 
from the light source through each one
of<00:01:51.290> these<00:01:51.590> three<00:01:51.920> top<00:01:52.159> corners<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.730> I<00:01:52.880> went

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120 
of these three top corners and I went

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.330 
of these three top corners and I went
ahead<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.630> use<00:01:53.870> different<00:01:54.560> colored<00:01:54.950> pencils

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
ahead and use different colored pencils

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.390 
ahead and use different colored pencils
so<00:01:55.850> that<00:01:56.030> we<00:01:56.150> can<00:01:56.530> keep<00:01:57.530> track<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.800> them<00:01:58.040> easier

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
so that we can keep track of them easier

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.460 
so that we can keep track of them easier
although<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.150> can<00:01:59.360> just<00:01:59.540> use<00:01:59.690> regular<00:01:59.960> pencil

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
although you can just use regular pencil

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.710 
although you can just use regular pencil
when<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.680> draw<00:02:00.860> yours<00:02:01.190> now<00:02:01.670> why<00:02:02.120> did<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.479> pick

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
when you draw yours now why did I pick

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.320 
when you draw yours now why did I pick
these<00:02:03.140> three<00:02:03.560> corners<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.909> fourth

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
these three corners and not this fourth

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
these three corners and not this fourth
corner<00:02:05.600> over<00:02:05.870> here

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
corner over here

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.350 
corner over here
well<00:02:06.860> that's<00:02:07.010> because<00:02:07.159> even<00:02:08.090> though<00:02:08.239> the

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
well that's because even though the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.029 
well that's because even though the
light<00:02:08.509> source<00:02:08.840> when<00:02:09.200> hitting<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.619> object

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
light source when hitting the object

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.309 
light source when hitting the object
will<00:02:10.220> cast<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.819> shadow<00:02:10.849> over<00:02:11.659> at<00:02:11.900> this<00:02:12.050> corner

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
will cast a shadow over at this corner

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.369 
will cast a shadow over at this corner
that<00:02:13.040> shadow<00:02:13.519> will<00:02:13.999> be<00:02:14.030> covered<00:02:14.959> up<00:02:15.079> by<00:02:15.109> the

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
that shadow will be covered up by the

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.110 
that shadow will be covered up by the
object<00:02:15.920> itself

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
object itself

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.479 
object itself
it's<00:02:17.239> only<00:02:17.690> these<00:02:17.930> three<00:02:18.319> outer<00:02:18.560> corners<00:02:19.069> here

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
it's only these three outer corners here

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.720 
it's only these three outer corners here
that<00:02:20.330> will<00:02:20.540> create<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:21.200> visible<00:02:21.860> shadow<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.459> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
that will create a visible shadow on the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.880 
that will create a visible shadow on the
ground<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.080> why<00:02:24.230> we<00:02:24.500> pick<00:02:24.709> these

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
ground and so that's why we pick these

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
ground and so that's why we pick these
three<00:02:25.220> corners<00:02:25.610> another<00:02:26.330> way<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.540> think<00:02:26.780> about

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
three corners another way to think about

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.740 
three corners another way to think about
it<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.349> that<00:02:27.709> these<00:02:28.519> three<00:02:28.970> corners<00:02:29.330> are<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
it is that these three corners are the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.570 
it is that these three corners are the
furthest<00:02:30.170> away<00:02:30.349> from<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.830> light<00:02:31.069> source<00:02:31.099> and

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
furthest away from the light source and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.309 
furthest away from the light source and
so<00:02:31.790> they<00:02:32.030> form<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.480> outer<00:02:32.659> edge<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
so they form the outer edge of the

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.830 
so they form the outer edge of the
object<00:02:33.769> which<00:02:34.459> in<00:02:34.670> turn<00:02:34.909> will<00:02:35.180> create<00:02:35.480> the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
object which in turn will create the

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.410 
object which in turn will create the
visible<00:02:36.230> shadow<00:02:36.530> all<00:02:37.400> right<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:37.790> now<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.060> know

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
visible shadow all right so now we know

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.300 
visible shadow all right so now we know
our<00:02:38.659> shadow<00:02:38.989> is<00:02:39.260> going<00:02:39.409> to<00:02:39.590> lie<00:02:39.709> somewhere<00:02:40.069> in

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
our shadow is going to lie somewhere in

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.339 
our shadow is going to lie somewhere in
this<00:02:40.670> vicinity<00:02:40.879> here<00:02:41.629> although<00:02:41.989> we<00:02:42.170> don't

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
this vicinity here although we don't

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.530 
this vicinity here although we don't
know<00:02:42.470> what<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.040> exact<00:02:43.519> shape<00:02:43.940> of<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.209> shadow

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
know what the exact shape of the shadow

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.559 
know what the exact shape of the shadow
is<00:02:44.840> going<00:02:45.230> to<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.250> find<00:02:46.489> that<00:02:46.670> out<00:02:46.849> we're

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
is going to be so to find that out we're

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.869 
is going to be so to find that out we're
going<00:02:47.750> to<00:02:47.900> take<00:02:48.170> our<00:02:48.470> shadow<00:02:48.980> vanishing<00:02:49.609> point

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
going to take our shadow vanishing point

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.990 
going to take our shadow vanishing point
and<00:02:50.060> draw<00:02:50.750> a<00:02:50.930> line<00:02:51.140> from<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.650> through<00:02:52.370> each<00:02:52.579> one

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
and draw a line from it through each one

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.680 
and draw a line from it through each one
of<00:02:53.239> these<00:02:53.569> three<00:02:54.140> lower<00:02:54.859> corners<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:56.299> notice

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
of these three lower corners so notice

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.420 
of these three lower corners so notice
that<00:02:56.720> each<00:02:57.140> one<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.530> these<00:02:57.620> lower<00:02:58.010> corner

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
that each one of these lower corner

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.660 
that each one of these lower corner
corresponds<00:02:59.180> to<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.390> higher<00:02:59.750> corner<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:01.430> we

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
corresponds to a higher corner that we

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.970 
corresponds to a higher corner that we
drew<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.090> line<00:03:02.329> through<00:03:02.390> earlier<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.290> I<00:03:03.739> went

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
drew a line through earlier and I went

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.580 
drew a line through earlier and I went
ahead<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.250> used<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.849> same<00:03:05.090> color<00:03:05.359> for<00:03:05.780> each

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
ahead and used the same color for each

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.670 
ahead and used the same color for each
respective<00:03:07.099> corners<00:03:07.810> all<00:03:08.810> right<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.319> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
respective corners all right so the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.220 
respective corners all right so the
point<00:03:09.950> where<00:03:10.400> these<00:03:10.670> lines<00:03:11.030> intersect<00:03:11.390> is

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
point where these lines intersect is

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.259 
point where these lines intersect is
going<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.950> be<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:14.239> coordinate<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> our<00:03:15.290> shadow

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
going to be the coordinate of our shadow

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.360 
going to be the coordinate of our shadow
so<00:03:17.269> now<00:03:17.480> all<00:03:17.780> you<00:03:17.900> have<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.140> do<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.530> connect

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
so now all you have to do is connect

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.699 
so now all you have to do is connect
these<00:03:20.060> points<00:03:20.599> together<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:21.260> form<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> shape

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
these points together to form the shape

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.849 
these points together to form the shape
of<00:03:22.130> our<00:03:22.280> shadow<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:24.079> now<00:03:24.230> let's<00:03:24.410> fill<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.739> in

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
of our shadow so now let's fill it in

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.569 
of our shadow so now let's fill it in
and<00:03:25.069> see<00:03:25.190> how<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.459> looks<00:03:26.650> all<00:03:27.650> right<00:03:27.859> so<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.220> just

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
and see how it looks all right so I just

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.259 
and see how it looks all right so I just
use<00:03:28.849> my<00:03:29.019> pen<00:03:30.019> here<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.680> shade<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.130> in<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:32.120> can

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
use my pen here to shade it in you can

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.319 
use my pen here to shade it in you can
also<00:03:32.450> use<00:03:32.780> a<00:03:33.049> marker<00:03:33.500> or<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.799> sharpie<00:03:34.400> or<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.819> pen

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
also use a marker or a sharpie or a pen

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.659 
also use a marker or a sharpie or a pen
or<00:03:35.480> just<00:03:35.690> your<00:03:35.780> regular<00:03:36.109> pencil<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:37.099> just

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:37.669 
or just your regular pencil I just

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.309 
or just your regular pencil I just
wanted<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:38.000> give<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.209> some<00:03:38.450> extra<00:03:38.599> contrast

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
wanted to give it some extra contrast

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.890 
wanted to give it some extra contrast
now<00:03:40.310> let's<00:03:40.579> give<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:40.819> some<00:03:40.940> more<00:03:41.299> dimension<00:03:41.450> by

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
now let's give it some more dimension by

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.619 
now let's give it some more dimension by
shading<00:03:42.349> in<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.590> cube<00:03:42.799> itself<00:03:43.239> since<00:03:44.239> the

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
shading in the cube itself since the

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.750 
shading in the cube itself since the
light<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:44.989> coming<00:03:45.470> this<00:03:45.709> way<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:46.340> side<00:03:46.549> of

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
light is coming this way this side of

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.369 
light is coming this way this side of
cube<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.120> going<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.389> be<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.599> shadow<00:03:47.810> so<00:03:48.079> we're

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
cube is going to be in shadow so we're

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:49.750 
cube is going to be in shadow so we're
going<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.530> use<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.889> darkest<00:03:49.220> tone<00:03:49.400> for<00:03:49.579> that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
going to use the darkest tone for that

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.869 
going to use the darkest tone for that
and<00:03:50.440> we'll<00:03:51.440> use<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.889> lighter<00:03:52.160> tone<00:03:52.459> for<00:03:52.730> this

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:52.879 
and we'll use a lighter tone for this

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:56.170 
and we'll use a lighter tone for this
side<00:03:53.120> over<00:03:53.419> here<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:55.489> lightest<00:03:55.819> tone<00:03:56.000> for

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
side over here and the lightest tone for

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.339 
side over here and the lightest tone for
the<00:03:56.299> top<00:03:58.510> all<00:03:59.510> right<00:03:59.690> so<00:03:59.870> that<00:04:00.019> looks<00:04:00.139> pretty

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
the top all right so that looks pretty

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.990 
the top all right so that looks pretty
good<00:04:00.470> but<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.069> real<00:04:01.280> magic<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.879> this

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
good but the real magic to this

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.699 
good but the real magic to this
technique<00:04:02.480> is<00:04:02.720> when<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:02.989> can<00:04:03.139> actually<00:04:03.349> add<00:04:03.680> a

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
technique is when you can actually add a

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.000 
technique is when you can actually add a
shadow<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.760> a<00:04:04.790> second<00:04:05.510> object<00:04:05.660> using<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.799> same

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
shadow to a second object using the same

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.069 
shadow to a second object using the same
light<00:04:07.280> source<00:04:07.549> and<00:04:07.819> that's<00:04:08.419> going<00:04:08.660> to<00:04:08.720> give

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
light source and that's going to give

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.259 
light source and that's going to give
you<00:04:09.199> a<00:04:09.230> very<00:04:09.560> nice<00:04:09.799> cohesive<00:04:10.430> look<00:04:10.579> so<00:04:11.060> let's

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
you a very nice cohesive look so let's

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.909 
you a very nice cohesive look so let's
do<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:11.540> same<00:04:11.690> thing<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.230> this<00:04:12.410> house<00:04:12.680> right

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
do the same thing to this house right

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.860 
do the same thing to this house right
here<00:04:12.980> and<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:14.000> will<00:04:14.120> also<00:04:14.209> give<00:04:14.389> me<00:04:14.690> an

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
here and that will also give me an

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.110 
here and that will also give me an
opportunity<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.680> show<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.190> how<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.519> add<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
opportunity to show you how to add a

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.140 
opportunity to show you how to add a
shadow<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:17.900> house<00:04:18.680> shape<00:04:19.010> object<00:04:19.489> all<00:04:19.970> right

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
shadow to a house shape object all right

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.640 
shadow to a house shape object all right
so<00:04:20.329> once<00:04:20.539> again<00:04:20.690> we're<00:04:21.049> going<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.289> be<00:04:21.410> drawing

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
so once again we're going to be drawing

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.700 
so once again we're going to be drawing
a<00:04:21.979> line<00:04:22.849> from<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.360> light<00:04:23.479> source<00:04:23.710> through

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
a line from the light source through

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.100 
a line from the light source through
each<00:04:24.949> one<00:04:25.340> of<00:04:25.400> these<00:04:25.729> three<00:04:26.060> corners<00:04:26.479> at<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
each one of these three corners at the

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.770 
each one of these three corners at the
top<00:04:27.440> of<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.740> object<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.880> only<00:04:29.150> difference<00:04:29.599> is

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
top of the object the only difference is

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.120 
top of the object the only difference is
that<00:04:29.840> now<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.289> we<00:04:30.590> have<00:04:30.770> this

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
that now that we have this

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.550 
that now that we have this
here<00:04:31.460> will<00:04:31.700> also<00:04:31.940> be<00:04:32.150> drawing<00:04:32.570> a<00:04:32.780> line<00:04:33.200> through

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
here will also be drawing a line through

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.150 
here will also be drawing a line through
the<00:04:33.800> peak<00:04:34.040> of<00:04:34.160> this<00:04:34.370> roof<00:04:34.580> as<00:04:34.760> well<00:04:36.100> now<00:04:37.100> the

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
the peak of this roof as well now the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.160 
the peak of this roof as well now the
next<00:04:37.580> thing<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:37.760> do<00:04:37.970> is<00:04:38.120> draw<00:04:38.480> a<00:04:38.510> straight<00:04:38.990> line

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
next thing to do is draw a straight line

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.440 
next thing to do is draw a straight line
from<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:39.590> shadow<00:04:39.950> vanishing<00:04:40.520> point<00:04:40.790> through

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
from the shadow vanishing point through

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.860 
from the shadow vanishing point through
this<00:04:41.870> point<00:04:42.260> here<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:43.520> point<00:04:43.880> here<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.360> this

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
this point here this point here and this

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.650 
this point here this point here and this
point<00:04:44.990> here<00:04:45.620> and<00:04:45.740> also<00:04:46.460> as<00:04:46.880> for<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.360> peak<00:04:47.540> of

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
point here and also as for the peak of

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.390 
point here and also as for the peak of
the<00:04:47.780> roof<00:04:47.930> we're<00:04:48.590> going<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:48.800> take<00:04:49.010> our<00:04:49.160> ruler

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
the roof we're going to take our ruler

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.890 
the roof we're going to take our ruler
and<00:04:49.760> draw<00:04:50.390> a<00:04:50.420> straight<00:04:50.570> line<00:04:51.050> from<00:04:51.830> that<00:04:52.130> peak

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
and draw a straight line from that peak

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.120 
and draw a straight line from that peak
straight<00:04:53.900> down<00:04:54.110> until<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.620> hit<00:04:54.800> the<00:04:54.860> bottom

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
straight down until you hit the bottom

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.010 
straight down until you hit the bottom
edge<00:04:55.490> of<00:04:55.790> this<00:04:55.970> house<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.510> that's<00:04:56.750> going<00:04:56.960> to

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
edge of this house and that's going to

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.620 
edge of this house and that's going to
be<00:04:57.140> our<00:04:57.350> fourth<00:04:57.740> point<00:04:58.010> and<00:04:58.370> we'll<00:04:59.060> also<00:04:59.330> be

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
be our fourth point and we'll also be

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.350 
be our fourth point and we'll also be
drawing<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.110> line<00:05:00.440> from<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.730> shadow<00:05:01.940> vanishing

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
drawing a line from the shadow vanishing

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.490 
drawing a line from the shadow vanishing
point<00:05:02.630> through<00:05:02.930> this<00:05:03.080> line<00:05:03.290> as<00:05:03.500> well<00:05:05.500> all

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
point through this line as well all

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.380 
point through this line as well all
right<00:05:06.680> so<00:05:06.890> it<00:05:07.010> can<00:05:07.160> get<00:05:07.280> pretty<00:05:07.580> messy<00:05:07.730> so<00:05:08.180> make

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
right so it can get pretty messy so make

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.560 
right so it can get pretty messy so make
sure<00:05:08.420> you're<00:05:09.080> careful<00:05:09.800> about<00:05:10.340> keeping<00:05:11.060> track

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
sure you're careful about keeping track

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.990 
sure you're careful about keeping track
of<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.870> lines<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.440> matching<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.400> up<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.760> the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
of the lines and matching it up to the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.870 
of the lines and matching it up to the
correct<00:05:14.390> corners<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.290> this<00:05:15.980> corner<00:05:16.370> matches

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
correct corners so this corner matches

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.030 
correct corners so this corner matches
up<00:05:17.060> with<00:05:17.210> this<00:05:17.420> corner<00:05:17.780> this<00:05:18.230> corner<00:05:18.290> matches

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
up with this corner this corner matches

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.010 
up with this corner this corner matches
up<00:05:19.190> with<00:05:19.310> this<00:05:19.460> corner<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:19.880> so<00:05:20.090> on<00:05:20.270> all<00:05:20.900> right

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
up with this corner and so on all right

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.750 
up with this corner and so on all right
so<00:05:21.170> now<00:05:21.320> let's<00:05:21.560> find<00:05:21.800> all<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.220> points<00:05:22.580> where

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
so now let's find all the points where

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.120 
so now let's find all the points where
those<00:05:23.090> lines<00:05:23.360> intersect<00:05:24.260> so<00:05:24.890> here's<00:05:25.220> one

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
those lines intersect so here's one

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:34.510 
those lines intersect so here's one
here's<00:05:28.130> one<00:05:28.250> here's<00:05:30.640> one<00:05:31.640> and<00:05:32.090> here's<00:05:33.520> another

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
here's one here's one and here's another

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.050 
here's one here's one and here's another
one<00:05:36.010> alright<00:05:37.010> so<00:05:37.070> now<00:05:37.370> let's<00:05:37.400> connect<00:05:37.910> these

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
one alright so now let's connect these

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.940 
one alright so now let's connect these
points<00:05:38.450> together<00:05:38.570> to<00:05:38.990> form<00:05:39.290> the<00:05:39.410> shape<00:05:39.440> of<00:05:39.800> our

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
points together to form the shape of our

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.430 
points together to form the shape of our
shadow<00:05:40.280> now<00:05:40.880> remember<00:05:41.390> to<00:05:41.540> refer<00:05:41.900> back<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.170> the

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
shadow now remember to refer back to the

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.350 
shadow now remember to refer back to the
object<00:05:42.860> if<00:05:42.980> you<00:05:43.100> have<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:43.520> in<00:05:43.760> order<00:05:44.090> to<00:05:44.210> make

what that looks like and now we can

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.190 
what that looks like and now we can
shade<00:06:01.670> in<00:06:01.850> the<00:06:02.030> house<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.450> same<00:06:02.600> way<00:06:02.810> we<00:06:02.990> did
