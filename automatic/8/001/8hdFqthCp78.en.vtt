00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.370
 My name is Manfred Lohr the last 40 years old come from Hesse 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.279
 Florian 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:16.359
 bizarre local time 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.359
 of 20 years worth of work as the car of 16 years 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.170
 my first 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.170
 but it is out of the question but as a very long time on a new project 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.140
 the second construction phase for a good colleague 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.360
 the third 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.880
 like turbo 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.930
 for later 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.930
 Pensions Gaal his team 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.660
 the laureate did not turn on primarily gullwing doors 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.750
 and who just four points as the first line for children 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.760
 Sliding doors 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.970
 and around 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.680
 Highlight on stainless steel 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.200
 Mr. Blanc OMG 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.480
 is just unique 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.890
 and I'm in a very nice cut so we should not 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.030
 shine 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.369
 Percent should be percents so scribbled by Merz 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.240
 9 1 percent of those who drive this strict line just drive this 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.330
 that's just 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.330
 I've seen said century 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 Well 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 Well 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.460
 So who's a chauvinist for the film for my first movie? 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.359
 I have determined five years 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.890
 yes Konan every 15 years old boss already five years effective 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.159
 screwed a lot 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.589
 to whom stainless steel one can very much 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.309
 strike fast and it hurts and bleeds too 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.579
 and there is a lot more blood I would say 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.310
 if you have a car on one side 16 years now it still has a flaw 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.089
 back left on the sidewall and scratches 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:34.659
 and the injured Marcel so if I'm in the next few percent 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:40.839
 six months away I had to buy Mennel's new sidewall 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:43.839
 oecd countries 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:49.019
 there's the sidewall I've bought from around the ando in and out 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.239
 England reworked again through new grounded with Diallo swapped 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.829
 they are yours for him 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.129
 yes two years 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.799
 I want to give up here 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.989
 the special about the car is processes Biturbo 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.419
 percent 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.529
 The air scoops the air in the side boxes 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 since it is cooler in Ladeburg he already installed 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.489
 then charging air cooler over gate or Victor forcibly married 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.489
 that means percent in the air 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.259
 Combustion chamber and thus more torque and more power 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.749
 and the engine Co UK 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:42.969
 not run seven years so I have to be very careful Potsdam 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.519
 Check with more engine rinses and percent fuel system 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.399
 Bring one percent to life 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.549
 yes for me as a percentage Psalter automotive mechanic 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.439
 Wismar and Keys try to turn him often, but he starts 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.859
 most of the time, a remake is trivial 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.249
 Petrol pump releast broken or gasoline pump or old fuel or 

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:09.379
 Specialist currently in all possible parts 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.329
 and then process is already percent again 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.729
 Ahlert a I guess percentages over the Old Town 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.969
 now wants something increased 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.969
 No 

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:30.059
 Well 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.029
 2 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:41.809
 Nonetheless, the previous year is heard so quickly from the literature thus 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:45.870
 Does he go with banana peels and chocolate so soon come so far 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.229
 the router is 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.229
 designed as a car and not necessarily as an 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.659
 Movie highlight 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.719
 well known the movie is waiting for car of course made famous though i do 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.479
 I think he is right as the city every planned as folding doors 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.680
 Dismantling to the people that he 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.850
 also independently insert what would have become without the 4 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.690
 like Timo on more gas station you have to refuel at nine times now yes 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.089
 not like in the movie 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:24.359
 in front of an old one across the through colorful 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.699
 I was just about to start driving and I was on my knees in almost all of them 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.950
 but it was thank goodness that you I got out 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.530
 Airport you write off with my way 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.830
 So Christians means a baby because there are no children so it has my baby 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.360
 it opens the garage and then, although the burglar was on my face 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.129
 although I am very very very 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.869
 in Â«The devil is
