00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hi, guys. How are you? 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.429
 video 50 facts about Switzerland I commented 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:14.280
 there one of the ducks that here in Switzerland is the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.760
 Swiss only is little the Swiss have home 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.830
 itself is the land of rent and there 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.369
 some people signed up for me 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:29.070
 ask for clown but you win so well 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.160
 there because people do not buy a 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.829
 own house things like that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.579
 I came here today and show a little 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 my village where I live and okay 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.590
 commenting with you how it is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.550
 How would it be to build a property 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:51.360
 here in Switzerland and with that clarified 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.379
 why is it that few Swiss have a home 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.969
 own majority pay rent is I live 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.559
 here in a village in the town that is a 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.280
 paradise here I'm practically live 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.340
 millionaires 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:14.310
 the houses here the ship line where I live 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:17.189
 is a case of FRF 23 million and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.530
 any simple property there I think that as 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.460
 the cheaper property there that you 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.009
 I could buy maybe the 700 thousand 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.650
 you could buy a 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.740
 apartment had the highest values 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 low 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.850
 When I tell people people 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.689
 Ask me where you live here where 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.820
 I work there everything I said I live and in 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.399
 such a place there people are 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:53.909
 eyes do not even think about it soon enough 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:56.270
 My husband must be a millionaire and in the 6 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.600
 does not know anything 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:06.439
 I do not speak but I live in the favela 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:09.590
 him of it here is my pain I live there 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.039
 in the midst of the rich in a 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.430
 small apartment 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.810
 still has left and not with the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.540
 old apartments common a house like 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.099
 This one for example costs there for a 3 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.459
 million francs with the brush and I live 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.230
 here you are seeing beans for the goal on 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.390
 shanty town 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.730
 here is a beautiful place and here when 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.430
 the day is clear if the impasse here gives 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.700
 for you to see all the mountains there in the 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.109
 background does not approach fifth what I 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.450
 I'll talk 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.370
 the bureaucracy that is to be built 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.519
 here Switzerland will be built here in 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.280
 first you have to have 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.220
 already the project you bought a land 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.000
 bought the land you go in the city hall 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.189
 and will submit it for approval and ask 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.739
 building permit 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:11.400
 This is the first step there, the second 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:14.220
 step is that your neighbors have to 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.940
 accept you as a neighbor and your 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.769
 construction is who comes here in the 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.459
 Switzerland or who lives here in Switzerland at 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.769
 Iron stakes are high. 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.290
 and everything before you build you have 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.209
 do a prototype of the construction 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:37.769
 in that place is speech showing to the height 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.760
 small dimension and if someone is not 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.810
 according 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.819
 You're not going to question that work for 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.949
 example if you will be building 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.549
 taller than my house will do 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:53.639
 shadow in my house or if it will cover 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.370
 my view is I build this house 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.250
 right here because that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.349
 sight of you in front of me builds 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.209
 a higher section to cover my 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.299
 sight right 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.930
 then the neighbors have to question 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:13.229
 and seizing this work knows future 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.610
 construction and so on goes here 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.250
 in my village 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.140
 even has a work and is already guessing 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.750
 than in the last resort because the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.320
 they did not attach 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:29.370
 want that building is fighting 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.870
 in justice there is something else here 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.630
 defined concrete rules that greatly 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:41.100
 construction costs and the price of 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:45.350
 here is expensive because it has 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.450
 to be strictly complied with all 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.730
 demands is that neither in Brazil nor in 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:53.160
 Could you buy some soil from you? 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.050
 joint family over the weekend and lexie 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.940
 weekend and raise your three 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.250
 rooms the way you have to 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.340
 you want to understand how well 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.640
 in having a project without having plants in 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.460
 which is absolutely nothing at times until a 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.419
 vase invading the neighbor's plot 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.490
 then cobbled area of the city 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:18.120
 tax evasion there and you wet the 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.950
 and then the work goes on and on. 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.000
 then it is a problem to get the 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:27.270
 bits ii and more is done the way it is 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.020
 Anyway, in Brazil, there's no need to 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.050
 first the city hall gave you 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.160
 to only if you are not is inside 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.710
 of some protection area respecting the 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:45.030
 percentage is daily green that has to 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.950
 ending the region in the city there 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.470
 set of parameters and then the 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:55.229
 safety parameters and the 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.830
 construction abnormalities here than by 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:03.060
 example it has to be strictly 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:05.610
 not to lose energy is and will be 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.020
 extremely isolated because of the 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:13.830
 winter and all that but then construction 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.650
 here in Switzerland is very expensive and something else 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.450
 and you can even get a mortgage 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:22.169
 for example a Swiss, he can achieve 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:23.970
 a mortgage, because based on the background 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.190
 his pension the pension fund would be 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.500
 as a guarantee fund 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.860
 nor my husband has been working for 40 years 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:34.460
 when not 35 years for example 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.110
 he has an excellent pension fund to 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.060
 mortgage the bank will lend the 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.190
 Of course money will be 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.980
 based on the kilogram there because if 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.890
 can pay he has and travel something else 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:50.700
 that debt does not die with the subject 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:53.610
 then it is interesting to the potecas 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.860
 family with children because later 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.690
 children will continue to pay for this 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.180
 hypothetical will continue to pay this 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.500
 and will take possession of the 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.480
 property 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.940
 then one of the difficulties here much 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.780
 great if you have property itself is the cost 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:13.350
 construction price and the fact that 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:16.950
 debt longevity is also an important 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:19.140
 very difficult and mobile thing that 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.000
 It is not for anyone here wins 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.700
 very well but only here the Swiss 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.430
 prioritize a lot of quality of life vacations 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.140
 everything they want and they invest little in 

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.790
 own property 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.070
 That's what I hope you guys are. 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.600
 I like to see my life and to know how 

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:38.030
 and live here 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.030
 A kiss to everyone and until the next video
