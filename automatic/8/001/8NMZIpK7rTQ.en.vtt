hi<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:00.709> you<00:00:01.709> might<00:00:01.890> remember<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.280> while<00:00:02.520> back

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hi guys you might remember a while back

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.830 
hi guys you might remember a while back
I<00:00:03.179> made<00:00:03.300> this<00:00:03.840> glider<00:00:05.120> from<00:00:06.560> styrofoam<00:00:07.560> plates

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
I made this glider from styrofoam plates

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.650 
I made this glider from styrofoam plates
and<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.900> had<00:00:10.050> several<00:00:10.320> suggestions<00:00:10.830> about

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
and I had several suggestions about

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.370 
and I had several suggestions about
putting<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.719> motor<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.170> it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
putting a motor on it

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.710 
putting a motor on it
and<00:00:14.000> I<00:00:15.000> did<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.809> used<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.740> my

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
and I did have a go I used one of my

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.490 
and I did have a go I used one of my
vibrating<00:00:18.720> tooth<00:00:18.900> brush<00:00:19.500> motors<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
vibrating tooth brush motors and a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.859 
vibrating tooth brush motors and a
propeller<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.740> I'd<00:00:22.859> bought<00:00:23.189> off<00:00:23.400> eBay<00:00:23.869> but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
propeller that I'd bought off eBay but

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.839 
propeller that I'd bought off eBay but
the<00:00:24.990> propeller<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.500> much<00:00:25.710> too<00:00:25.980> big<00:00:26.250> for<00:00:26.699> that

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the propeller is much too big for that

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.700 
the propeller is much too big for that
motor<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:28.130> it<00:00:29.150> struggled<00:00:30.150> or<00:00:30.420> basically<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
motor and it struggled or basically it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.139 
motor and it struggled or basically it
did<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:31.980> power<00:00:32.489> dive<00:00:33.180> rather<00:00:33.809> than<00:00:34.110> flying<00:00:35.149> well

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
did a power dive rather than flying well

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.869 
did a power dive rather than flying well
a<00:00:36.420> while<00:00:37.050> back<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.620> actually<00:00:37.860> ordered<00:00:38.250> some

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a while back I actually ordered some

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
a while back I actually ordered some
cheap<00:00:39.840> motors<00:00:40.379> from<00:00:41.250> ebay<00:00:41.700> from<00:00:42.180> China<00:00:42.590> and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
cheap motors from ebay from China and

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.779 
cheap motors from ebay from China and
they've<00:00:43.739> arrived<00:00:44.010> today<00:00:46.250> what<00:00:47.250> caught<00:00:47.579> my<00:00:47.760> eye

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
they've arrived today what caught my eye

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.580 
they've arrived today what caught my eye
was<00:00:48.210> they<00:00:48.420> actually<00:00:48.539> came<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.730> propellers

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
was they actually came with propellers

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.889 
was they actually came with propellers
so<00:00:52.590> hopefully<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.910> matched<00:00:54.239> propellers

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so hopefully they are matched propellers

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.319 
so hopefully they are matched propellers
for<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.620> motors<00:00:55.949> they're<00:00:56.699> slightly<00:00:56.969> bigger

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
for the motors they're slightly bigger

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.170 
for the motors they're slightly bigger
motors<00:00:57.780> anyway<00:00:58.609> than<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> ones<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.090> I've

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
motors anyway than the ones that I've

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.500 
motors anyway than the ones that I've
got<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:00.719> should<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:01.050> more<00:01:01.230> powerful<00:01:02.510> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
got so they should be more powerful so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.130 
got so they should be more powerful so
I'm<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> take<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.710> motor<00:01:04.979> off<00:01:06.140> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
I'm going to take this motor off and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.990 
I'm going to take this motor off and
mount<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.770> these<00:01:07.920> motors<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.670> I'll<00:01:08.790> mount

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
mount one of these motors but I'll mount

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.920 
mount one of these motors but I'll mount
at<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.270> back<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.380> pusher<00:01:11.570> because<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.659> had<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
at the back as a pusher because I had to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.359 
at the back as a pusher because I had to
add<00:01:13.020> lots<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> weight<00:01:13.560> at<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.070> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
add lots of weight at the back to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.450 
add lots of weight at the back to
balance<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.909> propeller<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> front

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
balance out that propeller on the front

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.820 
balance out that propeller on the front
so<00:01:17.540> we'll<00:01:18.540> try<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.229> see<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.650> we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so we'll try it at the back see if we

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.649 
so we'll try it at the back see if we
can<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.820> without<00:01:20.939> having<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.390> add<00:01:21.479> any

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
can do it without having to add any

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.219 
can do it without having to add any
extra<00:01:21.689> weight<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.030> run<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.150> from<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.570> super

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
extra weight and run it from this super

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.330 
extra weight and run it from this super
capacitor<00:01:25.860> which<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.960> 2<00:01:27.960> point<00:01:28.259> 7<00:01:28.590> volts<00:01:28.979> 5

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
capacitor which is 2 point 7 volts 5

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.859 
capacitor which is 2 point 7 volts 5
farad's<00:01:30.439> so<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.590> what<00:01:31.740> I'll<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:31.979> I'll

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
farad's so that's what I'll do I'll

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.749 
farad's so that's what I'll do I'll
stick<00:01:33.869> one<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.110> these<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> back<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.920> see

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
stick one of these on the back and see

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.560 
stick one of these on the back and see
if<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> fly<00:01:36.650> there<00:01:37.650> we<00:01:37.770> are<00:01:38.570> in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
if we can get it to fly there we are in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.560 
if we can get it to fly there we are in
position<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.950> we've<00:01:41.159> got<00:01:41.280> our<00:01:41.460> on/off<00:01:42.210> switch

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
position so we've got our on/off switch

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.870 
position so we've got our on/off switch
super<00:01:43.409> capacitor<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.600> motor<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:46.159> just<00:01:47.159> tried

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
super capacitor and motor I just tried

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380 
super capacitor and motor I just tried
it<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.329> bedroom<00:01:48.570> there<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.790> it<00:01:50.790> shot<00:01:51.360> off

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it in the bedroom there and it shot off

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.069 
it in the bedroom there and it shot off
in<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.899> vertical<00:01:52.259> climb<00:01:53.240> so<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.479> bit<00:01:54.659> worried

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
in a vertical climb so I'm a bit worried

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.300 
in a vertical climb so I'm a bit worried
it<00:01:55.200> may<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.530> too<00:01:55.590> far<00:01:57.619> not<00:01:58.619> quite<00:01:58.920> sure<00:01:58.950> where

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it may go too far not quite sure where

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.730 
it may go too far not quite sure where
to<00:01:59.340> go<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.640> test<00:01:59.850> fly<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.240> night<00:02:00.740> certainly

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to go and test fly at night certainly

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.380 
to go and test fly at night certainly
makes<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.070> difference<00:02:02.460> having<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.790> decent<00:02:02.969> motor

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
makes a difference having a decent motor

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.080 
makes a difference having a decent motor
on<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.899> those<00:02:04.439> toothbrush<00:02:05.219> motors<00:02:05.640> really

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
on there those toothbrush motors really

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.029 
on there those toothbrush motors really
don't<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.390> any<00:02:06.570> power<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:07.770> sort

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
don't have any power not for this sort

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.839 
don't have any power not for this sort
of<00:02:08.069> application<00:02:10.340> although<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.370> haven't<00:02:11.640> tried

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
of application although I haven't tried

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.570 
of application although I haven't tried
it<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.300> right<00:02:12.420> sized<00:02:12.840> propeller

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
it with the right sized propeller

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.650 
it with the right sized propeller
that<00:02:14.580> might<00:02:14.760> be<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> next<00:02:15.090> thing<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.540> do

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
that might be the next thing to do

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.540 
that might be the next thing to do
anyway<00:02:16.319> we'll<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> go<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.130> test<00:02:17.340> fly

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
anyway we'll have to go and test fly

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.160 
anyway we'll have to go and test fly
this<00:02:17.610> somewhere<00:02:18.180> I'm<00:02:18.390> just<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.660> bit<00:02:18.780> worried<00:02:19.080> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
this somewhere I'm just a bit worried it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.680 
this somewhere I'm just a bit worried it
may<00:02:19.290> fly<00:02:19.560> off<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.100> I<00:02:20.459> won't<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.270> able<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.420> find

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
may fly off and I won't be able to find

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.020 
may fly off and I won't be able to find
it<00:02:21.840> again<00:02:22.220> okay<00:02:23.220> guys<00:02:23.459> we're<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.300> park

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
it again okay guys we're in the park

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:41.520 
it again okay guys we're in the park
so<00:02:27.030> I'll<00:02:27.180> charge<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.750> up

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:51.260 

give<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.190> about<00:02:42.280> 30<00:02:42.670> seconds<00:02:44.640> 1<00:02:45.640> 2<00:02:46.360> 3<00:02:47.170> 4<00:02:48.040> 5<00:02:48.850> 6<00:02:49.660> 7<00:02:50.440> 8

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
give it about 30 seconds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:03.600 
give it about 30 seconds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:02:52.270> 10<00:02:53.170> 11<00:02:54.010> 12<00:02:54.720> 13<00:02:55.770> 14<00:02:57.090> 15<00:02:58.090> 16<00:02:59.700> 18<00:03:00.700> 19<00:03:01.980> 21<00:03:02.980> 20

9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 21 20

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.170 
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18 19 21 20
seconds<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.090> reckon<00:03:06.060> again

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:04:59.140 

see<00:03:11.900> what<00:03:12.019> happens

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.210 

right<00:04:59.870> guys<00:05:00.020> I<00:05:00.410> think<00:05:00.440> that's<00:05:00.710> enough<00:05:00.919> test

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
right guys I think that's enough test

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.310 
right guys I think that's enough test
flight<00:05:01.550> just<00:05:02.449> had<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.750> go<00:05:02.870> over<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.139> my

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
flight just had to go over to my

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.580 
flight just had to go over to my
neighbors<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:04.070> ask<00:05:05.000> for<00:05:05.389> my<00:05:05.510> toy<00:05:05.810> plane<00:05:06.229> back

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590

neighbors and ask for my toy plane back
which<00:05:07.070> is<00:05:07.220> always<00:05:07.370> a<00:05:07.490> bit<00:05:07.639> embarrassing

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
which is always a bit embarrassing

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.930 
which is always a bit embarrassing
because<00:05:09.350> once<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.919> stopped<00:05:10.220> it<00:05:10.370> going<00:05:10.580> in<00:05:10.699> quite

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
because once I stopped it going in quite

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.790 
because once I stopped it going in quite
such<00:05:11.210> tight<00:05:11.570> sir<00:05:11.870> of<00:05:12.020> course<00:05:12.229> it<00:05:12.380> decided<00:05:12.680> to

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
such tight sir of course it decided to

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.629 
such tight sir of course it decided to
go<00:05:12.860> straight<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.590> straight<00:05:16.130> over<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.430> fence

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
go straight so straight over the fence

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.310 
go straight so straight over the fence
to<00:05:16.790> next<00:05:17.150> door<00:05:17.360> anyway

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
to next door anyway

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.060 
to next door anyway
seems<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.770> work<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:20.870> very<00:05:21.199> sensitive<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.949> the

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
seems to work it's very sensitive to the

seems to work it's very sensitive to the
trimming<00:05:22.370> I've<00:05:22.699> been<00:05:22.910> using<00:05:23.150> this<00:05:23.449> big

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
trimming I've been using this big

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.990 
trimming I've been using this big
paperclip<00:05:25.100> moving<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.520> backwards<00:05:25.699> and

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
paperclip moving it backwards and

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.950 
paperclip moving it backwards and
forwards<00:05:26.389> to<00:05:26.449> adjust<00:05:26.870> the<00:05:27.139> center<00:05:27.650> of<00:05:27.710> gravity

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
forwards to adjust the center of gravity

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.310 
forwards to adjust the center of gravity
but<00:05:29.960> other<00:05:30.139> than<00:05:30.290> that<00:05:30.500> it<00:05:30.949> works<00:05:31.220> so<00:05:32.320> that's

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
but other than that it works so that's

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.310 
but other than that it works so that's
the<00:05:33.680> motor<00:05:34.669> and<00:05:35.030> propeller<00:05:35.180> from<00:05:36.110> ebay<00:05:36.860> China

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
the motor and propeller from ebay China

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.370 
the motor and propeller from ebay China
I'll<00:05:39.320> put<00:05:39.530> a<00:05:39.560> link<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:40.010> where<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.220> got<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.490> from

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
I'll put a link to where I got it from

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.140 
I'll put a link to where I got it from
super<00:05:42.380> capacitor<00:05:43.330> on/off<00:05:44.330> switch<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:46.150> two

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
super capacitor on/off switch and two

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.890 
super capacitor on/off switch and two
double-a<00:05:47.690> batteries<00:05:48.260> in<00:05:48.470> there<00:05:49.449> to<00:05:50.449> charge<00:05:50.750> it

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
double-a batteries in there to charge it

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.050 
double-a batteries in there to charge it
up<00:05:50.960> with<00:05:51.260> so<00:05:51.889> I'm<00:05:51.949> charging<00:05:52.490> it<00:05:52.669> with<00:05:52.699> about

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
up with so I'm charging it with about

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.360 
up with so I'm charging it with about
three<00:05:53.539> volts<00:05:53.960> it's<00:05:54.500> a<00:05:54.620> two<00:05:54.800> point<00:05:54.949> seven<00:05:55.340> volt

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
three volts it's a two point seven volt

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.820 
three volts it's a two point seven volt
capacitor<00:05:56.330> so<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.110> should<00:05:57.440> be<00:05:57.560> fully

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
capacitor so that should be fully

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.040 
capacitor so that should be fully
charging<00:05:58.340> it<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:58.760> it<00:05:59.240> lasts<00:05:59.630> for<00:05:59.690> a<00:05:59.840> few

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
charging it and it lasts for a few

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.570 
charging it and it lasts for a few
seconds<00:06:00.530> which<00:06:00.650> is<00:06:00.680> enough<00:06:01.039> to<00:06:01.160> make<00:06:01.280> it<00:06:01.430> go

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
seconds which is enough to make it go

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.719 
seconds which is enough to make it go
round<00:06:01.729> and<00:06:01.940> round<00:06:02.000> in<00:06:02.270> the<00:06:02.389> garden<00:06:02.919> so<00:06:03.919> I<00:06:04.250> think

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
round and round in the garden so I think

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:08.860 
round and round in the garden so I think
that's<00:06:05.000> a<00:06:05.090> success<00:06:05.510> I<00:06:07.270> could<00:06:08.270> spend<00:06:08.510> a<00:06:08.630> lot

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
that's a success I could spend a lot

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.659 
that's a success I could spend a lot
more<00:06:08.900> time<00:06:09.110> getting<00:06:09.620> the<00:06:09.770> trimming<00:06:10.130> exactly

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:10.669 
more time getting the trimming exactly

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.219 
more time getting the trimming exactly
right<00:06:10.820> but<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.240> don't<00:06:11.450> think<00:06:11.539> I'll<00:06:11.720> worry<00:06:11.960> about

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
right but I don't think I'll worry about

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.500 
right but I don't think I'll worry about
it
