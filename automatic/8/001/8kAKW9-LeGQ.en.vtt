00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.369
 in the first person in so mode 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.019
 expected that for me it has been brutal 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.609
 I have to say I have to give the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.960
 thanks to my friend a thousand tricks that has 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.059
 left the video because I'm having 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.010
 problems with the broad gt and four 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.380
 I do not get downloaded if they have downloaded 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.329
 but I'm not even in campaign mode 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.190
 and could play a little but afterwards 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.750
 He has not let me come back in and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.340
 that well managed this gameplay are worth 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 guys that you see so first person 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.149
 I'm going to teach to make him look good 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.980
 As you can see, I'm going to take the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.629
 car and we're going to drive a little bit 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.100
 is delighted that I have to say that the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.050
 First person mode for me has been 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 brutal is what was lacking in this 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.789
 I play and as you can see I had left 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.100
 flipping inside the car the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.229
 panels are seen on the markers are 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.310
 move the needle of the rpm and the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.930
 speed is worth to me not 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.420
 delighted when I've seen it I did not 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.970
 I was expecting this simple detail but 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.430
 that is pretty pretty handsome and now 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.810
 you're going to see guys that under the car and 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.820
 good as I have to tell you that we're going 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.189
 to try the new weapon I'm going to take the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.740
 ax and how is it seen at maximum 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.899
 quality is worth it we have recorded it to maximum 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.429
 quality and rendering just like the 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.409
 guys listen to the noise they make 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.659
 when we kill someone is stealing 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.909
 I have to tell you it's a bit sadistic but 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.890
 I loved it as you see splashes a 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.990
 heap blood the blood on the way 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.030
 of splashing and the most the spots and 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.610
 all that looks a lot better than in 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.470
 play 3 and xbox and as you see then also 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.590
 you see in the graphics and all that is 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.030
 spectacular the colors the brightness I have 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.610
 have to say that rockstar has done very 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.369
 good job and good guys good I'm 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.899
 here following killing people and I have 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.929
 What to say, guys, if you were playing 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.039
 much in play 3 and xbox 360 in gta iv 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.849
 you have some new console 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.979
 generation 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:06.610
 I recommend a lot, I recommend 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.470
 much this game is worth if you were not already 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.069
 tired and all that obviously not what 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.069
 I recommend 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.970
 the glitters and all that looks super super 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.430
 handsome I do not know I liked it very much 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.350
 I think that is what Gta 5 was missing 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.270
 to be a square because all the 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.130
 people were looking for the first person 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.830
 I was going to run over that as you can see 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.030
 you see quite well enough and now you will see 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.130
 that I get inside the police car 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.560
 and also has the interior made to the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.480
 radio and all that markers 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.520
 I will try during the day we go up 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.680
 More little things you already know that I'm not going to 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.170
 game is worth it if not then a thousand tricks between 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.790
 me and leave some video I appreciate it 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.010
 very much way to see if you can record me 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.570
 some things I will upload the ones that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.850
 I want to go up a lot of things 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.860
 ok now you are going to see that walcott returned 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.410
 the car as you see by the crystals and 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.490
 the pieces and all that comes out 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.890
 shot the car and it looks a lot 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.960
 better and I will try to make videos 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.340
 also of the fauna is worth of all 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.800
 animals and all that there is that there 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.150
 very many and nothing more guys now you go 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.710
 to see what I just messed up with 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.790
 policeman who has the grenades of 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.160
 first person that I liked 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.960
 very much that of removing the ring and 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.430
 throw the grenade as you see and nothing else 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.230

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.620
