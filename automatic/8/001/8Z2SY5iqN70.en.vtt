you can find in the PS Vita one thing I

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.970 
you can find in the PS Vita one thing I
think<00:00:27.390> people<00:00:27.779> are<00:00:27.869> missing<00:00:28.080> out<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.769> new

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
think people are missing out on this new

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
think people are missing out on this new
iPad<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.849> could<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.539> same

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
iPad is that this could be the same

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.749 
iPad is that this could be the same
specs<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> we<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> iphone<00:00:32.430> 5

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
specs that we see in the iphone 5

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
specs that we see in the iphone 5
because<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> iphone<00:00:33.719> 4s<00:00:34.110> had<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> exact<00:00:34.770> same

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
because the iphone 4s had the exact same

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.740 
because the iphone 4s had the exact same
specs<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.489> saw<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> ipad<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
specs that we saw in the ipad to the

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.479 
specs that we saw in the ipad to the
iphone<00:00:37.110> 4<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> same<00:00:38.010> space<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
iphone 4 at the same space and the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.479 
iphone 4 at the same space and the
original<00:00:38.670> ipad<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.780> go<00:00:39.960> along<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.860> cycle

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
original ipad so we go along this cycle

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.150 
original ipad so we go along this cycle
um<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:42.270> looks<00:00:42.329> like<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> iphone<00:00:43.410> 5<00:00:43.649> could<00:00:44.010> have

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
um it looks like the iphone 5 could have

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
um it looks like the iphone 5 could have
the<00:00:44.309> same<00:00:44.579> specs<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.329> new<00:00:45.809> ipad<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the same specs as the new ipad but the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
the same specs as the new ipad but the
question<00:00:46.770> is<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.789> solve<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> same<00:00:48.480> spec

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
question is if we solve the same spec

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.750 
question is if we solve the same spec
that<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.469> new<00:00:49.680> ipad<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.399> an

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
that we see in this new ipad in an

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.060 
that we see in this new ipad in an
iphone<00:00:51.149> 5<00:00:51.420> would<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.960> still<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.289> happy<00:00:52.620> person

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
iphone 5 would you still be happy person

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.229 
iphone 5 would you still be happy person
i<00:00:53.100> would<00:00:53.250> rather<00:00:53.370> have<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> quad-core<00:00:53.969> graphics

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
i would rather have a quad-core graphics

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.020 
i would rather have a quad-core graphics
card<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> quad-core<00:00:55.559> cpu<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.579> i'm<00:00:56.760> good<00:00:57.000> on

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
card then a quad-core cpu so i'm good on

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.090 
card then a quad-core cpu so i'm good on
that<00:00:57.270> part<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:57.899> finally<00:00:58.199> added<00:00:58.230> 4g<00:00:58.770> LTE

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that part they finally added 4g LTE

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.729 
that part they finally added 4g LTE
either<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.640> verizon<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.359> AT&amp;T<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.289> i'm<00:01:01.469> good

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
either on verizon or AT&amp;T so i'm good

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.500 
either on verizon or AT&amp;T so i'm good
with<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.949> too<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.640> they<00:01:02.940> bumped<00:01:03.239> up<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.359> new

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
with that too and they bumped up the new

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
with that too and they bumped up the new
ipad<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> 2k<00:01:04.619> resolution<00:01:04.860> display<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:05.850> does

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
ipad to a 2k resolution display so does

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.030 
ipad to a 2k resolution display so does
that<00:01:06.240> mean<00:01:06.570> could<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.930> add<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> 720p

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
that mean could they add a 720p

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.429 
that mean could they add a 720p
resolution<00:01:08.850> displays<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> next<00:01:10.020> iPhone

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
resolution displays with the next iPhone

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.810 
resolution displays with the next iPhone
but<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.950> they're<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.580> that

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
but if they're going to do that that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.460 
but if they're going to do that that
means<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:12.090> have<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> bigger<00:01:12.990> screen

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
means they have to have a bigger screen

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
means they have to have a bigger screen
so<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.070> comes<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> point<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> think

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so that comes to the point what I think

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.210 
so that comes to the point what I think
the<00:01:15.720> next<00:01:16.049> iPhone<00:01:16.409> should<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.070> is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the next iPhone should have and that is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
the next iPhone should have and that is
a<00:01:17.250> bigger<00:01:17.640> screen<00:01:17.970> better<00:01:18.450> front-facing

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
a bigger screen better front-facing

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.840 
a bigger screen better front-facing
camera<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:19.950> now<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> iphone<00:01:20.549> 4s

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
camera because right now the iphone 4s

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
camera because right now the iphone 4s
has<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.180> killer<00:01:21.720> back<00:01:22.229> facing<00:01:22.650> cam<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
has a killer back facing cam for the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.370 
has a killer back facing cam for the
front-facing<00:01:23.610> camera<00:01:24.210> oh<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.080> bump

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
front-facing camera oh then you bump

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 
front-facing camera oh then you bump
that<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.650> 720p<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.970> slightly<00:01:27.390> different

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
that up to 720p and a slightly different

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.380 
that up to 720p and a slightly different
design<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.220> you're<00:01:29.369> an<00:01:29.400> Android<00:01:29.729> user<00:01:30.030> out

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
design so if you're an Android user out
