00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.149 
dark it also imparts just the tiniest
bit<00:02:01.399> of<00:02:01.790> mascara<00:02:02.060> onto<00:02:02.780> the

bit of mascara onto the
yes<00:02:03.310> this<00:02:04.030> is<00:02:04.210> good<00:02:04.390> for<00:02:04.539> a<00:02:04.600> numerous<00:02:05.020> reasons

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:05.609 
yes this is good for a numerous reasons

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.729 
yes this is good for a numerous reasons
then<00:02:06.609> because<00:02:07.479> it's<00:02:07.659> such<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.810> small<00:02:08.140> amount

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
then because it's such a small amount

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.490 
then because it's such a small amount
if<00:02:09.220> drives<00:02:09.640> almost<00:02:10.000> instantaneously<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:11.260> can

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
if drives almost instantaneously you can

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
if drives almost instantaneously you can
curl<00:02:11.860> your<00:02:11.890> lashes<00:02:12.250> again<00:02:12.580> with<00:02:12.910> this<00:02:13.030> tiny

bit of mascara this mascara will hold

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.990 
bit of mascara this mascara will hold
the<00:02:16.090> curl<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.500> really<00:02:17.950> curl<00:02:18.730> and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
the curl in and it can really curl and

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.210 
the curl in and it can really curl and
open<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.629> the<00:02:19.780> eye<00:02:19.810> which<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:20.830> we<00:02:20.920> want

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
once your curl is done you've curled

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.900 
once your curl is done you've curled
them<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.920> then<00:02:24.129> go<00:02:24.459> back<00:02:24.670> with<00:02:24.790> this

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
them you then go back with this

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.809 
them you then go back with this
technique<00:02:25.180> again<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.780> comb<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.830> through<00:02:26.890> you

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
technique again and comb it through you

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.300 
technique again and comb it through you
can<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.239> like<00:02:28.510> five<00:02:28.870> six<00:02:29.319> seven<00:02:29.769> applications

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
can do like five six seven applications

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.250 
can do like five six seven applications
of<00:02:30.489> this<00:02:30.700> if<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:31.000> want<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.330> -<00:02:31.840> three<00:02:32.080> is

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
of this if you want to - three is

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.320 
of this if you want to - three is
perfectly<00:02:32.680> fine<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.310> it<00:02:33.400> will<00:02:33.549> separate<00:02:34.090> them

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
perfectly fine and it will separate them

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.630 
perfectly fine and it will separate them
it<00:02:34.750> will<00:02:34.870> keep<00:02:35.110> them<00:02:35.290> cold<00:02:35.530> all<00:02:35.829> day<00:02:36.250> long<00:02:36.459> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it will keep them cold all day long and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.140 
it will keep them cold all day long and
they<00:02:36.819> are<00:02:36.849> going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> be<00:02:37.319> starburst<00:02:38.319> effect

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
they are going to be starburst effect

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.789 
they are going to be starburst effect
really<00:02:40.150> kind<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.510> beautiful<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.290> long<00:02:41.470> and

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
really kind of beautiful and long and

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.550 
really kind of beautiful and long and
separate<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:42.849> that's<00:02:43.090> enough<00:02:43.780> chatter<00:02:44.140> let's

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
separate so that's enough chatter let's

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.500 
separate so that's enough chatter let's

the lashes here once and you can see
that<00:02:51.190> I'm<00:02:51.280> starting<00:02:51.489> from<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.730> base<00:02:51.910> of<00:02:52.090> the

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
that I'm starting from the base of the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.509 
that I'm starting from the base of the
lash<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:52.510> basically<00:02:53.440> just<00:02:53.709> combing<00:02:54.099> it

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
lash and basically just combing it

through the mascara and you want to
start<00:02:58.180> right<00:02:58.390> at<00:02:58.510> the<00:02:58.599> base<00:02:58.720> because<00:02:59.079> in<00:02:59.500> an

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
start right at the base because in an

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.470 
start right at the base because in an
ideal<00:03:00.160> world<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.549> base<00:03:00.760> of<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.120> lash<00:03:01.239> would

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
ideal world the base of the lash would

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.619 
ideal world the base of the lash would
be<00:03:01.599> the<00:03:01.920> blackest<00:03:02.920> area<00:03:03.459> here<00:03:03.819> haven't<00:03:04.390> tight

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
lined or anything like that you can see

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.979 
lined or anything like that you can see
the<00:03:06.640> hairs<00:03:06.879> are<00:03:07.060> sort<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.299> going<00:03:07.480> through<00:03:07.599> the

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
the hairs are sort of going through the

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.960 
the hairs are sort of going through the
comb<00:03:08.200> but<00:03:08.950> at<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.220> same<00:03:09.400> time<00:03:09.609> there's<00:03:09.849> no

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
comb but at the same time there's no

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.420 
comb but at the same time there's no
clumping<00:03:10.269> it's<00:03:11.139> almost<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.739> coating<00:03:12.250> each

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
clumping it's almost like coating each

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.240 
clumping it's almost like coating each
and<00:03:12.790> every<00:03:13.049> eyelash<00:03:14.049> which<00:03:14.769> is<00:03:14.920> really<00:03:15.130> the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
and every eyelash which is really the

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.890 
and every eyelash which is really the
point<00:03:15.430> obviously<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.389> need<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.599> be<00:03:16.690> very

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
point obviously you need to be very

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.000 
point obviously you need to be very
careful<00:03:17.290> when<00:03:17.380> you're<00:03:17.470> doing<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.709> I'm<00:03:17.920> using

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
careful when you're doing this I'm using

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.099 
careful when you're doing this I'm using
my<00:03:18.280> left<00:03:18.459> hand<00:03:18.579> so<00:03:18.940> it's<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.090> bit<00:03:19.239> candid<00:03:19.870> here

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
my left hand so it's a bit candid here

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.650 
my left hand so it's a bit candid here
but<00:03:20.859> you<00:03:21.459> get<00:03:21.669> that<00:03:21.790> kind<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.120> gist<00:03:22.450> but

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
but you get that kind of gist but

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.599 
but you get that kind of gist but
obviously<00:03:23.230> because<00:03:23.530> this<00:03:23.859> is<00:03:24.010> metal<00:03:24.459> and

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
obviously because this is metal and

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.789 
obviously because this is metal and
these<00:03:24.700> are<00:03:24.880> metal<00:03:25.150> teeth<00:03:25.389> you<00:03:26.019> do<00:03:26.410> need<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.709> be

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
these are metal teeth you do need to be

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.789 
these are metal teeth you do need to be
careful<00:03:27.190> as<00:03:27.340> you<00:03:27.400> go<00:03:27.910> near<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> eye<00:03:28.989> and<00:03:29.440> as

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
careful as you go near the eye and as

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.289 
careful as you go near the eye and as
you<00:03:29.919> can<00:03:30.010> see<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.340> comb<00:03:30.609> here<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.180> it's

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
you can see the comb here and it's

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.629 
you can see the comb here and it's
pulling<00:03:31.630> up<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.900> can<00:03:32.049> see<00:03:32.290> as<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.220> just<00:03:33.430> said

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
pulling up you can see as I just said

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.490 
pulling up you can see as I just said
every<00:03:34.239> single<00:03:34.480> hair<00:03:34.840> looks<00:03:35.049> like<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:35.380> been

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
every single hair looks like it's been

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.589 
every single hair looks like it's been
coated<00:03:35.799> and<00:03:36.519> I'm<00:03:36.639> gonna<00:03:36.790> give<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.150> a<00:03:37.209> before

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
and after so you can kind of see that

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.059
