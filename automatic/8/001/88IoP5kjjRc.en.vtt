00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.219
 Now I'll show you a few tricks and 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:15.900
 hidden features of the app awards the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.609
 But watch offers many features and functions 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.560
 some of them are not immediately 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.570
 obvious and that's why I'll be you 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.130
 Now show a few of them 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.170
 Let's start with the ones up here 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.689
 notifications to her I see I have here 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
 some messages on my apple 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.449
 I can also watcher watch one by one 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.669
 Just drop it over here 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.410
 delete and tab on the delete however 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.500
 Of course that may be the case 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.000
 a bit exhausting and a lot of message 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.969
 if I touch a forest here now 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 I can delete all at once 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.700
 Now let's go to the other side and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 second from the bottom up 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
 there we come in the glems and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.129
 There is here 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.629
 this small panel can be found there 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.399
 can do some here 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.649
 activate flight mode do not disturb 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.270
 you can activate your apple watch 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.340
 to silence then only becomes 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.010
 vibrates and you can even down there 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.840
 Search for your iphone let's say her 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.060
 can not find your iphone then 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.740
 Let's touch it here and listen 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.619
 a ping and then you can 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.440
 look where the device is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.660
 there is only one ping per tab 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.880
 and he's pretty loud so if 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.160
 your iphone within reach is then 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.170
 will you find the part like that 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.670
 I'll turn the iphone around you can 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.260
 activate the flash here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.450
 just hold on and you'll see 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.820
 it sounds and the lightning is still too 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.980
 activated and it would not be there 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.840
 he has really misplaced place 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.100
 Let's get into the apps because there are still 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.600
 a possibility as it is here 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.530
 fast between different apps 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.360
 and can jump here 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.210
 I open here the setting sap 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.430
 then I go back and open 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.720
 then here the e-mail from and if 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.760
 I return to the settings 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.760
 I just want to give it twice 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.440
 digital crown serve twice 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.580
 click and I come the settings 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.560
 and when I come back twice on it 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.120
 clique I come back in the e-mails 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.610
 and so you can always go back and forth 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.160
 between the two last used apps 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.960
 jump the whole operate and open 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.820
 here the apps on the small screen 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.490
 may be something peaceful maybe 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.380
 especially if you have something bigger finger 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.870
 but maybe you can do it here too 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.260
 siri help because you can also with siri 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.420
 open apps 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:33.060
 open the settings and the whole 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.310
 has worked there are also the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.320
 possibility to take screenshots 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.390
 you simply have to use the digital crown 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.870
 and the button here at the side 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.440
 press simultaneously and then you see 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.090
 like the screen on flash 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.890
 how to actually get it from the iphone 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.660
 also knows and then you have the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.620
 screenshot made i still do it 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.450
 once and if I'm in here now 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.030
 my iphone go in 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.040
 then you will soon see that 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.340
 screenshot already right here 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.840
 is stored 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.100
 in the news we can also 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.810
 send images 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.150
 I go here and sometimes on the icon 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.790
 and there you see, we have that hand 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.019
 heart and the smiley and has a forest 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.910
 we can just paint here 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.680
 change the majlis I can from here 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.390
 go green on red if you go there 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040
 want to express something more that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.590
 whole is also here in the heart goes 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.750
 that then on blue or on violet or 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.000
 on red and at hand 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.530
 the whole thing does not work the hand 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.840
 is just always white but in the 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.930
 other two you can have in perforce 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.880
 just change the color and 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.590
 There is also heart on the apple watch 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.570
 if I have my e 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.490
 Open mails and I want my emails 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.470
 but like to continue on my iphone 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.600
 I can just read here for now 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.370
 iphone go unlock the whole and 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.110
 you can see this icon on the bottom of this page 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.150
 lockscreen if I go up now 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.930
 joke and of course also briefly 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.209
 unlocking 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.430
 then I am here in my e-mail app 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.400
 inside, where it can immediately continue 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.090
 Forest Touch is on the apple watch 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.500
 ubiquitous there is everywhere 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.250
 functions with it just once 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.360
 try out 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.950
 I think I still do not know 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.750
 but all discovered here in the music app 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.700
 For example, if I times by forest 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.160
 I have to go in first by 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.169
 forest has in the menu I can now 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.510
 example, select the source that is 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.410
 whether the music is saved by the apple 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.490
 Watch is played or downloaded from the iphone 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.919
 and we still have the possibility 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.660
 here to listen to her and then 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.000
 we can see the controls here directly 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.760
 We also have airplay here again 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.550
 and the random playback so forest 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.380
 really is pretty much everywhere 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.600
 Just try and see if something happens 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.270
 if you put something tighter on the display 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.490
 when the time is up to the next 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.650
 loading something is tight you can too 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.140
 here in the clans just click this one 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.580
 battery icon activate the power reserve 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.890
 then you will only have the time 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.780
 displayed and the apple watch keeps very much 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.669
 much longer than the normal one 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.800
 So you can also use that here 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.110
 manually activate in the shine 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.390
 and that were the people a few small ones 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.800
 tips and tricks for apple watch the man 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.510
 maybe not at first sight 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.280
