00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.330
 good morning I checked 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.009
 I would define it with 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.410
 step humbucker 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.389
 the main rules of Trieste 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.839
 we always use this purpose of shooting mechanisms 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.769
 are the songs of ciro more and more attention 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.320
 a little more complicated than the ones we've seen before 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.970
 we win announce 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.990
 the first company rule 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.000
 and the one that says that 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.910
 you have to eat the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.510
 number of pieces impress 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.510
 we think onassis use of this kind 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.190

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.110
 if not yes 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.110
 unicredit aprilia as mentioned your link egregious 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.480
 this move 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.730
 bette enterprise two pieces 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.820
 I have to eat this drama 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.510
 certainly with this first of May in Rome between the doors of Naples 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.230
 on purpose, 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.600
 onion taken with this date and here's what happens 1 2 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.180
 who are we paved the way 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.880
 cassata 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.929
 this is a very, very often situation 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.900
 we have another rule that if there are our rules for quality we 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.100
 come later 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 epson important printers 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.770
 supply 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.810
 a simplicissimus example 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.460
 the space of this type 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.900
 white wins by exploiting the rule that says that 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.070
 you have to eat with the highest quality 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.890
 then 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.980
 if by third parties 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.790
 white moves 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.890
 in this this request box then 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.790
 this move takes effect 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.580
 the black cannot eat with the pawn for those who are obliged to eat with the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.249

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.249
 libya august 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.009
 we miss you 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.489
 I suffer from love 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.669
 another one 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.389
 situation 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
 taken for this 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.449
 we end up threatening 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:38.900
 pretending this period is attacking we defend everything I want a 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.389
 son 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.729
 you look like first edition 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.289
 this move 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.759
 the truth cannot eat 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.059
 order for more than cat eat the apple 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:54.379
 where I eat the highest quality so I must eat the damage I eat 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.159
 and we do not eat 1 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.439
 yet 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.439
 an exercise 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.540
 sporting what is the most complicated of the rules taken up again 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.879
 don't look for sequence 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.879
 it remains so 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.959
 when 

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:33.839
 there is the possibility of eating 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.199
 different values 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:37.809
 it's equal quality 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.739
 care must be taken 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.099
 hdr 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.629
 what is the hold 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.569
 with which I eat first 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.609
 superior quality 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.909
 therefore, considering the same number of pieces, parity of quality is considered 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:57.119
 you have to eat bread where it comes first 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:00.119
 superior quality is an example of this 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:03.019
 the right move whatsoever 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.239
 the right move this 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.659
 strange 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.179
 always enough vinyl 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:14.099
 because the real certainly could eat a tissue is a lady 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.999
 and he would have no other percussion but he is obliged to eat 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.710
 a lady a pawn because this part 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.289
 die first 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:29.780
 then the black brigade make this one take 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.099
 he has composed 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099
 with you I will leave cum 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.970
 penis I have finished our excursus on the recovery rules that we always have to 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.689
 keep in mind 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.480
 because I'm stunned 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.560
 for the whole game, see you next time
