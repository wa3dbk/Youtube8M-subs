00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
legal briefs and legal memos and I think

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.179 
legal briefs and legal memos and I think
you<00:01:08.869> know<00:01:08.960> while<00:01:09.140> on<00:01:09.290> some<00:01:09.530> level<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:09.860> makes

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
you know while on some level that makes

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:11.560 
you know while on some level that makes
sense<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:10.729> think<00:01:10.759> it's<00:01:11.060> an<00:01:11.179> extremely

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
sense I think it's an extremely

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.889 
sense I think it's an extremely
depressing<00:01:12.170> thought<00:01:12.969> and<00:01:13.969> I<00:01:14.299> do<00:01:14.359> feel<00:01:14.869> like

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
depressing thought and I do feel like

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:17.080 
depressing thought and I do feel like
somebody's<00:01:15.469> stepping<00:01:15.829> on<00:01:15.950> my<00:01:16.070> oxygen<00:01:16.429> tea<00:01:16.729> but

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
somebody's stepping on my oxygen tea but

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.300 
somebody's stepping on my oxygen tea but
I<00:01:17.179> fear<00:01:17.539> that<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.259> alternative<00:01:18.920> might<00:01:19.100> feel

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
I fear that the alternative might feel

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.010 
I fear that the alternative might feel
like<00:01:19.460> somebody<00:01:19.880> simply<00:01:20.119> cut<00:01:20.479> off<00:01:20.689> my<00:01:20.899> oxygen

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
like somebody simply cut off my oxygen

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.840 
like somebody simply cut off my oxygen
tube<00:01:21.530> because<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:21.829> won't<00:01:22.069> be<00:01:22.189> able<00:01:22.249> to<00:01:22.460> pay<00:01:22.670> my

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
tube because I won't be able to pay my

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.349 
tube because I won't be able to pay my
bills

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
bills

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.380 
bills
