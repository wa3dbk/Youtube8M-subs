00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:32.169
 good the time we met 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.210
 good 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.690
 as you see good until you see 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.870
 seen before 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.250
 the basic roller of special soul super 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.210
 squid variant of conveyor 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.210
 but I want to be 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.500
 and if I buy it to try 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.630
 to buy I'm going to use it, come on 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.270
 down 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.490
 let's use a roll start 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.530
 I hate the rollers but I base on my 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.210
 first games with rolls 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.810
 let's go to the lobby we're going to look for a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.940
 friendly combat and we are going to give him cane and 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.940
 to see what time we see 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.350
 let's give it to see this in 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.300
 counterpart quickly we are already level 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.300
 7 so imagine a lot of cloth 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 I will put we will reach the most level 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.110
 high that there is the 20 plazuela del 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.110
 squid 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.460
 come on 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.260
 good the roller and start the best ' 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.600
 exists on the one hand but this consumes a 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.150
 brutality but a brutality of 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.810
 damn bath roll over here without you 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.729
 no one sees me so orient this painting 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.150
 here and I'll hide my mind a while 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.150
 recharge 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.610
 you know what it looks like a lot 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.409
 but when defending itself 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.709
 you have also 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:13.790
 I have to be not so much in the center 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:17.510
 do not let me see because it's one thing 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.129
 quite as logical I do not have to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.980
 let me see because if I'm not a target 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.049
 easy then to be an easy target what 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.480
 better than it's a let me see if I'm going to 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.010
 paint all this because my colleagues 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.710
 they do not paint it I paint it for 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 that I'm going to give it that only good 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.990
 for it to be the one coming or what 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.990
 be points 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.840
 you find all this limited easy 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.660
 access and others I'll stay a little here 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.530
 This is where this is where I can play my 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.160
 letters of my tricks here hidden I will 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.160
 come here 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.440
 it's worth a pint this 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.240
 mine 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.090
 I do not exist what to do, I have to 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.760
 do the waits that go forward I 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.799
 you touch them in the areas I as 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.799
 hiding me and little else 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.870
 they are painting themselves 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.360
 damn 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.220
 we will win the game but many 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.360
 times that if I'm seeing that I 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.590
 I'm sacrificing I'm painting 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.310
 very much 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.310
 let's give it 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.770
 if we can see some dead twice 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.770
 I think twice 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.810
 how 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.430
 we are not going to look at it 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.970
 to fuck but as serious has already been 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.690
 First of all it's all a bit easy but 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.690
 quite easy 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.569
 we go there we go 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.379
 this is the good this is the good groups 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.379
 we are painted a lot of things 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.370
 on this night to kill many but what 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.290
 what I'm going to do is that with the roller 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.310
 Kills the roller basically what it does 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.260
 is to paint 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.030
 us the ones that have to clear and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.040
 you may need to paint and paint already 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.980
 paint and melee is bestial 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.230
 because we have a good body then 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.220
 right now here post replies 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.220
 surely because they are going to come 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.350
 basically I have to paint everything all everything 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.380
 everything everything to come after me but it gives me 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.380
 same 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:42.460
 to the soloist wheel 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.370
 and I think I 've been the one to paint and 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.700
 are the ones who have painted the most and have been 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.230
 pretty good because he hit us a little stick 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.740
 so nothing cojones I hope that I have 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.940
 liked the game with the roller if 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.520
 you want more games with the roller 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.700
 give likes and I will upload games with the 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.440
 good hollow roll cares and we 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.860
 we see in the next game play until the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.860
 next 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.469
 so so so so 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:14.469
 so so so so 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.140
 before
