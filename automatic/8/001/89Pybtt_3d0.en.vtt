00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:09.410
 will be played in the challenge I hope you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.650
 be well 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.259
 they tested before doing this 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.940
 this post is finally I started 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:24.980
 today I'm going to talk to you about them 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:27.430
 in the small to challans she for 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.310
 those who have him who recognize him 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.870
 they recognize the next of course 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.870
 it's the brigitte bardot 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.480
 so as you see I chose in 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.670
 revenge it's pretty Chinese dishes 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 it was the color that spoke the flow 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.560
 single orange 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.960
 it looks like me it's gay it's happy 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.170
 and then for a price per dose should not 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.140
 take it in case I think so here's I 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.210
 discover there the 5 is in fabric 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.979
 that's why I hesitated to 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.530
 make it buy because I already had 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.860
 two sad experiences with 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.540
 previous bags in Le Mans fabric and I 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.040
 I had promised myself never bought a 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.170
 cloth bag but make a 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.060
 as you can rock it 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.520
 beautiful it's just beautiful this 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:33.130
 bag and that's it I cracked despite the fabric 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.330
 so the coronation itself presents itself 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 with two years the little ball worn 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.460
 shoulder 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.880
 you can see it normal classic and 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.410
 the biggest for the shoulder strap or 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.050
 who likes to wear the bags 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.390
 shoulder strap will amaze with the project 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.420
 lighthouse you can and you stay at 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:02:00.310
 colleagues 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.030
 then what I also liked about 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.240
 sex and the seat pocket the very small 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.069
 outside pocket that allows you to 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.300
 cram 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.670
 pass navigo phone small 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.940
 odds like that we need to have 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.870
 handy afterwards for the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.750
 Parisian I do not know 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.190
 Paris Metro is quite disreputable one 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.540
 advises not only to put 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.310
 stuff that's very valuable 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.090
 to fans of the coup and for now 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.190
 I had no worries inside you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.200
 have a little loop signed dance she 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.730
 could close the bag finally beats after 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.220
 finally you think what you want 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.930
 there is no closure 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.760
 it can be bad or it does not depend 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.400
 finally me it does not bother me it's not 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.989
 annoying so a little loop that you 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.079
 allow to close and open the 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:03.930
 circle so here are some small 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.980
 strings from the side it takes 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.980
 laces progress 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.050
 and then inside it's like a 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:18.130
 it's still a tad all 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:23.140
 a large pocket where you can swing 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:31.599
 everything you want we have a small 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:38.739
 pocket on the side 110 and a second 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:41.640
 post with closure langois the end 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:45.210
 it's classic 1 the bag 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.050
 he has two pockets of inside an ip 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:52.110
 an entity and then the pocket or 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:55.230
 discarded values â€‹â€‹I let go of her finally 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.800
 opera during the sales 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.799
 last year what it is this beginning 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.860
 of swell year that is behind and I 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.340
 had half price so 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.530
 so here we go 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.780
 we often tend to say to think 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.840
 that it's going to cost us the skin of the buttocks 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.970
 that we will never be able to see that with 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.180
 balances private sales in general 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.960
 the set of correct prices cost of 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.340
 more throws as you know I 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.180
