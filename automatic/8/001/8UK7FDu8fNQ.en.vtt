00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
episodes where I drunk my protein shake

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.620 
episodes where I drunk my protein shake
and<00:00:15.469> you<00:00:16.100> guys<00:00:16.250> asked<00:00:16.580> me<00:00:16.730> to<00:00:16.850> do<00:00:17.119> if<00:00:17.270> we<00:00:17.420> look

about it how i created and this is what
i<00:00:20.210> will<00:00:20.390> do<00:00:20.660> now<00:00:20.690> so<00:00:21.170> first<00:00:21.620> of<00:00:21.770> all<00:00:21.950> and<00:00:22.430> i

i will do now so first of all and i
think<00:00:23.180> this<00:00:23.630> protein<00:00:24.110> shake<00:00:24.380> is<00:00:24.590> very<00:00:24.980> healthy

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
think this protein shake is very healthy

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.090 
think this protein shake is very healthy
but<00:00:26.240> i'm<00:00:26.510> not<00:00:26.750> a<00:00:26.810> professional<00:00:27.020> my<00:00:27.560> friend<00:00:27.830> so

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
but i'm not a professional my friend so

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.520 
but i'm not a professional my friend so
um<00:00:28.430> I<00:00:28.670> can't<00:00:29.570> tell<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:29.990> you<00:00:30.500> should

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
um I can't tell you that you should

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.069 
um I can't tell you that you should
always<00:00:30.860> drink<00:00:31.640> something<00:00:32.480> like<00:00:32.629> that<00:00:32.840> after

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
always drink something like that after

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.970 
always drink something like that after
you<00:00:33.320> work<00:00:33.620> out<00:00:33.860> or<00:00:34.550> anything<00:00:35.239> else<00:00:35.690> but<00:00:36.379> I

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
you work out or anything else but I

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.450 
you work out or anything else but I
won't<00:00:37.820> show<00:00:38.030> you<00:00:38.059> what's<00:00:38.960> very<00:00:39.350> healthy<00:00:39.980> what

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
won't show you what's very healthy what

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.180 
won't show you what's very healthy what
you<00:00:40.609> can<00:00:40.760> do<00:00:40.940> on<00:00:40.969> your<00:00:41.120> own<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.890> yeah<00:00:42.890> I<00:00:42.980> think

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
you can do on your own and yeah I think

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.779 
you can do on your own and yeah I think
we<00:00:43.730> should<00:00:43.909> start<00:00:44.179> now<00:00:44.359> so<00:00:44.629> you<00:00:45.589> can<00:00:45.829> see<00:00:46.070> what

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:46.789 
we should start now so you can see what

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.340 
we should start now so you can see what
we<00:00:47.149> need<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.929> ingredients<00:00:48.109> ham<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:49.819> milk

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
we need the ingredients ham it is milk

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.779 
we need the ingredients ham it is milk
with<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:51.829> low<00:00:52.399> percentage<00:00:52.730> of<00:00:53.329> fat<00:00:54.399> then<00:00:55.399> we<00:00:55.579> got

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
with a low percentage of fat then we got

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.770 
with a low percentage of fat then we got
low<00:00:56.359> fat<00:00:56.780> /<00:00:57.379> cheese<00:00:57.909> this<00:00:58.909> is<00:00:59.059> very<00:00:59.449> good<00:00:59.600> here

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
low fat / cheese this is very good here

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.290 
low fat / cheese this is very good here
so<00:01:00.260> when<00:01:00.559> we<00:01:00.679> have<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.889> closer<00:01:01.339> look<00:01:01.699> here<00:01:01.999> maybe

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
so when we have a closer look here maybe

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.420 
so when we have a closer look here maybe

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
of the proteins on 100 gram so I'm all

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.190 
of the proteins on 100 gram so I'm all
in<00:01:12.020> all<00:01:12.170> this<00:01:12.740> thing<00:01:13.340> here<00:01:13.610> with<00:01:13.930> 250<00:01:14.930> grams

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
and Toby has 13 grams of protein in it

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.999 
and Toby has 13 grams of protein in it
this<00:01:19.219> is<00:01:19.340> very<00:01:19.520> good<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.119> here<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.140> the

this is very good and here we have the

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.859 
this is very good and here we have the
memory<00:01:22.579> so<00:01:23.289> in<00:01:24.289> my<00:01:24.500> opinion<00:01:24.649> um<00:01:25.539> men<00:01:26.539> Marines

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
memory so in my opinion um men Marines

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.260 
memory so in my opinion um men Marines
are<00:01:27.110> very<00:01:27.409> good<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:28.490> protein<00:01:29.030> shake

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
are very good in this protein shake

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.380 
are very good in this protein shake
because<00:01:29.990> then<00:01:30.649> it's<00:01:30.829> tasty<00:01:31.369> when<00:01:32.149> you<00:01:32.240> eat

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
because then it's tasty when you eat

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.880 
because then it's tasty when you eat
something<00:01:32.719> like<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.229> without<00:01:33.409> anything

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
something like that without anything

it's not very tasty my friends so we
won't<00:01:39.680> put<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.640> sugar<00:01:40.969> because<00:01:41.509> it's

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
won't put in sugar because it's

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.330 
won't put in sugar because it's
unhealthy<00:01:42.079> we<00:01:42.979> will<00:01:43.310> put<00:01:43.549> in<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:44.000> memory<00:01:44.619> and<00:01:45.619> I

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
unhealthy we will put in a memory and I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
let's carry on my friend it's putting

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.110 
let's carry on my friend it's putting
the<00:02:30.690> pieces<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.560> mandarins<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.370> now<00:02:33.090> a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
the pieces of the mandarins and now a

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.600 
the pieces of the mandarins and now a
little<00:02:33.750> bit<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:34.080> knit<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.760> has<00:02:36.120> also<00:02:37.610> some

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
little bit of knit so it has also some

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.600 
little bit of knit so it has also some
proteins<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.329> but<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:40.049> also<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.370> more

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
proteins in it but it's also with more

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.690 
proteins in it but it's also with more
fat<00:02:41.879> so<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.750> take<00:02:43.019> too<00:02:43.290> much<00:02:43.470> milk<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:46.700> yes

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
fat so don't take too much milk here yes

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.330 
fat so don't take too much milk here yes
this<00:02:48.180> should<00:02:48.209> be<00:02:48.480> enough<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.989> now<00:02:49.590> I'm<00:02:49.890> you

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
this should be enough and now I'm you

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.240 
this should be enough and now I'm you
will<00:02:50.489> mix<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.420> would<00:02:52.019> say<00:02:52.260> let's<00:02:52.709> mix<00:02:53.099> it

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
will mix it so I would say let's mix it

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.630 
will mix it so I would say let's mix it
for<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:54.299> minute<00:02:54.480> or<00:02:54.840> 14<00:02:55.319> seconds<00:02:55.829> if<00:02:56.430> you

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
for one minute or 14 seconds if you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.819 
for one minute or 14 seconds if you
don't<00:02:56.819> have<00:02:57.030> such<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> special<00:02:57.989> mixer<00:02:58.530> here<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
don't have such a special mixer here you

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.910 
don't have such a special mixer here you
can<00:02:59.010> also<00:02:59.160> take<00:02:59.519> something<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:01.470> here

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
can also take something like that here

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.119 
can also take something like that here
that<00:03:02.519> show<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.319> let's<00:03:04.319> try<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:04.890> this

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
that show it to you let's try with this

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.660 
that show it to you let's try with this
year<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:07.349> have<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.769> check<00:03:08.459> out

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
year so and you have to check out

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.180 
year so and you have to check out
yourself<00:03:09.090> what<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.450> got<00:03:09.629> at<00:03:09.750> home<00:03:09.959> and<00:03:10.739> then

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
yourself what you got at home and then

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.960 
yourself what you got at home and then
you<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.670> do<00:03:12.359> it<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:12.690> your<00:03:12.750> own<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.799> will<00:03:14.700> turn

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you can do it on your own so I will turn

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.479 
you can do it on your own so I will turn
on<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.269> mixer<00:03:15.420> now<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.799> will<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.160> back

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
on the mixer now and then I will be back

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.069 
on the mixer now and then I will be back
because<00:03:17.549> it's<00:03:18.120> it's<00:03:18.389> very<00:03:18.930> low<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.500> friend<00:03:21.079> put

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
because it's it's very low a friend put

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:52.190 
because it's it's very low a friend put
onto<00:03:22.829> it<00:03:27.049> yes<00:03:28.459> and<00:03:29.459> now<00:03:29.819> we<00:03:29.880> can<00:03:30.329> mix<00:03:30.540> it<00:03:33.950> hot

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.860 

this<00:03:53.200> should<00:03:53.380> be<00:03:53.500> enough<00:03:53.590> reference<00:03:54.480> so<00:03:55.480> let's

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
this should be enough reference so let's

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.050 
this should be enough reference so let's
take<00:03:56.320> it<00:03:56.530> out<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.680> here<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.310> we<00:03:57.640> can<00:03:57.850> have<00:03:58.030> a

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
take it out of here and we can have a

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.680 
take it out of here and we can have a
look<00:03:58.270> here<00:04:00.390> yes<00:04:01.390> mm-hmm<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:03.090> as<00:04:04.090> i<00:04:04.270> told<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.600> at
