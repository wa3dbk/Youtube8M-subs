anyway Marco asked do you think using a

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.550 
anyway Marco asked do you think using a
double<00:05:57.120> clutch<00:05:57.270> gearbox<00:05:57.330> takes<00:05:58.230> away<00:05:58.500> from

double clutch gearbox takes away from

double clutch gearbox takes away from
the<00:05:58.770> driving<00:05:59.250> experience<00:05:59.370> as<00:05:59.910> opposed<00:06:00.390> to

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
the driving experience as opposed to

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.960 
the driving experience as opposed to
driving<00:06:00.780> a<00:06:01.020> car<00:06:01.320> with<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:01.830> manual<00:06:02.130> gearbox<00:06:02.370> and

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
stick well my answer is quite simply yes

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.420 
stick well my answer is quite simply yes
it<00:06:07.020> does<00:06:07.410> take<00:06:07.650> away<00:06:07.860> from<00:06:07.980> the<00:06:08.100> driving

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430

experience now on the track pdk or a
double<00:06:11.400> clutch<00:06:11.670> is<00:06:11.880> much<00:06:12.030> better<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.570> car's

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
double clutch is much better the car's

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
and a better driving experience if you

if<00:06:31.110> I'm<00:06:31.320> in<00:06:31.470> heavy<00:06:31.650> traffic<00:06:32.010> I<00:06:32.340> couldn't<00:06:32.670> give

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
if I'm in heavy traffic I couldn't give

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.070 
if I'm in heavy traffic I couldn't give
two<00:06:33.000> SH<00:06:33.030> about<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.660> driving<00:06:33.990> experience

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:36.930 
because traffic and manual transmissions

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.480 
because traffic and manual transmissions
they<00:06:37.230> go<00:06:37.380> together<00:06:37.500> like<00:06:37.710> toothpaste<00:06:38.250> and
