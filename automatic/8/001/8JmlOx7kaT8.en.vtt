00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
center pin to the right you stretch a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
center pin to the right you stretch a
black<00:00:20.580> or<00:00:20.820> brown<00:00:20.850> rubber<00:00:21.210> band<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.170> don't

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
then we're gonna turn it and right here

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.350 
then we're gonna turn it and right here
just<00:00:34.410> like<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.040> then<00:00:36.030> we're<00:00:36.270> gonna

just like that and then we're gonna
start<00:00:36.630> from<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.870> center<00:00:37.170> pin<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.559> go

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
start from the center pin and go

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.459 
start from the center pin and go
straight<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.280> time<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.170> gonna<00:00:40.290> keep

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
straight this time so we're gonna keep

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.920 
straight this time so we're gonna keep
on<00:00:40.620> going<00:00:40.770> straight<00:00:41.010> until<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.120> reach<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.540> top

on going straight until we reach the top

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.850 
on going straight until we reach the top
pin<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:44.719> then<00:00:45.719> from<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.440> center<00:00:46.620> pin

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
pin right here then from the center pin

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
pin right here then from the center pin
to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> left<00:00:47.430> we<00:00:48.210> stretch<00:00:48.450> another<00:00:48.840> black

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
black or brown rubber band then we go

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.760 
black or brown rubber band then we go
straight<00:00:52.980> twice<00:00:54.199> then<00:00:55.199> we're<00:00:55.379> gonna<00:00:55.530> turn

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
straight twice then we're gonna turn

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.510 
straight twice then we're gonna turn
right<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> top<00:00:58.129> then<00:00:59.129> we're<00:00:59.340> going

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
right here to the top then we're going

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
right here to the top then we're going
to<00:00:59.550> leave<00:00:59.699> these<00:00:59.969> three<00:01:00.329> pins<00:01:00.739> welcome<00:01:01.739> to

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
to leave these three pins welcome to

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.399 
to leave these three pins welcome to
anything<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.399> their<00:01:02.690> nordley<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.080> diamond

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
anything on their nordley this diamond

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.219 
anything on their nordley this diamond
shape<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.549> only<00:01:06.090> these<00:01:06.299> three<00:01:06.570> pins<00:01:06.900> are<00:01:07.049> left

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
shape so only these three pins are left

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.600 
shape so only these three pins are left
so<00:01:07.409> we're<00:01:07.560> gonna<00:01:07.680> put<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.040> triangle<00:01:08.400> right

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
so we're gonna put a triangle right

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.840 
so we're gonna put a triangle right
there<00:01:09.530> then<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.070> then<00:01:11.250> we're<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.460> place<00:01:11.610> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there then and then we're gonna place to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.390 
there then and then we're gonna place to
the<00:01:11.970> cap<00:01:12.390> band<00:01:12.630> first<00:01:13.290> should<00:01:13.530> stretch<00:01:14.100> over

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the cap band first should stretch over

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.969 
the cap band first should stretch over
them<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.240> sit<00:01:15.450> into<00:01:15.570> figure<00:01:15.960> eight<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.500> put

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
them to sit into figure eight and put

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
them to sit into figure eight and put
them<00:01:17.130> together<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.420> doubled

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
them together and you have doubled

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
them together and you have doubled
rubber<00:01:19.799> band<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.520> place<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> top<00:01:21.600> pin

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
rubber band you place it on the top pin

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.289 
rubber band you place it on the top pin
and<00:01:22.439> then<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.740> you're<00:01:22.920> ready<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.159> loop<00:01:23.490> your

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and then now you're ready to loop your

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.160 
and then now you're ready to loop your
loom<00:01:24.509> around<00:01:27.200> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.549> go<00:01:29.549> under<00:01:30.020> put<00:01:31.020> your

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
loom around kind of go under put your

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.270 
loom around kind of go under put your
hook<00:01:31.740> under<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:33.000> cap<00:01:33.180> band<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.950> then<00:01:35.070> search

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
hook under the cap band and then search

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.350 
hook under the cap band and then search
for<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:36.590> right<00:01:37.590> rubber<00:01:38.250> band<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.180> we're

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
for this right rubber band then we're

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359 
for this right rubber band then we're
gonna<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.110> then<00:01:40.290> loop<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.009> onto

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
gonna get it and then loop it onto

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.149 
gonna get it and then loop it onto
itself<00:01:42.140> then<00:01:43.140> go<00:01:43.590> under<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.570> one<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.869> then

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
itself then go under that one and then

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.550 
itself then go under that one and then
kind<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> loop<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.670> around<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.659> then

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
kind of loop it around this one then

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.950 
kind of loop it around this one then
this<00:01:50.399> triangles<00:01:51.000> right<00:01:51.119> there<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.720> you're

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
this triangles right there so you're

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.160 
this triangles right there so you're
going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:53.299> push<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.450> triangle<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.079> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
going to push that triangle out of the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.780 
going to push that triangle out of the
way<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.159> black<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:57.020> right<00:01:58.020> there

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
way and get this black one right there

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.520 
way and get this black one right there
then<00:01:59.790> we're<00:01:59.939> gonna<00:02:00.060> hook<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:01.350> right

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
then we're gonna hook it on then right

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.260 
then we're gonna hook it on then right
here<00:02:01.770> we're<00:02:02.310> gonna<00:02:02.460> take<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.790> rubber<00:02:03.119> band

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
here we're gonna take this rubber band

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.980 
here we're gonna take this rubber band
which<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.520> what's<00:02:05.520> easy<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.090> do<00:02:06.540> because

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
which is what's easy to do because

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.199 
which is what's easy to do because
there's<00:02:07.229> nothing<00:02:07.590> that's<00:02:08.550> pulling<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.000> back

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
there's nothing that's pulling it back

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.170 
there's nothing that's pulling it back
or<00:02:09.360> anything<00:02:09.569> then<00:02:10.170> we<00:02:10.259> do<00:02:10.379> that<00:02:10.500> next<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:12.000> take

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
or anything then we do that next we take

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.050 
or anything then we do that next we take
this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
this

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
this
Center<00:02:13.360> one<00:02:13.739> then<00:02:14.739> we<00:02:14.890> loop<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.900> then<00:02:16.900> we<00:02:17.020> keep

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
Center one then we loop it then we keep

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.580 
Center one then we loop it then we keep
on<00:02:18.069> doing<00:02:18.099> this<00:02:18.630> straight<00:02:19.630> until<00:02:20.110> we<00:02:20.260> reach

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
on doing this straight until we reach

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.530 
on doing this straight until we reach
the<00:02:20.830> top<00:02:21.010> pin<00:02:21.280> which<00:02:21.790> appears<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.330> be<00:02:22.420> the

the top pin which appears to be the

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.710 
the top pin which appears to be the
bottle<00:02:22.900> thing<00:02:23.670> laid<00:02:24.670> out<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:25.000> dance<00:02:25.770> next<00:02:26.770> you

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
kind of loop it on the left then go

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
kind of loop it on the left then go
straight<00:02:32.980> out<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:37.540> note<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.340> right
