00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.160
 arrived in the petrol pleases 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.690
 this lure of having a few women 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.690
 to fetch a grain of madness 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.640
 the qt by its gallery 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 it must be done 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.300
 seriously because she has a lot of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.759
 power currently the identity of 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.500
 renault the rhombus well put forward 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.510
 develop confident and proud you see it 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.410
 some sides r5 turbo 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.410
 I am going very well 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:50.539
 the inspiration you set two 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:55.149
 heirlooms your christmas segment to break 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.149
 their bill town of clovis 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.129
 as and that conceptual of tidji me 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.760
 focusing wikango crazy weekend but 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.860
 than howlin wolf or because it's mostly 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.060
 Alcantara wish 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.120
 in fact the materials they use 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.490
 not for the outside use the match 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.830
 as a contrast with the brilliant that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.590
 can be very very handsome know it well 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.180
 bright but red and a little satiny 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 everyone knows the pictures of jean 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.800
 ragnotti who makes his 360 degrees trip 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.690
 spectacular so that's the grain of 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.670
 madness and the next phase fit to do 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.259
 so check that on the track is 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.690
 has as imagined it is 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.250
 performing very pleasant to drive there 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.250
 it will be managed the icing on the cake 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.580
 rather typical circuit but a typical circuit 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.580
 that's a bit much 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.230
 today his first runs 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.700
 today we check that everything 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.960
 works properly that's what we 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.960
 calls in jargon a burn-in 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.560
 we check that all functions 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.650
 mechanical parts of the car are 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.930
 operational and it's also very 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.599
 nice this kind of noise it's like 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.069
 it's sporty it's totally in 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.209
 relationship with the external appearance of 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.209
 the car makes you want to play 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.290
 it's super bad have worked for them 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.290
 beyond without problem 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:07.470
 the reassurance tests unrwa 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.470
 who saw eight bodies of a hardening 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.110
 today you discover a phase 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.170
 test in conditions a little 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:25.230
 extreme and windsor half an hour with 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:28.230
 carbon credit floating mirror of 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.230
 luca 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:42.000
 dsb thread of a stride technology says on 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.909
 in a dream 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.569
 and then wash-wells or sous for 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.569
 the first time 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.420
 years 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:57.290
 a v6 3 liters 5 that is not far from 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.860
 350 horsepower for a car that makes 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.370
 it's already a cocktail 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.370
 very interesting 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.310
 a very dynamic little car is in 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.530
 does the behavior is quite in 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.460
 relationship with the design we want 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.230
 to play with his car 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.820
 she asks that because of that 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.030
 that a very mobile a little wheelbase 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.770
 so that makes the car extremely lively 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.200
 the concept are always done with 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.210
 inspiration but also with some 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.480
 ideas for the future 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.370
 so if it works well if it inspires and 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.970
 here you have to work on a future 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.889
 city 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.870
 we will still draw heavily on 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.310
 also the concept there we would like to see 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.150
 born license plates 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.150
 that she was driving on the road
