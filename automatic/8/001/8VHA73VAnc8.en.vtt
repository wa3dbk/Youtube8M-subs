00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.730
 let's play this way that the truth 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.189
 what I love is a way that flips 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.850
 because in addition you kill keeps you in 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.980
 tension 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.200
 You can not have a voucher, but you can also 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.230
 you can do a little bit because it puts in 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.990

 he is crazy he was clenching wires 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.780
 how good it has been three times and it is 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.390
 tremendous 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.370
 My mother, what do you do for that? 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.560
 this game why that's good this game in 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.069
 general good, good, something, let's go, 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.760
 there but that's why I'm cool in this way 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.530
 boat butt ie 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.269
 if you have tried it, people 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.799
 comments put it out there because the 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.799
 true that is tremendous is all the 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.709
 while very frantic you do not do many 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.769
 low I'm pretty much I've seen or I 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.630
 I've also done 24 casualties and things like that 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.000
 but the truth is that you do little 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.340
 because all the casualties of all 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.160
 the whole team and the truth that same 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.600
 he enjoys him as a dwarf and this mode of 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.940
 game keeps you what I tell you in 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.229
 voltage there to power butt not so 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.330
 Nothing, I hope you liked it 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.520
 this way if you want more I'll upload more 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.440
 from time to time a little bit and such because 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 the truth is that it motivates me, it's cool you know 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.639
 that I say that keeps in tension 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.620
 so people I hope that I have 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.229
 it seemed funny that you had passed 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.699

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.699
