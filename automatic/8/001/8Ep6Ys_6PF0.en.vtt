00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
like mid 02 and that's when we decided

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.630 
like mid 02 and that's when we decided
we<00:01:35.899> should<00:01:36.049> hold<00:01:36.229> one<00:01:36.469> as<00:01:36.619> well<00:01:36.799> I<00:01:37.130> got<00:01:37.520> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
we should hold one as well I got the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.310 
we should hold one as well I got the
venue<00:01:37.939> like<00:01:38.090> two<00:01:38.299> months<00:01:38.450> in<00:01:38.630> advance<00:01:38.929> so<00:01:39.079> it's

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
venue like two months in advance so it's

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.599 
venue like two months in advance so it's
actually<00:01:39.649> pretty<00:01:39.829> well<00:01:40.070> set<00:01:40.280> up<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.490> that

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
actually pretty well set up in that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.819 
actually pretty well set up in that
sense<00:01:40.820> like<00:01:40.999> we<00:01:41.119> had<00:01:41.210> time<00:01:41.420> to<00:01:41.539> like<00:01:41.719> hype<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.619> I

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
sense like we had time to like hype it I

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:44.739 
sense like we had time to like hype it I
mean<00:01:43.100> smash<00:01:43.460> boards<00:01:43.820> was<00:01:43.939> still<00:01:44.179> tiny<00:01:44.450> back

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:44.749 
mean smash boards was still tiny back

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:46.630 
mean smash boards was still tiny back
then<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.259> there<00:01:45.770> wasn't<00:01:45.890> much<00:01:46.130> we<00:01:46.159> could<00:01:46.310> do<00:01:46.520> to

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
then so there wasn't much we could do to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.149 
then so there wasn't much we could do to
height<00:01:46.820> but<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.659> got<00:01:47.780> like<00:01:47.929> a<00:01:47.960> 15<00:01:48.439> min<00:01:48.679> turn<00:01:48.950> out

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
height but we got like a 15 min turn out

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.940 
height but we got like a 15 min turn out
so<00:01:49.780> given<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:50.810> it<00:01:50.960> was<00:01:51.049> like<00:01:51.229> 2,000<00:01:51.799> to<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so given that it was like 2,000 to the
