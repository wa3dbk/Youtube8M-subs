00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
eyeliner it's pretty simple but I just

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.400 
eyeliner it's pretty simple but I just
kind<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.850> broke<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.119> down<00:00:21.240> into<00:00:21.449> simple<00:00:21.990> steps

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
kind of broke it down into simple steps

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.160 
kind of broke it down into simple steps
that<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.670> achieve<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.000> cat<00:00:24.269> eye<00:00:24.300> look<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
that I do to achieve a cat eye look so I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.000 
that I do to achieve a cat eye look so I

hope it helps and keep watching for my
cat<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.429> like<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.970> use<00:00:30.150> L'Oreal<00:00:30.720> twelve-hour<00:00:31.230> in

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
cat I like to use L'Oreal twelve-hour in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.380 
cat I like to use L'Oreal twelve-hour in
fallible<00:00:31.920> liquid<00:00:32.309> eyeliner<00:00:32.759> just<00:00:32.969> because

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
fallible liquid eyeliner just because

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.910 
fallible liquid eyeliner just because
it's<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.660> felt-tip<00:00:33.989> pen<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.559> that's<00:00:34.680> better

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it's a felt-tip pen and that's better

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.610 
it's a felt-tip pen and that's better
precision<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.030> always<00:00:36.390> use<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.899> gel<00:00:37.440> liner

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
precision you can always use a gel liner

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.560 
precision you can always use a gel liner
or<00:00:37.980> liquid<00:00:38.340> liners<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:38.730> other<00:00:38.879> pens<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
or liquid liners or other pens to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.549 
or liquid liners or other pens to
achieve<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> cat<00:00:40.170> eye<00:00:40.200> look<00:00:42.110> so<00:00:43.110> start<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
achieve the cat eye look so start the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.619 
achieve the cat eye look so start the
cat<00:00:43.770> eye<00:00:43.800> eye<00:00:44.010> sin<00:00:44.610> leave<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.329> lash<00:00:45.600> line

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
cat eye eye sin leave on my lash line

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.590 
cat eye eye sin leave on my lash line
and<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:46.710> using<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.309> side<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.910> my<00:00:48.090> felt<00:00:48.360> tip

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and I'm using the side of my felt tip

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.420 
and I'm using the side of my felt tip
pen<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> has<00:00:49.379> better<00:00:49.649> precision<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
pen because it has better precision and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
pen because it has better precision and
it's<00:00:50.640> just<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:51.030> better<00:00:51.270> edge<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.050> whereas

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it's just a better edge to it whereas

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
it's just a better edge to it whereas
you<00:00:52.800> don't<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> use<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.579> point<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.000> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
you don't want to use the point of it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.790 
you don't want to use the point of it
because<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.899> don't<00:00:54.989> get<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> same<00:00:55.500> color

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
because you don't get the same color

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.760 
because you don't get the same color
payoff<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.520> it's<00:00:56.850> easier<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.360> mess<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
payoff and it's easier to mess up so I

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.060 
payoff and it's easier to mess up so I
like<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> apply<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.420> Li<00:01:00.649> first<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.039> that

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
like to apply this in Li first so that

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.789 
like to apply this in Li first so that
way<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.609> go<00:01:02.760> back<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.049> fix<00:01:04.049> mistakes<00:01:04.500> or

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
way I can go back and fix mistakes or

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
way I can go back and fix mistakes or
make<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.040> thicker<00:01:11.210> for<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.299> flick<00:01:12.540> portion<00:01:12.869> of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
make it thicker for the flick portion of

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.899 
make it thicker for the flick portion of
the<00:01:13.049> cat<00:01:13.229> eye<00:01:13.260> look<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.770> basically<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.340> draw<00:01:14.729> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the cat eye look I basically just draw a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.730 
the cat eye look I basically just draw a
life<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> corner<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.049> eye<00:01:16.200> where<00:01:16.619> my

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
life from the corner of my eye where my

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
life from the corner of my eye where my
bottom<00:01:17.100> lash<00:01:17.310> line<00:01:17.340> ends<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.570> line<00:01:18.840> would<00:01:19.020> be

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
bottom lash line ends this line would be

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.600 
bottom lash line ends this line would be
where<00:01:19.350> my<00:01:19.500> lower<00:01:19.710> lash<00:01:20.009> line<00:01:20.040> were<00:01:20.430> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
where my lower lash line were to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.859 
where my lower lash line were to
continue<00:01:22.880> once<00:01:23.880> I've<00:01:24.030> drawn<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> line<00:01:24.450> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
continue once I've drawn that line I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.390 
continue once I've drawn that line I
connect<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> end<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> liner

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
connect the end of it to the liner

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.280 
connect the end of it to the liner
already<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.150> lid<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.810> fill<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
already on my lid and then fill in the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.920 
already on my lid and then fill in the
space<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.100> between<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> make

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
space in between and you want to make

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.469 
space in between and you want to make
sure<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.560> endpoint<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.640> pointees<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
sure that the endpoint is pointees you

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.690 
sure that the endpoint is pointees you
want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> go<00:01:34.020> back<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.619> use<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> tip<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
want to go back and just use the tip of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.120 
want to go back and just use the tip of
the<00:01:36.150> liner<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:37.020> that<00:01:37.229> point

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
the liner to make that point

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.300 
the liner to make that point
and<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:41.259> basically<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:41.860> you<00:01:42.100> can<00:01:42.189> go

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
and that's basically it so you can go

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.010 
and that's basically it so you can go
back<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.549> even<00:01:42.850> out<00:01:43.060> any<00:01:43.180> rough<00:01:43.420> edges<00:01:43.659> or

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
back to even out any rough edges or

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.900 
back to even out any rough edges or
uneven<00:01:44.409> lines<00:01:44.650> or<00:01:45.040> make<00:01:45.220> it<00:01:45.340> thicker

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:02:08.509
