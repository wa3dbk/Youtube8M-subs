earpods<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:41.250> want<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.550> match<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.390> right

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
earpods you want to match that the right

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
earpods you want to match that the right
side<00:00:43.170> i'm<00:00:43.379> doing<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.770> facing<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> right

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
side i'm doing it facing you the right

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.650 
side i'm doing it facing you the right
side<00:00:45.149> obviously<00:00:46.100> goes<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:48.000> side<00:00:48.329> of

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
side obviously goes to the right side of

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.729 
side obviously goes to the right side of
the<00:00:48.750> earpods<00:00:49.399> like<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:51.140> left<00:00:52.140> side<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the earpods like that left side go to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.240 
the earpods like that left side go to
the<00:00:52.860> left<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.620> left<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
the left so this is this is left and the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
the left so this is this is left and the
ear<00:00:59.250> pod<00:00:59.550> would<00:01:00.000> rest<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:02.629> down<00:01:03.629> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
ear pod would rest like this down this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.670 
ear pod would rest like this down this
way<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.119> where<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> goes<00:01:06.360> into<00:01:06.600> an<00:01:06.780> ear<00:01:07.049> facing

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
way so where it goes into an ear facing

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.719 
way so where it goes into an ear facing
outward<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.400> then<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
outward and then the little and

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.249 
outward and then the little and
essentially<00:01:11.729> put<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.390> label<00:01:13.140> site<00:01:13.409> down<00:01:13.770> and

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
essentially put the label site down and

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.490 
essentially put the label site down and
then<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.560> kind<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.920> press<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.180> tied<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.960> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
then you kind of press in tied and this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.260 
then you kind of press in tied and this
is<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> tricky<00:01:20.009> part<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> gather<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
is a tricky part you want to gather the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.109 
is a tricky part you want to gather the
heads<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> microphone<00:01:24.930> park<00:01:25.290> portion<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
heads the microphone park portion and

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.149 
heads the microphone park portion and
the<00:01:27.119> site<00:01:27.659> without<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.259> cable<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.040> it's

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the site without the cable actually it's

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.830 
the site without the cable actually it's
worth<00:01:29.369> pointing<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.150> little<00:01:30.450> tab<00:01:30.810> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
worth pointing out that little tab that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.649 
worth pointing out that little tab that
held<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.860> together<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.670> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.970> squeeze<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
held it together you want to squeeze it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
held it together you want to squeeze it
down<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> bottom<00:01:35.270> right

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
microphone is tucked underneath time

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.470 
microphone is tucked underneath time
underneath<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.060> then<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:13.440> want<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
microphone portion so that's underneath

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.619 
microphone portion so that's underneath
microphone<00:02:20.340> portion<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:20.939> the<00:02:20.970> income<00:02:21.390> and

fit<00:02:22.349> into<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.860> slot<00:02:24.319> this<00:02:25.319> way<00:02:25.560> now<00:02:26.040> once<00:02:26.250> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
fit into the slot this way now once you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.699 
fit into the slot this way now once you
get<00:02:26.579> to<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.819> stage<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.629> think<00:02:28.319> you're<00:02:28.439> set<00:02:28.680> to

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
get to this stage I think you're set to

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.380 
get to this stage I think you're set to
go<00:02:28.860> now<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.579> course<00:02:29.640> this<00:02:29.939> might<00:02:30.150> look<00:02:30.329> like

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
go now of course this might look like

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.289 
go now of course this might look like
it's<00:02:30.750> not<00:02:30.959> even<00:02:31.260> because<00:02:31.799> one<00:02:32.609> side<00:02:32.879> is<00:02:33.120> longer

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
it's not even because one side is longer

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.420 
it's not even because one side is longer
than<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.629> others<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.470> other<00:02:34.620> but<00:02:35.220> don't

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
than the others the other but don't

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.190 
than the others the other but don't
worry<00:02:35.549> about<00:02:35.609> it<00:02:35.849> you<00:02:35.970> keep<00:02:36.180> going<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> same

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
worry about it you keep going the same

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.170 
worry about it you keep going the same
direction<00:02:37.489> it's<00:02:38.489> going<00:02:38.609> to<00:02:38.819> wrap<00:02:39.000> itself

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
direction it's going to wrap itself

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.460 
direction it's going to wrap itself
around<00:02:39.510> my<00:02:41.390> image<00:02:42.390> keep<00:02:42.599> going<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:42.989> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
around my image keep going on the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.479 
around my image keep going on the
picture<00:02:44.400> gigs<00:02:44.609> coming<00:02:45.150> up<00:02:45.500> out<00:02:46.500> of<00:02:46.560> frame<00:02:46.920> so

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
picture gigs coming up out of frame so

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.360 
picture gigs coming up out of frame so
then<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.879> wrap<00:02:48.120> around<00:02:50.389> wrap<00:02:51.389> around<00:02:51.780> again

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
then you wrap around wrap around again

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.059 
then you wrap around wrap around again
until<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.760> find<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:55.109> coffee<00:02:55.379> makers<00:02:55.829> in<00:02:55.980> the

until you find the coffee makers in the
background<00:02:57.200> mmm<00:02:58.200> smells<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.650> good<00:02:58.799> coffee<00:02:59.069> and

by the time get all the way through you
will<00:03:08.310> see<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:09.030> there's<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.959> excess<00:03:13.709> know

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
will see that there's a the excess know

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:20.930 
will see that there's a the excess know
the<00:03:14.849> UM<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.950> plug<00:03:18.019> we<00:03:19.019> come<00:03:19.319> to<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.739> side<00:03:20.160> here

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
the UM the plug we come to the side here

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.129 
the UM the plug we come to the side here
and<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:22.470> tuck<00:03:22.769> this<00:03:23.519> in<00:03:24.889> this<00:03:25.889> way<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:27.139> then

and just tuck this in this way and then

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.229 
and just tuck this in this way and then
what<00:03:29.129> is<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.340> make<00:03:29.489> me<00:03:29.609> all<00:03:29.669> that<00:03:29.849> noise<00:03:30.000> the

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
what is the make me all that noise the

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.119 
what is the make me all that noise the
fair<00:03:30.449> and<00:03:30.780> then<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:32.129> can<00:03:32.280> push<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.669> stop<00:03:34.129> let

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
fair and then you can push you stop let

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.530 
fair and then you can push you stop let
me<00:03:35.190> try<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.430> get<00:03:35.579> I<00:03:37.040> think<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.430> wound<00:03:38.909> it<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.269> too

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
me try to get I think I wound it up too

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.750 
me try to get I think I wound it up too
tightly<00:03:39.900> gonna<00:03:40.829> turn<00:03:41.129> again<00:03:41.810> loosely<00:03:43.760> up

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
tightly gonna turn again loosely up

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.110 
tightly gonna turn again loosely up
around<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:48.470> think<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.590> most<00:03:49.739> tricky<00:03:50.220> part<00:03:50.909> is

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
around I think the most tricky part is

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.390 
around I think the most tricky part is
the<00:03:51.829> portion<00:03:52.829> way<00:03:53.099> you<00:03:53.159> need<00:03:53.729> to<00:03:53.909> fit<00:03:54.239> your

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
the portion way you need to fit your

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.430 
the portion way you need to fit your
microphone<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.359> volume<00:03:57.569> control<00:03:58.109> piece

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
microphone and the volume control piece

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.569 
microphone and the volume control piece
into<00:03:59.430> the<00:04:00.239> case<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:01.500> once<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:01.949> okay<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.340> when

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
into the case and once it's okay so when

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.240 
into the case and once it's okay so when
it's<00:04:02.729> not<00:04:02.909> too<00:04:03.299> tightly<00:04:03.690> wound<00:04:04.079> we<00:04:04.919> can<00:04:05.099> then

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
it's not too tightly wound we can then

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.949 
it's not too tightly wound we can then
tuck<00:04:05.549> this<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:07.549> here<00:04:08.549> like<00:04:09.359> that<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:10.400> then

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
tuck this in here like that and then

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.349 
tuck this in here like that and then
cover<00:04:12.959> it<00:04:14.690> boom<00:04:15.829> then<00:04:16.829> hope<00:04:17.159> it's<00:04:17.400> clear<00:04:18.120> hope

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
cover it boom then hope it's clear hope

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.490 
cover it boom then hope it's clear hope
you<00:04:18.479> can<00:04:18.659> see<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.190> all<00:04:20.190> right<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:22.380> were

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
you can see this all right you were

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.740 
you can see this all right you were
trying
