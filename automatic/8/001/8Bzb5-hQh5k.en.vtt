00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.779
 at the other extreme the whites and the blacks and we also have to 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.980
 true formula 1 but he coach did not show an adult audience 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.260
 a little bit of cod like this will have other continents to salmon baltar has 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.830
 open a chip ee uu euros we hope that the climate of at stake pavone 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.980
 santander black culture 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.320
 but little by little 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.560
 to pay the asparagus for its constant 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 I continue with this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.420
 if you keep a knife like you did before 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.020
 in this case 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.660
 but good as we have other pique gadgets present them not xisco well 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.930
 we have already waited for your children in charge 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.170
 let's see if we understand how to exceed 60 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.420
 then then this is for you activision 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.900
 is the best asparagus there 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.010
 well then to hunt it game was very important 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 we protest the water the wind ended 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.150
 then salt 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.310
 and if we do not realize 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.800
 is esparragoza floating 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.280
 the Portuguese gone therefore 3 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.860
 then delivered as a husband either with kitchen paper or with a rag 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.510
 White 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 three above 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.110
 for what reason 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.280
 we will simply achieve that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.520
 Lara has completely covered herself with water 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.680
 with that rag, that's why the paper 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.140
 and it cooks but it happens 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.430
 as you get to know this usually happens 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.770
 as asparagus grapes to the opas what will only happen is that the part of 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.390
 above have rusted if for that reason the alaveses coat throughout the tournament 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.350
 in this way 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.380
 we get 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.300
 what 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.800
 Rogen stage set 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.620
 I know that this cloth knows, but it makes work submerge 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.050
 very good results 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.600
 do not 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.840
 if we will see it oaxaca 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.080
 Taiwan maintains that when you compare this tissue 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.330
 the hardest part of the game 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.309
 we remember and the stretches 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.260
 these places of the real one is missing 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.309
 DR response 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:14.299
 outside little 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.169
 in the case escudero of asparagus altered the dish what we're going to do 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.059
 is 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.309
 let's go to pray 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.489
 the aiem to asparagus 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.489
 and last season 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.010
 we want this for latina 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.390
 lima ago also advocated to make more goals acquired firmable the tide 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.390
 delay love that I should take those rebound 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.989
 this neglected to oppose 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.900
 and under that task that we have after 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.910
 white asparagus au gratin with smoked salmon the same as the cooked ones 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.410

 boiled eggs raw egg yolk mayonnaise black olives pate 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:21.449
 Pepper 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:25.359
 for its preparation on asparagus we put some fillets teresa 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.210
 smoked in this case neighbors that goes eighth to put 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.099
 the graduates the cod 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.289
