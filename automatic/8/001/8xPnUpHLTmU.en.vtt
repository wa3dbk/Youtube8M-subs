00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.870 
it's probably one of the best another
back<00:01:49.539> its<00:01:50.439> up<00:01:50.560> if<00:01:50.649> you<00:01:50.770> want<00:01:50.920> 50<00:01:51.039> which<00:01:51.789> is

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
back its up if you want 50 which is

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.700 
back its up if you want 50 which is
pretty<00:01:52.240> much<00:01:52.360> all<00:01:52.899> around<00:01:53.110> a<00:01:53.320> short<00:01:53.560> board

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
pretty much all around a short board

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.200 
pretty much all around a short board
style<00:01:54.009> thing<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.490> a<00:01:54.520> couple<00:01:54.850> inches<00:01:55.030> shorter

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
style thing and a couple inches shorter

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.330 
style thing and a couple inches shorter
than<00:01:55.600> your<00:01:55.810> regular<00:01:56.320> short<00:01:56.770> board<00:01:57.009> so<00:01:57.159> it's<00:01:57.280> a

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
than your regular short board so it's a

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.520 
than your regular short board so it's a
little<00:01:57.490> bit<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:57.789> step<00:01:57.970> down<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:59.049> I<00:01:59.110> think

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
little bit of a step down but I think

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.200 
little bit of a step down but I think
the<00:01:59.770> answer<00:02:00.039> this<00:02:00.130> one<00:02:00.310> is<00:02:00.460> two<00:02:00.579> meanings<00:02:00.939> or

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
the answer this one is two meanings or

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.800 
the answer this one is two meanings or
