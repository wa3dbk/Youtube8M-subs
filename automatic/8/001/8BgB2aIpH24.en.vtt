00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 or the one that pete is what is promised is debt 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.629
 here I have the most desired smartphones 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 from the moment to my left with just 5 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.099
 months in the market and trained in korea 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.590
 in martial arts the samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 and to my right just arrived from 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.449
 cupertino and with a great croce de 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.779
 left apple iphone 5 welcome 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.430
 to the fight of the fight year we started with 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.279
 the screen of the iphone 5 is a 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.760
 retina screen with ips technology and a 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.710
 format 16 ninths 4 inches galaxy s3 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.989
 super amoled screen with technology 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 penta and also with format 16 ninth and 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.050
 a size of 48 inches 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.610
 the resolution thousand 136 x 640 pixels what 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.440
 which gives a density of pixels by 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.850
 inch of 330 720 x 1280 pixels of 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.460
 resolution what makes it a 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.309
 hd screen the pixel density is 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.260
 306 pixels per inch the iphone 5 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.690
 has more pixel density and the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.129
 samsung galaxy s3 what you have is more 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.109
 resolution so like the two 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.650
 screens look great here what 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.970
 what counts is the size you prefer 484 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.880
 processor 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.940
 to 6 dual-core to one gigahertz exynos 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.980
 quad core to 1 4 gigahertz though 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.050
 different benchmarks have made the 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.930
 iphone 5 recover the leadership I had 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.130
 the galaxy s3 in front of the iphone 4s the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.120
 truth is that comparing this is very 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.550
 complicated because in practice 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.340
 the two work perfectly at 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.480
 time to put videos of watching movies and 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.870
 to use any type of application 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.120
 both are very fluid and you know that the 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.250
 processor is not all both have a 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.290
 ram memory of 1gb and in speed it does not 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.420
 you can not put one but none of 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.080
 we both go with the iphone 5 design 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.570
 Built in aluminum and galaxy crystal 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.070
 s3 built in plastic and glass in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.410
 the theory the aluminum is more resistant 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.210
 to blows that the plastic in practice 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.570
 do not make me throw them on the ground for 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.340
 check it the iphone 5 has thickness of 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.130
 0.76 millimeters versus the galaxy s3 that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.250
 It has a thickness of 0.86 mm on 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.259
 iphone 5 weighs 112 grams and the garage is 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.759
 of 333 grams the truth is that the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.270
 difference in use does not show much 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.220
 perhaps the biggest difference comes from the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.960
 width and the size of the screen in 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.990
 color is the iphone 5 what can we 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.940
 in black and graphite and in white and silver and 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.650
 The s3 can be found in addition to the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.600
 colors in which it came out that is the foot 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.310
 of the blue marble white that is blue and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.350
 white in another new range of colors 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.819
 like for example a reddish tone that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.469
 he is very cool 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.139
 capacities 16 32 and 64 gigas both 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.819
 just that the galaxy s3 can also 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:39.129
 increase capacity through 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.859
 microsd cards use the same 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.019
 types of networks is to say that in the end the 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.359
 data download speed will depend 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.459
 more of your operator and where are you from 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.379
 from the terminal itself the cameras 8 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.840
 megapixel autofocus flash led 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.370
 geotagging and facial detection the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.319
 quality of the iphone 5 camera is 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.030
 somewhat superior to that of the galaxy s3 about 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.919
 all in low light conditions although 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.599
 has some failures that should not 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.760
 have though the galaxy 3 camera 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.250
 It is also very good and has controls 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.019
 of exposure that the iPhone 5 does not have or 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.510
 good has through applications 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.060
 besides the galaxy s3 also has 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.489
 very creative ways the two record video 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.810
 at 1080p at 30 frames per second is 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.209
 say that they are capable of recording video 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 full hd and both have stabilizer 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.389
 image then you can connect them to your 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.370
 Full HD screen to see the 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.310
 videos recorded in that format but 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.579
 both need an adapter to be able 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.040
 do it also have front cameras 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.460
 12 megapixels the camera of the iphone 5 and 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.400
 is 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.280
 to record videos at 720p at 30 frames 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.810
 per second the galaxy s3 is 19 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.510
 megapixels that also records video to 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.030
 720p at 30 frames per second the 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.880
 The quality of the Galaxy S3 is noticeable in 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.110
 videoconferences without a lid or with a lid 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.060
 of the lid because it makes a lot of sense 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.830
 because at the end of the day like this you can 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.840
 replace the battery that by the way already 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.730
 you know that you have the nfc integrated in 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.340
 she and you also have access here to the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.530
 micro sd nano sim versus micro sim 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.480
 connectors you already know the iphone 5 ha 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.060
 changed to the lighting connector that is 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.360
 this and the galaxy s3 therefore uses the 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.030
 standard micro USB 1440 battery connector 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.220
 milliamperios garage is 32 thousand 100 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.750
 milliamperes although in the galaxy s3 the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.540
 battery has to feed a screen 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.880
 larger the results show that 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.950
 the galaxy s3 battery lasts longer to see 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.530
 it's not that you do not have to plug it in 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.700
 until next month but at least 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.230
 you can stand the day 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.090
 baggy watching videos surfing 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.830
 internet with twitter facebook with 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.450
 regarding the headphones if it were not 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.740
 because apple has launched what is not 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.540
 we are talking about them right now 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.310
 but it turns out that the spots have 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.580
 greatly improved the sound both are 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.870
 can 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.789
 use as hands- free since 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.159
 they incorporate a microphone and also 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.050
 volume control but the spots are 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:49.449
 they hear better but instead the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.090
 Samsung Galaxy S3 Headphones Have 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.189
 This silicone coating are 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.199
 able to isolate you better from sound 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.050
 external the microphones the iphone 5 has 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.939
 3 and galaxy s3 has 2 the third 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.770
 iphone 5 microphone which is located 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.330
 right next to the camera you do not notice 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.699
 both for voice quality and 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.699
 cancellation of noise but for the video 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.340
 nothing climent is that it has arrived 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.370
 safe and sound we continue with the videogram 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.229
 both have gps and satellites 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.509
 glonass and both are very fast and very 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.220
 precise the difference lies in the 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.659
 maps in the case of the iphone 5 the 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.909
 application of maps to be victory to the 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:27.979
 load faster than the galaxy s3 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:31.039
 but you know that the maps in the 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.199
 iphone 5 ie in ie6 have a 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.330
 small problem are greener than a 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:37.099
 Android both have wifi with wifi 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.199
 hotspot pérez that in addition the galaxy s3 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.639
 has wifi direct that is to say a 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.340
 application that allows you to send 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:44.960
 files from one device to another more 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.819
 fast and no need to connect 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.310
 sensor data that share the 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:51.199
 accelerometer the gyroscope the compass and 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.780
 also the proximity sensor also 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.759
 the galaxy s3 has a rgb sensor and 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.289
 it also has a barometer plus things that 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.419
 has the galaxy 3 and that the iphone 5 does not 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:01.009
 has for example the xxvii the smart 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.690
 stay that you already know is the sensor this 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.340
 that when you look at the phone it makes the 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.560
 screen does not turn off another of the things 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.819
 I like it a lot and that iPhone 5 does not 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.740
 has for example is the customization 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:11.240
 of the LED lights that you have here and 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.400
 that tells you depending on how you 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.050
 configures and the color you get if 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.810
 you are receiving a 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.210
 s a whatsapp or anything else is 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.129
 say it is more customizable the galaxy s3 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.690
 He also has nfc that you already know is 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.129
 this connection by proximity that we 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.990
 allows for example making payments 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.000
 technology to share content on 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.479
 iphone5 works with the play and the galaxy 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.979
 s3 works either with dlna or when the share 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.419
 cast although if there is anything that none of 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:37.159
 you both have and that I would love 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.810
 that they had is the charge by induction 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:40.460
 in neither case does it come from 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.379
 series although you know that you can 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.909
 put training to the breaking blake in 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:45.560
 you we stopped the comparison of iphone 5 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:47.719
 the galaxy s3 to show you some 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.099
 shocking images and is Felix the 

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:51.259
 austrian east that is has gone up to the 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.090
 stratosphere without wings 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:56.300
 although red bulls are supposed to be nothing 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.849
 to launch directly to the earth 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.310
 this must be the panic button that 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:04.250
 right in red voice assistants iphone 5 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.900
 city ​​galaxy s3 is voice while the 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.430
 iphone 5 for example asking what 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.440
 time ago today tells us the time that 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.789
 does the galaxy s3 here asking him what 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.289
 he himself tells us the time he makes in 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:14.030
 cambridge cloud storage 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:17.090
 icloud 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.789
 dropbox operating system and today 6 with the 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.950
 app store app store ' 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:24.590
 Android 4.0 operating system 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.000
 and the imminent living with shop 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.560
 google applications 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.160
 Finally the prices from 669 euros and 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.540
 from 599 euros and which is the best which 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.940
 I buy myself at this point of the 

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.500
 movie at the end the hardware is no longer 

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.570
 so important because both are 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.160
 excellent smartphones so what 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.680
 you have to think is that you are going to 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.210
 use and above all I think that the 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.070
 the most definitive part is going to be the size 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.050
 of the screen if you like the screen 

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.480
 a little smaller or a little bit more 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.500
 great good also the part of money 

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.170
 because yes there is a difference 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.150
 economic between them and you already know that if 

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.160
 you want to know more about smartphones or 

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.960
