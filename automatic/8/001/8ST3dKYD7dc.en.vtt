tension against the door and a key
component<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.330> this<00:02:24.569> door<00:02:25.170> closer<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:26.010> has

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
component to this door closer is it has

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.520 
component to this door closer is it has
an<00:02:26.580> arrow<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.569> gives<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.870> direction<00:02:28.440> of

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
an arrow that gives the direction of

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.100 
an arrow that gives the direction of
which<00:02:28.709> way<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:28.920> springs<00:02:29.489> are<00:02:29.910> wound<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
which way the springs are wound in the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.710 
which way the springs are wound in the
door<00:02:31.319> closer<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.700> rule<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.090> thumb<00:02:33.299> is<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
door closer and the rule of thumb is the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.030 
door closer and the rule of thumb is the
arrow<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.019> going<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.319> pointing<00:02:34.799> towards

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
arrow is going to be pointing towards

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.670 
arrow is going to be pointing towards
the<00:02:35.340> door<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.510> if<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.720> can<00:02:36.959> imagine<00:02:37.230> if<00:02:37.560> we're

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the door so if you can imagine if we're

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.699 
the door so if you can imagine if we're
going<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.860> put<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:39.319> here<00:02:40.319> for<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
going to put this in here for the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.650 
going to put this in here for the
tension<00:02:40.980> tensions<00:02:41.970> what's<00:02:42.209> going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.420> hold

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
tension tensions what's going to hold

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.900 
tension tensions what's going to hold
that<00:02:42.870> against<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> door<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.519> what<00:02:44.700> I'm<00:02:44.790> going

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910

facing towards the door because that's

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.030 
facing towards the door because that's
where<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> tension<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.349> going<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.620> be<00:03:49.800> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
where the tension is going to be and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.759 
where the tension is going to be and
it's<00:03:50.880> going<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.090> start<00:03:51.360> by<00:03:51.480> passing<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.530> one

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769

what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:41.990 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
rotate<00:04:39.060> this<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:40.169> create<00:04:40.620> tension<00:04:41.370> on<00:04:41.550> the

for<00:04:45.419> this<00:04:45.540> particular<00:04:45.870> door<00:04:46.230> because<00:04:46.590> it's<00:04:46.770> a

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
for this particular door because it's a

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.950 
for this particular door because it's a
commercial<00:04:47.160> door<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.850> think<00:04:48.270> I<00:04:48.540> can<00:04:48.720> probably

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
commercial door I think I can probably

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
that I have on it and that's the part

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.350 
that I have on it and that's the part
that's<00:04:56.160> going<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.340> be<00:04:56.460> writing<00:04:56.820> against<00:04:57.090> the

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
that's going to be writing against the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.530 
that's going to be writing against the
the<00:04:57.750> doors<00:04:57.990> this<00:04:58.290> arm<00:04:58.730> now<00:04:59.730> there's<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.970> little

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
it's a pretty simple system so if our

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.180
