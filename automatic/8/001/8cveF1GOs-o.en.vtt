00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.759 

then<00:03:26.320> to<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.800> we're<00:03:27.040> going<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.370> add<00:03:28.380> our<00:03:29.380> dry

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
then to that we're going to add our dry

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:37.670 
then to that we're going to add our dry
ingredients

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.149 

let's<00:03:38.680> stir<00:03:39.099> that<00:03:39.870> until<00:03:40.870> combines<00:03:44.040> now<00:03:45.040> we're

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 
let's stir that until combines now we're

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.309 
let's stir that until combines now we're
going<00:03:45.249> to<00:03:45.340> set<00:03:45.579> this<00:03:45.730> mixture<00:03:46.209> aside<00:03:46.329> for<00:03:46.900> 20

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
going to set this mixture aside for 20

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.949 
going to set this mixture aside for 20
minutes<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.670> it's<00:03:48.819> been<00:03:48.999> 20<00:03:49.359> minutes<00:03:49.389> we're

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
minutes so it's been 20 minutes we're

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.209 
minutes so it's been 20 minutes we're
going<00:03:50.079> to<00:03:50.139> take<00:03:50.439> a<00:03:51.030> sheet<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.269> plastic<00:03:52.629> wrap

and put it on a flat surface for rolling

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.759 
and put it on a flat surface for rolling
out<00:04:00.609> I<00:04:01.120> should<00:04:01.930> have<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.200> rollup<00:04:02.439> we're<00:04:02.650> going

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
out I should have a rollup we're going

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.080 
out I should have a rollup we're going
to<00:04:02.829> Pat<00:04:03.099> out<00:04:03.840> some<00:04:04.840> of<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.200> dough<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:06.849> you<00:04:06.939> want

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
to Pat out some of the dough so you want

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.309 
to Pat out some of the dough so you want
to<00:04:07.180> take<00:04:07.269> about<00:04:07.599> a<00:04:08.099> quarter<00:04:09.099> cup<00:04:09.870> for<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.900> small

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
to take about a quarter cup for a small

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.249 
to take about a quarter cup for a small
or<00:04:11.709> medium<00:04:12.669> sized<00:04:13.000> tortilla<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.310> can<00:04:15.310> use<00:04:15.549> a

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
or medium sized tortilla you can use a

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.170 
or medium sized tortilla you can use a
third<00:04:17.259> of<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.470> cup<00:04:17.650> for<00:04:17.889> a<00:04:17.949> larger<00:04:18.400> one<00:04:18.549> just

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
third of a cup for a larger one just

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.210 
third of a cup for a larger one just
like<00:04:19.329> about<00:04:19.570> nine<00:04:19.840> inches<00:04:20.199> this<00:04:20.889> will<00:04:21.039> make

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
like about nine inches this will make

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:30.960 
like about nine inches this will make
the<00:04:21.370> better<00:04:21.579> seven<00:04:22.090> inch<00:04:29.099> then<00:04:30.099> on<00:04:30.639> top<00:04:30.910> of

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
the better seven inch then on top of

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.909 
the better seven inch then on top of
that<00:04:31.150> we're<00:04:31.419> going<00:04:31.539> to<00:04:31.599> sprinkle<00:04:32.110> on<00:04:32.470> some

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
that we're going to sprinkle on some

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.730 
that we're going to sprinkle on some
potato<00:04:33.430> starch<00:04:33.880> or<00:04:34.810> corn<00:04:35.080> starch

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
potato starch or corn starch

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.460 
potato starch or corn starch
I<00:04:36.120> think<00:04:37.120> potato<00:04:37.419> starch<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:37.870> easier<00:04:38.169> to<00:04:38.320> work

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
I think potato starch is easier to work

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.409 
I think potato starch is easier to work
with<00:04:38.530> myself<00:04:41.340> as<00:04:42.340> soon<00:04:42.520> as<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.669> feel<00:04:42.909> one<00:04:43.150> piece

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
with myself as soon as I feel one piece

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.830 
with myself as soon as I feel one piece
step<00:04:43.840> I<00:04:43.990> add<00:04:44.169> some<00:04:44.409> starch<00:04:44.770> to<00:04:45.009> it<00:04:45.750> and<00:04:46.750> you're

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
step I add some starch to it and you're

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.870 
step I add some starch to it and you're
padding<00:04:47.289> it<00:04:47.409> out<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:47.889> you're<00:04:48.220> pushing<00:04:48.550> out

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:03.310 

try<00:04:56.880> to<00:04:56.940> keep<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.419> a<00:04:57.540> circular<00:04:58.169> shape

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.120 

so<00:05:04.320> just<00:05:04.560> preheat<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:06.560> cast<00:05:07.560> iron<00:05:07.830> skillet

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
so just preheat a cast iron skillet

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.170 
so just preheat a cast iron skillet
preferably<00:05:09.139> over<00:05:10.139> medium-high<00:05:10.590> heat<00:05:11.120> this<00:05:12.120> is

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
preferably over medium-high heat this is

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.830 
preferably over medium-high heat this is
a<00:05:12.389> tortilla<00:05:12.930> that<00:05:13.410> I<00:05:14.039> use<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.910> little<00:05:15.210> saucer

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
a tortilla that I use a little saucer

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.680 
a tortilla that I use a little saucer
and<00:05:16.110> traced<00:05:16.919> around<00:05:20.240> want<00:05:21.240> to<00:05:21.360> give<00:05:21.479> you<00:05:21.600> an

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
and traced around want to give you an

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.090 
and traced around want to give you an
idea<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:22.169> how<00:05:22.800> it<00:05:22.979> would<00:05:23.100> look<00:05:24.440> more<00:05:25.440> perfectly

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
idea of how it would look more perfectly

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.320 
idea of how it would look more perfectly
shaped<00:05:26.400> my<00:05:27.800> saucer<00:05:28.800> wasn't<00:05:29.160> exactly<00:05:29.550> round<00:05:30.000> it

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
shaped my saucer wasn't exactly round it

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:41.809 
shaped my saucer wasn't exactly round it
was<00:05:30.449> close<00:05:30.690> enough

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:55.140 

this<00:05:42.300> is<00:05:42.360> a<00:05:42.389> good<00:05:42.539> lunch<00:05:42.749> size<00:05:43.050> too

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.860 

now<00:05:55.720> in<00:05:55.990> between<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.800> cooking<00:05:57.220> of<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:58.630> first

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
now in between the cooking of the first

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.010 
now in between the cooking of the first
and<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.169> second<00:05:59.560> one<00:05:59.680> what<00:06:00.130> I<00:06:00.160> did<00:06:00.550> was<00:06:01.020> turn

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
and the second one what I did was turn

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.710 
and the second one what I did was turn
the<00:06:02.320> skillet<00:06:03.190> off<00:06:03.370> or<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.910> burner<00:06:04.150> off<00:06:04.270> and

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
the skillet off or the burner off and

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.240 
the skillet off or the burner off and
this<00:06:07.720> way<00:06:07.870> it<00:06:07.990> gives<00:06:08.169> it<00:06:08.350> the<00:06:08.470> chance<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:09.010> cool

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
this way it gives it the chance to cool

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.830 
this way it gives it the chance to cool
down<00:06:09.280> a<00:06:09.490> little<00:06:09.669> bit<00:06:10.120> and<00:06:10.750> when<00:06:10.870> you<00:06:10.960> put<00:06:11.229> the

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
down a little bit and when you put the

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.830 
down a little bit and when you put the
plastic<00:06:13.840> wrap<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.470> it<00:06:14.560> gets<00:06:14.860> on<00:06:15.100> to<00:06:15.840> the

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
plastic wrap and it gets on to the

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.620 
plastic wrap and it gets on to the
skillet<00:06:17.260> you<00:06:17.889> don't<00:06:18.040> have<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.430> worry<00:06:18.729> about<00:06:19.090> it

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
skillet you don't have to worry about it

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.719 
skillet you don't have to worry about it
melting<00:06:21.240> because<00:06:22.240> that's<00:06:22.510> really<00:06:22.720> important

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
melting because that's really important

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:28.920 
melting because that's really important
to<00:06:24.729> use<00:06:25.000> that<00:06:25.240> plastic<00:06:25.750> wrap<00:06:25.900> you<00:06:27.660> can<00:06:28.660> either

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
to use that plastic wrap you can either

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.779 
to use that plastic wrap you can either
cook<00:06:29.169> it<00:06:29.350> on<00:06:29.500> one<00:06:29.770> side<00:06:29.979> till<00:06:30.220> it<00:06:30.310> gets<00:06:30.490> brown

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
cook it on one side till it gets brown

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:41.670
