00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:20.310
 for the attached potato appliance 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.360
 gl 34 k now offers grimme one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.400
 steam forming 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.260
 We have the machine at the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.900
 Dutch contractor day 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.900
 cargo viewed last spring 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.260
 the laying machine was on a john 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.870
 Deere tractors 74 30 attached to the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.990
 plant bed preparing in front high mountain 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.560
 with the tine rotor RT 300 from Grimma 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.560
 worked 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.680
 The gl 34h was with a hydraulic 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.909
 single row drive equipped with 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.460
 over the terminal gbt 2100 of the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 Plant distance of each row individually 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.600
 set and in passengers 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.600
 automatically be planted closer 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.860
 for the best possible 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.650
 quality of work but also about the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.270
 Lifting power needs to be kept within limits 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.280
 the tools were used for steam forming 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.730
 from the outset into the empty machine 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.730
 integrated 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.000
 then works with this system 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.920
 grim the motto it will not earth 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.030
 condenses the later for the dam 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.030
 construction is needed 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.840
 The tine rotor initially provides for the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.700
 correspondingly deep crumbs around the floor 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.070
 and the deformation of the potato dam 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.590
 in the deep adjustable Zinke next to 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.920
 pulling the furrows loosen the ground and 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.140
 pull a groove in this role 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.870
 the big ones too thick and devilish 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.760
 in the entire loose ground before the 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.760
 wheels destroy the ground again 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.390
 The steam-formed sheets are made of stainless steel 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.830
 if possible without additional pressure 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.830
 dam their final form 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.840
 next to the summary of 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.110
 is characterized by the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.000
 four-row gl 34 came with steam formation 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.000
 by a comparatively small amount 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.600
 tug power requirement from grimme 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.600
 gives here without tine rotor 130 ps
