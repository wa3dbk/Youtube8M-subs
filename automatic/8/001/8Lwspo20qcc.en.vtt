of<00:00:56.750> Britain<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.870> believe<00:00:58.199> yes<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> when

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
of Britain I believe yes and and when

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
of Britain I believe yes and and when
the<00:00:59.820> settlers<00:01:00.239> came<00:01:00.510> over<00:01:00.899> they<00:01:01.350> were<00:01:01.410> warring

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the settlers came over they were warring

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.609 
the settlers came over they were warring
with<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.280> Indians<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.180> who<00:01:03.420> used<00:01:03.809> red

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
with the Indians up there who used red

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.100 
with the Indians up there who used red
paint<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.760> right<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> ritual<00:01:06.810> before

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
paint all right that was a ritual before

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
paint all right that was a ritual before
they<00:01:07.320> fought<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.610> therefore<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.390> word

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
they fought so therefore the word

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.250 
they fought so therefore the word
Redskins<00:01:10.409> meant<00:01:10.860> Indian<00:01:11.790> fighters<00:01:12.330> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
Redskins meant Indian fighters and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.859 
Redskins meant Indian fighters and
that's<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> came<00:01:13.799> into<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.280> lexicon<00:01:14.869> so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that's how it came into the lexicon so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.380 
that's how it came into the lexicon so
now<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.490> politically<00:01:18.210> correct

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
now we have a a politically correct

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.690 
now we have a a politically correct
society<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:20.009> saying<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.430> with<00:01:20.549> any

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
society and I'm not saying that with any

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.370 
society and I'm not saying that with any
derision<00:01:21.150> although<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.930> think<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
derision although I don't think it's a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
derision although I don't think it's a
healthy<00:01:22.740> thing<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.729> be<00:01:23.850> overly<00:01:24.420> politically

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
healthy thing to be overly politically

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.270 
healthy thing to be overly politically
correct<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.560> saying<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.189> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
correct but I'm not saying that in this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.550 
correct but I'm not saying that in this
case<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.700> any<00:01:26.820> division<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.409> is

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
case with any division that that is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.340 
case with any division that that is
going<00:01:28.950> after<00:01:29.100> Redskins<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> sounds

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
going after Redskins because it sounds

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.859 
going after Redskins because it sounds
like<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.220> pigmentation<00:01:33.150> discussion<00:01:33.720> when

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
like it's a pigmentation discussion when

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.590 
like it's a pigmentation discussion when
it<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.229> isn't<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.100> say<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.759> say

intending any malice any abuse but I

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.199 
intending any malice any abuse but I
believe<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:06.299> words<00:02:06.719> change<00:02:07.530> over<00:02:08.099> time<00:02:08.340> they
