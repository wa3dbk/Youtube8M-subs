favorite things about it is it has the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.370 
favorite things about it is it has the
analog<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.550> digital<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.689> have<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> ease

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
analog and digital so you have the ease

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.350 
analog and digital so you have the ease
of<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.890> looking<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.369> seeing<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.790> time<00:00:33.059> on

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
of just looking and seeing the time on

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.170 
of just looking and seeing the time on
the<00:00:33.960> digital<00:00:34.350> screen<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> same<00:00:35.850> time

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the digital screen but at the same time

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.470 
the digital screen but at the same time
you<00:00:36.920> have<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.100> analog<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.910> gives<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you have the analog and gives it that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110 
you have the analog and gives it that
nice<00:00:39.780> look<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:41.250> left<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.969> see

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
nice look on the left here you can see

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.690 
nice look on the left here you can see
this<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.420> dial<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.170> can't<00:00:44.129> really<00:00:44.340> tell<00:00:44.670> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
this little dial I can't really tell you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.590 
this little dial I can't really tell you
what<00:00:45.020> it<00:00:46.020> does<00:00:46.230> or<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.920> works<00:00:47.160> but<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.149> put

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
what it does or how it works but you put

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
what it does or how it works but you put
it<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.780> stopwatch<00:00:49.350> mode<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.579> start

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
it in stopwatch mode and then you start

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.430 
it in stopwatch mode and then you start
and<00:00:50.940> stop<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> stopwatch<00:00:51.510> down<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and stop the stopwatch down here and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
and stop the stopwatch down here and
then<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.399> supposed<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> tell<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> your

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
then it's supposed to tell you your

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.520 
then it's supposed to tell you your
speed<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.960> something<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.039> that<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.579> so

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
speed or something like that and so

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.170 
speed or something like that and so
based<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.070> time<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.640> stopped<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
based on the time that you stopped it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.500 
based on the time that you stopped it
I'll<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> tell<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:02.390> after<00:01:03.390> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
I'll just and tell you that after the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.789 
I'll just and tell you that after the
stopwatch<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> timer<00:01:05.689> then<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.229> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
stopwatch you have a timer then it this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.490 
stopwatch you have a timer then it this
gives<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> world<00:01:08.580> time<00:01:09.020> for<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.350> could

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
gives you the world time for you could

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.660 
gives you the world time for you could
just<00:01:10.650> scroll<00:01:10.920> through<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> different

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.580 
kind of stuff I forgot how many it has a
ridiculous<00:01:21.240> number<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:22.159> time<00:01:23.159> zones<00:01:23.189> though

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
ridiculous number of time zones though

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.740 
ridiculous number of time zones though
after<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:26.159> an<00:01:26.430> alarm<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.090> really

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
after that you have an alarm I really

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
after that you have an alarm I really
don't<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.710> alarm<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> much<00:01:29.369> but<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
don't use the alarm that much but you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.620 
don't use the alarm that much but you
have<00:01:29.939> two<00:01:30.119> alarms<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:32.400> use<00:01:32.579> your<00:01:33.240> watch

have two alarms so if you use your watch

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140 
have two alarms so if you use your watch
alarm<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.680> have<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.070> option<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.939> and

alarm you have that option on here and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.170 
alarm you have that option on here and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
then we're back to the home screen from

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.840 
then we're back to the home screen from
here<00:01:39.450> if<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.570> hit<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> forward<00:01:40.200> button<00:01:40.850> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
here if you hit the forward button you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.109 
here if you hit the forward button you
could<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.950> it'll<00:01:43.950> tell<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> date<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
could see it'll tell you the date on the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.289 
could see it'll tell you the date on the
bottom<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.899> today<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.619> June<00:01:46.860> 24th<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:48.119> then

bottom so today is June 24th and then

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.230 
bottom so today is June 24th and then
I'll<00:01:48.509> scroll<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.960> between<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.770> time

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
I'll scroll in between that and the time

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.410 
I'll scroll in between that and the time
it<00:01:51.240> does<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:53.189> military<00:01:53.399> time<00:01:53.939> option

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420

then scroll through mode until you see
that<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.119> did<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.079> little<00:02:01.229> bit<00:02:01.380> but

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
that I I did that for a little bit but

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.429 
that I I did that for a little bit but
then<00:02:01.979> I<00:02:02.280> realized<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.840> used<00:02:04.110> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
then I realized I was just so used to
