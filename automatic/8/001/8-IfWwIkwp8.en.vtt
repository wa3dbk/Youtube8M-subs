during the winter as I said the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.300 
during the winter as I said the
mid-twenties<00:01:06.450> Fahrenheit<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.530> very<00:01:07.799> common

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
really occur in a large profusion over a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.260 
really occur in a large profusion over a
long<00:01:43.140> period<00:01:43.740> they<00:01:44.670> start<00:01:45.030> blooming

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
long period they start blooming

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
fall so they're very long lasting bloom

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.480 
fall so they're very long lasting bloom
as<00:01:51.329> well<00:01:52.020> as<00:01:52.200> quite<00:01:52.500> unique<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.310> these

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.090 
stems here and then a little detail of
the<00:01:56.310> succulent<00:01:56.880> leaves<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:58.469> heads<00:01:58.710> kind

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
the succulent leaves and the heads kind

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.179 
the succulent leaves and the heads kind
of<00:01:59.250> nod<00:01:59.520> before<00:02:00.149> they<00:02:00.329> open<00:02:00.689> up<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.079> start<00:02:02.009> to

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
of nod before they open up and start to

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.560 
of nod before they open up and start to
bloom<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:03.890> so<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> like<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.420> in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
bloom so so what I like about it in

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.889 
bloom so so what I like about it in
terms<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.759> design<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.660> good

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
terms of design is that it's a good

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.380 
terms of design is that it's a good
foreground<00:02:10.560> plant<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.489> can<00:02:11.670> see<00:02:11.910> here

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
foreground plant as you can see here

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.770 
foreground plant as you can see here
it's<00:02:12.660> right<00:02:12.989> up<00:02:13.170> next<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.590> a

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.290 
very little water once it's established
and<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.870> highly<00:02:37.870> regarded<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.940> in<00:02:39.940> that

way to also deer resistant it's as most

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.280 
way to also deer resistant it's as most
succulents<00:02:46.120> are<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.510> deer<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:46.959> really

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.979 
succulents are the deer don't really
like<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.860> plant<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.640> my<00:02:49.150> luck<00:02:49.390> with<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:49.810> has

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
like this plant so my luck with this has

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.630 
like this plant so my luck with this has
been<00:02:50.200> very<00:02:50.440> good<00:02:50.709> in<00:02:50.890> terms<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.370> deer

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
been very good in terms of deer

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.440 
been very good in terms of deer
resistance<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:53.580> that's<00:02:54.580> what<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:55.060> tell<00:02:55.300> you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
resistance so that's what I can tell you

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.930 
resistance so that's what I can tell you
in<00:02:55.540> terms<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.080> design<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.739> prefers<00:02:57.160> full<00:02:57.519> Sun

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
in terms of design it prefers full Sun

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.670 
in terms of design it prefers full Sun
by<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.269> way<00:02:58.600> most<00:02:59.019> succulents<00:02:59.890> do<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:01.680> very

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
by the way most succulents do and very

by the way most succulents do and very
as<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.220> said<00:03:03.489> very<00:03:03.760> heat<00:03:04.150> tolerant<00:03:04.800> plants<00:03:05.800> get

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
as I said very heat tolerant plants get

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.699 
as I said very heat tolerant plants get
about<00:03:06.340> eight<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.450> twelve<00:03:07.630> inches<00:03:08.140> high<00:03:08.410> by<00:03:08.680> the
