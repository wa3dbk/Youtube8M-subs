00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.020
 exercise of tomina them in cojÃ­mar together or cross with legs supported in 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.230
 flat bank this exercise has a low execution difficulty 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.279
 anatomical position lying face up or what is the same in supine position 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.830
 legs flexed at 90 degrees and feet supported by heels on a bench 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:27.859
 flat 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.079
 the legs should be relaxed stur before the whole exercise 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.989
 The head will not be flexed at any time of the exercise 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.020
 this means that the separation between the chin and the chest should be the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 same throughout the exercise 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.630
 that distance will be about the size of our fist 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.320
 initial position of the exercise the initial position and we will get it 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.440
 slightly lifting shoulders and head off the ground 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.210
 carrying out the exercise from the initial position with the shoulders 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.610
 scapulae and the head slightly separated from the ground will inspire and 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.000
 we will perform a strong but controlled contraction of the abdominals 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.720
 higher 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.780
 this will cause the shoulders and scapulae to rise to the final position 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.270
 in this final position expire we have and we will stop a few moments 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.940
 now we will descend until just before the shoulders touch the ground and 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.540
 we will start the movement again 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.710
 we must pay special attention to the lower back or lower back 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.350
 This must remain stuck to the ground throughout the exercise for this 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.520
 we will exert constant pressure towards the ground of that area this action of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.490
 strongly stick the lower back to the ground still mention the intensity of 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.830
 exercise 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.070
 the hands should be placed next to the head but they should only touch the head 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.020
 the fingertips 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.120
 At no time during the exercise should we help our hands to climb 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.330
 the log 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
 the movement should be slow and controlled at all times 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.890
 the working range of this exercise is very short it starts with a flexion of 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.810
 trunk of about 5 or 10 degrees and ends between 30 or 35 degrees with respect to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.159
 ground
