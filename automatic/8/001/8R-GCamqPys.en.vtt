00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.319
 and greet his matches at lma and you 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:07.779
 seek to become stronger here are two 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:16.750
 exercises to work the legs without 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:18.370
 gear I really mean without gear 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.289
 we see a lot of things on the net 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.890
 the guys who stage tractions there 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.960
 world and flags of chickens up of 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.730
 push is a lot of stuff to do the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.880
 arm in the end but for the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.420
 legs of the blow as we do here are two 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.819
 drill 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.429
 a little bit advanced not necessarily easy 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:39.640
 to do but I'll show you the 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:42.129
 evolutionary stages to arrive at 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.399
 start quiet and finish with 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.100
 really the exercises force so these 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.449
 two exo where we need nothing so 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.039
 even if you are in the hotel room 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.979
 on the beach where he has nothing 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.899
 raised not even a stone not even a 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:57.639
 tree trunk not even a tassel that 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.269
 go through there no you could serve you 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:00.670
 as charge 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.339
 you can do it so it's the pistols 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.280
 squats then trackers the squat actually 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.670
 that's it on one leg and it makes a 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.720
 reason so there are two forms and at the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.960
 shape where is going to be 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.460
 legs back and the weight towards 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.230
 the front so we have the column rather 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.600
 leaning it means that when we go 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.700
 lower 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.280
 it's mostly the ass that will work for 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.500
 back up there is the leg shape forward 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.710
 so here we have the right back center of 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.390
 gravity so rather backwards finally 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.000
 we manage to keep it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.590
 always in the middle above the middle 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.080
 of the foot is the correct form of 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.970
 no matter what she squat finally 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.830
 but we are really in 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.150
 back so when we go down it's 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.030
 especially knee that will fold so here it is 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.650
 mainly the quads that work 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.979
 so the stage we will say intermediate 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.830
 before we get to that, it's with the help of 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.900
 of a support so to start more 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.640
 quiet I want to be like that I put 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.649
 having a leg we press it allows 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.020
 to better manage the balanced and it allows 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.900
 also to be able to help strong level if you 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.980
 have passed so it's the same for me 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.920
 lean forward 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.500
 I go down and I go back and I can 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.640
 help me a little bit with this leg the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.400
 if necessary 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.870
 so after you to judge you can not anymore 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.850
 or less transferred power on 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.850
 your back leg that will help you 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.290
 take more support or on the contrary the 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.269
 to do more or less 100 for 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.120
 practically in the end came that 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.200
 it barely touches uncle support and you 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.269
 are going to be there yeah important when you 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.220
 do it always have to maintain the 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.140
 trajectory of the game we need not that the 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.070
 leg gets called inwards 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.140
 outwards 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.180
 there you hurt your knee we are when 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.380
 even on one leg squat so that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.640
 still does a little bit of a charge 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.870
 heavy 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.670
 from there there may be a risk of 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.010
 injury if your knee starts from all 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.790
 sides so the same here we have both 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.790
 forms forward and backward 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:17.290
 here after there is the ultimate form it is 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.840
 when you do it on a support so there 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.120
 you can really go down and 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.120
 the thur goes up 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.930
 Oh 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.500
 here 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.070
 for the mecca two leg exercises 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.290
 without gear anything at all you can 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.510
 to do absolutely anywhere 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.880
 pistoles squat with two inclinations 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.230
 different to work rather the 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.989
 glutes or quads 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.450
 if you have comments but the ones 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.280
 below it will be a pleasure to read you at 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.700
 soon for more videos on 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.700
 other exercises
