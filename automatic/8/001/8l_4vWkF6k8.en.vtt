in front of the coil and just show you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
in front of the coil and just show you
the<00:00:45.840> sound<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.320> hope<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.890> hear<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> I'm

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
the sound I hope you can hear that I'm

going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.670> set<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> camera<00:00:48.090> over<00:00:48.360> here<00:00:48.480> where

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
going to set the camera over here where

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.520 
going to set the camera over here where
you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.020> try<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> hopefully<00:00:49.890> hear<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:51.530> see

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you can try to hopefully hear it see

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:06.200 
you can try to hopefully hear it see
that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.540 

alright<00:01:07.210> that's<00:01:07.360> about<00:01:07.480> 8<00:01:07.780> inches<00:01:08.110> away

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
alright that's about 8 inches away

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.220 
alright that's about 8 inches away
before<00:01:09.550> I<00:01:09.580> actually<00:01:09.760> get<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.120> good<00:01:10.570> sell<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> good

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
before I actually get a good sell a good

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.810 
before I actually get a good sell a good
repeatable<00:01:11.800> signal<00:01:12.040> that<00:01:12.340> I'd<00:01:12.430> be<00:01:12.610> able<00:01:12.730> to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
repeatable signal that I'd be able to

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.040 
repeatable signal that I'd be able to
hear<00:01:13.060> out<00:01:13.210> in<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.390> relic<00:01:13.690> woods<00:01:15.900> from<00:01:16.900> the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
hear out in the relic woods from the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.990 
hear out in the relic woods from the
side<00:01:17.290> it's<00:01:17.620> probably<00:01:18.190> also<00:01:18.730> 8<00:01:19.180> inches<00:01:19.420> or<00:01:19.570> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.260 

you<00:01:25.000> know<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:26.200> gonna<00:01:26.380> switch<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:26.740> over<00:01:26.980> to<00:01:30.270> now

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
you know I'm gonna switch it over to now

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.570 
you know I'm gonna switch it over to now
we're<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.540> prospecting<00:01:32.170> mode<00:01:32.410> now<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.190> sound

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
we're in prospecting mode now the sound

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.430 
we're in prospecting mode now the sound
is<00:01:33.760> obviously<00:01:34.300> different<00:01:34.720> or<00:01:34.870> okay<00:01:35.140> this<00:01:35.320> is

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
is obviously different or okay this is

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.680 
is obviously different or okay this is
like<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.710> were<00:01:35.830> talking<00:01:36.220> about<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:37.420> the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
like you were talking about and the the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.390 
like you were talking about and the the
difference<00:01:38.110> is<00:01:38.260> so<00:01:38.440> noticeable<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.040> me<00:01:39.190> if<00:01:39.280> you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
difference is so noticeable to me if you

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:51.220 
difference is so noticeable to me if you
watch<00:01:39.610> here<00:01:42.540> if<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.660> can<00:01:43.780> hear<00:01:43.960> that

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.600 

it<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.100> it<00:01:52.400> is<00:01:52.460> quite<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.150> bit<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.540> difference<00:01:54.020> in

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
it is it is quite a bit of difference in

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.730 
it is it is quite a bit of difference in
the<00:01:55.610> ability<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.060> get<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.360> signal<00:01:56.900> further<00:01:57.500> away

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
the ability to get a signal further away

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.310 
the ability to get a signal further away
from<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.980> coil<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:02.720> subtle<00:02:03.080> but<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:06.170> does

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
from the coil it's subtle but it does

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.450 
from the coil it's subtle but it does
make<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.590> big<00:02:06.620> difference<00:02:06.740> I'm<00:02:07.130> gonna<00:02:07.250> turn<00:02:07.340> the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
make a big difference I'm gonna turn the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.420 
make a big difference I'm gonna turn the
gaining<00:02:07.730> up<00:02:07.820> see<00:02:08.030> how<00:02:08.090> much<00:02:08.210> I<00:02:08.360> can<00:02:08.480> do

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
gaining up see how much I can do

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.830 
gaining up see how much I can do
okay<00:02:10.430> right<00:02:10.670> now<00:02:10.820> this<00:02:11.030> machine<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.360> cranked

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
okay right now this machine is cranked

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.080 
okay right now this machine is cranked
out<00:02:11.930> of<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> frame<00:02:12.500> on<00:02:12.830> prospecting<00:02:13.790> mode<00:02:13.970> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
out of the frame on prospecting mode and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.370 
out of the frame on prospecting mode and
let's<00:02:14.210> see<00:02:14.300> how<00:02:14.360> far<00:02:14.570> away<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:14.900> cleaner<00:02:15.200> will

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
let's see how far away this cleaner will

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.180 
let's see how far away this cleaner will
pick<00:02:15.530> up

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.250 

I<00:02:24.310> can<00:02:25.000> pick<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.180> up<00:02:25.300> pretty<00:02:25.420> solid<00:02:25.780> at<00:02:26.080> about

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
I can pick it up pretty solid at about

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.810 
I can pick it up pretty solid at about
1618<00:02:26.980> inches<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:29.130> don't<00:02:30.130> know<00:02:30.250> exactly<00:02:30.370> what

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
1618 inches I don't know exactly what

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.130 
1618 inches I don't know exactly what
that<00:02:30.850> measurement<00:02:31.270> is<00:02:31.510> but<00:02:31.690> I<00:02:31.720> used<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.990> be<00:02:32.050> a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
that measurement is but I used to be a

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.340 
that measurement is but I used to be a
carpenter<00:02:32.410> I'd<00:02:32.800> say<00:02:32.980> that's<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.930> that's

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
carpenter I'd say that's that's that's

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.440 
carpenter I'd say that's that's that's
approaching<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.920> good<00:02:36.100> 16<00:02:36.550> maybe<00:02:36.760> 17<00:02:36.880> inches

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
approaching a good 16 maybe 17 inches

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.010 
approaching a good 16 maybe 17 inches
away<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:38.230> made<00:02:39.220> this<00:02:39.370> video<00:02:39.630> too

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
away so I made this video too

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.580 
away so I made this video too
I<00:02:42.300> wasn't<00:02:43.300> even<00:02:43.420> gonna<00:02:43.570> make<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.780> video<00:02:44.020> until<00:02:44.560> I

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
I wasn't even gonna make a video until I

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.480 
I wasn't even gonna make a video until I
did<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.250> air<00:02:45.490> test<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:45.940> my<00:02:46.090> own<00:02:46.240> at<00:02:46.510> home<00:02:47.490> and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
did this air test on my own at home and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.700 
did this air test on my own at home and
I<00:02:48.580> saw<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.880> difference<00:02:49.390> and<00:02:49.630> after<00:02:50.470> seeing

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
I saw the difference and after seeing

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.670 
I saw the difference and after seeing
how<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.700> big<00:02:52.000> difference<00:02:52.420> between<00:02:52.680> relic

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
how the big difference between relic

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.400 
how the big difference between relic
mode<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.270> prospecting<00:02:55.270> mode<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.630> MXT<00:02:55.960> I

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
mode and prospecting mode on the MXT I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.770 
mode and prospecting mode on the MXT I
thought<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.310> was<00:02:57.430> probably<00:02:57.730> worth<00:02:58.240> making<00:02:58.690> a

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
thought it was probably worth making a

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.540 
thought it was probably worth making a
video<00:02:59.080> just<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.590> show<00:02:59.620> other<00:02:59.950> folks<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.460> I'm

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
video just to show other folks and I'm

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.980 
video just to show other folks and I'm
gonna<00:03:00.670> test<00:03:00.970> prospecting<00:03:01.570> mode<00:03:01.750> pretty

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
gonna test prospecting mode pretty

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.070 
gonna test prospecting mode pretty
