00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
crazy but I didn't think of this theory

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.310 
crazy but I didn't think of this theory

you<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.320> all<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.059> look<00:00:39.210> at

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
you think all right so if you look at

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.500 
you think all right so if you look at
the<00:00:39.660> sign<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.350> says<00:00:41.100> demon<00:00:41.700> instead<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.239> baby

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the sign it says demon instead of baby

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.430 
the sign it says demon instead of baby
because<00:00:43.020> baby<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.530> crossed<00:00:43.829> out<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:45.090> is

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
because baby is crossed out and this is

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.680 
because baby is crossed out and this is
really<00:00:46.440> odd<00:00:46.680> because<00:00:47.340> we're<00:00:48.090> meant<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> take

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
really odd because we're meant to take

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.660 
really odd because we're meant to take
everything<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.530> gravity<00:00:49.890> falls<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> joke

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
everything in gravity falls as a joke

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.630 
everything in gravity falls as a joke
and<00:00:51.020> similar<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> way<00:00:52.559> bill<00:00:53.010> said<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and similar to the way bill said that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.170 
and similar to the way bill said that
the<00:00:54.329> fat<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:55.050> smarter<00:00:55.559> aka<00:00:56.160> soos<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
the fat one was smarter aka soos the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.670 
the fat one was smarter aka soos the
handyman<00:00:57.660> knows<00:00:57.840> more<00:00:58.020> than<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.199> think

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
error in the story or could it be

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
error in the story or could it be

trying to hide his true identity and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.289 
trying to hide his true identity and
he's<00:01:33.750> actually<00:01:33.960> like<00:01:34.380> really<00:01:34.799> older<00:01:35.280> he's<00:01:36.000> not

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
all right so you're probably wondering

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.190 
all right so you're probably wondering
why<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.850> possible<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.570> Gideon<00:01:42.780> isn't

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
why it's possible that Gideon isn't

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
why it's possible that Gideon isn't
vampire<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.890> any<00:01:44.070> other<00:01:44.280> monster<00:01:44.790> well<00:01:45.390> if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
vampire not any other monster well if

you look into the bunker when there are

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
you look into the bunker when there are

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
face looks exactly like gideon when he's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.260 
face looks exactly like gideon when he's
doing<00:02:01.049> his<00:02:01.170> little<00:02:01.380> pose<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.850> really

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
doing his little pose and this is really

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.240 
doing his little pose and this is really
weird<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.810> supposed<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> really

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
weird this is supposed to be a really

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.999 
weird this is supposed to be a really
subtle<00:02:05.610> hint<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.420> not<00:02:06.689> gonna<00:02:06.869> mean<00:02:07.079> much<00:02:07.350> but

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
subtle hint it's not gonna mean much but

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.440 
subtle hint it's not gonna mean much but
it<00:02:08.520> means<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> long<00:02:09.629> run<00:02:09.869> if<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
it means a lot in the long run if you

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.750 
it means a lot in the long run if you
actually<00:02:10.810> look<00:02:11.050> deeper<00:02:11.440> into<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.890> because<00:02:12.040> the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
actually look deeper into it because the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.150 
actually look deeper into it because the
vampire<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.569> making<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.020> same<00:02:14.260> exact<00:02:14.650> pose<00:02:14.920> as

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
vampire is making the same exact pose as

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.460 
vampire is making the same exact pose as
gideon<00:02:15.610> would<00:02:15.879> with<00:02:16.269> his<00:02:16.450> normal<00:02:16.870> pose<00:02:17.110> so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
gideon would with his normal pose so

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.580 
gideon would with his normal pose so
that's<00:02:17.680> really<00:02:18.040> interesting<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:19.349> Gideon<00:02:20.349> has

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
that's really interesting so Gideon has

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.070 
that's really interesting so Gideon has
five<00:02:20.950> fingers<00:02:21.250> similar<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.510> adults<00:02:22.959> and

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
five fingers similar to the adults and

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.259 
five fingers similar to the adults and
gravity<00:02:23.470> falls<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:24.040> while<00:02:24.730> some<00:02:25.000> say<00:02:25.239> that

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
gravity falls and while some say that

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.660 
gravity falls and while some say that
the<00:02:25.629> fingers<00:02:26.019> are<00:02:26.050> just<00:02:26.260> four<00:02:26.980> designed<00:02:27.430> to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the fingers are just four designed to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.670 
the fingers are just four designed to
see<00:02:27.880> if<00:02:28.209> they<00:02:28.540> look<00:02:28.780> better<00:02:28.959> with<00:02:29.260> four<00:02:29.560> or

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
see if they look better with four or

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.650 
see if they look better with four or
five<00:02:29.920> on<00:02:29.950> certain<00:02:30.459> characters<00:02:30.910> there<00:02:31.450> could

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
five on certain characters there could

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.300 
five on certain characters there could
be<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.780> secret<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> them<00:02:32.410> because<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:32.860> comic-con

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
be a secret to them because in comic-con

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
4 2013 Alex Hirsch was asked why Gideon

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.390 
4 2013 Alex Hirsch was asked why Gideon
has<00:02:37.180> five<00:02:37.480> fingers<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.140> he<00:02:38.560> did<00:02:38.799> not<00:02:38.950> answer

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
has five fingers and he did not answer

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.970 
has five fingers and he did not answer
because<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:40.269> answer<00:02:40.299> would<00:02:41.049> be<00:02:41.110> something

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
because the answer would be something

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.940 
because the answer would be something
spoilery<00:02:42.940> so<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.720> possible<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.739> just

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
spoilery so it's possible this is just

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.650 
spoilery so it's possible this is just
speculation<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.790> it's<00:02:45.910> definitely<00:02:46.090> possible

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
speculation but it's definitely possible

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.770 
speculation but it's definitely possible
for<00:02:47.349> Gideon<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.920> be<00:02:48.040> older<00:02:48.400> than<00:02:48.579> we<00:02:48.760> think<00:02:49.090> in

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
for Gideon to be older than we think in

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.430 
for Gideon to be older than we think in

deed to the mystery shack is called
grandpa<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.650> kid<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.160> this<00:03:00.849> is<00:03:01.090> like<00:03:01.390> an<00:03:01.569> old

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
grandpa the kid and this is like an old

grandpa the kid and this is like an old
person<00:03:02.230> posing<00:03:02.650> as<00:03:02.769> a<00:03:02.799> kid<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.370> since<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.450> is

person posing as a kid and since this is

person posing as a kid and since this is
right<00:03:04.989> after<00:03:05.500> Gideon

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
right after Gideon

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.819 
right after Gideon
we<00:03:06.579> can<00:03:06.790> assume<00:03:07.209> that<00:03:07.510> they<00:03:08.110> are<00:03:08.260> related

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:08.829 
we can assume that they are related

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.759 
we can assume that they are related
because<00:03:08.950> it's<00:03:09.370> right<00:03:09.700> after<00:03:10.290> more<00:03:11.290> evidence

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
because it's right after more evidence

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.830 
because it's right after more evidence
for<00:03:12.040> Gideon<00:03:12.250> being<00:03:12.700> older<00:03:13.060> than<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.329> think<00:03:13.569> is

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
for Gideon being older than we think is

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.530 
for Gideon being older than we think is
the<00:03:14.410> fact<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.739> he<00:03:14.889> has<00:03:15.040> white<00:03:15.579> hair<00:03:15.609> even

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
the fact that he has white hair even

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.539 
the fact that he has white hair even
when<00:03:16.690> he's<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> baby<00:03:17.200> that's<00:03:17.500> really<00:03:17.829> weird<00:03:18.250> and

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
when he's a baby that's really weird and

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.300 
when he's a baby that's really weird and
he<00:03:19.269> dresses<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:19.870> an<00:03:20.019> old<00:03:20.139> person<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.769> in

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
he dresses like an old person and in

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.270 
he dresses like an old person and in
season<00:03:21.819> 1<00:03:22.120> episode<00:03:22.569> 4<00:03:22.900> he<00:03:23.530> danced<00:03:24.010> for<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
season 1 episode 4 he danced for a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.370 
season 1 episode 4 he danced for a
little<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:24.850> immediately<00:03:25.389> got<00:03:25.600> tired<00:03:25.959> after

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
little and immediately got tired after

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.830 
little and immediately got tired after
that<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.639> what<00:03:28.180> old<00:03:28.359> people<00:03:28.720> do

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
that and that is what old people do

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.289 
that and that is what old people do
because<00:03:29.139> they<00:03:29.410> do<00:03:29.980> small<00:03:30.459> activities<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
because they do small activities and

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.000 
because they do small activities and
then<00:03:31.690> they<00:03:31.780> just<00:03:31.959> get<00:03:32.139> really<00:03:32.170> tired<00:03:32.769> after

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
then they just get really tired after

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.890 
then they just get really tired after
because<00:03:33.519> it's<00:03:33.670> really<00:03:34.060> hard<00:03:34.269> for<00:03:34.329> them<00:03:34.569> to<00:03:34.720> do

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
because it's really hard for them to do

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.080 
because it's really hard for them to do
but<00:03:35.290> when<00:03:35.620> Gideon<00:03:35.859> does<00:03:36.310> that<00:03:36.549> and<00:03:36.760> he's<00:03:36.880> so

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
but when Gideon does that and he's so

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.330 
but when Gideon does that and he's so
young<00:03:37.389> one<00:03:37.989> should<00:03:38.380> question<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:39.069> Gideon

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
young one should question that Gideon

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.270 
young one should question that Gideon
also<00:03:39.940> uses<00:03:40.299> words<00:03:40.660> that<00:03:40.900> grunkle<00:03:41.799> Stan<00:03:42.010> even

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
also uses words that grunkle Stan even

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.770 
also uses words that grunkle Stan even
comments<00:03:42.670> on<00:03:42.790> he<00:03:43.000> doesn't<00:03:43.299> know<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.750> meaning

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
comments on he doesn't know the meaning

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.590 
comments on he doesn't know the meaning
of<00:03:44.260> Gideon's<00:03:44.859> words<00:03:45.160> and<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:46.000> just<00:03:46.329> weird

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
of Gideon's words and it's just weird

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.990 
of Gideon's words and it's just weird
because<00:03:46.840> how<00:03:47.470> could<00:03:47.769> such<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> young<00:03:48.400> kid<00:03:48.670> have

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
because how could such a young kid have

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.660 
because how could such a young kid have
such<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.299> varied<00:03:49.810> vocabulary<00:03:50.769> unless<00:03:51.310> he's

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
such a varied vocabulary unless he's

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.390 
such a varied vocabulary unless he's
older<00:03:52.090> than<00:03:52.120> we<00:03:52.359> think<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.829> very<00:03:54.069> first

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
older than we think in the very first

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.470 
older than we think in the very first
episode<00:03:54.549> of<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.060> series

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
episode of the series

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.300 
episode of the series
dipper<00:03:56.079> says<00:03:56.470> look<00:03:56.829> on<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.069> bright<00:03:57.280> side

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
dipper says look on the bright side

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.580 
dipper says look on the bright side
maybe<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:58.030> next<00:03:58.299> one<00:03:58.450> will<00:03:58.599> be<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.750> vampire<00:03:58.810> and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
maybe the next one will be a vampire and

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.710 
maybe the next one will be a vampire and
if<00:04:00.220> gravity<00:04:00.430> falls<00:04:00.790> does<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.209> thing<00:04:01.450> best

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
if gravity falls does one thing best

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.599 
if gravity falls does one thing best
it's<00:04:01.959> foreshadowing<00:04:02.799> because<00:04:03.459> they

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
it's foreshadowing because they

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.879 
it's foreshadowing because they
foreshadow<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.359> almost<00:04:04.840> every<00:04:05.290> episode<00:04:05.769> about

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
foreshadow in almost every episode about

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.610 
foreshadow in almost every episode about
the<00:04:06.220> upcoming<00:04:07.180> events<00:04:07.540> in<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.750> episode<00:04:08.410> and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
the upcoming events in that episode and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.849 
the upcoming events in that episode and
in<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.370> series<00:04:09.730> and<00:04:09.910> if<00:04:10.690> Gideon<00:04:11.380> really<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.829> a

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
in the series and if Gideon really is a

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.400 
in the series and if Gideon really is a
vampire<00:04:12.160> it<00:04:12.849> would<00:04:13.359> make<00:04:13.540> more<00:04:13.750> sense<00:04:13.810> because

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
vampire it would make more sense because

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.379 
vampire it would make more sense because
dipper<00:04:14.769> said<00:04:15.040> maybe<00:04:15.579> the<00:04:15.760> next<00:04:15.910> one<00:04:16.120> will<00:04:16.269> be<00:04:16.299> a

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
dipper said maybe the next one will be a

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.670 
dipper said maybe the next one will be a
vampire<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:17.079> Mabel's

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
vampire and Mabel's

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.020 
vampire and Mabel's
next<00:04:18.190> love<00:04:18.400> interest<00:04:18.820> right<00:04:19.060> after<00:04:19.419> this

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
next love interest right after this

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.350 
next love interest right after this
is<00:04:20.090> gideon<00:04:20.690> so<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.620> really<00:04:22.280> cool<00:04:22.580> how<00:04:23.060> they

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
is gideon so it's really cool how they

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.970 
is gideon so it's really cool how they
could<00:04:23.540> actually<00:04:23.570> foreshadow<00:04:24.440> this<00:04:24.680> it's

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
could actually foreshadow this it's

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.680 
could actually foreshadow this it's
definitely<00:04:25.190> possible<00:04:25.670> for<00:04:26.150> gideon<00:04:26.420> to<00:04:26.540> be<00:04:26.660> a

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
definitely possible for gideon to be a

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.620 
definitely possible for gideon to be a
vampire<00:04:26.930> with<00:04:27.530> all<00:04:27.680> this<00:04:27.830> foreshadowing<00:04:28.639> so

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
vampire with all this foreshadowing so

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.629 
vampire with all this foreshadowing so
if<00:04:29.750> little<00:04:30.050> gideon<00:04:30.410> actually<00:04:30.980> is<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.250> really

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
if little gideon actually is a really

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.600 
if little gideon actually is a really
old<00:04:31.850> vampire<00:04:32.090> then<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.410> episode<00:04:33.590> title<00:04:34.370> for

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
old vampire then the episode title for

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.730 
old vampire then the episode title for
his<00:04:34.820> introduction<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.990> hand<00:04:36.260> that<00:04:36.380> rocks<00:04:36.560> the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
his introduction the hand that rocks the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.890 
his introduction the hand that rocks the
mabel<00:04:37.130> would<00:04:37.669> actually<00:04:38.000> be<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.180> reference<00:04:38.540> to<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
mabel would actually be a reference to a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.440 
mabel would actually be a reference to a
really<00:04:39.230> creepy<00:04:39.470> movie<00:04:39.950> and<00:04:40.130> this<00:04:40.700> movie<00:04:40.760> is

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
really creepy movie and this movie is

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.180 
really creepy movie and this movie is
about<00:04:41.900> someone<00:04:42.350> trying<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.650> steal<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.919> baby

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
about someone trying to steal a baby

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.580 
about someone trying to steal a baby
that<00:04:44.030> movie's<00:04:44.419> called<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.840> hands<00:04:45.230> that<00:04:45.350> rocks

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
that movie's called the hands that rocks

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.560 
that movie's called the hands that rocks
the<00:04:45.710> cradle'<00:04:46.190> and<00:04:46.370> stealing<00:04:46.940> a<00:04:47.030> baby<00:04:47.210> would

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
the cradle' and stealing a baby would

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.780 
the cradle' and stealing a baby would
sound<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.960> lot<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.260> cradle-robbing<00:04:49.190> which<00:04:49.460> if

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
sound a lot like cradle-robbing which if

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.120 
sound a lot like cradle-robbing which if
you<00:04:50.090> look<00:04:50.300> in<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.480> urban<00:04:50.750> dictionary<00:04:51.130> defines

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
you look in the urban dictionary defines

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.130 
you look in the urban dictionary defines
it<00:04:52.370> as<00:04:52.520> dating<00:04:52.940> someone<00:04:53.330> who<00:04:53.540> is<00:04:53.660> much<00:04:53.900> much

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
it as dating someone who is much much

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.860 
it as dating someone who is much much
younger<00:04:54.470> than<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.770> and<00:04:55.040> if<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:56.240> actually

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
younger than you and if you actually

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.100 
younger than you and if you actually
factor<00:04:57.440> in<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.710> fact<00:04:57.980> that<00:04:58.270> gideon<00:04:59.270> is<00:04:59.600> really

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
factor in the fact that gideon is really

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.700 
factor in the fact that gideon is really
old

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
old

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.830 
old
this<00:05:00.919> title<00:05:01.370> would<00:05:01.460> make<00:05:01.640> sense<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.419> title<00:05:02.750> of

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
this title would make sense the title of

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.630 
this title would make sense the title of
the<00:05:02.930> episode<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:03.470> reference<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:04.190> this<00:05:04.340> all

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
the episode is a reference to this all

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.120 
the episode is a reference to this all
this<00:05:05.120> evidence<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.780> adding<00:05:06.140> up<00:05:06.290> it's<00:05:06.710> really

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
this evidence is adding up it's really

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.190 
this evidence is adding up it's really
cool<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.460> think<00:05:07.520> about<00:05:07.910> this<00:05:08.120> because<00:05:08.390> you

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
cool to think about this because you

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.570 
cool to think about this because you
probably<00:05:09.590> never<00:05:09.830> thought<00:05:09.950> about<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.550> idea

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
probably never thought about the idea

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.480 
probably never thought about the idea
that<00:05:10.940> gideon<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.479> a<00:05:11.510> really<00:05:11.870> old<00:05:11.900> vampire

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
that gideon is a really old vampire

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.800 
that gideon is a really old vampire
