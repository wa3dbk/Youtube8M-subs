building our N walls indoor frame for
our<00:00:15.630> greenhouse<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.740> segment<00:00:17.190> we're

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
our greenhouse in this segment we're

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.330 
our greenhouse in this segment we're
using<00:00:17.910> plywood<00:00:18.570> sheeting<00:00:19.140> at<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.890> end<00:00:20.100> to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
using plywood sheeting at one end to

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.220 
using plywood sheeting at one end to
construct<00:00:21.029> our<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.420> wall<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:22.140> our

greenhouse in lieu of plywood sheeting
you<00:00:24.750> could<00:00:24.960> use<00:00:25.140> polycarbonate<00:00:25.859> panels

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
you could use polycarbonate panels

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.310 
you could use polycarbonate panels
polycarbonate<00:00:27.240> panels<00:00:27.660> are<00:00:27.840> lightweight

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
polycarbonate panels are lightweight

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.470 
polycarbonate panels are lightweight
they're<00:00:28.800> easy<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.189> cut<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.640> they'll<00:00:30.119> also

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
they're easy to cut and they'll also

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.269 
they're easy to cut and they'll also
allow<00:00:30.689> sunlight<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.230> pass<00:00:31.590> through<00:00:31.859> into<00:00:32.070> your

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
allow sunlight to pass through into your

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.280 
allow sunlight to pass through into your
greenhouse<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.540> good<00:00:33.660> alternative<00:00:34.170> as

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
greenhouse so it's a good alternative as

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
greenhouse so it's a good alternative as
well<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:35.100> we're<00:00:35.250> using<00:00:35.520> plywood<00:00:35.969> sheeting<00:00:36.450> at

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
well but we're using plywood sheeting at

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
well but we're using plywood sheeting at
one<00:00:36.719> end<00:00:36.899> today<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> shady<00:00:38.280> side

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
one end today and it's on a shady side

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
one end today and it's on a shady side
of<00:00:38.640> our<00:00:38.760> greenhouse<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.600> we'll<00:00:39.750> still<00:00:39.960> get

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
of our greenhouse so we'll still get

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
of our greenhouse so we'll still get
sunlight<00:00:40.379> into<00:00:41.010> our<00:00:41.100> greenhouse<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.579> well

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
sunlight into our greenhouse as well

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700 
sunlight into our greenhouse as well
the<00:00:42.360> first<00:00:42.600> step<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> construct<00:00:43.440> your<00:00:43.559> end

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the first step to construct your end

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.430 
the first step to construct your end
walls<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.430> design<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.120> match<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:46.050> plywood

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
walls is to design and match the plywood

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.709 
walls is to design and match the plywood
sheeting<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.579> curve<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.420> end<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.629> your

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.619 
sheeting to the curve at the end of your
greenhouse<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.340> will<00:00:51.059> hold<00:00:51.360> up<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
greenhouse to do this will hold up the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
greenhouse to do this will hold up the
plywood<00:00:52.260> sheeting<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.280> sections<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:54.000> one
