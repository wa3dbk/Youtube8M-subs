00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.430
 Hi, how are you talking with 102? 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.129
 we are in a new warcraft video 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.340
 today I am going to bring you a strategy that 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.750
 I passed a taringa user is called 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.150
 adrián thank you very much adrián for 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.320
 good strategy wait now 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.820
 when I think that put pause for 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.140
 explain a bit better what the 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.289
 strategy the truth that I liked 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.070
 I found it quite easy to do and very 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.670
 effective good first and playing against 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.079
 a computer in easy I am human 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.470
 obviously and that being more human in this 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.470
 strategy 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.340
 and we found in the well 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 well let's show you that you have to 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:49.170
 do first today discuss first 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.899
 of the five pawns the peasants by 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.239
 don dos send them to mines with two others 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.940
 done two quarters and the third that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.780
 they are left they do orange I am going to advance 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.940
 a little the speed they are taking out 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.250
 meanwhile five for the mine 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.850
 I really liked thank you very much to adrián 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.440
 it's good because the peasant of 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.979
 the local farm to look for equal way 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.960
 that the two who are from the barracks and 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.990
 then they make another farm they have to 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.810
 try to have come and go doing 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.860
 many soldiers see those who go 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.960
 leaving more more they go forgiveness is 645 in 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.450
 timber 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.260
 and 25 in the mine as you see they ended up leaving 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.260
 the private soldiers 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.530
 I have four still read today we do not 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.110
 matter when we barely have because of 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.820
 that became seven soldiers us 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.710
 we put two the altar I think I did 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.960
 at eight it's really to put 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.259
 my water is fine here I have six 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.090
 soldiers and I do loyalty in 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.830
 kings as I was short of food I 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.030
 I make another farm and it was that they sing well 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.630
 in having more farms those four or five 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.630
 farms two barracks and the altar in the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.550
 medium that we want to take out is going to be the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.989
 archi magician with elemental skill 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.709
 that has served us so much because 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.410
 how many more are already better as you see here 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.830
 says to invoke and I while I am taking out 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.500
 gold I'm doing more farms 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:28.490
 I'm taking out Kaka soldiers who already 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.170
 have enough come home they see them in 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.990
 instead of going to attack directly what 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.000
 I do because they wait for you to wait for 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.560
 I put pause not that I'm here directly 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.300
 because I'm with him with ok shifts and like 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.150
 you know if there was a car at night 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.650
 obviously he was going to lose this fight 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.080
 because you do not see the units that have 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.080
 because they denounce invisible and they are not 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.930
 in motion as the medium in instead of 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.140
 go directly and they are taking out more more 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.480
 soldiers and doing more farms 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.400
 well of step cristiada so when it 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.290
 I was going to attack during the day and that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.570
 ensures the victory good was the 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.160
 pause as it was each bush managed to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.819
 Stamina of readiness that I think many 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.640
 it did not work 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.200
 and you always have to keep pulling out and if 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.900
 it is five miles at most large home 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.670
 They see here that killed these free table 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.859
 I tried to start and they did not take me 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.299
 a lot but just as much new much problem 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.299
 because it can give the same as come here 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.560
 still not yet is not the time for 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.300
 attack because it 's night I'm taking out 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000
 more soldiers I make farms and I 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.530
 asks 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.860
 still do not update the town hall 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.650
 as you see 4 in wood 5 in the in the 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.630
 mine I'm taking out to go to attack 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.880
 first I want to send those who have more 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.060
 what has more life like in here what 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.610
 I did it was perennial a few steps something 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.050
 important that I did as you want 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.340
 fight against the nocturnal 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.650
 most of 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.620
 it's units are archers have damage 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.150
 driller then what I did was there is 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.430
 a skill that I can not see now 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.819
 of the barracks that is called defense or 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.310
 something like that makes soldiers use 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.860
 the shield walk slower but that is 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.830
 the damage of the prisons produces 30% 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.200
 ie that comes to us that is perfect 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.150
 that the new date would make it 30% year 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.979
 less I guess if I make life count how 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.820
 was here updated to bulwark and what 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.890
 I have found the one 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.080
 together with the hero all the soldiers 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.600
 low and lower life those who were 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.330
 leaving control 2 and as you see here sent 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.340
 attack what I do with the quartiles is 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.480
 put the monarch I have a couple of 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.210
 problems because I'm 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.590
 the others these bastards were me 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.810
 attacking good here that they see 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.710
 wait a bit slow down 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.930
 here what I did was give him a blizzard and 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.430
 leading the back archers who 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.290
 they went down a lot of life and the truth that 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.030
 that helped me a lot as we pulled out 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.010
 elementary 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.870
 Cali won the truth a lot because 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.060
 I put up a defense as they see that they have 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.340
 shield forward and the sides and only the 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.160
 really helped me a lot for a year 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.630
 per player as they see the meeting point 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.850
 of the barracks they put the base is 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.400
 second I was going I was collecting gold I was going 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.530
 taking out 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.270
 many soldiers and this is what 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.280
 they want to do is when they are attacking 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.960
 it's at 0 before actually before I would 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.940
 attack the people required to 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.400
 update weapons and armor 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.949
 the soldiers who are the truth is 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.289
 very effective at the first minutes of 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:28.530
 game good street lemos board at 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:31.169
 computer or the good computer here is 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.900
 very easy as you see here others go 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.060
 coming the soldiers destroys him 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.430
 the guys destroyed him the ancestor of 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.139
 war the altar of the heroes the courses 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.669
 moles so they do not get covered out in 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.830
 wants to acquire by making the 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.870
 teachers who did not let it be this 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.270
 it's an instant the guys send him here 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.680
 I am destroyed the lunar well again 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.310
 altar of kings shattered life 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.590
 human as you see 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.390
 this strategy is called fuman I do not know 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.000
 because I did not say it at the beginning of the video 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.890
 excuse me and very effective the truth that is 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.680
 very good as you see here won the game 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.950
 it lasted ten minutes almost 11 hours that's 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.380
 very good because it 's like it's emphasized 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.540
 a lot in removing only private soldiers 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.250
 and through the updates and good 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.460
 thanks to blizzard we 're also going 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.980
 pulling up on top of the base the 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.700
 true that they are more more there was quite 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.700
 and good 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.230
 that the Mexican tax archers please 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.780
 door and I exposed him loyal to the skill of 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.700
 defense of the soldiers the truth that 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.710
 it was very good strategy thank you very much 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.210
 Adrián because I liked it so much that 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.570
 I will be very often this when I play 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:42.220
 against me or against whoever denle 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:46.530
