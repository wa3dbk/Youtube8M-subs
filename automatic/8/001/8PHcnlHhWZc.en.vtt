to talk about perk slot number two perks
so<00:00:38.160> let's<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.610> right<00:00:38.879> into<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.570> list<00:00:39.960> first

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
so let's get right into this list first

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.630 
so let's get right into this list first
off<00:00:40.820> we've<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:41.850> hardwired<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:44.190> perk<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
off we've got hardwired and this perk is

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.850 
off we've got hardwired and this perk is
going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.210> immune<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.690> counter<00:00:46.289> UAVs

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
going to make you immune to counter UAVs

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.400 
going to make you immune to counter UAVs
and<00:00:46.940> EMPs<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.750> it's<00:00:48.870> pretty<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.350> like

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
and EMPs so it's pretty much like

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.400 
and EMPs so it's pretty much like
assassin<00:00:50.280> pro<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.820> modern<00:00:51.090> warfare<00:00:51.239> 3<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
assassin pro for modern warfare 3 the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.549 
assassin pro for modern warfare 3 the
EMP<00:00:53.280> doesn't<00:00:53.699> affect<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> still<00:00:55.289> see

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
EMP doesn't affect you you can still see

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.310 
EMP doesn't affect you you can still see
things<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:57.120> HUD<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
things and your HUD and all that but you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
things and your HUD and all that but you
won't<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.739> able<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.070> call<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.340> score<00:00:59.879> streaks

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
won't be able to call in score streaks

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.650 
won't be able to call in score streaks
so<00:01:00.480> essentially<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.699> assassin

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so essentially it's just like assassin

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.990 
so essentially it's just like assassin
pro<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.409> modern<00:01:04.890> warfare<00:01:05.040> 3<00:01:05.250> other<00:01:05.729> than

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
pro from modern warfare 3 other than

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
pro from modern warfare 3 other than
that<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:07.200> much<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.680> can<00:01:07.770> tell<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.159> about

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
that not much I can tell you about

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000 
that not much I can tell you about
hardwire<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.540> pretty<00:01:10.170> simple<00:01:10.470> perk<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
hardwire it's a pretty simple perk is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.550 
hardwire it's a pretty simple perk is
probably<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.970> don't<00:01:12.689> particularly<00:01:13.140> see

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
probably one I don't particularly see

what toughness is going to counter it's

and<00:04:36.000> be<00:04:36.150> consistent<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:37.620> toughness<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.280> think

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
and be consistent so toughness I think

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.570 
and be consistent so toughness I think
is<00:04:38.580> going<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.820> be<00:04:38.910> an<00:04:39.000> excellent<00:04:39.570> /<00:04:39.930> choice<00:04:40.580> but

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
is going to be an excellent / choice but

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.760 
is going to be an excellent / choice but
just<00:04:42.030> like<00:04:42.150> fast<00:04:42.600> hands<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.140> think<00:04:43.170> it<00:04:43.530> may<00:04:43.740> be

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
just like fast hands I think it may be

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.070 
just like fast hands I think it may be
overshadowed<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.420> class<00:04:45.690> by

cold-blooded<00:04:46.920> or<00:04:47.450> scavenger<00:04:48.450> I<00:04:48.660> think

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
cold-blooded or scavenger I think

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.410 
cold-blooded or scavenger I think
