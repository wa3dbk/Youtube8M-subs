a complex area there are so many things

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.999 
a complex area there are so many things
happening<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:57.960> such<00:00:58.229> a<00:00:58.259> dynamic<00:00:58.559> situation

00:00:58.999 --> 00:00:59.009

going<00:00:59.610> on<00:01:00.710> we<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.040> when<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.339> person<00:01:02.759> is

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
going on we can see when the person is

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.820 
going on we can see when the person is
making<00:01:03.119> an<00:01:03.390> effort<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.809> roll<00:01:03.960> away<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
making an effort to roll away and you

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920 
making an effort to roll away and you
know<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> player<00:01:05.759> is<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.360> lying<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
know when a player is just lying on a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.990 
know when a player is just lying on a
ball<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.740> creating<00:01:08.250> no<00:01:08.430> space<00:01:08.729> or<00:01:08.880> no

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
ball and creating no space or no

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.429 
ball and creating no space or no
opportunity<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.689> as<00:01:09.840> referees<00:01:10.229> we've

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
opportunity I think as referees we've

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.350 
opportunity I think as referees we've
got<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> stick<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> no<00:01:11.400> excuses<00:01:11.850> policy<00:01:12.240> with

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
got to stick a no excuses policy with

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.550 
got to stick a no excuses policy with
them<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.960> put<00:01:13.140> yourself<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.470> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
them really if you put yourself in a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.899 
them really if you put yourself in a
position<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:14.220> only<00:01:14.369> intended<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.700> slow

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
position you're only intended to slow

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:15.530 
position you're only intended to slow
that<00:01:15.030> ball<00:01:15.210> down

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that ball down

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.789 
that ball down
and<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.930> kind<00:01:16.079> of<00:01:16.170> consistency<00:01:16.619> about

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
and it's that kind of consistency about

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
and it's that kind of consistency about
players<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> coaches<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.939> want<00:01:18.119> from<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
players and coaches all want from the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.420 
players and coaches all want from the
referee<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.930> think<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.350> clear<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.040> can<00:01:20.250> be

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
referee I think it's clear it can be

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.490 
referee I think it's clear it can be
quick<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.270> slowed<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.509> all<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
quick it can be slowed down all in the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.969 
quick it can be slowed down all in the
fairness<00:01:22.679> of<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> game

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.080 

we're<00:01:26.979> now<00:01:27.130> going<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.460> look<00:01:27.549> at<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.880> chacras

attacking<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.640> defending<00:01:53.910> you<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> great

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
attacking and defending you get a great

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.410 
attacking and defending you get a great
example<00:01:55.680> there<00:01:56.010> of<00:01:56.040> daylight<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.300> only

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
example there of daylight but it only

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 
example there of daylight but it only
has<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:57.810> be<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.960> millimeter<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.710> daylight

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
has to be a millimeter of daylight

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.190 
has to be a millimeter of daylight
that's<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.640> difficulty<00:02:00.150> if<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.750> player<00:02:00.960> makes

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
that's the difficulty if a player makes

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.960 
that's the difficulty if a player makes
a<00:02:01.290> clear<00:02:01.590> release<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.250> can<00:02:02.400> then<00:02:02.550> play<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
a clear release we can then play and

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.190 
a clear release we can then play and
reward<00:02:03.210> him<00:02:03.330> if<00:02:03.450> he<00:02:03.510> gets<00:02:03.660> back<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> ball

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
reward him if he gets back on the ball

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200 
reward him if he gets back on the ball
we<00:02:04.590> must<00:02:04.770> make<00:02:04.920> sure<00:02:05.160> of<00:02:05.370> is<00:02:05.730> that<00:02:05.970> an<00:02:06.060> actual

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
we must make sure of is that an actual

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
we must make sure of is that an actual
tackle<00:02:06.690> has<00:02:06.780> taken<00:02:07.050> place<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.650> not<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.800> tackle

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
tackle has taken place it's not a tackle

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.960 
tackle has taken place it's not a tackle
until<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.880> ball<00:02:09.030> carrier<00:02:09.479> hits<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.410> ground

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.730 

the<00:02:14.970> tackle<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> grates<00:02:15.840> only<00:02:16.200> from<00:02:16.440> this

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
the tackle the grates only from this

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.370 
the tackle the grates only from this
flows<00:02:17.490> everything<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.210> offside<00:02:18.630> line<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
flows everything the offside line the

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.440 
flows everything the offside line the
attacking<00:02:20.100> clean<00:02:20.310> is<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> defense<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.120> people

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
attacking clean is the defense of people

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.420 
attacking clean is the defense of people
everything<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.500> in<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.740> scenario<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.280> now

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
everything so in this scenario we now

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.100 
everything so in this scenario we now
talk<00:02:26.670> about<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.000> gates<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.870> correct

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
talk about the gates and the correct

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.600 
talk about the gates and the correct
entry<00:02:28.290> through<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.830> rack<00:02:29.010> once<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.340> rock<00:02:29.490> is

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
entry through the rack once a rock is

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.250 
entry through the rack once a rock is
formed<00:02:29.880> as<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.630> can<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:30.900> here<00:02:31.110> the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
formed as you can you can see here the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.230 
formed as you can you can see here the
defender<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.860> entered<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> rook<00:02:32.459> he's<00:02:32.850> formed

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
defender is entered the rook he's formed

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.180 
defender is entered the rook he's formed
the<00:02:33.330> rook<00:02:33.510> with<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.780> attacker<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.830> he<00:02:34.920> stayed

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the rook with the attacker and he stayed

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.550 
the rook with the attacker and he stayed
within<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> gate<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.970> gate<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.450> formed<00:02:37.380> from

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
within the gate the gate is formed from

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.770 
within the gate the gate is formed from
where<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.770> player's<00:02:38.070> toes<00:02:38.310> are<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:39.510> where<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
where the player's toes are to where the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.570 
where the player's toes are to where the
tackle<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.200> head<00:02:40.410> ease<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.370> any

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
tackle is head ease as well so any

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.490 
tackle is head ease as well so any
player<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.360> legally<00:02:42.870> enter<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.290> rook

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
player can legally enter the rook

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.220 
player can legally enter the rook
through<00:02:44.190> any<00:02:44.430> angle<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.390> long<00:02:45.630> as<00:02:45.750> he<00:02:45.840> comes

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
through any angle as long as he comes

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.680 
through any angle as long as he comes
through<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.739> feet<00:02:46.950> or<00:02:47.370> from<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.790> head<00:02:47.970> where

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
through the feet or from the head where

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.479 
through the feet or from the head where
it<00:02:48.810> becomes<00:02:49.020> illegal<00:02:49.500> from<00:02:50.070> an<00:02:50.220> attacking

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
it becomes illegal from an attacking

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.729 
it becomes illegal from an attacking
perspective<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.540> when<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:51.959> come<00:02:52.170> across<00:02:52.500> in

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
perspective is when you come across in

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.860 
perspective is when you come across in
front<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.610> feet<00:02:53.790> or<00:02:54.239> in<00:02:54.390> front<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
front of the feet or in front of the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.620 
front of the feet or in front of the
head<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.260> take<00:02:55.770> out<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> player<00:02:56.250> from<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.580> side

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.270 

so<00:03:01.380> that's<00:03:01.530> been<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.710> nice<00:03:01.890> brief

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
so that's been a nice brief

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.130 
so that's been a nice brief
demonstration<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.210> breakdown<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:04.050> we

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
demonstration of the breakdown and we

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.420 
demonstration of the breakdown and we
can<00:03:04.230> just<00:03:04.380> see<00:03:04.470> how<00:03:04.590> complex<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.130> really<00:03:05.370> is

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
can just see how complex it really is

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.640 
can just see how complex it really is
yeah<00:03:06.060> get<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.570> breakdown<00:03:06.780> right<00:03:07.140> get<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
