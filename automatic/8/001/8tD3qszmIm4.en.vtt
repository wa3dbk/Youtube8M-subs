00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.140
 no no 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.870
 very good to all the kids here 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.760
 I bring another cue advice video 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.260
 world and this I think it's going to be a very 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.990
 very important especially for the 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.000
 that create a good seed but many 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.580
 many seeds and I think it 's by far 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.750
 this is the best I've seen of all 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.910
 especially if you want to get 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.039
 materials and get good equipment 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.619
 worth the seeds the number 8 do not fear 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.480
 I do not even pity decision the 8 end and one 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.800
 of the good things you have is first 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.030
 that you have many of these here you can 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.440
 count a lot of material actually 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.880
 well let's be the best move I've seen 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.050
 at stake so far 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.610
 another good thing that you have is that they have 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.930
 many final heads around here good 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.520
 professional heads of these big 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.780
 as they are for example with those big ones and 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.370
 that are not especially difficult to 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.079
 kill but they are pretty good 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.579
 experience and of good objects and over 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.160
 for all this area near these 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.230
 mountains as teach there are enemies not 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.760
 dead plus one and what happens with the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.710
 nerves that have more behind because 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.420
 the more they have the better the team that 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.800
 they loose it's worth here you're going to see what 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.109
 euros how much secrets are we not going to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.430
 charge and I'll show you the biggest 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.230
 attractive that I have seen these 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.450
 seeds and also that is almost to 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.460
 principle ok let's be here let's go 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.729
 to this one here 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.350
 we are to death around here to tears 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.760
 I do not know if they are going to attack me, it seems that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.710
 but good we are going to take advantage and you well 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.750
 pointed you mean you as 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.130
 you start because I just deleted and 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.200
 start seeds I think you start by 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.390
 here is close but if you look from 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.210
 the city as far as I am there is a 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.380
 my way sofÃ­a and it leaves towards the south of 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.720
 the city is worth it I say it in case you already know 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.399
 the city if you go down the south road 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.600
 of the city that you have in south you go 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.280
 following is still what it does 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.630
 you find this where I am, it's worth 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.850
 there are here like two mountains closing the 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.860
 step is therefore very good when you get to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.200
 and climb up here you will find 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.390
 possibly the best mine I've seen 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.340
 I in club world is still worth this for 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.070
 those who need to go other because he knows 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.929
 that here we have one silver then 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.450
 here you will find a lot more but 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.340
 a lot of you are going to inflate here to 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.960
 take things I think is the best mine 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.370
 I've seen we're going but of course 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.050
 here you have one of iron that releases 3 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.810
 the lukewarm are in all the mines 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.300
 guys who are always going to do something 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.270
 giving for sack here we have another one 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.670
 iron there you have as you see one of gold 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.040
 here another iron next door there is another one 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.690
 iron is fine is that a look guys 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.300
 it's brutal is that you're going to inflate 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.100
 materials here I enter there dead to 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.030
 here we have another iron look there 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:33.020
 we have another iron down here 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:36.020
 there is more still than iron silver 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.670
 but here you have a good what would 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.840
 have to break a bomb so 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.630
 you know that some bomb you can also 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.160
 take this from here objects you have and here 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.420
 you also have another iron that would 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.620
 we break with a bomb we will break 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.200
 what I think I have some here 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.680
 still if you look at me I have one then nothing 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.680
 breaks 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.760
 and you take what's left has not 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.700
 broken because it breaks with us is worth more 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:04.050
 more we want more we want more than here 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.810
 look more iron and here we kill 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.400
 ok here is more iron and I tell you that 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.870
 I could also do that, not if you want 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.730
 much more if you need materials and not 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.440
 you find look at seed or seeds 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.900
 you can change seed or just 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.400
 open this seed comes to choose the 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.590
 materials you stay at the door of the 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.060
 mine clears it and will recreate it and 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.670
 your staff will be right at the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.069
 mine door and nothing here is more than 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.660
 this mine is brutal really seriously 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.340
 I've seen lots of mines because I 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.380
 is looking at many seeds for 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.880
 bring these videos and from afar is the 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.980
 better but with differences 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.780
 abysmal see that there is another with 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.870
 emeralds until we have left one of 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.360
 gold that we will go now it is worth here there is more 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.220
 still careful that the emeralds 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.720
 guys serve to make weapons and 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.860
 special armor all armor 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.290
 for example the armors that are of 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.019
 green color are manufactured footprint pawn 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.850
 pull there there we have more iron more 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.739
 iron over here we go back 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.660
 we believe those things the armors by 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.280
 example that are green are kraft 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.650
 the blue ones were with emeralds 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.310
 with sapphire gold color with 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.019
 diamonds and things like that I'm going to see by 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.460
 here more things that we have not left 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.330
 back and gold there 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.740
 seriously this mine is by far the best 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.350
 that I've seen in the game but but with 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.760
 Net abysmal difference look to see by 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.920
 here had to be the gold that we have 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.020
 seen before there is gold here there are two 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.390
 more spikes there are more ways to exercise 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.840
 it's also very very big here we have 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:33.100
 You see gold and here I think there was 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.380
 more iron can be to see the same I am 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.390
 wronging guys to bera bera bera bera 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.640
 see us you think you want more iron 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.470
 I stopped, I brought it pretty well served 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.300
 and as you can see here we have more more 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.480
 skeletons of these braza vale 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.430
 there we are 1 - and I was already kid 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.720
 let's leave it here somewhere 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.450
 tranquilito where we do not stick masters 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.740
 here we are going to leave it high for nothing 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.970
 guys, I hope I've already served you 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.410
 I say these seeds very very good 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.960
 because they have many bosses around 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.280
 the city in areas of such low level that 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.050
 they can follow you to level up if 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.360
 you know it handles well characters you know 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.950
 dodge on time and others have this 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.600
 mine that you can enter will be known there 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.640
 many more mines around here then you 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.460
 Cannon worth the CNE a cannon or 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.280
 they call there are a lot of mines all 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.860
 around here you have the city close heads 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.360
 here you have very cool hours these 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.700
 seeds the number I already said is the 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.780
 seed 8 that is very very simple no no 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.820
 It goes without layer description for 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.170
 companies thing sure and that's it 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.580
 I hope you have been helped 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.600
 have liked and see you in the video 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.600
 until another 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.300
 Y
