00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:28.740
 bad job

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.380
 oyster of the party 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 but mexico did not fall in despair kept unchanged by 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.240
 the bands 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.070
 his persistence had a reward when you're bread and senior managed to steal the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.770
 ball and surprise the Japanese behind centering towards the arrival of Renae 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.780
 cuéllar that got the equalizer at minute 31 one by one was going to Mexico 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.189
 Japan did not hesitate and went straight to the attack but when they were better playing 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.670
 the Asians with several clear chances of goal all disrupted by a 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.500
 inspired cecilia sean tiago under the three posts came the try comeback 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.000
 of the mexican team thanks of the chapulín run the player more 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.890
 technique of this team k very well benefit a rebound very close to the area to 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.410
 get rid of two defenses and finish placed at the angle at minute 41 for the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.410
 two for one that turned the scoreboard for the Mexican team 

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:34.639
 the third came shortly after that notation from 2 to 1 with internal urans 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.889
 of stephany senior who really was the most important players of the team of 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:38.640
 Roberto Medina 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.210
 I took a center to the heart of the area that captain nayeli nodded 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.729
 rangel at minute 45 to go with an advantage of 3 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.169
 even the dressing room that seemed really final to settle the meeting 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.039
 however something happened Mexico lost lost that two goal advantage 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.839
 amazing what happens is a football game the Japanese team responded 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:00.359
 he left with everything in the second half the time went against him until 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.509
 a play of fortune came with the goal in own goal of cuéllar after a 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.879
 corner kick badly cleared japan was not trying to center with the pot 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.849
 but the auctioneers never arrived when the party died, the 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.760
 figure likewise chi the best player who has japan 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.130
 to draw with a shot from more than 30 meters it seems to me that there could be 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.730
 done more 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.659
 the goalkeeper Cecilia Santiago stays 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.360
 static tdk war with a couple of meters and it arrived without problem for the 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.579
 goal if for the ball to cover his goal however 3 3 the 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.079
 final result mexico will play against england against nigeria looking for the 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.890
 go to the next round I see complicated that the women's team can advance 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.639
 we said that roberto medina declared pure nonsense 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.549
 since Apple had a lot of dynamism and work the first part that was 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.979
 awarded with the highest scoring effectiveness all the players worked 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:44.500
 very well 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.940
 from the goalkeeper and after the second part the rhythm went down to pons was 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.440
 director until he managed to draw with a bit of luck says our goal 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.540
 in own goal pre injuries above the tie 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.409
 I think that in the end 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.859
 has been a fair result I think it is wrong roberto medina just would have 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.939
 been that to gain to mexico when Canada ed the cfe in the game three goals a1 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.019
 they even have pink sports training with ate and cta thank you very much 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:05.339
 Goodnight
