00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
them up so that's really useful for

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.940 
them up so that's really useful for
developers<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:07.770> if<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.729> hit<00:01:09.049> f12<00:01:10.049> that

developers all now if you hit f12 that

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.950 
developers all now if you hit f12 that
have<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.250> thing<00:01:11.490> called<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.390> developer

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
have this thing called to developer

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.440 
have this thing called to developer
tools<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.119> hit<00:01:15.630> f12<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.830> brings<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:18.000> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
handy developer tools in there we can

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.910 
handy developer tools in there we can
also<00:02:46.020> have<00:02:46.970> compatibility<00:02:47.970> mode<00:02:48.450> sir<00:02:48.810> if<00:02:49.020> your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
room and web person like me and you're

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.960 
room and web person like me and you're
fed<00:02:53.670> up<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:54.000> doing<00:02:54.630> conditional<00:02:55.620> studies<00:02:56.610> for

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
fed up of doing conditional studies for

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:04.240 
fed up of doing conditional studies for
IE<00:02:57.210> in<00:02:59.060> first<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.270> eighth<00:03:02.630> there's<00:03:03.630> a

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
IE in first and eighth there's a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:13.220 
IE in first and eighth there's a
compatibility<00:03:05.250> mode<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.040> can<00:03:12.230> turn

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
compatibility mode and that you can turn

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:37.980 
compatibility mode and that you can turn
on<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.230> go<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.040> page

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:52.750 

page<00:03:38.710> and<00:03:39.160> then<00:03:41.580> compatible<00:03:42.580> as<00:03:42.700> UV<00:03:43.120> view

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.649 

page<00:03:53.450> and<00:03:53.810> then<00:03:53.959> we<00:03:54.080> go<00:03:54.260> round<00:03:55.659> compatibility

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
page and then we go round compatibility

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:02.830 
page and then we go round compatibility
view<00:03:57.189> we<00:03:58.189> can<00:04:00.790> change<00:04:01.790> some<00:04:02.120> things<00:04:02.150> about<00:04:02.599> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
view we can change some things about the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.009 
view we can change some things about the
page<00:04:03.110> so<00:04:03.950> we<00:04:04.069> can<00:04:04.280> make<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.640> at<00:04:05.480> more<00:04:05.840> like

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
page so we can make it at more like

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.789 
page so we can make it at more like
other<00:04:06.379> browsers<00:04:06.860> this<00:04:07.519> is<00:04:07.760> useful<00:04:08.299> if<00:04:08.870> things

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
other browsers this is useful if things

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.420
