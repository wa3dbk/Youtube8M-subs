00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 we want to tell you about our drift 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.769
 typewriters now we will show you how 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:18.199
 they look and tell and told 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.199
 it will be well let's mean let's start the hall 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.279
 there is such a plug in the back 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.769
 which is inserted charging and using 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.170
 charging these cars are charging the top 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.239
 there is a power button on these 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:40.050
 cars so ahead 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:42.690
 in front there is a compartment under the battery such 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 Here's where the cover will be organized 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.010
 battery one capacity of 25 ampere hours 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.989
 place in the battery compartment allows 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.579
 there to put a small car 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.710
 the battery that is the size we go there 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:02.250
 will come in next 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.040
 cover law means more control 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 drift is carried out using here 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.510
 these two joysticks 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.310
 that is, simultaneously pressing them or there 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.010
 to spin 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.150
 pressing 1 joystick and the machine is spinning 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.750
 spinning rides, etc. But then at 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.210
 it comes with a remote control now for you 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.780
 show here is such a remote on this 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.840
 the console binds up to four cars 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.040
 Means each machine under certain 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.110
 like a certain button with 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.000
 a certain letter, respectively, can 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.640
 always turn it on it is always possible 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 turn off the machine well, in short, how 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.090
 it was like this
