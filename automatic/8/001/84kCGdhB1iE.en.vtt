00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.530
 hello now and welcome back to 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.360
 lake that today we are going to work with one of 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.790
 the most versatile fruits of the mother 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.620
 nature the pineapple I will teach you 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.780
 how to create three delicious recipes and 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.789
 healthy for desserts and how to use 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.570
 every last bit of this 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.550
 tropical wonder 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.070
 twist the stem of the leaves to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.710
 remove it but eye do not throw it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.810
 we use a saw knife like 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.059
 of the bread to cut the skin from above 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.190
 down below try to follow the curvature 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.670
 of the pineapple so as not to remove a lot of meat 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.670
 with the skin 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.750
 with a smaller knife we ​​are going to 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.000
 remove their little black dots that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.650
 they were left telling them eyes they can 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.320
 make cutting diagonal grooves 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.180
 taking two or three points at a time 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.220
 I'll finish with a pineapple that looks like a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.860
 giant screw yellow and refreshing 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.990
 a cutting board cut into the pineapple by 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.940
 half and do the same with the pieces 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.670
 resulting to end with eight pieces 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.640
 about the same size cut out 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.890
 in the center hard so again we keep 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.630
 our ugly bits next to the 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.280
 rest of the waste because they 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.440
 they also have a purpose in this 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.210
 world at the end of the video I show you what 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.570
 do with them our first way 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.520
 to cook the pineapple will be a classic 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.520
 North American a brown sugar and cinnamon 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.760
 just like a pineapple a little sugar 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.780
 brown and cinnamon in that order and may 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.780
 cook them in a pan 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.840
 i 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.899
 for the second way to commit 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.479
 our pineapple are we going to use our 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.979
 boats just like that and we're going to put a 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.979
 delicious syrup 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.550
 while you are giving wonder what 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.550
 is what is here at the end 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.270
 we will use an iron grill 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.380
 fused to achieve those brands of 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.740
 so nice barbecue 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.740
 d 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.310
 we melted a bit of butter 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.900
 we add brown sugar and danielle and 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.480
 we mix 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.220
 we want all this to remain liquid like this 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.470
 that we achieve the desired consistency with 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.110
 a little bit of water but move until 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.180
 dissolve the sugar and ready 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.460
 we will see it on top of our boats 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 of pineapple on the grill and we give it a 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.750
 grated coconut touch 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.810

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.920

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.030
 metal or be a food processor and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.890
 then air and a touch of dancing can 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.530
