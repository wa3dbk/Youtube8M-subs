00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.760 
four the screws in the outside edge now
the<00:01:07.900> radio<00:01:08.200> itself<00:01:08.470> can<00:01:08.650> just<00:01:08.770> be<00:01:08.860> pulled<00:01:10.770> free

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
the radio itself can just be pulled free

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.520 
the radio itself can just be pulled free
on<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.850> backside<00:01:13.300> we've<00:01:14.080> got<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.230> large

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
on the backside we've got a large

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.280 
on the backside we've got a large
connector<00:01:15.090> we're<00:01:16.090> going<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.360> release<00:01:16.630> and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
connector we're going to release and

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.960 
connector we're going to release and
plug<00:01:17.500> in<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:17.710> lock<00:01:17.860> pick<00:01:18.070> harness<00:01:20.910> okay<00:01:21.910> to

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
plug in the lock pick harness okay to

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
plug in the lock pick harness okay to
release<00:01:22.240> connect<00:01:22.600> you're<00:01:22.720> just<00:01:22.870> gonna

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
release connect you're just gonna

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.110 
release connect you're just gonna
squeeze<00:01:23.290> on<00:01:23.710> this<00:01:23.860> end<00:01:24.130> here<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.870> little<00:01:25.870> click

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
squeeze on this end here a little click

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.420 
squeeze on this end here a little click
and<00:01:28.120> then<00:01:28.300> it's<00:01:28.420> unplugged<00:01:28.960> itself<00:01:32.430> including

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
and then it's unplugged itself including

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.190 
and then it's unplugged itself including
a<00:01:33.490> lockpick<00:01:33.880> harness<00:01:34.210> our<00:01:34.420> matching<00:01:34.810> factory

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
a lockpick harness our matching factory

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.510 
a lockpick harness our matching factory
connectors<00:01:35.590> or<00:01:35.860> do<00:01:35.980> we<00:01:36.070> just<00:01:36.220> take<00:01:36.370> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
connectors or do we just take the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.360 
connectors or do we just take the
factory<00:01:36.880> one<00:01:37.030> plug<00:01:37.870> it<00:01:37.990> into<00:01:38.110> ours<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:39.070> insert

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
factory one plug it into ours to insert

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.740 
factory one plug it into ours to insert
them<00:01:39.550> make<00:01:39.670> sure<00:01:39.790> you<00:01:39.880> have<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.180> locking<00:01:40.570> bar

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
them make sure you have the locking bar

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.170 
them make sure you have the locking bar
up<00:01:40.990> first<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.830> then<00:01:42.610> it'll<00:01:42.850> push<00:01:43.000> together

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
up first and then it'll push together

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.090 
up first and then it'll push together
push<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.900> locking<00:01:44.170> bar<00:01:44.320> down<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.620> locks<00:01:44.860> them

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
push the locking bar down it locks them

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.930 
push the locking bar down it locks them
together<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.690> think<00:01:46.690> so

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
together I think so

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.100 
together I think so
and<00:01:48.940> now<00:01:49.240> we're<00:01:49.360> inserting<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.750> other<00:01:49.900> end<00:01:50.050> of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and now we're inserting the other end of

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.570 
and now we're inserting the other end of
the<00:01:50.200> lock<00:01:50.320> pick<00:01:50.500> team<00:01:50.710> harness<00:01:51.040> directly<00:01:51.430> into

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
the lock pick team harness directly into

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.390 
the lock pick team harness directly into
the<00:01:51.670> radio<00:01:51.940> again<00:01:52.150> just<00:01:52.450> lift<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.750> tab<00:01:52.960> first

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
the radio again just lift the tab first

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.800 
the radio again just lift the tab first
push<00:01:54.400> them<00:01:54.580> together<00:01:54.700> and<00:01:55.150> then<00:01:55.300> push<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.630> tab

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
push them together and then push the tab

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.960 
push them together and then push the tab
down<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.320> lock<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.650> in<00:01:56.800> just<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.610> very<00:01:57.640> simple

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
down to lock it in just a very simple

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.399 
down to lock it in just a very simple
tea<00:01:58.300> harness<00:01:58.630> that's<00:01:58.840> all<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.110> takes<00:01:59.260> to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
tea harness that's all it takes to

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.780 
tea harness that's all it takes to
connection<00:01:59.860> together<00:01:59.979> there's<00:02:00.370> no<00:02:00.520> power

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
connection together there's no power

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.850 
connection together there's no power
connections<00:02:01.330> that<00:02:01.600> are<00:02:01.690> necessary<00:02:02.170> or

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
connections that are necessary or

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.710 
connections that are necessary or
grounds<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.670> you<00:02:04.120> know<00:02:04.210> does<00:02:04.390> all<00:02:04.600> the
