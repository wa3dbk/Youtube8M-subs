thought I kind of expected that because
I<00:02:06.889> know<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.219> agmatine<00:02:07.369> sulfate<00:02:07.639> has

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
I know that agmatine sulfate has

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.350 
I know that agmatine sulfate has
terrible<00:02:08.840> gpic<00:02:09.649> tastes<00:02:10.100> terrible<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.150> to

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
terrible gpic tastes terrible and to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.270 
terrible gpic tastes terrible and to
mask<00:02:11.630> those<00:02:11.900> flavors<00:02:12.319> is<00:02:12.440> very<00:02:12.680> difficult<00:02:12.890> so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
mask those flavors is very difficult so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.470 
mask those flavors is very difficult so
it<00:02:13.370> doesn't<00:02:13.790> taste<00:02:13.940> very<00:02:14.090> good

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
it doesn't taste very good

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.479 
it doesn't taste very good
it<00:02:14.540> comes<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.200> two<00:02:15.440> flavors<00:02:15.590> at<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.099> moment

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
it comes in two flavors at the moment

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:17.800 
it comes in two flavors at the moment
but<00:02:16.610> like<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.909> said<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.209> doesn't<00:02:17.330> really<00:02:17.599> matter

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
but like I said it doesn't really matter

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.229 
but like I said it doesn't really matter
because<00:02:17.930> they<00:02:18.140> both<00:02:18.290> taste<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:18.739> crap<00:02:19.239> but

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
because they both taste like crap but

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.170 
because they both taste like crap but
