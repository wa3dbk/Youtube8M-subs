maybe somebody broke down why are they
using<00:01:43.080> normal<00:01:43.619> shipping<00:01:43.979> code<00:01:45.380> catch<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
using normal shipping code catch the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.699 
using normal shipping code catch the
observation<00:01:47.310> okay<00:01:48.149> fire<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.959> dogs<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.530> right

I like that idea
little<00:02:34.879> ships<00:02:35.209> they<00:02:35.480> look<00:02:35.629> Tara<00:02:35.930> like<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.769> we

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
little ships they look Tara like can we

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.470 
little ships they look Tara like can we
get<00:02:37.010> closer<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.580> one<00:02:37.730> broadcasting<00:02:38.390> the

get closer to the one broadcasting the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.680 
get closer to the one broadcasting the
distress<00:02:38.840> signal<00:02:39.610> yeah<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:41.300> guy<00:02:41.450> might<00:02:41.660> not

distress signal yeah that guy might not

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.119 
distress signal yeah that guy might not
even<00:02:42.019> still<00:02:42.200> be<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.590> there

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
even still be in there

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.059 

Tom<00:03:13.540> I've<00:03:13.870> got<00:03:14.140> something<00:03:14.590> know<00:03:14.920> the

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
Tom I've got something know the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.670 
Tom I've got something know the
trajectory<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:15.849> all<00:03:16.120> these<00:03:16.329> crafts<00:03:16.689> all<00:03:17.379> of

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
trajectory of all these crafts all of

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.709 
trajectory of all these crafts all of
this<00:03:17.799> daily<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.370> slowly<00:03:18.790> moving<00:03:19.180> towards

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:19.719 
this daily is slowly moving towards

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.319 
this daily is slowly moving towards
action<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.560> it's<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.579> deal<00:03:21.909> with<00:03:22.150> that

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
action and it's a deal with that

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:22.860 
action and it's a deal with that
thing

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
thing

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.869 
thing
I<00:03:22.900> thought<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.469> system<00:03:23.650> was<00:03:23.859> deserted<00:03:24.400> why

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
I thought the system was deserted why

00:03:24.879 --> 00:04:01.860 
I thought the system was deserted why
would<00:03:25.030> all<00:03:25.120> this<00:03:25.269> be<00:03:25.480> way<00:03:25.659> out<00:03:25.689> here

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.160 

anywhere<00:04:02.870> else<00:04:03.250> no<00:04:04.250> distress<00:04:04.900> what<00:04:05.900> about<00:04:06.080> the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
anywhere else no distress what about the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.040 
anywhere else no distress what about the
docks<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:07.400> designed<00:04:07.820> them<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.060> space<00:04:08.600> on<00:04:08.810> life

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
docks you designed them to space on life

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.340 
docks you designed them to space on life
and<00:04:09.380> sequences<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.210> can't<00:04:11.450> reach<00:04:14.320> what<00:04:15.320> is

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
and sequences so we can't reach what is

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.740 
and sequences so we can't reach what is
it<00:04:15.620> with<00:04:15.800> our<00:04:15.950> luck<00:04:16.220> how<00:04:17.090> long<00:04:17.269> before<00:04:17.390> we<00:04:17.660> get

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
it with our luck how long before we get

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:32.740 
it with our luck how long before we get
sucked<00:04:18.049> in<00:04:18.200> by<00:04:18.380> this<00:04:18.560> thing<00:04:31.330> these<00:04:32.330> ships<00:04:32.660> have

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
sucked in by this thing these ships have

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.530 
sucked in by this thing these ships have
been<00:04:32.900> trapped<00:04:33.200> here<00:04:33.350> for<00:04:33.530> other<00:04:33.680> years<00:04:34.040> -<00:04:34.540> very

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
been trapped here for other years - very

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.530 
been trapped here for other years - very
high<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:37.070> wouldn't<00:04:37.370> be<00:04:37.430> a<00:04:37.460> problem<00:04:37.760> for<00:04:38.060> us<00:04:38.270> we

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
high it wouldn't be a problem for us we

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
high it wouldn't be a problem for us we
didn't<00:04:38.810> need<00:04:38.900> power<00:04:39.200> but<00:04:39.950> we'll<00:04:40.130> come<00:04:40.340> down

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
didn't need power but we'll come down

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.420 
didn't need power but we'll come down
I've<00:04:42.560> got<00:04:42.740> an<00:04:42.830> idea

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
I've got an idea

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.060 
I've got an idea
crazy<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.390> just<00:04:44.450> might<00:04:44.750> work<00:04:45.410> what<00:04:45.650> if<00:04:45.740> someone

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
crazy it just might work what if someone

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.800 
crazy it just might work what if someone
on<00:04:46.160> earth<00:04:46.400> log<00:04:46.730> on<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.000> our<00:04:47.240> systems<00:04:47.660> and

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
on earth log on to our systems and

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.080 
on earth log on to our systems and
control<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.230> docks<00:04:48.410> remotely<00:04:50.350> interesting

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
control the docks remotely interesting

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.360 
control the docks remotely interesting
if<00:04:53.090> my<00:04:53.330> position<00:04:53.870> more<00:04:54.080> powers<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.770> receivers

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
if my position more powers and receivers

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.120 
if my position more powers and receivers
yes<00:04:55.940> it<00:04:56.180> may<00:04:56.300> work<00:04:56.600> but<00:04:57.440> why<00:04:57.620> are<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.919> dogs

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
yes it may work but why are the dogs

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.480 
yes it may work but why are the dogs
being<00:04:58.430> sucked<00:04:58.790> in<00:04:58.940> by<00:04:59.090> that<00:04:59.270> thing<00:04:59.540> as<00:04:59.660> well

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
being sucked in by that thing as well

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.200 
being sucked in by that thing as well
who<00:05:01.490> cares

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
who cares

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.750 
who cares
we<00:05:02.600> don't<00:05:02.870> even<00:05:02.990> move<00:05:03.350> let's<00:05:04.220> not<00:05:04.400> waste<00:05:04.550> any

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
we don't even move let's not waste any

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.180 
we don't even move let's not waste any
more<00:05:04.850> time<00:05:06.640> okay<00:05:07.640> here<00:05:08.030> we<00:05:08.150> go
