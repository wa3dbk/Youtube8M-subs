00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the welcome you want to know the school, I 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.170
 one monster biology teacher 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.130
 today we will look at a selection for 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.210
 dance again 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.580
 and the first question and so how much is contained 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.369
 adenine nucleotide family guanine 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.130
 and cytosine in a fragment of the dna molecule 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.130
 if it detects 1200 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.500
 nucleotide cytosine which is 20 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.529
 percent of the total 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.779
 nucleotides in this dna fragment 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:34.170
 so guys frets it want to say that we 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.809
 we start to write a compilation then not c5 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.140
 I'll sort out the basic types 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.300
 tasks that were where r 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.950
 previous years so here is one of the typical 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.649
 tasks as we have to solve first thing 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.510
 the main thing is not to remember the principle 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.520
 complementarity it is that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.980
 adenine complimentary shade well and moisture 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.350
 complimentary to cytosine is iron 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.449
 rule for those who are not at all 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.540
 oriented one teammate wrong 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.450
 also some st-1 is nucleotides 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.240
 it's like the first to measure of which 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.360
 dna will not be with you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.729
 connected here so it will be 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 the principle of complementarity ie 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.140
 adenine adenine and thymine form two 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.869
 hydrogen bonds 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.259
 I showed it here in two 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.540
 dashes and guanine and cytosine they 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.439
 linked by three hydrogen bonds this 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.759
 you need to remember to do it clean 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.490
 mathematics that is, we are told that we have 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.229
 1200 nucleotides cytosine 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.530
 at this floor is 20 process 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.950
 we make up the simplest of the total 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.219
 proportions in which another 200 is 20 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.750
 percent and x is one hundred percent 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:02.630
 I'm looking for x is the total 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:06.470
 nucleotides in the whole of the DNA so x I 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.299
 will be equal to 1200 multiply by 100 divide 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:16.630
 20 0 and reduce here 6 it turns out 6 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:20.739
 thousand nucleotides all dna fragments and 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:23.420
 See if we have Cytosine 1200 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.970
 guanine will be exactly the same as 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.549
 cytosine is also one of the conclusions of 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.739
 this principle of complementarity ie 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:35.569
 we boldly put guanine 1200 also 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.450
 look we still have adenine thymine 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.790
 which will also be equally we are 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.750
 found out that total 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.040
 nucleotides 6000 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.150
 at the same time stozeva 1200 guanine and 1200 then 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.900
 This is a total of 2,400, that is, it is lean and 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.549
 theme 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.840
 we have six thousand minus left 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.950
 2,400 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.120
 that is, it will be 3 600 3600 nucleotides 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.120
 on adenine and thymine 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.280
 this is actually quite a simple conclusion 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.500
 elementary mathematics and so that is 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.500
 3000 we have one address 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.799
 and thymine we just halve it 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.459
 we have 1800 nucleotides 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.930
 on you not 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.120
 and 1800 on you we all solved this problem 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.849
 and you got 3 points 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.650
 I was alone with you in school 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.260
 subscribe to our channel 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.060
 on yutube won that now run 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.110
 come to us for courses in moscow and nato 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.110
 igor tits together with
