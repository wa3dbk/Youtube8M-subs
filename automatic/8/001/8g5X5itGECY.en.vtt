00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.500
 face hard enough 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.080
 to immediately understand the nature of man 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.809
 like he likes to complain or not 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.669
 sticking ears or dimple on chin 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.480
 these details rarely draws 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.550
 attention in vain specialists in physiognomy 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.330
 assure that the face of a man is an open book 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.940
 you just need to be able to read it 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.890
 the lion of the fat said the eyes are the mirror of the soul 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.110
 sounds nice but psychologists say 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.079
 the eyes can be judged only a mood 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.230
 human nature of each of us is written 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.440
 on the face is tempting one look even at 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.489
 the photo and the man knows everything 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.950
 physiognomy and psychologists are carried away 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.739
 recruiters and just curious what is it 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.880
 fashion trend or secret knowledge system i 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.310
 decided to experiment 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.020
 sent to the expert visited his photo 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.270
 recruitment agencies and training 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.280
 physiognomy who will tell about me 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.280
 the truth on the forehead we see horizontal 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.700
 wrinkles man is prone to surprise 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.410
 like to be surprised 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.839
 perhaps a creative profession in this 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.850
 the psychologist was not mistaken the rest fifty 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.860
 fifty not a gift of physiognomy 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.320
 call about scientific discipline 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.299
 quite subjective let's say a liar 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.299
 You can spice up a sweet smile 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.979
 what to believe depends on the experience of a specialist 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.510
 in this case you need yourself 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.400
 called grabbing a hand always and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.600
 saying so this is my opinion my opinion 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.280
 doesn't work here i can draw 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.880
 only on those facts that were 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.920
 checked 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.290
 Vladimir Maleh on one of the most 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.240
 Russia's influential personnel officers are already more than 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.460
 forty years he has been picking up staff for 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.619
 business during the interview creates 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.510
 psychological portrait and then looks 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.430
 the behavior of a person in a team 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.240
 almost no mistakes 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.830
 my rating is energetic positive and 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.320
 short-tempered close to the truth but not 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.080
 too specifically physiognomy is 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.390
 good extra in 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.320
 evaluation of a stranger including 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.420
 when hiring but physiognomy 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.820
 will give us information only about 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.509
 the nature of the person his personal 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.340
 qualities 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.560
 but no way 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.960
 talk about how he will 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.690
 successful in a particular profession 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.069
 experience shows rounded face and snub 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.050
 nose is a sign of good humor 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.160
 lower teeth noticeable when talking 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.739
 severe temper 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.690
 lop-eared speaks of stubbornness dimple 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.150
 on the chin from the difficult character 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.709
 sometimes opinions are different experts on 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.170
 European people are assured that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.129
 traditional Chinese physiognomy to 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.230
 we are not applicable 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.420
 although a psychologist is a specialist in feng shui 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.790
 looking at the picture was not mistaken in the description 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.090
 my character and even guessed the scope 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.269
 activities see very beautiful 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.450
 a clear mouth may be a profession related 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.970
 there may be some sort of speaking 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.060
 teaching but he sets out his thoughts 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.069
 very clearly and competently trust 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.260
 physiognomy at 100 percent so far 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.930
 early enough to evaluate the facial features of a person 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.170
 you need to follow his fate and only then 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.940
 draw conclusions such conclusions they are important 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.920
 but they are important again if a person 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.389
 has enough experience and practice 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.030
 that is, sometimes three-day courses or 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:13.209
 even one year is not enough for 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.100
 order to figure out what's going on 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.170
 psychologists say a couple to a human soul 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.910
 summarize your experience and and although on 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.099
 creating a database of individuals and 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.609
 their respective characters can leave 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.799
 the years 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.170
 it is necessary to begin and when character assessment 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:28.450
 will give an impartial computer 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.910
 physiognomy from fashion hobbies 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.319
 will turn into applied science at the core 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.319
 which principle does not harm
