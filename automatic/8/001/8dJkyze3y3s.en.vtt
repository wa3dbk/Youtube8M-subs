go<00:00:14.560> well<00:00:14.590> right<00:00:15.010> away<00:00:15.869> because<00:00:16.869> we<00:00:17.140> played<00:00:17.380> ten

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619

basketball<00:00:56.649> that<00:00:56.680> was<00:00:57.149> demonstrated<00:00:58.149> in<00:00:58.180> the

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
basketball that was demonstrated in the

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.930

first half of that game on Saturday and

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.270 
first half of that game on Saturday and
hopefully<00:01:01.420> we'll<00:01:01.600> be<00:01:01.750> able<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:02.079> withstand<00:01:02.770> the

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
hopefully we'll be able to withstand the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.389 
hopefully we'll be able to withstand the
gaff<00:01:03.610> as<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.239> expression<00:01:05.199> goes<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.100> play<00:01:06.250> up

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399 
gaff as the expression goes and play up

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.280 
gaff as the expression goes and play up
to<00:01:06.430> press<00:01:06.790> your<00:01:06.940> defense<00:01:07.000> when<00:01:07.690> we<00:01:07.869> have<00:01:08.080> to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
to press your defense when we have to

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.180 
to press your defense when we have to
when<00:01:08.470> teams<00:01:08.770> games<00:01:09.430> get<00:01:09.700> close<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.979> think<00:01:11.979> that

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
when teams games get close I think that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.609 
when teams games get close I think that
coaching<00:01:15.190> staffs<00:01:15.460> doing<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.820> great<00:01:16.000> job

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

other than that you know I think I see

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.240 
other than that you know I think I see
growth<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.229> this<00:01:41.380> team<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.830> I'm<00:01:41.920> optimistic

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
growth in this team and I'm optimistic

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.789 
growth in this team and I'm optimistic
that<00:01:42.759> it's<00:01:43.750> not<00:01:43.930> always<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.229> final<00:01:44.680> score

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
that it's not always the final score

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.370 
that it's not always the final score
sometimes<00:01:45.520> how<00:01:45.700> you<00:01:45.759> play<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.299> think<00:01:47.229> we're

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
sometimes how you play I think we're

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.319 
sometimes how you play I think we're
playing<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:48.189> game<00:01:48.400> much<00:01:48.700> better<00:01:49.000> and<00:01:49.180> we're

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.329 
playing the game much better and we're

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:51.270 
playing the game much better and we're
giving<00:01:49.540> some<00:01:49.869> activity<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.560> we<00:01:50.680> like<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.070> see

Brooklyn
games<00:02:15.350> that<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.860> thought<00:02:16.130> their<00:02:16.400> games<00:02:16.700> that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530

left-hander a guy that's a big angular

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.830 
left-hander a guy that's a big angular
kid<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.650> play<00:02:27.860> defense<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.640> know<00:02:29.570> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
kid that can play defense you know and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.180 
kid that can play defense you know and
giving<00:02:30.080> him<00:02:30.170> foul<00:02:30.410> trouble<00:02:30.800> in<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.950> game

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
giving him foul trouble in that game

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.400 
giving him foul trouble in that game
really<00:02:31.730> really<00:02:31.940> hurt<00:02:32.240> us<00:02:32.360> in<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.690> process<00:02:33.230> of

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
really really hurt us in the process of

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.160 
really really hurt us in the process of
trying<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.250> win<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.640> game<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.840> thought

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
trying to win that game and I thought

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.170 
trying to win that game and I thought
the<00:02:36.350> Brooklyn<00:02:36.710> game<00:02:36.890> was<00:02:37.100> difficult<00:02:37.640> game<00:02:37.850> for

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
the Brooklyn game was difficult game for

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.380 
the Brooklyn game was difficult game for
him<00:02:38.300> also<00:02:38.480> I<00:02:39.020> thought<00:02:39.650> that<00:02:39.710> that<00:02:40.220> wasn't<00:02:40.460> one

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
him also I thought that that wasn't one

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.410 
him also I thought that that wasn't one
of<00:02:41.420> his<00:02:41.600> high<00:02:41.780> moments<00:02:42.350> but<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:43.390> was<00:02:44.390> very

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
of his high moments but I was very

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.330 
of his high moments but I was very
pleased<00:02:44.840> with<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.170> Atlanta<00:02:45.320> game<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.980> think

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
pleased with the Atlanta game I think

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.980 
pleased with the Atlanta game I think
that<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:46.670> frustrations<00:02:47.330> going<00:02:47.600> to<00:02:47.660> be<00:02:47.750> there
