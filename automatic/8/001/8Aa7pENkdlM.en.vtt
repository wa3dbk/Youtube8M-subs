like a decent enough delay think they

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.870 
like a decent enough delay think they
mend<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.950> about<00:01:26.070> right<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.670> should<00:01:26.850> be

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
mend this is about right it should be
