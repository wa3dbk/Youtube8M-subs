00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 images with another one of the panoramas that 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.220
 we have for this weekend it's about 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.980
 of the third version of the comic with 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.500
 chile which is the biggest comic event 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.120
 videogames movies and series a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 opportunity where as we are 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.640
 watching movie lovers meet 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 television and all these characters to 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.070
 what they also want to look like 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.080
 They try as much as possible to imitate everything 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.539
 that has to do with your wardrobe your 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.820
 way to move their way of acting and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.690
 in most cases the resemblance 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.070
 is frankly enviable above all 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 for other people who also like 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.750
 a lot of the comics and they are trying 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 to take pictures with them there are 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.980
 series and favorite movies that they 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
 they have and when they see their character 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.110
 favorite immediately approach with the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.510
 idea of taking a souvenir to your home 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.460
 this begins today extends to the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.160

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.629
 pretty important assistance 27 thousand 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.820
 in this opportunity until the station 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.830

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.630
 developing this event and we are going to 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.640
 talk to some of them so that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.740

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.000

 in the costumes he made the mask 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.899
 hands and all that but I had to 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.640
 do all the disguise for me alone 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.149
 It was difficult because I had to do 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.649
 straight line in a very difficult machine 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.420

 what he did and the suit and I myself 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.040
 cost much 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.430
 but it's not worth it worth it 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.680

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.870

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.120

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.370
 hat 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.610
 when it seems to you that you told me 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.440
 you are already working on these events 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:19.210

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.150
 and the people who tell you when they see you 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.120
 I imagine that if they want to take pictures 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.270
 with you that you are very similar 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.520
 jacques barrot I say captain jack 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.380
 sparrow I created a little the character or 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.690
 do not 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:41.490
 you have to believe the story a fanatic 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.140
 yes yes I do not know myself since I saw the 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.080
 movie the first time I fell in love with the 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.300
 character 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.910
 that's why I said I'm going to do ex 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.459
 for the world cup so now that I have 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.560
 the suit is missing the boat, not many 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.750
 thank you we also talk with 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.910
 another fan of the comics that 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.650
 they try to characterize these 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.580
 characters we realize of immediate this 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.580
 conversation we had with them 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.329
 I like girls, the truth is that 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.180
 I like comics for 15 years 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:20.180
 because he started doing cosplay 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.889
 common machine to get a little more out of 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.850
 personality equal to help a lot in 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.770
 that know people group friend and a little 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.590
 de-stress from everyday life serves 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.900
 pretty much I actually started doing 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.970
 anime events in fact I for the 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.639
 videogames I started shopping but 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.979
 what hurley the first one that always 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.320
 I liked the average because bipolar has 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.320
 a bad love but also because 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.470
 I loved the joker and choose question 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.820
 I love it since 1995 and I like the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.160
 double personality that has how it 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.440
 develops with the hero that in the end what 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.020
 Take it as a park is like your alter ego 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.050
 but in good version the suit 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.620
 I was designed by a friend and everything is done 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:07.599
 with an effort of work and sweat and I 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.599
 I have tried to focus on the character 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:14.169
 almost a year and a half make up everything 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.350
 like child and clothes to see the mask 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.830
 I made it 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.290
 I am 65 years old and I am not enjoying 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.180
 of 'adult batman who was a child 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.970
 bit difficult because of issues you think 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.180
 they bothered and the whole thing and I like 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:32.250
 batman because the only superhero as 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.410
 it has already been said that it is has no powers 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.860
 but it uses intelligence 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:40.590
 physical and the constant errors that 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.440
 they commit, they perfect themselves 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.210
 they are all fans, they told us 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.400
 that when they were little he gave them even 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.320
 more shame disguising themselves as their 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.120
 favorite character because they were bothered 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.340
 at school but now that they are adults 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.440
 and how many times they are hidden behind a 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.880
 disguise makes them easier than others 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.230
 things can you find here what 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.270
 we listen immediately in poses 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.780
