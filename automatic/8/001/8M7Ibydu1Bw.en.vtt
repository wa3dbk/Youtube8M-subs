00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 It contains genetic factors that determine the color of the eye, hair, skin and all other qualities such as face and body 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 And now "plowing" Surat al-Baqarah 223 "Your wives plow to you"; 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 This word refers to plowing the earth and planting the seed in it 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 This term refers to the sexual process "plowing". And laying the cyst which is the seed 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 This is a very good analysis because the cyst is a root-like organ called the choroid roots absorbs oxygen and food from the mother's blood just as the roots of the plant as in the picture 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 Suck food from the soil 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 The next stage is "the relationship"; - we see the next tranche - 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 Alaqah in Surat Al-Mu'mounun 14 "Then we created the sperm a leech, and created us a bond." 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 The word "ellak" refers to a shape similar to a leech, especially at the age of 22 days as shown in this slide 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 This is the relationship and this is the fetus at the age of 23 days 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 And thought that you must agree that the similarity is striking between these two configurations 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And that the human embryo really looks like a tie 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 The embryo is similar to an adherent adherent to the uterine choroid sac and the internal lining of the uterus 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 And the stage of "Madghah" Al-Mumin 14 and returned to you "and then we created the sperm leech and we created the link Mgghp"; 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Which you see here 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 It begins in the sixth week 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 The next stage is the "covering" of the believers, A14: "And we created the bones, and they made bones for us." 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 In the stage that preceded it, the bone is formed and then the bones are chopped with meat 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 This word means cladding in meat. When bones are formed, they are surrounded or covered by the flesh or muscles that require bone adhesion 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 This bone adhesion allows the skeleton to move 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 These are the last stages of growth and are called "emergence". The believers 14 "Then we created another creation"; 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 And "emergence" means growth or presence and this undoubtedly refers to the embryonic stage, where there is a growing difference in the fetus from the stage of the initial fetus 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 The rate of growth of the body in the embryonic period is surprising, especially between the ninth and sixteenth week 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 Notice how it grows rapidly in the "embryonic" stage, or what we call the embryonic stage 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.000
 The next stage is the "ability" of the Ahqaf 15, and says Sura "and carry him and his separation thirty months"; 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 This term "susceptibility" refers to the human embryo's ability to survive ectopic 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 There is no specific time in which the survival of the embryo is confirmed 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 But now it is generally accepted that a fetus of 24 weeks or older has a reasonable chance of survival 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 The survival of the fetus between the ages of 22 and 24 weeks has become possible in the past two years only 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 When methods have evolved to provide care for children who are not fully developed 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Therefore, the period of survival of the fetus will be at 24 weeks. We used to say 26 or 28 but now with better equipment some of them survived at 24 weeks 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 But some survived in 22 weeks, but these require a very sophisticated incubation process 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 This is the period in which the human embryo can survive 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 The next stage is the "uterine incubation", which is the final period in the development of the fetus in the uterus and the fetus is able to survive if left early 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 But remains in the uterus where it is supported and nourished by the mother 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
 Therefore, in most cases, the uterus is the incubator of the incomplete child 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 Weight gain has been noticeable in recent weeks 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
 Where the fat accumulates in the fetus and gradually becomes equipped for delivery 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 This last verse is from Surat Abes 19 and 20 "from the seed of his creation and his destiny, and then the path pleased him"; 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:59.000
 It is known that when the time of birth approaches, the tissues of the mother in the cervix and the joints of the stomach become soft so as to facilitate the passage of the fetus from the embryonic channel 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:09.000
 This process, stimulated by hormones in the mother's blood, accelerates in the early stages of birth 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 As for the chorionic sac - the water bag surrounding the fetus - it expands near the time of birth and stands out to the cervix and causes it to expand 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:35.000
 When the chorionic sac breaks, the fluid helps to form a slippery exit for the fetus to pass from the cervix to the outside of the mother 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 What I mentioned earlier facilitates the child's birth and is the expression "the way pleased"; 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
 The stages of formation and development of the fetus mentioned in the Qur'an should be used when teaching Muslim students 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 Because they correspond to our modern concept of prenatal growth 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
 This will enable doctors and nurses to explain the development of the fetus to their patients using Quranic references 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
 Muhammad did not know these facts about the development of the fetus in the seventh century because most of them were revealed only in the twentieth century 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:26.000
 And Muslims have the argument in the conclusion that these facts were only a life of Muhammad from that who knows everything and not only how to grow, but how to live and do our jobs .. Thank you very much
