00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.670
 people where it rains nettheim here 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.819
 It's all kinds of lego to show you. 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.640
 here are the black numbers right who takes 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.060
 red was blue brown green that is 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.900
 which taste in light blue the white tone 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.769
 one of the insects has a lot of color delegates and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.410
 look that 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.269
 here you can mount anything 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.620
 for example in a blog you can have 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:55.410
 one two three four five six spaces 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:59.100
 in a single album 123456 understood in a 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.319
 you get 16.11 of this obvious that you have 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.299
 some who need too much fear right? 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.430
 here happy here gifts 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.100
 good guys of course part for 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.440
 change the proportion is for example 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.680
 these pieces that I showed you there 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.329
 she is very hard, and these others 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.910
 here is one for 21 for 3 1 for 41 for six 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.590
 What does this mean one by one? 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.829
 say that it occupies a square 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.940
 from that time right now that 6 is now a 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.889
 for two 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.950
 He has one tall, that's what he has there. 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.989
 and two squares that beauty now 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.769
 a 3 to 1 and three ranks 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.540
 CNET squares is a four by four is 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.170
 It's squares that were going for six 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.010
 occupy those six squares beauty the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.260
 OK 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.700
 well we also have several colors I already 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.849
 I'll show you 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.580
 and here a construction is for example that 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.430
 I only made the Simpsons house. 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.020
 it looks like it's legal time that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.750
 stay away from here, right? 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.240
 really resembles the home of the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.750
 simpsons are you can use several colors 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.470
 for example brown there to pink is to 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:14.550
 make the garage green there to do 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:17.070
 the grass and such the gray rug with green 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.030
 neon or orange to make the wall then 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.500
 already achieved several adverse events 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.660
 to make their constructions 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.970
 there is another camper construction that is 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.790
 a tripod is a clip that's how we did it 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.760
 with the green color that is the original color of the 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.610
 clip and also there we used the part 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.030
 black neon the black lego for us to do 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.580
 the mouth and eye of the face clipper is very 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.190
 fun is really fun even if 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.460
 You'll take your time and it'll start. 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.800
 tinkering with fellow minecraft aquino right 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.260
 You can do many expensive things here. 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.790
 for example you can pick up and make half 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.650
 that a siren looks like it 's a 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.200
 little thing but a little thing 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.100
 simple even if you come here place 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.830
 a business like this 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.020
 So you come here and it's obvious that I 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.350
 I'm using the one by one is the power is 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:10.230
 using the other but as you have six 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:14.610
 here and divide half by half is you 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:17.280
 comes here, for example, a blue light 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.230
 it's a blue light you're going to look like the 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.880
 who introduced himself to the police 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.480
 it was just cool 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:27.330
 Look how much mass it's here. 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.850
 for beauty we finished ours ours 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.960
 siren it is obvious that we can make a 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.480
 little up 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.430
 You can fit as much as you want. 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.950
 as much as you want and if you have 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.890
 fun ego you build what 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.530
 Do you want, man, look okay, by the time you're done. 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.900
 we made another layer here and we're not going 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.910
 do one here O red the other 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.290
 hour 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.480
 What another beauty here and another here looks 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.100
 How is it most similar here? 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.440
 because before 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.880
 much of the time a siren like you 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.190
 You can get whatever you want to stay. 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.480
 basically this is what I hope you 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.760
 have tanned there 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.460
 this way of lego is not a clipping right 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.650
 Will you remember that I mentioned the 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.290
 dimensions of a choir in group 2 1 by 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.420
 314 for six because then you go 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.090
 using not to be in their confections 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.580
 for example here you can see that 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.830
 indicates how long 4 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.600
 here we have for 6 that we have 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:26.480
 two for two, right? 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.970
 two by three in several sizes of 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.900
 pieces of lego is not because really the 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.160
 ego has several different parts even 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.470
 Who wins then is this? 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.820
 life favorite in the video you liked it 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.440
 subscribe to the channel if you have not 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.870
 enrolled and they had to have surrendered 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.210
 he will travel to the description by limoges 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.980
 the inscription is also this she was worth 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.980
 said floor
