00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.570
 within the framework of the European area of 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.910
 higher education as you know it 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.619
 establish three levels of training a 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.350
 first grade level a second level 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:24.120
 of master's degree and a third level of doctorate 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.300
 inside of the degrees of 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.000
 those referred to industrial engineering 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.239
 As you know, the grade has replaced 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.110
 all the old degrees and now 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.020
 the possibility of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.750
 European higher education which is the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.080
 master's degree in engineering 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.410
 industrial within this country in this 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.270
 country 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.670
 this master gives us access to the profession 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.710
 Regulated industrial engineering according to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.390
 the current law of the powers 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.430
 latest studies that have been developed 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.800
 about employability in Spain in the year 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.020
 2011 show that engineering 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.239
 industrial has become the 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.379
 most demanded degree and not only 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.059
 it has become the most 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.910
 defendant but the percentage of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.170
 companies that demand the qualification of 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.270
 industrial engineering is superior to 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.460
 percentage of college students that take 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.900
 universities and that is because due 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.200
 this is due to what I was saying before 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.960
 that is to say that is due to the 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.979
 Employability is lacking 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.450
 multidisciplinarity grants to the 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.600
 industrial engineering is a profession 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.920
 versatile is a profession that encompasses 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.410
 many sectors and within each sector 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.330
 covers all facets of the cycle 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.930
 of industrial life and that gives it that 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.580
 high employability the four pillars 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.660
 differentials of the qualifying master 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.570
 industrial engineering of the university 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.900
 European of Madrid 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.390
 they are the schedule the companies the cloister
