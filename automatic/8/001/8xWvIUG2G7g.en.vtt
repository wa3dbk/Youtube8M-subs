version<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.540> gun<00:00:33.750> isn't<00:00:34.410> really<00:00:34.860> all<00:00:34.890> that

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
version this gun isn't really all that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.850

good<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.149> does<00:00:36.570> do<00:00:36.780> damage<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.440> gets<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> lot

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
good it does do damage it gets you a lot

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.220 
good it does do damage it gets you a lot
of<00:00:37.890> points<00:00:38.190> except<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.239> run<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> ammo

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
of points except you run out of ammo

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.530 
of points except you run out of ammo
extremely<00:00:41.040> fast<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> same<00:00:42.180> thing<00:00:42.510> goes

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
extremely fast and the same thing goes

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
extremely fast and the same thing goes
for<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.320> pack<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> punch<00:00:43.860> version<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.399> gun

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
for the pack a punch version this gun

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.260 
for the pack a punch version this gun
it's<00:00:45.539> okay<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> best<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.090> just

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
it's okay it's not the best but it just

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.389 
it's okay it's not the best but it just
flies<00:00:48.539> through<00:00:49.020> ammo<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.620> fast<00:00:49.920> when<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.280> have

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
flies through ammo so fast when you have

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.430 
flies through ammo so fast when you have
a<00:00:50.430> gun<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.239> goes<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.690> ammo<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.140> fast

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
a gun that goes through ammo so fast

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
a gun that goes through ammo so fast
there's<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.039> no<00:00:53.340> point<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.910> even<00:00:54.120> gain<00:00:54.270> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
there's really no point and even gain in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.670 
there's really no point and even gain in
the<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:54.899> place<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.440> you're<00:00:55.590> gonna

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the first place because you're gonna

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.639 
the first place because you're gonna
spend<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.219> much<00:00:56.399> money<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.940> getting<00:00:57.930> ammo<00:00:58.440> each

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
spend so much money on getting ammo each

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.410 
spend so much money on getting ammo each
round<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.550> you're<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.239> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
round and you're not going to get that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
round and you're not going to get that
same<00:01:00.719> amount<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.989> points<00:01:01.230> back<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:01.829> that's<00:01:02.039> why

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
same amount of points back so that's why

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.800 
same amount of points back so that's why
I<00:01:02.609> think<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.420> NPL<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.650> OK<00:01:05.339> gun<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.390> really

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
I think the NPL is an OK gun but really

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.920 
I think the NPL is an OK gun but really
nowhere<00:01:07.740> near<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.030> coming<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
nowhere near good so coming in in the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.580 
nowhere near good so coming in in the
number<00:01:10.170> four<00:01:10.500> spot<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.510> pm-63<00:01:12.510> now<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
number four spot is the pm-63 now the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.660 
number four spot is the pm-63 now the
non<00:01:13.799> pack-a-punch<00:01:14.369> version<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.900> gun<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
non pack-a-punch version of this gun is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.609 
non pack-a-punch version of this gun is
okay<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.850> actually<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.450> all<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:19.049> bad<00:01:19.350> it's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
okay it's actually not all that bad it's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.420 
okay it's actually not all that bad it's
actually<00:01:19.740> pretty<00:01:20.130> good

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
actually pretty good

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
actually pretty good
it<00:01:20.790> gets<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> good<00:01:21.450> amount<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.720> points<00:01:21.930> but

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it gets you a good amount of points but

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410 
it gets you a good amount of points but
it<00:01:22.619> suffers<00:01:23.310> from<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> same<00:01:23.820> problem<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
it suffers from the same problem that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.289 
it suffers from the same problem that
the<00:01:24.600> NPL<00:01:25.049> does<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.100> runs<00:01:26.460> through<00:01:26.640> ammo

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the NPL does it just runs through ammo

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.740 
the NPL does it just runs through ammo
really<00:01:27.990> really<00:01:28.290> fast<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.210> said<00:01:30.270> it's

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
really really fast but like I said it's

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.590 
really really fast but like I said it's
not<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> worst<00:01:32.009> non<00:01:32.640> upgradeable<00:01:33.420> gun

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
not really the worst non upgradeable gun

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660 
not really the worst non upgradeable gun
in<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> game<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.740> definitely<00:01:35.189> not<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> best

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
in the game it's definitely not the best

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.999 
in the game it's definitely not the best
but<00:01:36.299> hey<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.840> gets<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> lot<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> points<00:01:37.619> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
but hey it gets you a lot of points and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.950 
but hey it gets you a lot of points and
it<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> some<00:01:38.850> kills<00:01:39.150> early<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it can get you some kills early on the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.310 
it can get you some kills early on the
game<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.439> with<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.400> gun<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.390> suffers<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
game now with this gun really suffers is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.590 
game now with this gun really suffers is
when<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.220> upgrade<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.270> gun<00:01:45.479> your

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
when you actually upgrade this gun your

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.850 
when you actually upgrade this gun your

filling all the zombies with these two

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.180 
filling all the zombies with these two

the<00:02:21.310> two<00:02:21.430> weapons<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.970> around<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.480> mo<00:02:22.660> so

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
the two weapons that around that mo so

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.010 
the two weapons that around that mo so

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
points back to buy more ammo so these

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.770 
points back to buy more ammo so these

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
time you can pack a punch it's probably

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.880 
time you can pack a punch it's probably
gonna<00:05:30.700> be<00:05:30.790> like<00:05:31.000> round<00:05:31.240> 10<00:05:31.570> or<00:05:31.720> Plus<00:05:32.020> this<00:05:32.560> kind

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
gonna be like round 10 or Plus this kind

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.220 
gonna be like round 10 or Plus this kind
of<00:05:32.980> just<00:05:33.160> horrible<00:05:33.880> like<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.480> literally<00:05:34.840> feels

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
of just horrible like it literally feels

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.110 
of just horrible like it literally feels
like<00:05:35.350> there's<00:05:35.560> no<00:05:35.800> damage<00:05:36.310> increase<00:05:36.880> even

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
like there's no damage increase even

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.330 
like there's no damage increase even
though<00:05:37.270> there<00:05:37.450> is<00:05:37.750> but<00:05:38.470> you<00:05:38.919> know<00:05:39.010> it's<00:05:39.160> like<00:05:39.280> a

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
though there is but you know it's like a

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.460 
though there is but you know it's like a
one<00:05:39.550> shot<00:05:39.820> to<00:05:40.000> the<00:05:40.030> head<00:05:40.300> around<00:05:40.510> 11<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.200> then

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
one shot to the head around 11 and then

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.930 
one shot to the head around 11 and then
after<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.980> you're<00:05:42.220> just<00:05:42.250> pretty<00:05:42.790> much

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
after that you're just pretty much

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.880 
after that you're just pretty much
finished<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.330> actually<00:05:43.570> don't<00:05:43.870> know<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:44.440> I'm
