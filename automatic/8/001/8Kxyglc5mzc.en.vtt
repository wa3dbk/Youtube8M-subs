00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
soft and fluffy i love it and i think

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.690 
soft and fluffy i love it and i think
that<00:04:07.750> has<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> i'm<00:04:08.560> not<00:04:08.859> sure<00:04:09.070> if<00:04:09.220> it's<00:04:09.340> because

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
that has to i'm not sure if it's because

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.270 
that has to i'm not sure if it's because
of<00:04:10.329> the<00:04:10.570> hohoho<00:04:10.930> oil<00:04:11.260> that's<00:04:11.560> infused<00:04:11.950> in<00:04:12.190> the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
of the hohoho oil that's infused in the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.190 
of the hohoho oil that's infused in the
brush<00:04:12.459> I<00:04:12.730> think<00:04:13.239> that<00:04:13.359> has<00:04:13.480> something<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.930> do

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
brush I think that has something to do

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.409 
brush I think that has something to do
with<00:04:14.410> it<00:04:14.440> because<00:04:15.190> I've<00:04:15.430> never<00:04:15.459> actually<00:04:15.730> used

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
with it because I've never actually used

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.279 
with it because I've never actually used
ho<00:04:16.600> ho<00:04:16.750> ho<00:04:16.870> oil<00:04:17.079> on<00:04:17.410> my<00:04:17.709> hair<00:04:18.039> and<00:04:19.109> yeah<00:04:20.109> I<00:04:20.140> think

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
ho ho ho oil on my hair and yeah I think

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.670 
ho ho ho oil on my hair and yeah I think
that<00:04:20.590> could<00:04:20.739> be<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.310> then<00:04:21.930> also<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.380> brush

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
that could be it and then also the brush

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.700 
that could be it and then also the brush
itself<00:04:24.130> it<00:04:24.520> doesn't<00:04:25.330> snag<00:04:25.900> any<00:04:26.229> of<00:04:26.410> my<00:04:26.500> hairs

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
itself it doesn't snag any of my hairs

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.190 
itself it doesn't snag any of my hairs
and<00:04:26.860> theythey<00:04:27.130> tangled<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.640> really<00:04:27.940> well

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
and theythey tangled it really well

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.920 
and theythey tangled it really well
which<00:04:29.700> was<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.729> good<00:04:31.000> thing<00:04:31.060> so<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.600> don't<00:04:31.810> want

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
which was a good thing so I don't want

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.050 
which was a good thing so I don't want
to<00:04:31.990> ramble<00:04:32.289> on<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.470> on<00:04:32.740> but<00:04:33.130> those<00:04:33.850> are
