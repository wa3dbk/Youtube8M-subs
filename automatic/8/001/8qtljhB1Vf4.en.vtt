00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
here's the parts that I finally came up

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.020 
here's the parts that I finally came up
with<00:00:05.490> and<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.090> like<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.600> fourth<00:00:06.779> try<00:00:07.290> of

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.030 
with and this is like the fourth try of

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.199 
with and this is like the fourth try of
different<00:00:09.320> different<00:00:10.320> items<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.760> could

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:12.209 
different different items that I could

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.840 
different different items that I could
put<00:00:12.360> together<00:00:12.510> and<00:00:13.100> hopes<00:00:14.100> to<00:00:14.309> try<00:00:14.520> to<00:00:14.580> make<00:00:14.820> a

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
put together and hopes to try to make a

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.300 
put together and hopes to try to make a
rather<00:00:15.690> successful<00:00:17.060> do-it-yourself<00:00:18.060> Trangia

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310

need that if we like just like these to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.080 
need that if we like just like these to
make<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> let's<00:00:59.340> just<00:00:59.609> take<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> quick

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
make this and let's just take a quick

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:08.750 
make this and let's just take a quick
look<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:05.810> this<00:01:06.920> Miller<00:01:07.920> Lite<00:01:08.190> fits

look here the this Miller Lite fits
directly<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.790> ring<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.240> bottom<00:01:12.570> of

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
directly into that ring in the bottom of

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
directly into that ring in the bottom of
a<00:01:12.750> fosters<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.560> okay<00:01:14.250> if<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.550> cut<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.790> off

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
a fosters can okay if you cut it off

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.910 
a fosters can okay if you cut it off
just<00:01:16.710> exactly<00:01:17.160> below<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.650> right<00:01:19.650> where<00:01:19.830> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
just exactly below the right where it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.490 
just exactly below the right where it
starts<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:21.770> be<00:01:22.770> take<00:01:23.190> its<00:01:23.370> full<00:01:23.580> shape<00:01:24.140> okay<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
starts to be take its full shape okay so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.300 
starts to be take its full shape okay so
we<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:26.010> and<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.860> plan<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
we have that and then the plan is to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.690 
we have that and then the plan is to
expand<00:01:29.940> this<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.540> put<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> exactly

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
expand this and put this in it exactly

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300 
expand this and put this in it exactly
like<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.120> would<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.680> do-it-yourself<00:01:34.680> beer<00:01:35.070> pot

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
like you would a do-it-yourself beer pot

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.000 
like you would a do-it-yourself beer pot
ring<00:01:35.580> because<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:36.780> know<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:37.080> that's<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
ring because we know that that's a

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.990 
ring because we know that that's a
watertight<00:01:38.460> seal<00:01:38.700> already<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:40.760> that's<00:01:41.760> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
watertight seal already so that's the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
watertight seal already so that's the
goal<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.630> piece<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.530> create<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
goal for this piece to create a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.160 
goal for this piece to create a
watertight<00:01:44.250> seal<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:47.390> top<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.690> Fancy

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.340 
white seal pushing right on each of
those<00:02:36.460> holes<00:02:36.870> which<00:02:37.870> makes<00:02:38.140> me<00:02:38.320> think

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
those holes which makes me think

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.640 
those holes which makes me think
confidently<00:02:39.310> that<00:02:39.400> it's<00:02:39.670> going<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.940> seal<00:02:40.150> up

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
confidently that it's going to seal up

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.690 
confidently that it's going to seal up
so<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.400> other<00:02:42.520> part<00:02:42.790> is<00:02:42.970> if<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.420> cut<00:02:43.660> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
so the other part is if you cut the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.540 
so the other part is if you cut the
threads<00:02:45.700> off<00:02:46.950> right<00:02:47.950> there<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.400> can<00:02:48.520> see

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
threads off right there you can see

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.510 
threads off right there you can see
where<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.120> still<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:50.800> got<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> little<00:02:51.400> bit

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
of this because of the way the bottle

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.110 
of this because of the way the bottle
shaped<00:03:13.030> with<00:03:13.240> this<00:03:13.420> secondary<00:03:13.959> lip<00:03:14.290> here<00:03:15.120> it

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.610 
doesn't go the whole way up to the top
it<00:03:18.790> just<00:03:18.850> pushes<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.690> there<00:03:19.900> nice<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.140> firmly

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.810 
build another one of these pot stands
that<00:06:47.660> folds<00:06:48.080> up<00:06:48.230> like<00:06:48.410> that<00:06:48.680> but<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:49.340> only<00:06:49.550> want

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
that folds up like that but I only want

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.740 
that folds up like that but I only want
it<00:06:49.850> to<00:06:50.000> be<00:06:50.440> four<00:06:51.440> grids<00:06:51.740> high<00:06:51.980> because<00:06:52.750> with

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
it to be four grids high because with

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.020 
it to be four grids high because with
the<00:06:53.870> way<00:06:53.990> the<00:06:54.140> flame<00:06:54.440> is<00:06:54.740> working<00:06:55.550> out<00:06:55.670> on<00:06:55.880> this

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
the way the flame is working out on this

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.630 
the way the flame is working out on this
one<00:06:56.560> and<00:06:57.560> with<00:06:57.800> the<00:06:57.890> way<00:06:58.010> I<00:06:58.040> have<00:06:58.310> the<00:06:58.460> pot

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:58.640 
one and with the way I have the pot

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.370 
one and with the way I have the pot
stand<00:06:58.970> sitting<00:06:59.390> right<00:06:59.540> on<00:06:59.570> top<00:06:59.690> of<00:07:00.020> the<00:07:00.110> stove

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:00.380 
stand sitting right on top of the stove

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.980 
stand sitting right on top of the stove
it<00:07:00.680> needs<00:07:01.280> to<00:07:01.430> be<00:07:01.550> a<00:07:01.580> little<00:07:01.730> bit<00:07:01.940> lower<00:07:02.150> so<00:07:02.480> I'm

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
it needs to be a little bit lower so I'm

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.020 
it needs to be a little bit lower so I'm
going<00:07:03.140> to<00:07:03.170> make<00:07:03.350> another<00:07:03.590> pot<00:07:03.860> stand<00:07:04.220> and<00:07:04.550> I'm

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
going to make another pot stand and I'm

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.930 
going to make another pot stand and I'm
going<00:07:05.180> to<00:07:05.210> do<00:07:05.900> it<00:07:06.020> up<00:07:06.140> like<00:07:06.830> that<00:07:07.070> and<00:07:07.340> then

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
going to do it up like that and then

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.580 
going to do it up like that and then
I'll<00:07:08.120> start<00:07:08.390> running<00:07:08.690> some<00:07:08.720> tests<00:07:09.230> on<00:07:09.320> this

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:09.590 
I'll start running some tests on this

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.340 
I'll start running some tests on this
do-it-yourself<00:07:10.510> Trangia<00:07:11.510> stove<00:07:11.870> let<00:07:12.110> me<00:07:12.200> let

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350 
do-it-yourself Trangia stove let me let

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.380 
do-it-yourself Trangia stove let me let
you<00:07:12.380> guys<00:07:12.650> take<00:07:12.920> a<00:07:12.950> quick<00:07:13.220> look<00:07:13.430> with<00:07:14.300> the

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.390 
you guys take a quick look with the

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:21.869 
you guys take a quick look with the
lights<00:07:14.630> out<00:07:14.870> on<00:07:15.080> what<00:07:15.650> that<00:07:15.770> looks<00:07:15.830> like

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:21.879 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:24.089 

so<00:07:22.539> there<00:07:22.839> you<00:07:22.929> go<00:07:23.110> you<00:07:23.139> can<00:07:23.409> pretty<00:07:23.589> much<00:07:23.679> see

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:24.099 
so there you go you can pretty much see

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:29.309 
so there you go you can pretty much see
it's<00:07:24.629> just<00:07:25.629> about<00:07:25.899> the<00:07:26.110> same<00:07:27.360> as<00:07:28.360> a<00:07:28.389> transia<00:07:29.110> I

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 
it's just about the same as a transia I

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.260 
it's just about the same as a transia I
could<00:07:29.559> probably<00:07:29.800> increase<00:07:30.399> the<00:07:30.639> size<00:07:30.909> of<00:07:31.179> the

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.270 
could probably increase the size of the

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.469 
could probably increase the size of the
Jets<00:07:31.539> a<00:07:31.689> little<00:07:31.929> bit<00:07:32.129> but<00:07:33.129> I<00:07:33.669> just<00:07:34.240> really

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 
Jets a little bit but I just really

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:36.540 
Jets a little bit but I just really
don't<00:07:34.659> think<00:07:34.749> that's<00:07:35.050> necessary<00:07:35.679> for<00:07:35.919> I'm

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550 
don't think that's necessary for I'm

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.249 
don't think that's necessary for I'm
happy<00:07:37.149> with<00:07:37.270> it<00:07:37.330> the<00:07:37.539> way<00:07:37.659> it<00:07:37.779> is<00:07:37.869> I<00:07:38.080> don't<00:07:38.139> want

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:38.259 
happy with it the way it is I don't want

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:40.649 
happy with it the way it is I don't want
to<00:07:38.409> burn<00:07:38.559> too<00:07:38.800> much<00:07:39.009> fuel<00:07:39.309> too<00:07:39.550> fast<00:07:39.849> I<00:07:40.179> think

00:07:40.649 --> 00:07:40.659 
to burn too much fuel too fast I think

00:07:40.659 --> 00:07:44.070 
to burn too much fuel too fast I think
with<00:07:41.349> an<00:07:41.469> appropriate<00:07:42.039> windscreen<00:07:42.699> and<00:07:43.209> if<00:07:43.749> I

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:44.080 
with an appropriate windscreen and if I

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.309 
with an appropriate windscreen and if I
lower<00:07:44.589> the<00:07:44.830> pot<00:07:45.039> to<00:07:45.279> the<00:07:45.429> correct<00:07:45.789> height

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 
lower the pot to the correct height

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.949 
lower the pot to the correct height
that'll<00:07:47.319> work<00:07:47.439> out<00:07:47.619> just<00:07:47.919> fine<00:07:48.069> for<00:07:48.129> me<00:07:48.959> anyway

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:49.959 
that'll work out just fine for me anyway

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:52.769 
that'll work out just fine for me anyway
