dudes but the reason I went with the
Lightning<00:02:45.989> broadsword<00:02:46.560> over<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.190> Vulgarian

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
Lightning broadsword over the Vulgarian

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
Lightning broadsword over the Vulgarian
sword<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.060> because<00:02:48.390> it's<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.900> wait<00:02:49.320> lighter

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
sword is because it's to wait lighter

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.330 
sword is because it's to wait lighter
that's<00:02:51.630> pretty<00:02:51.870> much<00:02:51.959> it<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.590> ranking<00:02:53.070> sort

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
that's pretty much it the ranking sort

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.790 
that's pretty much it the ranking sort
actually<00:02:53.610> does<00:02:54.000> more<00:02:54.239> dps<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:57.300> long<00:02:57.480> run

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
actually does more dps in the long run

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.479 
actually does more dps in the long run
however<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.070> is<00:02:59.220> two<00:02:59.430> pounds<00:02:59.690> heavier<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.489> as

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
however it is two pounds heavier and as

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.250 
however it is two pounds heavier and as
you<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.760> these<00:03:03.540> stats<00:03:03.840> are<00:03:03.989> actually<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
you can see these stats are actually a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.809 
you can see these stats are actually a
little<00:03:04.380> bit<00:03:04.590> better<00:03:04.860> too<00:03:05.160> because<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:05.670> a

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
little bit better too because it's a

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.470 
little bit better too because it's a
tiny<00:03:06.630> bit<00:03:06.930> better<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.290> scaling<00:03:08.209> but<00:03:09.209> actually

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
tiny bit better and scaling but actually

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.199 
tiny bit better and scaling but actually
can't<00:03:09.660> use<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.080> apparently<00:03:10.650> also<00:03:11.190> it's<00:03:11.640> a<00:03:11.730> it's

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
can't use it apparently also it's a it's

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.759 
can't use it apparently also it's a it's
less<00:03:12.480> stat<00:03:13.140> restrictive<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:15.260> 3<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.530> 11

lightning<00:04:52.760> priests<00:04:52.970> chime<00:04:53.210> i<00:04:53.390> just<00:04:53.660> have<00:04:53.780> not

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
lightning priests chime i just have not

leveled up the dragon chime yet but i

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.700 
leveled up the dragon chime yet but i
should<00:04:55.610> be<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.150> i<00:04:56.510> will<00:04:56.750> be<00:04:56.780> using<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.380> dragon

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
should be and i will be using the dragon

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.420 
should be and i will be using the dragon
chime<00:04:57.890> over<00:04:58.850> the<00:04:59.180> priests<00:04:59.450> time<00:05:00.310> so<00:05:01.310> that

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
chime over the priests time so that

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.710 
chime over the priests time so that
would<00:05:01.550> be<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.669> change<00:05:01.880> later<00:05:02.180> on<00:05:02.360> in<00:05:02.479> the<00:05:02.539> series

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
would be a change later on in the series

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.409 
would be a change later on in the series
so<00:05:03.710> that's<00:05:04.039> pretty<00:05:04.220> much<00:05:04.370> what's<00:05:04.789> going<00:05:04.970> on<00:05:05.060> I
