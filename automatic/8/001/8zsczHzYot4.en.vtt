00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.360
 Hello friends, we have a question 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.030
 not a bad question I would say intricate 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.869
 say and that's what people who grew up there 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.430
 8 sera le tan Russian Federation but 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.500
 it doesn't matter anymore it depends on when 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 they left but people who grew up in one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.609
 culture 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.380
 what is it like to see their own children 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.250
 who are actually Americans they 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.989
 well but it's true i can say that we 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.840
 we see here a lot of situations when 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.030
 total misunderstanding occurs when children 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 refuse to accept their own 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.530
 parents with some Russian 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.600
 let's say the statements yes there is not there 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.079
 they have mexicans there they are black there 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.070
 wear something and look at it with horror and 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.440
 some kind of monstrous going on 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.710
 rejection of their own parents is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.719
 there is a lot of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:08.070
 families where just kids are completely lost 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:11.400
 parents but what to say first 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.270
 this is the choice of parents themselves conscious 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.170
 unconsciously but they chose it 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.610
 people who because of this i know here they are 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 come to the point that they just take away 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.380
 family are back where they come from 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
 it came very rarely memory 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.250
 wrong means but it happens and i 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.590
 I know such families that they leave 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.630
 because here is the wrong environment 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.320
 for raising children there and what there 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.409
 taught there and still that I can remember when 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.200
 me the first girls from india appeared in 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.170
 school student I then they have such 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.210
 paradigm was that 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.799
 a woman can not go teacher engage 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.439
 career until he has two kids 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.950
 which but a little bit t 34 years and 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.689
 here they are all I have been there for years 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.960
 let's say 30 there 32 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.750
 such cheeky little ones such 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.000
 this image of a healthy woman should be with 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.920
 overweight is not very strong but so 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.450
 now now they are trying to change with 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.569
 to be skinny but then here they are 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.819
 were here and they all the time the main theme 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.920
 didn’t take from discussions this is how bad to live 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.780
 in america as it is not something bad to live 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.640
 but how bad to raise children because 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.560
 that he is a child comes up and talks about a 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.989
 why is it all kids can go to 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.250

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.500
 to give because he is 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.150

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.880

 amazing scene we went to the store 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.299
 now and again to buy future ones there 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.850
 the bike I was shooting there at the same time led me 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.950
 there is a video about this store and there I am 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.950

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.560
 already an old woman my opinion for 70 is 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.200
 so still dressed in all this indian with 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.050
 naked wrapped in a down there a pile of rags 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.510
 different and with her children already obviously button 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.810
 american indian kids started there 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.849
 4 brothers and sisters here they are different 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.500
 age and there they run around the store and 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.720
 folder goes trash 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.670

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.040
 nato grandmothers all that they put out 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.019
 pesters take out at some point they 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.959

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:45.920
 shallow ice there 4 they are all like that hands in 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.959
 flank and went to her all three with a call 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.519
 represented here as ordinary children there 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.319
 Russian or American there absolutely 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.930
 indian which never make sense 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.060
 grandmothers can't and they call on 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.910
 she was flooded so they attacked in three 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 and she got scared and she got scared and 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:07.610
 It became, as it were, and that's 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.040
 here you are on here and that means another 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.690
 culture another generation another life 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.670
 there and then they don't you they 200 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.260
 Now parents tell that their children 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.859
 you do not want to see because there 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.169
 the toilet is dirty and there are mosquitoes like a hand 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.470
 mine is full of all not unusual and they 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.960
 I do not want to know this disgusting food 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:34.970
 so it’s not just ours 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:37.820
 Well, this is a universal such and how 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.229
 watch this but individually but at the end 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.450
 all prizes you want your children 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.389
 were your children culturally 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.889
 relationship of value there and so on but 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.650
 raise your own children something 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.660
 will come and well or accept to live such as 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.000
 she is 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.889
 I'm really watch for 20 years as a 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.870
 life in sacramento but i'm watching from here 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.150
 we are of course there sometimes it is there 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.770
 a couple of hours away from here 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.360
 but what is interesting here is very 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.600
 a lot of young guys charm on 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.430
 absolutely who have grown here but 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.710
 more or less grow 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.190
 that is, they are as if in an American but they 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.270
 completely fluent in Russian 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.430
 someone there in Ukrainian and there 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.550
 addiction of what kind of family has not grown 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.660
 they are believers they go there church on 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.390
 all that is, they are absolutely 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.430
 American children but they are 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.500
 if they bear an imprint that is 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.840
 the environment in which they grew up and it turns out 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.880
 such a thing that sakrament here and there it is 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.740
 she doesn't pay much for a job 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.670
 about it there there and cheap everything itself 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:46.340
 and for people who come and make sense 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.070
 whose life here before chewing is 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.890
 unpretentious here they are fine there everything is there 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.910
 in Russian there are 300 thousand people from 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.230
 there in the very baptists 50 nikita here is a sheet 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.990
 from these religious groups 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.730
 but it is very comfortable but if you 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.740
 there is a question where to earn there 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.480
 let's say 100 thousand and where to earn a hundred 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.060
 fifty thousand have such questions 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.370
 not even have children grow up and here 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.860
 their children they are ready to leave from there they 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.030
 ready to move in any direction they are 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:19.160
 they want they need understand so what 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.430
 It turns out the children need more than 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.500
 parents they want such prospects and 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.570
 which parents were not open and they 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.000
 I never even took it into my head and so on 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.620
 Well, thank God I mean, I would become glory 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.440
 god when i look at these guys and 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.450
 when i see how cool they are 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.640
 hardworking and bright eyes they are 

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.780
 want to learn and so on well so they 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.290
 this is nonsense to you talent 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.290
 that is why 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.960
 here I would come to you from him
