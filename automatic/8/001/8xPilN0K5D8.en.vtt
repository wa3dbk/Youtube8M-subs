and the high-back is called multi-zone
hi<00:00:37.170> back<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.280> stiffer<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> bottom

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
hi back so it's stiffer at the bottom

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
hi back so it's stiffer at the bottom
getting<00:00:40.620> softer<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> top<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.239> gives

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
getting softer at the top so it gives

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.060 
getting softer at the top so it gives
you<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.840> response<00:00:43.290> where<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.590> need<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.800> but
