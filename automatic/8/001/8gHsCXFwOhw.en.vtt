okay so this is the old piece and and
this<00:01:32.620> is<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.920> new<00:01:33.070> piece<00:01:33.310> we're<00:01:33.820> replacing

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
this is the new piece we're replacing

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.810 
this is the new piece we're replacing
this<00:01:34.510> with<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:35.010> we're<00:01:36.010> going<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.220> put<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.460> fiber

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
this with is we're going to put a fiber

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.500 
this with is we're going to put a fiber
bundle<00:01:37.120> in<00:01:37.420> it<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.900> that's<00:01:38.200> it

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
bundle in it and that's it

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.090 
bundle in it and that's it
you<00:01:40.510> don't<00:01:40.720> need<00:01:40.870> well<00:01:41.170> because<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.860> fiber

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
you don't need well because the fiber

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.390 
you don't need well because the fiber
bundle<00:01:42.640> is<00:01:42.760> um<00:01:43.030> very<00:01:43.590> strong<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.160> gonna

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
bundle is um very strong and it gonna

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.490 
bundle is um very strong and it gonna
definitely<00:01:45.700> support<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.660> weight<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.320> a

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
definitely support the weight of this a

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.200 
definitely support the weight of this a
piece<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.920> metal<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:48.720> no<00:01:49.720> welding<00:01:50.140> required

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
piece of metal so no welding required

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.240 
piece of metal so no welding required
just<00:01:52.210> I<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.030> put<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.390> well<00:01:55.780> and<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:57.130> the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
just I have to put it well and with the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.219 
just I have to put it well and with the
file<00:01:57.550> we're<00:01:57.910> going<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.150> smooth<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.840> two

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
file we're going to smooth the two

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.440 
file we're going to smooth the two
sheets<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:01.090> they<00:02:01.119> match<00:02:01.509> perfectly<00:02:01.540> and<00:02:03.450> after

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
sheets so they match perfectly and after

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.400 
sheets so they match perfectly and after
that<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.979> don't<00:02:06.280> know<00:02:06.430> I<00:02:07.350> paint<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:10.410> it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
that we don't know I paint it and it

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:22.080 
that we don't know I paint it and it
would<00:02:11.560> look<00:02:11.709> like<00:02:11.770> nothing<00:02:12.610> ever<00:02:12.790> happened

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.160
