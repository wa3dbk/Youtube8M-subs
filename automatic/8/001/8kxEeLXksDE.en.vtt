applications<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.440> quick<00:01:02.340> solution

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
applications so a quick solution

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.580 
applications so a quick solution
I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.110> temporary<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:06.590> had

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
I think it's temporary because I had

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.429 
I think it's temporary because I had
this<00:01:07.740> problem<00:01:08.060> last<00:01:09.060> night<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.630> then<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
this problem last night and then I

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.160 
this problem last night and then I
forgot<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> did<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.810> started

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
forgot what I did but it's it started

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.890 
forgot what I did but it's it started
working<00:01:13.560> again<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.950> today<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:15.060> school<00:01:15.420> they

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
working again and today in school they

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.320 
working again and today in school they
gave<00:01:16.049> me<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.290> same<00:01:16.560> air<00:01:16.830> now<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.000> did<00:01:18.299> is

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
gave me that same air now what I did is

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.320 
gave me that same air now what I did is
I<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.600> went<00:01:18.780> into<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> App<00:01:19.290> Store<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
I just went into the App Store and

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.450 
I just went into the App Store and
downloaded<00:01:21.330> any<00:01:21.570> free<00:01:21.990> application<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
downloaded any free application and I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.510 
downloaded any free application and I
guess<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:25.259> wakes<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.830> phone<00:01:26.040> up<00:01:26.280> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
guess that I know wakes the phone up and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
guess that I know wakes the phone up and
actually<00:01:26.670> starts<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.210> applications<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually starts the applications so I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.980 
actually starts the applications so I
downloaded<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.299> free<00:01:30.479> flashlight

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
downloaded the the free flashlight

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.690 
downloaded the the free flashlight
application<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.920> could<00:01:32.100> open<00:01:32.220> face<00:01:32.520> book

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
application and I could open face book

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.429 
application and I could open face book
everything<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.180> that

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
everything like that

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.649 
everything like that
I'm<00:01:34.439> planning<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.329> re<00:01:37.159> basically<00:01:38.659> resetting

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
I'm planning on re basically resetting

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.920 
I'm planning on re basically resetting
my<00:01:39.689> phone<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.200> restore<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.030> have<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.180> cleaned

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
my phone just restore it have it cleaned

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.460 
my phone just restore it have it cleaned
out<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.340> can't<00:01:45.030> really<00:01:45.470> have

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
out because I can't really have

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
out because I can't really have
unreliable<00:01:47.220> applications<00:01:47.759> like<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.180> my

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
unreliable applications like that on my

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.960 
unreliable applications like that on my
phone<00:01:48.619> but<00:01:49.619> I'm<00:01:49.860> gonna<00:01:49.979> leave<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
phone but I'm gonna leave it if it

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.340 
phone but I'm gonna leave it if it
happens<00:01:51.119> again<00:01:51.540> I'm<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> record<00:01:52.229> that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

and<00:01:52.820> then<00:01:53.820> I'm<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.119> restore<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.509> after

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and then I'm going to restore it after

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.300 
and then I'm going to restore it after
because<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.350> not<00:01:55.500> sure<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.950> fixes

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
because I'm not sure this fixes

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.480 
because I'm not sure this fixes
temporary<00:01:56.850> or<00:01:57.810> permanent<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.920> if<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.280> have

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
temporary or permanent but if you have

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.109 
temporary or permanent but if you have
that<00:01:59.700> problem<00:02:00.710> just<00:02:01.710> do<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.880> really

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
settings I tried a lot of different

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.979 
things that could reset the phone of its
basically<00:02:29.280> how<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.060> would<00:02:30.239> call<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.569> cookies

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
basically how you would call it cookies

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.160 
basically how you would call it cookies
so<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.859> it<00:02:32.010> kind<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.849> starts<00:02:33.450> fresh<00:02:33.659> and<00:02:33.959> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
so that it kind of starts fresh and it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.979 
so that it kind of starts fresh and it

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
still did the same thing so I mean the

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.399 
still did the same thing so I mean the
temporary<00:02:37.819> solution<00:02:38.819> like<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.150> said<00:02:39.420> go<00:02:40.139> into
