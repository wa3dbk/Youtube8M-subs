00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
that's going to create depth I think any

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.560 
that's going to create depth I think any
time<00:00:32.899> you<00:00:33.109> have<00:00:33.469> a<00:00:33.500> bell<00:00:34.399> cow<00:00:34.670> God<00:00:35.030> like<00:00:35.300> that

students<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.190> game<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.479> that's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
students in the game so I think that's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.680
