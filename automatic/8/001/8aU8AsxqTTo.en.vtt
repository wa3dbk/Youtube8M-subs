00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so you don't have to repaint that every

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.210 
so you don't have to repaint that every
few<00:01:12.600> years<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.049> keeps<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.409> nice<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.619> strong

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
few years it keeps it nice and strong

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.030 
few years it keeps it nice and strong
over<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.520> years<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.939> these<00:01:15.840> open<00:01:16.110> up<00:01:16.409> so<00:01:16.710> wide

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
over the years and these open up so wide

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
over the years and these open up so wide
and<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.430> big<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.030> really<00:01:18.240> fantastic<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and so big it's really fantastic the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.499 
and so big it's really fantastic the
reason<00:01:19.619> we've<00:01:19.799> done<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> awning<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.270> goes

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
reason we've done the awning which goes

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
reason we've done the awning which goes
this<00:01:22.170> way<00:01:22.409> rather<00:01:22.619> than<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.950> casement<00:01:23.220> this<00:01:23.700> way

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this way rather than a casement this way

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.179 
this way rather than a casement this way
is<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> house<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
is that on a house like this on the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
is that on a house like this on the
outside<00:01:26.310> there's<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.030> eaves<00:01:27.360> so

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
outside there's not a lot of eaves so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.690 
outside there's not a lot of eaves so
you<00:01:28.259> can't<00:01:28.530> open<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.860> windows<00:01:29.130> too<00:01:29.310> far<00:01:29.549> when

don't<00:02:31.739> paint<00:02:32.129> it<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.760> what<00:02:32.879> we've<00:02:33.000> found

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
don't paint it because what we've found

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
is that the paint can crack while

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.500 
is that the paint can crack while
traveling<00:02:35.159> so<00:02:35.730> what<00:02:35.849> we've<00:02:35.939> done<00:02:36.030> instead<00:02:36.209> is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
traveling so what we've done instead is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.449 
traveling so what we've done instead is
we've<00:02:36.629> stained<00:02:37.079> it<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.530> we've<00:02:37.799> used<00:02:38.040> colors

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
we've stained it and we've used colors

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.750 
we've stained it and we've used colors
like<00:02:38.700> white<00:02:39.000> as<00:02:39.719> well<00:02:40.049> as<00:02:40.200> other<00:02:40.500> colors<00:02:40.950> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
like white as well as other colors so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.190 
like white as well as other colors so
you'll<00:02:41.969> see<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> photo<00:02:42.599> of<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.840> tumbleweed

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you'll see a photo of a tumbleweed

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.899 
you'll see a photo of a tumbleweed
inside<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.889> the<00:02:44.010> white<00:02:44.189> walls<00:02:44.519> and

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
inside with the white walls and

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.490 
inside with the white walls and
typically<00:02:45.510> what<00:02:45.689> that<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.900> it's<00:02:46.109> a<00:02:46.230> stay

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
typically what that is it's a stay

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.369 
typically what that is it's a stay
instead<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.099> paint<00:02:47.989> some<00:02:48.989> of<00:02:49.079> our<00:02:49.200> options

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
instead of a paint some of our options

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.099 
instead of a paint some of our options
we<00:02:49.739> have<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.970> ladder<00:02:51.209> stairs<00:02:51.659> they

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
we have are the ladder stairs they

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.720 
we have are the ladder stairs they
definitely<00:02:52.650> make<00:02:52.859> it<00:02:52.889> a<00:02:53.040> lot<00:02:53.220> easier<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.519> go<00:02:53.669> up

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
definitely make it a lot easier to go up

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.159 
definitely make it a lot easier to go up
and<00:02:53.879> down<00:02:54.000> typically<00:02:54.569> we're<00:02:54.689> gonna<00:02:54.780> have<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
and down typically we're gonna have the

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:56.899 
and down typically we're gonna have the
rolling<00:02:55.500> ladder<00:02:55.709> as<00:02:55.919> our<00:02:56.069> standard<00:02:56.489> option<00:02:56.819> in

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:56.909 
rolling ladder as our standard option in

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:57.670 
rolling ladder as our standard option in

the house
these<00:02:58.680> ladder<00:02:58.980> stairs<00:02:59.370> are<00:02:59.519> great<00:03:00.290> we've

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
these ladder stairs are great we've

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.479 
these ladder stairs are great we've
added<00:03:01.439> another<00:03:01.650> option<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.040> well<00:03:02.189> so<00:03:02.340> if<00:03:02.400> you

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
added another option as well so if you

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.009 
added another option as well so if you
want<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.760> have<00:03:02.909> the<00:03:03.060> drawers<00:03:03.359> placed<00:03:03.689> in<00:03:03.840> them

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
as well you can do that too on the

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.970 
as well you can do that too on the
outside<00:03:06.870> we've<00:03:07.079> chosen<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.439> go<00:03:07.560> with<00:03:07.680> cedar

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
outside we've chosen to go with cedar

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.520 
outside we've chosen to go with cedar
siding<00:03:08.659> cedar<00:03:09.659> is<00:03:09.870> great<00:03:10.079> for<00:03:10.290> several

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
siding cedar is great for several

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920 
siding cedar is great for several
reasons<00:03:10.889> one<00:03:11.549> it's<00:03:11.879> incredibly<00:03:12.569> weather

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
reasons one it's incredibly weather

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.860 
reasons one it's incredibly weather
resistant<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.829> bug<00:03:14.129> resistant<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.940> two<00:03:15.540> it's

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
resistant in bug resistant and two it's

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.899 
resistant in bug resistant and two it's
incredibly<00:03:16.470> lightweight<00:03:16.829> compared<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:17.729> other

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
incredibly lightweight compared to other

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.330 
incredibly lightweight compared to other
woods<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.569> with<00:03:19.199> a<00:03:19.229> house<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:19.919> this<00:03:19.949> on

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
woods and with a house like this on

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.789 
woods and with a house like this on
wheels<00:03:20.609> you're<00:03:21.389> really<00:03:21.720> trying<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.139> fit<00:03:22.620> as

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
wheels you're really trying to fit as

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.860 
wheels you're really trying to fit as
much<00:03:22.979> as<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:23.310> can<00:03:23.609> without<00:03:23.849> being<00:03:24.209> too<00:03:24.479> heavy

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
much as you can without being too heavy

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.770 
much as you can without being too heavy
so<00:03:25.290> weight<00:03:25.470> does<00:03:25.680> play<00:03:25.889> a<00:03:25.919> big<00:03:26.010> role<00:03:26.310> in<00:03:26.340> things

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
so weight does play a big role in things

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.909 
so weight does play a big role in things
so<00:03:27.780> I'm<00:03:27.930> standing<00:03:28.139> here<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.620> got<00:03:28.739> two

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
so I'm standing here and I got two

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.349 
so I'm standing here and I got two
tumbleweeds<00:03:29.400> I've<00:03:29.549> got<00:03:29.699> an<00:03:29.819> all-electric

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
tumbleweeds I've got an all-electric

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.180 
tumbleweeds I've got an all-electric
model<00:03:30.720> I've<00:03:30.810> got<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.109> electric<00:03:31.470> propane<00:03:31.919> mix

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
model I've got the electric propane mix

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.589 
model I've got the electric propane mix
and<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.819> real<00:03:33.000> big<00:03:33.180> difference<00:03:33.299> between

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
and the real big difference between

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.080 
and the real big difference between
those<00:03:33.870> two<00:03:34.079> is<00:03:34.229> gonna<00:03:34.409> be<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:35.280> readily

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
those two is gonna be how readily

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.309 
those two is gonna be how readily
accessible<00:03:36.329> are<00:03:36.599> you<00:03:36.690> gonna<00:03:36.810> be<00:03:36.930> with<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.109> grid

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
accessible are you gonna be with a grid

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.649 
accessible are you gonna be with a grid
so<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:37.919> you're<00:03:38.069> gonna<00:03:38.220> be<00:03:38.430> someplace<00:03:38.849> in<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
so if you're gonna be someplace in the

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.539 
so if you're gonna be someplace in the
middle<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.019> nowhere<00:03:40.229> and<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:41.220> don't<00:03:41.370> know<00:03:41.489> if

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
middle of nowhere and you don't know if

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.280 
middle of nowhere and you don't know if
you're<00:03:41.639> gonna<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.090> 50<00:03:42.299> amp<00:03:42.659> then<00:03:43.139> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
you're gonna have that 50 amp then the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.869 
you're gonna have that 50 amp then the
combo<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.799> good<00:03:43.949> deal<00:03:44.129> but<00:03:44.579> if<00:03:44.669> you<00:03:44.760> think

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
combo is a good deal but if you think

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:46.250 
combo is a good deal but if you think
you're<00:03:45.030> gonna<00:03:45.120> be<00:03:45.239> an<00:03:45.359> RV<00:03:45.599> parking<00:03:45.900> lots<00:03:46.109> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
you're gonna be an RV parking lots the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.689 
you're gonna be an RV parking lots the
whole<00:03:46.409> time<00:03:46.620> then<00:03:47.010> go<00:03:47.129> with<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.280> 50<00:03:47.609> amp

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
whole time then go with the 50 amp

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.490 
whole time then go with the 50 amp
that's<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:47.970> great<00:03:48.120> choice<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:49.409> it

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
that's a great choice and then when it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.140 
that's a great choice and then when it
comes<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.769> water<00:03:49.949> holding<00:03:50.430> tanks<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:50.879> can<00:03:51.000> go

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
comes to water holding tanks we can go

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.179 
comes to water holding tanks we can go
the<00:03:51.269> 25<00:03:51.720> gallon<00:03:52.079> holding<00:03:52.319> tank<00:03:52.530> all<00:03:52.979> the<00:03:53.040> way

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
the 25 gallon holding tank all the way

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.979 
the 25 gallon holding tank all the way
up<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> about<00:03:53.459> 125<00:03:54.060> gallon<00:03:54.540> holding<00:03:54.810> tank<00:03:54.959> and

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
up to about 125 gallon holding tank and

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.330 
up to about 125 gallon holding tank and
that's<00:03:55.109> going<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.439> partially<00:03:55.680> depend<00:03:56.159> on<00:03:56.250> the

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
that's going to partially depend on the

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.069 
that's going to partially depend on the
model<00:03:56.549> you<00:03:56.819> have<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.299> each<00:03:57.689> one's<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:57.989> little

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
model you have and each one's a little

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.929
