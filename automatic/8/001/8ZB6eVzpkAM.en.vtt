over<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.929> kitchen<00:01:53.079> floor<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.490> i<00:01:54.880> was<00:01:55.179> using

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
over the kitchen floor so i was using

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.169 
over the kitchen floor so i was using
egg<00:01:55.780> cartons<00:01:56.229> and<00:01:56.469> I<00:01:56.590> had<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.399> egg<00:01:57.700> carton

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
egg cartons and I had this egg carton

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.590 
egg cartons and I had this egg carton
which<00:01:58.689> was<00:01:58.929> shorter<00:01:59.380> and<00:02:00.119> they<00:02:01.119> all<00:02:01.240> dumped

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.230 
which was shorter and they all dumped
out<00:02:01.719> of<00:02:01.899> it<00:02:02.049> so<00:02:03.039> then<00:02:03.549> I<00:02:03.579> found<00:02:03.850> another<00:02:04.119> egg

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
out of it so then I found another egg
