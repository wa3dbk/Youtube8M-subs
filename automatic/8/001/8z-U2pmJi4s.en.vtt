00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
picking up this debris all was doing was

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.730 
picking up this debris all was doing was
clogging<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.039> blades<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:50.229> we're<00:01:50.440> removing

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.090 

when<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.270> started<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.750> process<00:03:22.010> there<00:03:23.010> were

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
when we started the process there were

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.620 
when we started the process there were
three<00:03:23.370> methods<00:03:23.819> we're<00:03:23.970> going<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.209> use<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
three methods we're going to use to

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.770 
three methods we're going to use to
remove<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.080> mastic<00:03:25.850> one<00:03:26.850> was<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.240> titanium

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
remove the mastic one was the titanium

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.580 
remove the mastic one was the titanium
block<00:03:29.270> as<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.480> can<00:03:30.630> see<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.140> doing<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.470> great

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
block as you can see it's doing a great

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.570 
block as you can see it's doing a great
job<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:33.030> only<00:03:33.240> problem<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.780> it<00:03:34.470> clogs<00:03:35.069> quickly

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
job the only problem is it clogs quickly

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.260 
job the only problem is it clogs quickly
the<00:03:36.540> surface<00:03:36.959> area<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.440> titanium<00:03:38.010> block

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
the surface area the titanium block

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.720 
the surface area the titanium block
allows<00:03:39.270> for<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.690> mastic<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.770> be<00:03:40.920> reheated<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
allows for the mastic to be reheated and

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.300 
allows for the mastic to be reheated and
get<00:03:42.150> gummy<00:03:42.390> again<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:43.130> reactivates<00:03:44.130> the

get gummy again it reactivates the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.809 
get gummy again it reactivates the
adhesive<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.239> clogs<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.440> abrasive<00:03:46.980> while

adhesive and clogs the abrasive while
this<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.239> a<00:03:48.510> method<00:03:49.110> used<00:03:49.400> pretty<00:03:50.400> often<00:03:50.670> the

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
this is a method used pretty often the

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.810 
this is a method used pretty often the
process<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.900> taking<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.260> block<00:03:52.560> off<00:03:52.830> cleaning

process of taking the block off cleaning

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.240 
process of taking the block off cleaning
it<00:03:53.910> with<00:03:53.940> solvent<00:03:54.540> putting<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.290> back<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.709> and

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
it with solvent putting it back on and

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.400 
it with solvent putting it back on and
continuing<00:03:57.030> can<00:03:57.780> be<00:03:57.900> tedious<00:03:59.989> another<00:04:00.989> method

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
continuing can be tedious another method

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.610 
continuing can be tedious another method
