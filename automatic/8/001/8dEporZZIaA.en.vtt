 feet on the docks the girls 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.320
 go crazy and send me their 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.650
 people I hope you're fine 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 going sexy chocolate my good and today 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 I will offer you a little game at 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470
 team death on the terminal map 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.599
 so this map is a little bit 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.519
 paradise of all tricks writers 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.349
 dden of all the kits feeder the ground 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.210
 of all skiers of all 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.579
 rocks hours she is beautiful I love her 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.260
 but on mw2 that clearly people 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.489
 on a w3 I do not know what they did 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.290
 but they are not broken the onion 1 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.870
 I find it really not aesthetic to 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.100
 all she is gray here is no 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.930
 color one would believe a little bit in 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.180
 a morgue so it's true that it's a 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.039
 little bit about doing corpse 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.890
 in a morgue but they may have 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.570
 toup their costs by thinking that eh ben 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.059
 it's supposed to be in an airport in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.609
 more and ben she came out maybe 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.199
 six months after the release of the game 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.609
 so here's what to tell you the truth 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.660
 this match the awards because she was 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.720
 free otherwise I would not have it 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.220
 download i downloaded it all 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.630
 first dlc and saw that I had been 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.979
 really very dissatisfied with the cards that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.630
 had in it I did not really have who 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 at all I thought I was not 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.689
 reiterated twice the same mistake then 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.549
 maybe you have everything you 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.659
 download and you really liked 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.280
 what was there to offer you 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.689
 if so, do not hesitate to tell me 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.560
 say in the comments it will make me 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.049
 pleasure to know it 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.189
 and then why not give me 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.990
 the names of the maps because then I 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.640
 really know nothing at all maybe 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.619
 it will grow me a little bit on this fire 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.840
 king game and then why not make a 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.549
 little recap of the furniture you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.650
 liked and furniture that you have 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.020
 detected on 7 mw 3 you get to 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.299
 the end of the game little parenthesis nothing but 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.369
 for me quickly fast of eo2 and that's it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.320
 I close right away 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.030
 and then bah me the maps that I have 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.200
 really loved then my favorite I think 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.030
 that you realized 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.799
 well it was a mission she that 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.810
 is still so I have a lot 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.030
 loved dome i loved bootleg 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.219
 hard hat all the maps that allows us 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.079
 to search a little bit and then if not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.820
 for the maps hate and ben we'll say 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.310
 downturn I think that anyway we 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 is all in the same case it's very 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.799
 very rare that I saw someone who 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.690
 vote to play on this map 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.159
 after there are weights or positions that I have 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.290
 not who does it all 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.909
 is there anything else fallen short allen at 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.049
 departure I liked it well and then she took me 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.060
 inflated fast enough 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.799
 so I very quickly dropped the case 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.120
 support now and ben when she is 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.709
 there and well I do not vote for it all 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.379
 simply 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.049
 otherwise, well, besides that, the others nothing to 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.879
 say on particular I did not have you 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.250
 for neither against nor will we say well at 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.049
 contrary as would have said eh ben this 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.129
 great sir pierre desproges then 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.180
 for the youngest of you 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.190
 maybe you do not know him 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.860
 he was a very great comedian in a 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.120
 little bit in the line of coluche 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.560
 I know it has nothing to do with the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.910
 comments staked as usual I 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.810
 go astray a little bit it does not matter 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.480
 maybe I will have taught you 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.069
 something for the shot and then that's it 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.590
 if not to come back to this brand 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:55.810
 terminal dnw 3 well it's playing a little 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.459
 little like mw2 we will not hide that 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.530
 plays a lot on the spots that it is 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.920
 beyond cistern in the cockpit of 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.500
 the plane 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.019
 oulala baoulÃ© how where the guys get 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.120
 find in long shoot between the flag 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.849
 to it will have to pose it's in dominance 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.579
 so what am I doing now when that 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.829
 play like that on maps or sajoo on 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.690
 spot and well I put myself with it all 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.280
 elite shearer so I know that 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.849
 does a little bit but it's 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.530
 not serious 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.000
 I was tired of being always in 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.290
 running like crazy and me 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.239
 to make people smoke because people were 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.230
 static then on one side it's not about 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.290
 their fault because it's the map that 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.569
 is designed like that and they are not wrong 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.829
 of how to play so we go 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.900
 to say even if it spoils a little pleasure 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.829
 we will not hide it so I put myself 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.459
 with sniper 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:41.349
 anyway the game was designed from 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.389
 in such a way that they attend to death 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:45.250
 ballet player so 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.709
 and now I'm playing like everyone else 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.629
 world and then that's all so this tattoo 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.639
 to come back to that I really do not like 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.079
 well by cons there is a small problem 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.209
 I feel like I'm losing a lot 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.579
 a lot of precision you will tell me if 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:01.480
 you it's the same the problem is that 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:02.410
 in fact I focus a lot on 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.910
 the nicks of the guys 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.319
 so when they are hidden behind a 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.569
 trash or a crate or whatever 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.040
 be and not I focus as I 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.780
 just told you about the nickname 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.280
 and I shoot and as you know 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.480
 and when we shoot a nickname that 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.069
 do not puncture the player 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.599
 so it's a bit of a pity but 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.650
 otherwise except that and good game nothing to their 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:19.989
 blame 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.759
 it helps me a lot to do ngo 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.970
 food and then it's very good like that 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:27.490
 and it's all good go short 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.350
 now eh bah listen bigger 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.389
 thing to say to me except that I would like to 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.880
 make a big big dedication to my 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.370
 buddy skin that my little pot that stinks 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.680
 Montpetit rage skin that my little cardboard 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.570
 fruit juice packaging voila voila 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.860
 a little bit of trolling like 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.449
 usually I'm going to do a little 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.880
 parenthesis see what I have a drama 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.710
 it's a soul 4 1 with a touch sight 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.970
 or so I do not know how the guys 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.650
 who manage to play with that honestly 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.240
 look I pull I do not even know where I 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.190
 honestly I do not even know where I 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.300
 to say I was fixed sight and then to the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.500
 late I even pulled you over because 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.039
 I did it anyway for sure 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.539
 I'm going to do it so I'm how I 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.580
 put myself with my pay 9a did not even 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.260
 I do not go back on it 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.000
 remember all too honestly good on 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.530
 will see what happens in my opinion I 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.340
 will make me smoke before I even get 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.260
 makes a frag 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.400
 but it will not be too serious so what is 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.380
 what I said yeah then a little 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.880
 dedication even a big dedication to my 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.440
 buddy trash skin who for what they 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.840
 know it's the slayer of the team 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.430
 rage on xbox 360 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.940

 Anyway even on twitter and he had the 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:36.400
 good idea of iron eba a live comment a 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.630
 laughed in front of his followers and he told me 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.330
 asked if I wanted to accompany him so 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.680
 we did a little of the allied on twitter 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.020

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.470

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:28.349
 I say it's really a player 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:30.299
 exceptional so do not hesitate ebp to 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.569
 apart from that people bigger thing to you 

00:06:30.299 --> 00:06:33.299
 say 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.399
 the gameplay will come to know is good 

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:37.439
 now I hope you have passed 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:39.419
 a good time with me that I would not be 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:42.329
 have not gone too far in 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.279
 rotten delusions in my opinion if like 

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:46.829
 usually but hey it's not a big deal 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:48.899
 I wish you all and have a good time 

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:49.769
 a good day a good evening of 

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:52.110
 love the vibe 

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:54.979

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.979
