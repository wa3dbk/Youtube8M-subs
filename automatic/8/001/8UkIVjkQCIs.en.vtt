again these two together is actually

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.740 
again these two together is actually
really<00:03:59.370> difficult<00:03:59.640> first<00:04:00.209> time<00:04:00.420> it<00:04:00.510> took<00:04:00.660> me

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
really difficult first time it took me

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.000 
really difficult first time it took me
about<00:04:00.900> an<00:04:01.020> hour<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.349> half<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.800> I'm<00:04:01.860> not

about an hour and a half and I'm not

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.680 
about an hour and a half and I'm not
even<00:04:02.099> kidding<00:04:02.400> it's<00:04:03.000> certainly<00:04:03.270> not<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.599> a

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
even kidding it's certainly not just a

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.650 
even kidding it's certainly not just a
case<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:04.080> oh<00:04:04.260> yeah<00:04:04.910> but<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:05.940> think<00:04:06.270> it's<00:04:06.450> worth

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
case of oh yeah but I think it's worth

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.930 
case of oh yeah but I think it's worth
it<00:04:06.959> this<00:04:07.410> is<00:04:07.650> just<00:04:07.980> evil

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
it this is just evil

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
see jetfire's face but then at this

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.370 
see jetfire's face but then at this
point<00:04:25.980> of<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.190> movie<00:04:26.520> he's<00:04:27.180> dead<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.260> that

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
point of the movie he's dead so that

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.629 
point of the movie he's dead so that
would<00:04:28.500> have<00:04:28.590> been<00:04:28.620> a<00:04:28.710> bit<00:04:28.889> weird<00:04:29.100> bluster

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
would have been a bit weird bluster

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:30.770 
would have been a bit weird bluster
that's<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.940> effect<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.300> Prime's<00:04:30.570> just

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
that's the effect that Prime's just

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.600 
that's the effect that Prime's just
wearing<00:04:30.990> his<00:04:31.169> bits<00:04:31.440> you<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:32.010> only<00:04:32.100> do<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.400> lot

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
wearing his bits you can only do a lot

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.920 
wearing his bits you can only do a lot
with<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:32.850> thing<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.330> mean<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.510> can<00:04:33.720> just

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
with this thing I mean you can just

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.629 
with this thing I mean you can just
about<00:04:34.110> move<00:04:34.320> its<00:04:34.470> arms<00:04:34.830> and<00:04:35.040> it's<00:04:35.220> actually

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
about move its arms and it's actually

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.760 
about move its arms and it's actually
really<00:04:36.180> heavy<00:04:36.540> and<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.139> don't<00:04:37.200> think<00:04:37.530> it'd<00:04:37.650> be

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
really heavy and I don't think it'd be

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.560 
really heavy and I don't think it'd be
too<00:04:37.950> hard<00:04:37.979> to<00:04:38.280> snap<00:04:38.550> off<00:04:38.729> something<00:04:39.090> important

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
too hard to snap off something important

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.390 
too hard to snap off something important
and<00:04:39.900> this<00:04:40.050> bit<00:04:40.229> here<00:04:40.350> looks<00:04:40.560> pretty<00:04:40.800> sharp<00:04:40.860> so

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
and this bit here looks pretty sharp so

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.980 
and this bit here looks pretty sharp so
I<00:04:41.430> don't<00:04:41.639> like<00:04:41.760> having<00:04:41.970> my<00:04:42.150> eye<00:04:42.180> so<00:04:42.540> close<00:04:42.780> to

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
I don't like having my eye so close to

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.219 
I don't like having my eye so close to
it

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
it

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.510 
it
but<00:04:43.410> as<00:04:43.530> if<00:04:43.680> you're<00:04:43.800> gonna<00:04:43.889> play<00:04:44.160> with<00:04:44.190> it

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
but as if you're gonna play with it

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.219 
but as if you're gonna play with it
although<00:04:45.000> this<00:04:45.180> clearly<00:04:45.479> is<00:04:45.690> all<00:04:45.900> about

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
although this clearly is all about

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.570 
although this clearly is all about
optimist<00:04:46.740> I<00:04:46.889> think<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.160> could<00:04:47.280> have<00:04:47.340> used<00:04:47.400> a

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
optimist I think it could have used a

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.580 
optimist I think it could have used a
better<00:04:47.729> name<00:04:48.000> than<00:04:48.030> just<00:04:48.419> power<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:49.080> Optimus

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
better name than just power of Optimus

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.180 
better name than just power of Optimus
