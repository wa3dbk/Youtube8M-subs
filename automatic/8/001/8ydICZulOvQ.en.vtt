00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:10.759
 Euro back 48 new in which will take care of us Rome 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:13.169
 boxing 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.740
 under indeed boxing and my text so 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.560
 At the time they were 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.119
 so plans in the year 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.259
 or whatever I see 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.259
 In any case I have here 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.169
 more texts made Blatter a headline yet 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.040
 and yes, we were lying and money 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.040
 So little have removed part "but our resources are gentle 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.260
 and now we start writing with a box was Border 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.680
 Colon percent 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
 so lie line reveals everything 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 the larger percent 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.730
 to wear Kexel for themselves 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.390
 and 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.590
 but should 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 Save cloud so Klaus h 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.010
 and now we have a box here 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.330

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.840
 around 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.630
 with faith Rocks 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.670
 which is one pixel wide 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.970
 so of course it's still shit out 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.350
 because the goose and she bent over that right way goes 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.250
 but also that it really Emmendingen tack 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.030
 is 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.929
 and around 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.190
 m write now 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.020
 a semicolon 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.020
 Wulff so again spread colon 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 right Werner Kexel 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.470
 Protest is that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.310
 to generate 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.920
 what we now even more percent, for example, that the text even more so close 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.680

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.179
 he was already 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.729

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.609
 in the title 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:13.959
 his 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.189
 equal 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:17.619

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.539

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:31.539

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.079

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.569
 like this 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.389
 a box 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.739
 beautifully adapted a lyricist UL 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.019
