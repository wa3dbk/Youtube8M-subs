as<00:00:00.780> first<00:00:01.079> flight<00:00:01.410> around<00:00:01.740> our<00:00:01.890> solar<00:00:02.100> system

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
as first flight around our solar system

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.180 
as first flight around our solar system
here's<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.909> picture<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.360> Mars<00:00:03.710> by<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.799> way<00:00:04.980> this

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
here's a picture of Mars by the way this

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.249 
here's a picture of Mars by the way this
is<00:00:05.250> not<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> professional<00:00:06.150> tape<00:00:06.420> as<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.140> can

album<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.510> I've<00:00:09.660> just<00:00:09.690> got<00:00:10.019> my<00:00:10.050> camcorder<00:00:10.469> out

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
album and I've just got my camcorder out

album and I've just got my camcorder out
and<00:00:11.250> Wendell<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.700> i<00:00:11.759> are<00:00:11.910> flipping<00:00:12.059> through

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
and Wendell and i are flipping through

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.959 
and Wendell and i are flipping through
the<00:00:12.599> pictures<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> not<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> produced

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the pictures so this is not a produced

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.480 
the pictures so this is not a produced
tape<00:00:15.269> for<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.809> look<00:00:15.960> at<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.500> it'll

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
tape for you to look at so it'll

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.920 
tape for you to look at so it'll
probably<00:00:17.520> never<00:00:17.820> be<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.330> market<00:00:18.690> but<00:00:18.840> you

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
probably never be on the market but you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.210 
probably never be on the market but you
at<00:00:18.990> least<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> chance<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.949> some<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
at least you get a chance to see some of

bright<00:00:24.420> on<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:26.539> now<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.650> Mars<00:00:28.980> but<00:00:29.490> here's

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bright on it now here is Mars but here's

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.370 
bright on it now here is Mars but here's
one<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.000> these<00:00:30.119> satellites<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.170> orbit

plaza on Mars about the face on Mars and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.149 
plaza on Mars about the face on Mars and
we<00:01:12.990> should<00:01:13.140> hold<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.470> other<00:01:13.680> people<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.070> been

looking into no we published a paper
back<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> 70s<00:01:18.390> talking<00:01:19.140> about<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.650> there

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
back in the 70s talking about that there

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.410 
back in the 70s talking about that there
was<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> race<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.490> people<00:01:20.790> lived<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.119> Mars

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
was a race that people lived on Mars

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.160 
was a race that people lived on Mars
they<00:01:22.380> had<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.530> terrible<00:01:22.890> catastrophe<00:01:23.130> about

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
they had a terrible catastrophe about

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.870 
they had a terrible catastrophe about
186,000<00:01:25.170> years<00:01:25.320> back<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> time<00:01:26.520> there<00:01:26.729> was

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
186,000 years back at the time there was

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.760 
186,000 years back at the time there was
about<00:01:27.119> 40<00:01:27.450> million<00:01:27.659> people<00:01:27.780> killed<00:01:28.320> on<00:01:28.470> Mars

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
about 40 million people killed on Mars

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.109 
about 40 million people killed on Mars
and<00:01:29.180> they're<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.329> gone<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.990> course<00:01:32.119> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and they're all gone now of course so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.240 
and they're all gone now of course so
they're<00:01:33.299> worse<00:01:33.470> societies<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.070> we

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
they're worse societies there and we

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.830 
they're worse societies there and we
will<00:01:35.430> find<00:01:35.670> quite<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> few<00:01:36.210> remains<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.750> their

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
will find quite a few remains of their

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.230 
will find quite a few remains of their
civilization<00:01:37.530> once<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.130> there<00:01:38.240> here

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
civilization once we get up there here

this<00:05:39.900> one<00:05:40.139> is<00:05:40.289> the<00:05:40.440> strangest<00:05:40.889> of<00:05:41.070> all<00:05:41.250> it's<00:05:41.910> a

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
this one is the strangest of all it's a

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.620 
this one is the strangest of all it's a
plant<00:05:42.449> that<00:05:42.780> has<00:05:43.590> an<00:05:43.740> insect<00:05:44.250> head<00:05:44.759> Billy

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
plant that has an insect head Billy

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.570 
plant that has an insect head Billy
calls<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.110> a<00:05:46.199> plant<00:05:46.470> them<00:05:46.680> they<00:05:47.220> were<00:05:47.280> trying

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
calls it a plant them they were trying

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.550 
calls it a plant them they were trying
to<00:05:47.729> explain<00:05:48.030> to<00:05:48.090> him<00:05:48.419> how<00:05:48.449> the<00:05:48.750> evolution<00:05:49.470> of

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
to explain to him how the evolution of

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.950 
to explain to him how the evolution of
different<00:05:49.949> life<00:05:50.099> forms<00:05:50.400> goes<00:05:50.729> how<00:05:51.360> for

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
different life forms goes how for

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.770 
different life forms goes how for
instance<00:05:51.990> here's<00:05:52.500> a<00:05:52.669> plant<00:05:53.669> life<00:05:53.970> when<00:05:54.630> the

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
instance here's a plant life when the

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.839 
instance here's a plant life when the
plants<00:05:55.440> are<00:05:55.470> the<00:05:55.860> food<00:05:56.039> kingdom<00:05:56.460> of<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.639> world

when<00:05:57.389> the<00:05:57.509> plants<00:05:57.870> evolved<00:05:58.349> with<00:05:58.530> certain

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
when the plants evolved with certain

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.650 
when the plants evolved with certain
level<00:05:59.070> of<00:05:59.160> evolution<00:05:59.430> then<00:05:59.940> these<00:06:00.090> lower

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
level of evolution then these lower

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.140 
level of evolution then these lower
order<00:06:01.050> forms<00:06:01.380> here<00:06:01.530> in<00:06:01.650> small<00:06:01.979> head<00:06:02.280> and<00:06:02.490> this

animal kingdom has raised the evolution
of<00:06:27.780> the<00:06:28.199> body<00:06:28.409> material<00:06:28.830> high<00:06:29.190> enough<00:06:29.520> so<00:06:29.729> our

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
of the body material high enough so our

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.840 
of the body material high enough so our
