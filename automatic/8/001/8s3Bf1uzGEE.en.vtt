that<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.620> best<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.190> you<00:01:35.280> think<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
that is so best that you think a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.710 
that is so best that you think a
document<00:01:35.910> you<00:01:36.000> drop<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.330> into<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.540> black<00:01:36.660> hole

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
document you drop it into a black hole

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.510
