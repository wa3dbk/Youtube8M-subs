and a half years ago the number of views
is<00:00:23.820> over<00:00:24.000> 8,000<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.050> that's<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.890> pretty<00:00:26.279> decent

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699

swap<00:00:46.760> for<00:00:47.000> the<00:00:47.059> pattern<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:47.620> this<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.739> not

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
swap for the pattern but this is not

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.790 
swap for the pattern but this is not
actually<00:00:49.190> correct<00:00:50.410> so<00:00:51.410> let's<00:00:51.440> watch<00:00:51.620> this

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
actually correct so let's watch this

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.889 
actually correct so let's watch this
video<00:00:52.070> here<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:52.579> it's<00:00:53.180> five<00:00:53.390> seconds<00:00:53.750> long

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
video here so it's five seconds long

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.790 
video here so it's five seconds long
it's<00:00:54.140> really<00:00:54.199> quick<00:00:59.079> so<00:01:00.079> there<00:01:00.229> it<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.440> I

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
it's really quick so there it is I

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.889 
it's really quick so there it is I
consider<00:01:01.550> myself<00:01:01.729> pretty<00:01:02.000> good<00:01:02.210> at<00:01:02.479> figuring

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
consider myself pretty good at figuring

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.450 
consider myself pretty good at figuring
out<00:01:02.960> juggling<00:01:03.350> patterns<00:01:03.769> I'm<00:01:04.100> gonna<00:01:04.250> take<00:01:04.430> a

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
out juggling patterns I'm gonna take a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.270 
out juggling patterns I'm gonna take a
crack<00:01:04.759> at<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.500> I'll<00:01:06.500> show<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:06.860> guys<00:01:07.070> how

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
crack at this and I'll show you guys how

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.910 
crack at this and I'll show you guys how
to<00:01:07.310> do<00:01:07.550> it<00:01:07.869> so<00:01:08.869> there's<00:01:09.050> two<00:01:09.200> throws<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.860> you

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
to do it so there's two throws that you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.200 
to do it so there's two throws that you
should<00:01:10.310> learn<00:01:10.430> them<00:01:10.550> before<00:01:10.790> you<00:01:10.850> try<00:01:11.060> this

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
should learn them before you try this

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.160 
should learn them before you try this
pattern<00:01:11.770> one<00:01:12.770> is<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.190> slam<00:01:13.869> which<00:01:14.869> looks<00:01:15.110> like

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
pattern one is the slam which looks like

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.760 
pattern one is the slam which looks like
this

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.990 
this
and<00:01:16.479> other<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.720> chop<00:01:18.619> which<00:01:19.340> chops<00:01:19.850> look

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
and other is the chop which chops look

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.600 
and other is the chop which chops look
like<00:01:20.179> this<00:01:20.800> there's<00:01:21.800> a<00:01:21.860> third<00:01:22.130> type<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.369> throw

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
like this there's a third type of throw

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.749 
like this there's a third type of throw
that<00:01:22.759> he<00:01:22.820> does<00:01:23.000> in<00:01:23.119> his<00:01:23.179> pattern<00:01:23.630> which<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.950> call

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
that he does in his pattern which I call

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.300 
that he does in his pattern which I call
a<00:01:25.789> fake<00:01:26.090> chop<00:01:26.450> but<00:01:26.929> this<00:01:27.080> throw<00:01:27.289> happens<00:01:27.649> kind

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
a fake chop but this throw happens kind

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.310 
a fake chop but this throw happens kind
of<00:01:28.460> naturally<00:01:28.880> in<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.060> pattern<00:01:29.300> so<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:29.960> don't

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
of naturally in this pattern so I don't

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.469 
of naturally in this pattern so I don't
even<00:01:30.409> know<00:01:30.619> if<00:01:30.649> he<00:01:30.890> intended<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.759> do<00:01:32.270> that

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
even know if he intended to do that

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.779 
even know if he intended to do that
let's<00:01:33.440> talk<00:01:33.530> about<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.830> slams<00:01:34.100> if<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.640> throw

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
let's talk about the slams if you throw

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.340 
let's talk about the slams if you throw
continuous<00:01:35.270> slams<00:01:35.509> that's<00:01:35.990> called<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
continuous slams that's called the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.020 
continuous slams that's called the
shuffle<00:01:36.500> pattern<00:01:36.679> if<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.429> had<00:01:37.550> a<00:01:37.580> cascade

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
shuffle pattern if you had a cascade

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.510 
shuffle pattern if you had a cascade
throw<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:38.659> between<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.170> slams<00:01:39.470> that's<00:01:40.310> called

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
throw in between the slams that's called

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.550 
throw in between the slams that's called
Luke's<00:01:40.759> shuffle<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:42.050> can<00:01:42.170> increase<00:01:42.440> the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
Luke's shuffle you can increase the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.710 
Luke's shuffle you can increase the
number<00:01:42.770> of<00:01:42.800> throws<00:01:43.069> in<00:01:43.250> between<00:01:43.520> slams<00:01:43.880> in

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
number of throws in between slams in

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
number of throws in between slams in
this<00:01:44.840> case<00:01:45.020> we're<00:01:45.170> going<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.350> use<00:01:45.440> three

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
this case we're going to use three

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.139 
this case we're going to use three
throws<00:01:46.009> so<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.399> we<00:01:46.490> have<00:01:46.640> room<00:01:46.670> for<00:01:46.850> some

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
throws so that we have room for some

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.510 
throws so that we have room for some
chops<00:01:47.530> this<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.800> basic<00:01:49.069> pattern<00:01:49.220> the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
chops this is the basic pattern the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.679 
chops this is the basic pattern the
Tomas<00:01:49.849> uses<00:01:50.209> -<00:01:50.750> it<00:01:50.899> chops

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.950 

okay<00:01:55.689> now<00:01:55.840> let's<00:01:56.049> add<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.200> chops<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.750> your

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
okay now let's add the chops on your

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.320 
okay now let's add the chops on your
last<00:01:59.080> Cascade<00:01:59.560> throw<00:01:59.799> before<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.159> slam<00:02:00.460> make

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
last Cascade throw before the slam make

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.660 
last Cascade throw before the slam make
it<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.509> chop<00:02:01.830> then<00:02:02.830> do<00:02:02.979> the<00:02:03.070> same<00:02:03.250> thing<00:02:03.490> on<00:02:03.580> the

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
it a chop then do the same thing on the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.820 
it a chop then do the same thing on the
other<00:02:03.729> side<00:02:03.880> except<00:02:04.540> making<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.780> fake<00:02:04.960> child
