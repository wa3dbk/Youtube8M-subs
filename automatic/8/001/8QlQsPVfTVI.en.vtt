00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
go back to the original screen that when

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.859 
go back to the original screen that when
it's<00:01:40.500> first<00:01:40.860> purchased<00:01:41.600> meaning<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.689> it's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it's first purchased meaning that it's

set<00:01:49.860> up<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> Wi-Fi<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.869> that's<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.229> you're

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
set up the Wi-Fi and that's what you're

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
set up the Wi-Fi and that's what you're
going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> end<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:52.680> seeing<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.280> for<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.000> one

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
going to end up seeing so for this one

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.609 
going to end up seeing so for this one
it<00:01:54.270> didn't<00:01:54.450> take<00:01:54.570> too<00:01:54.600> long<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.290> probably

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
it didn't take too long it was probably

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.819 
it didn't take too long it was probably
about<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:55.829> 20<00:01:56.280> seconds<00:01:56.790> or<00:01:56.909> 30<00:01:57.240> seconds<00:01:57.829> so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
about like 20 seconds or 30 seconds so

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
about like 20 seconds or 30 seconds so
they're<00:01:59.490> getting<00:01:59.759> faster<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.210> faster

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
they're getting faster and faster

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
they're getting faster and faster
especially<00:02:00.689> with<00:02:01.049> these<00:02:01.170> newer<00:02:01.380> processors

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
especially with these newer processors

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.590 
especially with these newer processors
like<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.520> tablet<00:02:02.969> had<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:05.240> now<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.420> its

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
like this tablet had and now as its

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.850 
like this tablet had and now as its
finishing<00:02:07.020> up<00:02:08.360> we're<00:02:09.360> just<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.079> to<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
finishing up we're just going to see the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.670 
finishing up we're just going to see the
first<00:02:11.489> boot<00:02:11.910> animation

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:34.770 

and

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.510 

well<00:02:35.380> took<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.830> little<00:02:35.950> longer<00:02:36.220> than<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.460> thought

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
well took a little longer than I thought

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.570 
well took a little longer than I thought
so<00:02:37.240> secondly<00:02:37.810> it'll<00:02:38.140> be<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> looking<00:02:39.250> like<00:02:39.430> it's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
so secondly it'll be a looking like it's

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.770 
so secondly it'll be a looking like it's
going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.790> be<00:02:39.880> more<00:02:40.030> about<00:02:40.240> a<00:02:40.300> minute<00:02:40.660> now

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
going to be more about a minute now

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.040 
going to be more about a minute now
since<00:02:41.470> time<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:41.920> still<00:02:42.100> going<00:02:42.310> by<00:02:43.050> but

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
since time is still going by but

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.070 
since time is still going by but
basically<00:02:44.500> when<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.770> do<00:02:44.980> have<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.640> all<00:02:46.150> all

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
basically when you do have it all all

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.540 
basically when you do have it all all
said<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:47.560> done<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> will<00:02:48.130> just<00:02:48.310> be<00:02:48.460> at

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
said and done that it will just be at

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.570 
said and done that it will just be at
the<00:02:48.630> initial<00:02:49.630> boot<00:02:50.190> where<00:02:51.190> it'll<00:02:51.400> basically

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
the initial boot where it'll basically

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.850 
the initial boot where it'll basically
