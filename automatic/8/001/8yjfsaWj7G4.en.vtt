00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
what your arms are doing as you flip

what your arms are doing as you flip
over<00:02:07.580> don't<00:02:08.580> spin<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.060> arms<00:02:09.509> way<00:02:09.869> out<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.259> the

side this is slow

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.330

you're too far away and your push off

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.500 
you're too far away and your push off
will<00:02:21.810> be<00:02:21.930> weak<00:02:22.170> if<00:02:22.970> your<00:02:23.970> legs<00:02:24.150> are<00:02:24.300> fairly

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
