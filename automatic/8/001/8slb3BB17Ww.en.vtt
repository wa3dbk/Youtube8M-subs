00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.450
 so reliable savings and respect for the environment are now a 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.209
 reality 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:14.819
 I heard today a revolution in the market of fuel filters engines to 

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:18.900
 diesel engines known for their lifetime and operational safety 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.570
 are the main propellers in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.110
 industrial vehicles in heavy vehicles and you know equipment stopped injury to the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.440
 its business the dirceu chemical properties cause it to react with 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.879
 elements present in the air the motors were made to work only with 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.320
 dirced but received said waguinho 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.010
 so the performance does not have durability provided by the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.080
 manufacturers 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.340
 giselli impulsion is guaranteed with the use of quality filters and 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.740
 constant cleaning of the storage locations 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.130
 the twenty euro microfil tractors are the only ones that removed all the dirt and 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.430
 dirceu water maximizing power qi preventing damage to components 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.050
 sensitive promoter 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.320
 products and the invitation of the markets and 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.110
 integration 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.230
 both said developed using proprietary technology that extends through 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.810
 five tractors and another 20 are unbeatable in terms of preservation 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.780
 of engines 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.660
 he respected me 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.440
 do not orient benefits to your 'engine' 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.760
 the microcomputers his film had another even the most 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.060
 fine 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.730
 the filter element made of cellulose resin and has a 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.640
 and several layers built in transverse galleries that taper 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.850
 minimal company with its wall of 2 25 centimeters thick as 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.430
 obstacle that contributes 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.140
 deficiency, making it capable of retaining dirt 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.630
 March 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.170
 on committees while conventional filters can not handle 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.630
 fine particles has a lower particle reduction capacity 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.110
 of dirt from 30 to 50 thousand tickets to own technology that exist 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.360
 skillful filters shiver ninety-nine point ninety 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.290
 9% water therefore the maximum dryness protection against corrosion and damages in the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.279
 electronic components, conventional filters offer more 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.249
 inadequate separation of water from water passing through the filter to omint 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:19.099
 alteration of the eye up to ten times it affects the viscosity lisbon was 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.409
 detained and the flagships pull and acidic destruction of the lubricant 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.449
 in addition the water and dirt inside the combustion chamber harm claims 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.449
 reducing power and man 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:37.899
 the customer is the only one who solve all these problems at one time tucci 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.179
 Paulo 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.700
 benefits for the environment and the country 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.020
 the composition of solid particles is also responsible for the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.980
 up to 88% in the emission of pollutants and the inaction of water prevents it from being 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.180
 poured through the exhaust forming acid rain 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.779
 in the end of the conventional and able to adapt the vehicles to the norms 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:12.870
 current pollutant emissions in the end the team was not able to do so as it is already 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.170
 conveying the new mother 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.550
 three or more with a range greater than the common filters. 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.030
 each Libyan filter is used five conventional filters are no longer 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.020
 played in nature discard that does not have recycling program refills 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.250
 European filters that are easily disposed of by burning even 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.290
 material to feed boilers this is concern about the environment 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.369
 for generations 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.719
 The body of the European filters and perfect with latest generation materials has 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.529
 guarantee of 5 years of useful life of 30 years so each cycle is exchanged only 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:52.430
 a filter element 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.609
 the replacement by replacement of refills reduces the cost with the replacement of 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.159
 filters whose body is reused 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.389
 the autonomy of up to 50 thousand kilometers with 700 hours of 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.749
 exchange of a refill can be equivalent to the exchange of five filters with 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:14.409
 The cost of replacement can be reduced by up to 80%. 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:18.030
 vehicles that use euro-cyano may exhibit in fuel economy 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.509
 result of the pure fuel signature in the engine with the use of microfilters 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.080
 European type you will feel the difference in your fleet the economy with maintenance 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.639
 of motors and power systems 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.259
 increase in fuel life and fuel economy. 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:35.840
 motu 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.860
 Reliable fleet reduction of downtime for maintenance 88% reduction in 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.780
 emission of pollutants complying with current regulations after the disposal of 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.230
 filters preservation and respect for the environment 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.840
 necrophile bring energy and economy that's how you work not only success 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.360
 In Brazil, I trust you have conquered clients in 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.409
 south america and african 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.539
 I made the right decision for your fleet to use the product line and I trust 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.180
 request a visit from a consultant who can prove the benefits of the program 

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:14.960
 cost reduction and environmental preservation 

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.970
