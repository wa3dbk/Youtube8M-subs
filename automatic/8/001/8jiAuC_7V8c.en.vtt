so<00:03:11.530> that'll<00:03:12.159> be<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.310> huge<00:03:12.609> document

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.059 
so that'll be a huge document
synchronization<00:03:14.049> will<00:03:14.169> be<00:03:14.290> huge<00:03:14.500> we<00:03:14.680> hope<00:03:14.889> to

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
synchronization will be huge we hope to

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.479 
synchronization will be huge we hope to
see<00:03:15.099> that<00:03:15.639> as<00:03:15.849> well<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.359> what<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:17.310> iCloud<00:03:18.310> going

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
see that as well so what is iCloud going

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.349 
see that as well so what is iCloud going
to<00:03:18.579> cost<00:03:18.760> well<00:03:19.030> there's<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> lot<00:03:19.299> of

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
to cost well there's a lot of

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.720 
to cost well there's a lot of
speculation<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.019> if<00:03:20.139> you<00:03:20.349> are<00:03:20.709> somebody<00:03:21.609> who

otherwise will there be like a $25
annual<00:03:37.389> subscription<00:03:37.870> fee<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.229> the<00:03:38.440> fee

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
annual subscription fee so the fee

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.920 
annual subscription fee so the fee
schedule<00:03:39.280> really<00:03:39.549> is<00:03:39.729> up<00:03:40.209> in<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.359> air<00:03:40.510> nobody

schedule really is up in the air nobody
knows<00:03:41.079> exactly<00:03:41.260> how<00:03:41.769> much<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.370> iCloud

service<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.419> going<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:43.720> cost<00:03:44.159> so<00:03:45.159> it'll<00:03:45.340> be

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
service is going to cost so it'll be

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.899 
service is going to cost so it'll be
interesting<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.819> see<00:03:45.939> how<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:47.650> plays<00:03:47.829> out<00:03:48.159> so

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909 
interesting to see how that plays out so

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.759

I cloud is going to have to be

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.210 
I cloud is going to have to be

for developers iOS 5 is going to be huge
leap<00:05:50.930> forward<00:05:50.960> because<00:05:51.560> they'll<00:05:51.710> have<00:05:51.860> a

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
access to a huge slew of API is a huge

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.700 
access to a huge slew of API is a huge
it<00:05:55.400> they<00:05:55.909> were<00:05:56.000> completely<00:05:56.710> unacceptable

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
it they were completely unacceptable

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.260 
it they were completely unacceptable
right<00:05:58.279> now<00:05:58.460> they'll<00:05:58.789> have<00:05:58.940> complete<00:05:59.240> access

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
right now they'll have complete access

to an additional set of api's which will

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.529 
to an additional set of api's which will
allow<00:06:02.089> them<00:06:02.569> to<00:06:02.900> be<00:06:03.259> more<00:06:03.979> creative<00:06:04.389> with<00:06:05.389> the

allow them to be more creative with the

allow them to be more creative with the

currently available with the current iOS

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.550 
currently available with the current iOS
so<00:06:17.210> there's<00:06:17.360> no<00:06:17.479> really<00:06:17.750> limitation<00:06:18.409> with<00:06:18.500> the

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
so there's no really limitation with the

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.200 
so there's no really limitation with the
hardware<00:06:18.830> it's<00:06:19.189> the<00:06:19.430> operating<00:06:19.909> system

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
hardware it's the operating system

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.019 
hardware it's the operating system
itself<00:06:20.300> I<00:06:20.779> think<00:06:21.500> you're<00:06:21.589> going<00:06:21.710> to<00:06:21.770> see<00:06:22.029> Apple

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
itself I think you're going to see Apple

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:26.740 
itself I think you're going to see Apple
really<00:06:23.719> expand<00:06:24.289> iOS<00:06:25.250> 5<00:06:25.460> allow<00:06:26.180> a<00:06:26.210> lot<00:06:26.629> more

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
really expand iOS 5 allow a lot more

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.540 
really expand iOS 5 allow a lot more
flexibility<00:06:27.349> for<00:06:27.529> developers<00:06:28.069> a<00:06:28.099> lot<00:06:28.400> more

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
flexibility for developers a lot more

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.740 
flexibility for developers a lot more
creativity<00:06:29.120> and<00:06:29.560> functionality<00:06:30.560> for<00:06:30.800> users

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
creativity and functionality for users

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.240 
creativity and functionality for users
because<00:06:32.750> Apple<00:06:33.169> really<00:06:33.500> has<00:06:33.680> fallen<00:06:34.009> behind

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
because Apple really has fallen behind

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.189 
because Apple really has fallen behind
the<00:06:34.610> Android<00:06:34.879> operating<00:06:34.969> system<00:06:35.330> and<00:06:35.719> an<00:06:35.779> iOS

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
the Android operating system and an iOS

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.290 
the Android operating system and an iOS
5<00:06:36.409> is<00:06:36.529> going<00:06:36.740> to<00:06:36.800> have<00:06:36.919> to<00:06:37.039> be<00:06:37.159> a<00:06:37.339> huge<00:06:37.969> leap

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
5 is going to have to be a huge leap

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.209 
5 is going to have to be a huge leap
forward<00:06:38.330> so<00:06:38.990> I<00:06:39.199> think<00:06:39.560> you're<00:06:39.860> going<00:06:40.069> to<00:06:40.129> see

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:40.219 
forward so I think you're going to see

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.089 
forward so I think you're going to see
all<00:06:41.000> of<00:06:41.060> those<00:06:41.300> features<00:06:41.569> plus<00:06:42.259> more<00:06:42.589> don't

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:43.099 
all of those features plus more don't

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:44.230 
all of those features plus more don't
know<00:06:43.190> what<00:06:43.310> those<00:06:43.399> are<00:06:43.580> so<00:06:43.849> we'll<00:06:43.940> have<00:06:44.000> to<00:06:44.209> see

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
know what those are so we'll have to see

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.269 
know what those are so we'll have to see
next<00:06:44.599> week<00:06:44.779> and<00:06:45.469> real<00:06:45.649> quickly<00:06:45.860> let's<00:06:46.099> touch

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:07.609 
system will have access to all of your
ram<00:07:05.729> so<00:07:06.089> the<00:07:06.179> no<00:07:06.329> more<00:07:06.479> the<00:07:06.629> four<00:07:06.839> gigabyte<00:07:07.379> RAM

00:07:07.609 --> 00:07:07.619 
ram so the no more the four gigabyte RAM

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:11.269 
ram so the no more the four gigabyte RAM
limit<00:07:07.979> the<00:07:09.079> why<00:07:10.079> it<00:07:10.139> will<00:07:10.289> be<00:07:10.379> much<00:07:10.499> faster<00:07:10.799> I

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:11.279 
limit the why it will be much faster I

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.499 
limit the why it will be much faster I
think<00:07:11.939> it's<00:07:12.029> going<00:07:12.119> to<00:07:12.179> be<00:07:12.269> a<00:07:12.329> huge

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:12.509 
think it's going to be a huge

00:07:12.509 --> 00:07:14.089 
think it's going to be a huge
improvement<00:07:12.689> against<00:07:13.409> seamless<00:07:13.769> integration

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:14.099 
improvement against seamless integration
