00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.880 
actually two times where you saved me
and<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:27.869> really<00:01:28.259> impressed<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.680> it

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
and I was really impressed with it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.219 
and I was really impressed with it
another<00:01:29.460> con<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.240> him<00:01:30.360> was<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:30.990> his

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
another con with him was actually his

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.960 
another con with him was actually his
strength<00:01:31.650> he<00:01:31.829> wasn't<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.250> strong<00:01:32.670> with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
strength he wasn't that strong with

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.270 
strength he wasn't that strong with
saving<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> ball<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.799> ball<00:01:35.009> he'd

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
saving the ball you know the ball he'd

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.760 
saving the ball you know the ball he'd
actually<00:01:35.490> fall<00:01:35.909> over<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> lot<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.750> he<00:01:37.530> wouldn't

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
actually fall over a lot and he wouldn't

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.899 
actually fall over a lot and he wouldn't
be<00:01:37.829> able<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.009> keep<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> ball<00:01:38.400> out<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.729> nets

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
be able to keep the ball out the nets

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.609 
be able to keep the ball out the nets
and<00:01:39.150> times<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:40.020> was<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.259> annoying

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and times and that was really annoying

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
and times and that was really annoying
because<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.040> remember<00:01:41.340> diving<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> right<00:01:41.939> way

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
because I remember diving the right way

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.240 
because I remember diving the right way
for<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> penalty<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.110> he<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.470> didn't<00:01:43.799> save<00:01:44.040> he

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
for a penalty and he just didn't save he

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.340 
for a penalty and he just didn't save he
just<00:01:44.490> went<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> right<00:01:45.090> way<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.960> just<00:01:46.200> went

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
just went the right way and it just went

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.569 
just went the right way and it just went
in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> back<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:46.920> net<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.340> kind<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
in the back of the net which was kind of

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.460 
in the back of the net which was kind of
annoying<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.720> obviously<00:01:48.869> means<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.380> I

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
annoying and this obviously means that I

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.440 
annoying and this obviously means that I
didn't<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> far<00:01:50.280> throw<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.210> thing

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
didn't have a far throw but one thing

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.850 
didn't have a far throw but one thing
that<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.630> did<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.930> about<00:01:51.960> him<00:01:52.290> was<00:01:52.500> his<00:01:52.590> throw

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
that I did like about him was his throw

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
that I did like about him was his throw
because<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.159> throw<00:01:53.520> was<00:01:53.700> very<00:01:53.729> accurate<00:01:54.420> every

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
because if throw was very accurate every

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.510 
because if throw was very accurate every
single<00:01:55.079> time<00:01:55.290> whenever<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.040> threw<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> ball<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
single time whenever I threw the ball I

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.039 
single time whenever I threw the ball I
would<00:01:56.759> always<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> my<00:01:57.810> players

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
would always go to one of my players

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.380 
would always go to one of my players
apart<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:58.530> one<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.770> opponents<00:01:58.890> players

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
apart from one of my opponents players

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.670 
apart from one of my opponents players
and<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.630> very<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.200> throwing<00:02:01.409> his

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
and it was very good at throwing his

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.170 
and it was very good at throwing his
kicking<00:02:01.950> was<00:02:02.219> phenomenal<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.850> well<00:02:03.000> his

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
kicking was phenomenal as well his

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.389 
kicking was phenomenal as well his
passing<00:02:03.600> felt<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.200> really<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.040> was

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
passing of that caliber

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.090 
passing of that caliber
and<00:02:09.210> also<00:02:09.360> lads<00:02:09.660> his<00:02:09.840> saving<00:02:10.350> was<00:02:10.500> very<00:02:10.800> good
