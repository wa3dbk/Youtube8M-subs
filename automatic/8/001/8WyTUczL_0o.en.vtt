00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
bit he thinks how can we stop that what

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.530 
bit he thinks how can we stop that what
first<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.340> did<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.640> he<00:01:32.759> got<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> cage<00:01:33.240> as<00:01:33.420> an

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
first I did is he got in the cage as an

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.600 
first I did is he got in the cage as an
omnivore<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.320> three<00:01:34.560> carnivores<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.400> thus

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
omnivore with three carnivores and thus

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.300 
omnivore with three carnivores and thus
was<00:01:35.850> lowering<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> food<00:01:36.509> chain<00:01:36.780> ah

was lowering the food chain ah

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.990 
was lowering the food chain ah
so<00:01:39.299> second<00:01:39.780> bloke<00:01:39.900> thinks<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.430> take<00:01:41.700> food

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so second bloke thinks if I take food
