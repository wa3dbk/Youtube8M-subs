00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.140 
really wanted to start talking about
this<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:29.070> think<00:00:29.220> it's<00:00:29.490> really<00:00:29.670> important<00:00:30.090> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
this and I think it's really important I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.120 
this and I think it's really important I
think<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.420> needed<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> start<00:00:30.960> being<00:00:31.830> able<00:00:32.070> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
think we needed to start being able to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.430 
think we needed to start being able to
be<00:00:32.219> comfortable<00:00:32.369> talking<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:33.440> views

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
be comfortable talking about views

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.990 
be comfortable talking about views
subscribers<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.610> their<00:00:35.730> implications

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
subscribers and their implications

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.840 
subscribers and their implications
especially<00:00:36.930> when<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> comes<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.850> creative

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
especially when it comes to creative

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.500 
especially when it comes to creative
marketing<00:00:39.600> techniques<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.700> think<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.360> had<00:00:42.480> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
marketing techniques so I think we had a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.569 
marketing techniques so I think we had a
really<00:00:42.660> great<00:00:42.899> discussion<00:00:43.649> though<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> think

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
really great discussion though I think

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.360 
really great discussion though I think
maybe<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.940> might<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> first<00:00:45.360> half<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
maybe this might be the first half of a

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.040 
maybe this might be the first half of a
two-part<00:00:47.370> well<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.820> really<00:00:48.510> hope<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.899> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
two-part well I really hope that this is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.299 
two-part well I really hope that this is
not<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> last<00:00:49.410> time<00:00:49.649> we<00:00:49.739> talked<00:00:49.920> about<00:00:50.039> any<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
not the last time we talked about any of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.130 
not the last time we talked about any of
these<00:00:50.370> issues<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:51.239> no<00:00:51.360> absolutely<00:00:51.930> i<00:00:52.020> think

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
these issues well no absolutely i think

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
these issues well no absolutely i think
you<00:00:52.410> know<00:00:52.469> first<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.860> all<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.219> need<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> define

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you know first of all we need to define

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.189 
you know first of all we need to define
the<00:00:53.820> issues<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.300> begin<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.660> before<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.079> can

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the issues to begin with before we can

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.540 
the issues to begin with before we can
even<00:00:55.230> start<00:00:55.649> talking<00:00:56.010> about<00:00:56.100> accountability

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
even start talking about accountability

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
even start talking about accountability
everybody<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> panel<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:58.079> very<00:00:58.379> discreet

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
everybody on the panel was very discreet

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.860 
everybody on the panel was very discreet
and<00:00:59.280> deferential<00:00:59.579> when<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.149> came<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and deferential when it came to and

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.900 
and deferential when it came to and
sometimes<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.129> were<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.309> general<00:01:02.760> we<00:01:02.879> have

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
sometimes we were very general we have

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
sometimes we were very general we have
to<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> define<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.350> even

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
to really kind of define what even

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.740 
to really kind of define what even
certain<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> view<00:01:06.150> means<00:01:06.479> what

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
certain what like what a view means what

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.990 
certain what like what a view means what
certain<00:01:07.020> terms<00:01:07.290> mean<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> feel<00:01:07.920> like

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
certain terms mean I feel like

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.219 
certain terms mean I feel like
definitions<00:01:09.000> are<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.210> transition<00:01:09.600> yeah<00:01:10.200> I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
definitions are in transition yeah I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.179 
definitions are in transition yeah I
think<00:01:10.350> they'll<00:01:10.530> come<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> time<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.100> people

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
think they'll come a time when people

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.260 
think they'll come a time when people
are<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.549> start<00:01:11.640> calling<00:01:11.909> each<00:01:12.119> other

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
are going to start calling each other

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.670 
are going to start calling each other
out<00:01:12.540> but<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:12.930> right<00:01:13.049> now<00:01:13.260> since<00:01:13.500> we're

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
out but I think right now since we're

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
out but I think right now since we're
sort<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> all<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> together<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.479> now<00:01:15.689> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
sort of all in it together right now we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
sort of all in it together right now we
don't<00:01:16.320> really<00:01:16.560> want<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.890> start<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.159> civil<00:01:17.369> war

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
don't really want to start a civil war

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
don't really want to start a civil war
because<00:01:18.390> we're<00:01:18.630> gonna<00:01:18.780> live<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.200> don't<00:01:19.290> want

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
because we're gonna live we don't want

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
because we're gonna live we don't want
to<00:01:19.560> do<00:01:19.650> boxing<00:01:20.009> matches<00:01:20.220> exactly<00:01:20.939> though<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to do boxing matches exactly though I

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.999 
to do boxing matches exactly though I
think<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> might<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:22.530> come<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
think it might you know come to that

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.249 
think it might you know come to that
eventually<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.950> know<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.070> think<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.259> lot

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
eventually you know I think that a lot

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
eventually you know I think that a lot
of<00:01:28.320> really<00:01:28.619> interesting<00:01:29.299> concepts<00:01:30.299> came<00:01:30.540> up

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
of really interesting concepts came up

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.410 
of really interesting concepts came up
and<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.290> really<00:01:31.500> depends<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.180> how<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.210> view

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
and it really depends on how you view

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140 
and it really depends on how you view
content<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.770> understand<00:01:35.430> how<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
content and how you understand how the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.760 
content and how you understand how the
viewership<00:01:36.540> represents<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> quality<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.680> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
viewership represents the quality of the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.819 
viewership represents the quality of the
content<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.840> a<00:01:39.840> panel<00:01:40.259> showed<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
content because as a panel showed and

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.960 
content because as a panel showed and
also<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> questions<00:01:41.460> for<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.640> audience

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
also the questions for the audience

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.719 
also the questions for the audience
viewership<00:01:42.840> numbers<00:01:43.049> do<00:01:43.740> influence<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.579> way

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
viewership numbers do influence the way

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.300 
viewership numbers do influence the way
that<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> perceive<00:01:45.570> content<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.130> is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that you perceive content and that is

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.620 
that you perceive content and that is
something<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.000> continually

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
something that it will be continually

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.420 
something that it will be continually
exploited<00:01:49.430> especially<00:01:50.430> since<00:01:50.579> people<00:01:51.060> are

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
exploited especially since people are

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.499 
exploited especially since people are
influenced<00:01:53.430> by<00:01:53.460> their<00:01:53.729> peers<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.270> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
influenced by their peers and that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.569 
influenced by their peers and that
number<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.899> an<00:01:55.170> influence<00:01:55.590> metric<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
number is an influence metric so I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
number is an influence metric so I
really<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
really think that this is just the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.139 
really think that this is just the
beginning<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.250> conversation<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.820> we<00:02:00.030> need

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
beginning of a conversation that we need

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.030 
beginning of a conversation that we need
to<00:02:00.240> evolve<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.409> understand<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.250> how<00:02:02.640> do<00:02:03.180> we

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
to evolve to understand really how do we

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.550 
to evolve to understand really how do we
universally<00:02:05.040> qualify<00:02:06.200> content<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.380> if

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
universally qualify content and if

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.839 
universally qualify content and if
that's<00:02:07.770> something<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.429> even<00:02:08.759> necessary

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that's something that is even necessary

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.240 
that's something that is even necessary
is<00:02:09.629> there<00:02:10.140> anything<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.500> didn't<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.979> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
is there anything we didn't get to the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.559 
is there anything we didn't get to the
panel<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.819> would<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.000> liked<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> have

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
panel that you would have liked to have

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.610 
panel that you would have liked to have
seen<00:02:12.750> us<00:02:12.930> get

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
seen us get

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.720 
seen us get
with<00:02:13.769> the<00:02:13.860> things<00:02:14.099> that<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> know<00:02:14.459> stick<00:02:14.640> on

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
with the things that you know stick on

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.250 
with the things that you know stick on
your<00:02:14.879> mind<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:15.239> for<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.659> next<00:02:15.810> time<00:02:16.080> we're

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
your mind now for the next time we're

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.199 
your mind now for the next time we're
going<00:02:16.349> to<00:02:16.409> touch<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.799> these<00:02:16.950> topics<00:02:17.129> well<00:02:17.909> you

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
going to touch on these topics well you

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.899 
going to touch on these topics well you
know<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> really<00:02:18.870> wanted<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.260> get<00:02:19.590> into<00:02:22.879> some<00:02:23.879> of

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
know I really wanted to get into some of

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:29.990 
know I really wanted to get into some of
the<00:02:24.030> non-monetary<00:02:25.519> type<00:02:26.519> of<00:02:28.340> influence<00:02:29.340> right

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the non-monetary type of influence right

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.809 
the non-monetary type of influence right
so<00:02:30.440> sometimes<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.799> don't<00:02:31.890> have<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.129> pay<00:02:32.430> in

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
so sometimes you don't have to pay in

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.559 
so sometimes you don't have to pay in
dollars<00:02:32.879> you<00:02:33.659> can<00:02:33.690> pay<00:02:33.959> in<00:02:34.079> views<00:02:34.409> and<00:02:34.799> that<00:02:35.569> is

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
dollars you can pay in views and that is

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.899 
dollars you can pay in views and that is
going<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.769> going<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.280> make<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> difference

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
going to it's going to make a difference

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:40.940 
going to it's going to make a difference
especially<00:02:39.420> when<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.200> comes<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.530> networks

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
especially when it comes to networks

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.649 
especially when it comes to networks
right<00:02:41.129> now<00:02:41.310> networks<00:02:41.700> are<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:42.090> new<00:02:42.360> right<00:02:42.629> now

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
right now networks are so new right now

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.960 
right now networks are so new right now
that<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.459> bring<00:02:44.610> more<00:02:44.909> to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
that you really have to bring more to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.089 
that you really have to bring more to
the<00:02:45.030> network<00:02:45.239> than<00:02:45.989> it<00:02:46.109> offers<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:49.099> that

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
the network than it offers you but that

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.140 
the network than it offers you but that
is<00:02:50.280> going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.519> be<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.670> natural<00:02:50.819> progression

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
is going to be the natural progression

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.940 
is going to be the natural progression
and<00:02:51.690> if<00:02:51.840> YouTube<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.379> supposed<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.859> an

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
and if YouTube is supposed to be an

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.110 
and if YouTube is supposed to be an
antidote<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:55.099> old<00:02:56.099> boy<00:02:56.310> Hollywood<00:02:56.609> networks

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
antidote to old boy Hollywood networks

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.780 
antidote to old boy Hollywood networks
then<00:02:57.739> we're<00:02:58.739> going<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.069> be<00:02:59.310> disappointed<00:02:59.430> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
then we're going to be disappointed to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.460 
then we're going to be disappointed to
see<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.000> evolve<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.690> think<00:03:00.959> for<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.260> best

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
see that evolve I think for the best

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.140 
see that evolve I think for the best
because<00:03:01.680> there's<00:03:02.069> still<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> greater<00:03:02.819> chance

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
because there's still a greater chance

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.149 
because there's still a greater chance
is<00:03:03.329> still<00:03:03.480> much<00:03:03.840> more<00:03:03.870> democratic<00:03:04.650> but<00:03:05.069> if

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
is still much more democratic but if

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.410 
is still much more democratic but if
it's<00:03:05.280> going<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.519> survive<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.239> have

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it's going to survive it's going to have

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.199 
it's going to survive it's going to have
to<00:03:06.450> play<00:03:07.230> by<00:03:07.440> some<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.709> similar<00:03:07.980> rules

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
to play by some of the similar rules

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.399 
to play by some of the similar rules

think about the changes are you excited
for<00:03:13.859> YouTube<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.280> 2012<00:03:14.909> absolutely<00:03:15.720> anything

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
sometimes there are a little ahead of

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.099 
sometimes there are a little ahead of
their<00:03:29.790> time<00:03:29.819> but<00:03:30.120> that's<00:03:30.239> great<00:03:30.359> they've

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
their time but that's great they've

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.020 
their time but that's great they've
broken<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.889> ice<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:32.669> now<00:03:32.819> with

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
broken the ice and I think now with

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.119 
broken the ice and I think now with
their<00:03:33.530> hundred-million-dollar<00:03:34.530> content

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
their hundred-million-dollar content

their hundred-million-dollar content
initiative<00:03:35.579> I<00:03:35.849> think<00:03:36.540> they're<00:03:36.780> going<00:03:37.019> to

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
initiative I think they're going to

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.770 
initiative I think they're going to
really<00:03:37.440> have<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.700> content<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.299> support<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
really have the content to support the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.539 
really have the content to support the
technology<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.349> they're<00:03:40.680> really<00:03:40.980> excited

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
technology that they're really excited

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.909 
technology that they're really excited
to<00:03:41.790> create<00:03:42.209> for<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.109> front<00:03:43.319> page<00:03:43.530> this

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
to create for the front page this

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.860 
to create for the front page this
curatorial<00:03:44.579> nature<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.239> the<00:03:45.329> front<00:03:45.540> page<00:03:45.690> is

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
curatorial nature of the front page is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.789 
curatorial nature of the front page is
something<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.169> I<00:03:46.230> think<00:03:46.319> is<00:03:46.620> absolutely

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
something that I think is absolutely

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.860 
something that I think is absolutely
necessary<00:03:47.459> it's<00:03:48.419> going<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.870> de-emphasize<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
necessary it's going to de-emphasize the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.509 
necessary it's going to de-emphasize the
the<00:03:51.870> metric<00:03:52.319> and<00:03:53.209> it's<00:03:54.209> going<00:03:54.449> to<00:03:55.459> provide<00:03:56.459> a

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
the metric and it's going to provide a

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.159 
the metric and it's going to provide a
better<00:03:56.879> quality<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.510> type<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.690> content<00:03:58.019> which

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
better quality the type of content which

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.539 
better quality the type of content which
I<00:03:58.260> think<00:03:58.440> YouTube<00:03:58.829> wants<00:03:59.129> I<00:03:59.250> think<00:03:59.430> that's

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
I think YouTube wants I think that's

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.740 
I think YouTube wants I think that's
what<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.699> viewers<00:04:00.030> want<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:00.449> I<00:04:00.510> think

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
what the viewers want and I think

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.420 
what the viewers want and I think
everyone's<00:04:01.349> going<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.680> benefit<00:04:01.980> from<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.280> so
