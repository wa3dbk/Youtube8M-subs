 flaws of our educational system we are really in a crisis 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.120
 the university students headed by the president of the fech 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.149
 camila vallejos 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 they say yes and demand enough changes but they say that the answer 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.719
 of the authorities did not expect the minister has shown and that he is not capable 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.539
 of answering questions as basic as whether or not you agree with the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.539
 profit in education and confit interest and that has social then 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.260
 when these answers are given 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.290
 as they intend to take an open dialogue but I am committed to 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.320
 work hard and improve the quality of diesel in good times and in bad 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.460
 it has been proposed to definitely leave behind carolina santori education 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.259
 democratize universities 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.659
 expand coverage to the poorest sectors 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.640
 end self-financing of universities for which they ask for more 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.539
 state contribution and restructure the scholarship system to end the 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:35.539
 indebtedness 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.260
 from this last point the one that most worries hundreds of thousands of young people 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.619
 that they must pay millionaire credits as soon as they grow up 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.249
 of euros that in many cases exceeds 20 million pesos ariel puig affirmed 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.100
 year of engineering at the University of Chile and almost five and a half million 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.570
 of a warmth ar will reach 25 million I'm glad that the treatment 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.080
 face the bmv 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.700
 luckily but you have to see it that offers a Boston crossing will be in doubt to 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.540
 two to be able to study with credit is not for the entire career there is a 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.430
 difference that the debt directly to the university is one million pesos at 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.840
 year 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.459
 If you do not reach freedom, you will not be given titles that expire and have 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.399
 announced that hereafter 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.589
 series of the poetic work long 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.999
 not all the chains earning the indebtedness the study 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.559
 it will not be so clear 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.319
 the story of skin is that of thousands of young Chileans 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.989
 so a group of students created the page and I owe cilic points where each 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.069
 student entered his debt among the thousand 951 enrolled must in total more than 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.680
 22 billion pesos here on the website also realizes and the 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.839
 question is frequent 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:46.369
 as a calculation thousand euros how much to year s / how much interest that this interest 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.759
 We believe that this is a key issue to understand also the growing problem 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:54.119
 the interest will depend on the type of credit that a student chooses 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:57.809
 career of 4 million annually will finance with the solidarity fund to 15 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:01.919
 years ends costing just over 23 million pesos, that is to say 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:05.259
 3 trillion more expensive that has had a credit with state endorsement the 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:09.259
 career is worth little more than 29 million pesos 6 million more expensive than 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:13.789
 previous option with corfo credit soars almost 31 million 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.479
 practically 11 million more that is giving without credit and the option 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:22.069
 more expensive the private banking costs almost 33 million pesos 13 million 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.059
 only in interests a round business for banks 

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.980
 the student that greater 100 merchant to the contest 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.960
 to the second third year they nurtured very serious issue in this world is not the third 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.659
 quintile more than 60% awaken by de novo conditions have ability to 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.129
 pay can not continue to get into debt even if it is not so with a debt 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.789
 hide 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:44.570
 the other issue that at this point is the profit 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.540
 although the law establishes that education in our country can not 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.250
 operate as a business to earn money private universities generate 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.350
 cultivation that sometimes millionaire and he knows it Mary Olivia Monckeberg author of 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.449
 book the business of the universities 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.049
 but not only I have never felt that they stick to the panacea for morcillo 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.370
 if you do not have plans 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.089
 while he is practicing 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:09.009
 with sleep shocked 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.700
 a changing them for debt 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.000
 for this the owners of the universities create real estate these 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.200
 real estate or owner of all the facilities where it works in Cuba 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.229
 realestate 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.789
 new Zealand 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.789
 to the university corporation 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.509
 its installation 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:27.710
 so 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.789
 this corporation is uncovered 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:30.620
 a sum 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.809
 if they give me bad meanwhile it matters 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:36.499
 and so he wants the money at the hands of the same owners without breaking the law is the 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.869
 case of Minister Lavin who was one of the owners of the University of 

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:44.129
 development and of the real estate added what good of the facilities to this 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.160
 House of Studies 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.130
 an issue that was addressed in the zero tolerance program hits the court put silver 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.640
 is going to stop or not do not fit the precious silver mouth won throughout the year 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.160
 the work 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.270
 and he did not lose his match had been good for the least he could do 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.099
 now 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.309
 we did not find how much I earn 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:01.999
 a 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:03.330
 intermÃ³n 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.279
 of efficiency is the right person to 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:08.789
 to lead 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.240
 this current negotiation we try to talk with the minister about this 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.839
 point by which other education actors questioned 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:19.990
 unfortunately this means the divinity the truth close known that won 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.990
 money for the sale of the environment to the being of the psoe 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:28.840
 my duty is an intelligent person who had legitimacy and to know that 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.840
 had won money with this Monday that the development 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:35.080
 although the Indian should answer 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.710
 before the media communication before the citizenship because it corresponds to say 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.460
 effectively hundred when I do not think he questioned why it was so julia 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.090
 mind is not going to give way because of conflict interest in the demand that they are 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.439
 raising is not what they hope to solve this Monday when the 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.249
 dialogue table with the authorities 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:55.509
 mobilized and secondary university students in mass demonstrations that 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.779
 express and education is in crisis
