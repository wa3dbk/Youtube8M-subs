figure out how he was assembling these
no<00:01:59.300> one<00:01:59.420> had<00:01:59.540> ever<00:01:59.660> assembled<00:01:59.990> them<00:02:00.260> we<00:02:00.410> didn't

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
no one had ever assembled them we didn't

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.690 
no one had ever assembled them we didn't
know<00:02:00.740> how<00:02:00.950> to<00:02:00.979> put<00:02:01.220> them<00:02:01.310> together<00:02:01.430> we<00:02:01.670> just

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
know how to put them together we just

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.030 
know how to put them together we just
had<00:02:01.940> all<00:02:02.030> these<00:02:02.150> parts<00:02:02.600> basically<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.950> a

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
had all these parts basically just a

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.290 
had all these parts basically just a
bunch<00:02:04.220> of<00:02:04.280> people<00:02:04.520> sitting<00:02:04.640> around<00:02:04.910> trying<00:02:05.180> to

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
bunch of people sitting around trying to

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.600 
bunch of people sitting around trying to
put<00:02:05.510> cams<00:02:05.720> together<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.770> they're<00:02:07.490> all

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
put cams together and they're all

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.609 
put cams together and they're all
assembled<00:02:08.060> by<00:02:08.179> hand<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.959> it's<00:02:09.470> a

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
assembled by hand and it's a

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.080 
assembled by hand and it's a
labor-intensive<00:02:09.890> cam<00:02:10.490> that's<00:02:10.759> why<00:02:10.910> when<00:02:11.060> I

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
labor-intensive cam that's why when I

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.150 
labor-intensive cam that's why when I
first<00:02:11.390> introduced<00:02:11.900> them<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.860> need<00:02:12.980> to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
first introduced them we need to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.220 
first introduced them we need to
introduce<00:02:13.580> them<00:02:13.790> at<00:02:13.910> $80<00:02:14.540> and<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:14.840> made<00:02:15.020> very

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
introduce them at $80 and we made very

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.170 
introduce them at $80 and we made very
little<00:02:15.530> profit<00:02:15.800> but<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:16.670> were<00:02:16.760> really

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
little profit but we were really

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.880 
little profit but we were really
learning<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.630> process<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:18.410> working<00:02:18.740> with

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
learning the process and working with

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.310 
learning the process and working with
somebody<00:02:19.100> else's<00:02:19.610> designs<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.840> company

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
somebody else's designs the company

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.880 
somebody else's designs the company
right<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.280> would<00:02:22.820> say<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:24.140> small<00:02:24.680> to
