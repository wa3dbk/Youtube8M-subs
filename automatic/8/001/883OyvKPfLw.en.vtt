00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.170
 I don't know what to say to you in 3 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.570
 minutes 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.360
 the most brutal fight for all of our 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:22.980
 professional life today will be decided 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:27.060
 all or mouse again command or break 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:33.280
 give moment by moment and then end 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:37.589
 we are in hell gentlemen believe we can 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.589
 come to terms with this and then let us 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.730
 everyone wipe their feet or else we will give battle and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.470
 cut out 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:56.340
 soot and fighting may that life is such 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.620
 game where every day is important and in football 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.780
 also 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:05.880
 because in games and in the life of football 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.940
 the cost of a mistake is too high you made a move 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.970
 a little earlier or a little later if you have not 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.090
 left hurried leo postal 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:19.140
 For half a second these inches remained poor 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 we always need this dohera they in each 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:29.940
 gaming moment in any minute and second 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:32.729
 and our team will fight for them she 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.930
 will fight for every inch we don't 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.950
 regret neither yourself nor the others in this game 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.070
 We clung to the inch teeth MSK chain 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.610
 because you know the value of these prisons 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.610
 there is a difference between winning and losing 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.110
 between life and death fights win 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.480

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:06.960
 who is ready to give his life to her I know 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:11.330
 I still have life because I am ready 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.750
 fight and die for that inch because 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.320
 that this is life 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.380
 6 inches right in front of you i cant you 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.020

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.610
 mother who sacrifice themselves for the team 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.650
 because it knows that each of you 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:46.410
 if you need to do the same it is 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:50.970
 team of gentlemen and we either win the whole 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:58.880
 teams either die 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.880
 one by one is football 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.849
 that's all 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.060
