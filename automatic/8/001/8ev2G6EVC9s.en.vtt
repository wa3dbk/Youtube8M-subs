 important acapulco with the world that 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.130
 spent baking that body that exhibits 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.930
 it is before they go very well clear 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.930
 [Music] 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.479
 today I'm dying of nerves is the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.830
 true but if it is finally hama 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.830
 like the 'chicharito' is that I can not 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.049
 move a lot here genaro this is who I 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.060
 is instructing and who helped me 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.310
 upload this part does not look so high 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.759
 surely the shot is 35 meters what 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.119
 have we are at a height of 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 70 for the rock this genre how long they take 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.409
 you to climb to the top from the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.659
 water to the tip 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.310
 we were around a minute and a half or 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.319
 two minutes to get to the top of 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.509
 the good rock I want to tell you that 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:49.020
 for this point nothing later 23 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:53.390
 minutes with knees a little 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.390
 literally broken but before 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:08.700
 and they gave me but if not as 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.510
 we have a third dimension screen 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.920
 we know where you are from the water if you 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.330
 you're also like that right that falls 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.819
 on rock then you have to make a 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.160
 jump into the water to empty local 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.560
 story 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.910
 you face the rock 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.250
 really the rock has a forgiveness a 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.980
 belly then if I have to sit down not 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.980
 we saw it from the beginning 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440

 [Laughs] 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.280

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.270
 zoom in on the knees 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.270

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:20.640
 climb this rock is also lousy 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:22.920
