00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and on sitting very nicely this dynamic

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.740 
and on sitting very nicely this dynamic
strain<00:01:12.290> and<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> idea

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
strain and that's for the idea

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.679 
strain and that's for the idea
transmission<00:01:15.750> system<00:01:19.580> little<00:01:20.580> bit<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.119> foyers

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
transmission system little bit of foyers

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
transmission system little bit of foyers
so<00:01:22.520> not<00:01:23.520> always<00:01:23.939> easy<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.570> pick<00:01:24.990> inside<00:01:37.850> now<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so not always easy to pick inside now I

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
form must be a cool unit when it's on

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.480 
form must be a cool unit when it's on
the<00:02:02.760> sea<00:02:03.120> in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> field<00:02:06.979> now<00:02:07.979> let's<00:02:08.310> have

the sea in the field now let's have
again<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.240> global<00:02:09.840> view<00:02:10.760> of<00:02:11.760> this<00:02:12.150> nice<00:02:12.540> unit<00:02:14.000> so

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
again a global view of this nice unit so

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.930 
again a global view of this nice unit so
again<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:16.230> next<00:02:17.070> frame

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
again a next frame

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.670
