00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
he is quite large I think this guy might

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
he is quite large I think this guy might
be<00:01:49.170> 6.5<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.250> don't<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.579> um<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:52.640> he's<00:01:53.640> large

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
be 6.5 I don't know um but he's large

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
be 6.5 I don't know um but he's large
figures<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.810> no<00:01:55.079> doubt<00:01:55.259> about<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
figures and no doubt about it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
figures and no doubt about it
his<00:01:56.219> tail<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.820> curved<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.479> he<00:01:57.600> had<00:01:57.689> to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
his tail was curved because he had to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.350 
his tail was curved because he had to
fit<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> box<00:01:58.409> which<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.549> don't<00:01:59.610> mind<00:01:59.909> at<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
fit in a box which I don't mind at all I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.660 
fit in a box which I don't mind at all I
actually<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.530> different<00:02:02.399> type

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
actually kind of like a different type

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.480 
actually kind of like a different type
of<00:02:03.110> thing<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.320> when<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.920> look<00:02:05.040> at<00:02:05.159> his<00:02:05.310> face

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
of thing but when you look at his face

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.619 
of thing but when you look at his face
it<00:02:06.360> looks<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.469> lot<00:02:07.950> like<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.060> guy<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:09.599> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
