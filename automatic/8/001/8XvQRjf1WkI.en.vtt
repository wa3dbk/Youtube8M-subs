00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
February 2013 so this is just going to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:24.090 
February 2013 so this is just going to
be<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.630> quick<00:01:02.930> video<00:01:03.230> showing<00:01:03.469> you<00:01:03.920> guys<00:01:04.070> that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100 

now<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.130> must<00:01:25.549> say<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.090> being<00:01:26.360> natural<00:01:26.960> is

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
now I must say that being natural is

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.680 
now I must say that being natural is
much<00:01:27.560> much<00:01:28.070> easier<00:01:28.430> than<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.210> thought<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.570> would

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
much much easier than I thought it would

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.200 
much much easier than I thought it would
be<00:01:29.869> I<00:01:30.110> really<00:01:30.950> don't<00:01:31.100> have<00:01:31.159> any<00:01:31.490> problems<00:01:31.729> when

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
be I really don't have any problems when

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.120 
be I really don't have any problems when
it<00:01:32.330> comes<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.659> tangles<00:01:33.140> I'll<00:01:33.320> try<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.590> do<00:01:34.100> a

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
it comes to tangles I'll try to do a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.790 
it comes to tangles I'll try to do a
video<00:01:34.369> later<00:01:34.790> showing<00:01:35.180> you<00:01:35.420> guys<00:01:35.570> how<00:01:35.930> my<00:01:36.560> hair

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
video later showing you guys how my hair

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:57.400 
video later showing you guys how my hair
looks<00:01:37.190> underneath<00:01:55.539> but<00:01:56.539> this<00:01:56.720> is<00:01:56.899> basically

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
looks underneath but this is basically

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.710 
looks underneath but this is basically
how<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:58.070> have<00:01:58.280> been<00:01:58.490> wearing<00:01:58.850> my<00:01:59.000> hair<00:01:59.300> for<00:01:59.630> the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
how I have been wearing my hair for the

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.660 
how I have been wearing my hair for the
past<00:01:59.929> two<00:02:00.140> years<00:02:00.170> just<00:02:00.710> keeping<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.250> braided

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
past two years just keeping it braided

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.510 
past two years just keeping it braided
up<00:02:01.910> and<00:02:02.420> that<00:02:02.660> has<00:02:02.840> allowed<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.500> grow<00:02:04.429> back

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
up and that has allowed it to grow back

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.669 
up and that has allowed it to grow back
to<00:02:05.000> almost<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.479> lift<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:06.020> was<00:02:06.200> before<00:02:06.440> I

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
to almost a lift that it was before I

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.949 
to almost a lift that it was before I
cut<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.580> my<00:02:07.789> bangs<00:02:08.060> at<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.570> end<00:02:08.750> which<00:02:08.929> you

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
cut it and my bangs at the end which you

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.749 
cut it and my bangs at the end which you
actually<00:02:09.289> see<00:02:09.649> are<00:02:09.769> actually<00:02:09.979> longer<00:02:10.459> than

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
actually see are actually longer than

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.720 
actually see are actually longer than
they<00:02:10.820> were<00:02:11.110> prior<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.170> me<00:02:12.530> cutting<00:02:12.860> my<00:02:12.890> ear<00:02:13.340> so

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
they were prior to me cutting my ear so

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.210 
they were prior to me cutting my ear so
I<00:02:14.500> really<00:02:15.500> I'm<00:02:15.560> really<00:02:15.769> glad<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:15.980> made<00:02:16.130> this

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
I really I'm really glad I made this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.580 
I really I'm really glad I made this
decision<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.760> actually<00:02:16.940> go<00:02:17.300> natural<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:18.500> I

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
decision to actually go natural like I

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.949 
decision to actually go natural like I
said<00:02:18.800> before<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.280> this<00:02:19.430> has<00:02:19.730> got<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.630> be<00:02:20.690> one<00:02:20.840> of

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
said before it this has got to be one of

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.160 
said before it this has got to be one of
the<00:02:21.050> best<00:02:21.320> decisions<00:02:21.590> I've<00:02:22.370> me<00:02:22.640> in<00:02:22.790> my<00:02:23.050> in<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
the best decisions I've me in my in a

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.140 
the best decisions I've me in my in a
while<00:02:24.350> you<00:02:25.160> guys<00:02:25.340> know<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.550> will<00:02:25.670> only<00:02:25.819> state

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
while you guys know I will only state

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.880 
while you guys know I will only state
that<00:02:26.360> being<00:02:26.569> natural<00:02:27.019> probably<00:02:27.410> isn't<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:27.769> me

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that being natural probably isn't for me

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.890 
that being natural probably isn't for me
but<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.340> guess<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.090> can<00:02:29.269> never<00:02:29.420> say<00:02:29.660> never

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
but I guess you can never say never

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.700 
but I guess you can never say never
which<00:02:30.799> good<00:02:31.100> thing<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.400> in
