00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
renamed and edited in this system we

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.200 
renamed and edited in this system we
require<00:01:44.740> two<00:01:45.010> different<00:01:45.370> products<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:46.090> we

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
require two different products so we

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.350 
require two different products so we
create<00:01:46.510> and<00:01:46.780> model<00:01:47.080> a<00:01:47.229> second<00:01:47.560> item<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:48.360> new

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
create and model a second item a new

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.690 
create and model a second item a new
position<00:01:49.570> source<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:50.260> created<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.890> then

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
position source is created and then

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.450 
position source is created and then
connected<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.420> camera<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.979> item<00:01:54.280> can

create a project sometimes you have to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.110 
create a project sometimes you have to
fine-tune<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.890> placement<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.700> product

on<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.780> conveyors<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.220> very

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
on the conveyors you can do that very

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.120 
on the conveyors you can do that very

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
you've seen that done without writing

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.640 
you've seen that done without writing
one<00:02:44.700> line<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:45.030> code<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.510> at<00:02:45.720> each<00:02:45.900> vendor<00:02:47.540> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
one line of code in at each vendor and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.710 
one line of code in at each vendor and
so<00:02:49.650> now<00:02:49.830> you've<00:02:50.040> seen<00:02:50.069> just<00:02:50.910> how<00:02:51.030> easy<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.599> is
