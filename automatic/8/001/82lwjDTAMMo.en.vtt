juggernaut on turn 4 is actually looking
pretty<00:02:39.160> good<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.610> game

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.680 

clarksdale<00:02:48.370> acts<00:02:48.520> doesn't<00:02:48.910> really<00:02:49.510> bother<00:02:49.780> me

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.520 

doesn't<00:02:55.690> even<00:02:55.780> equip<00:02:58.170> why<00:02:59.170> would<00:02:59.290> he<00:02:59.380> not

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
doesn't even equip why would he not

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.430 
doesn't even equip why would he not
equip<00:02:59.890> their<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:00.780> think<00:03:01.780> nitrogens<00:03:02.230> attacked

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
equip their I think nitrogens attacked

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.720 
equip their I think nitrogens attacked
with<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.560> juggernaut<00:03:02.890> here<00:03:05.040> yea<00:03:06.040> rather<00:03:06.400> than

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
with a juggernaut here yea rather than

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.120 
with a juggernaut here yea rather than
he<00:03:07.540> might<00:03:07.720> have<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:07.900> tainted<00:03:08.290> strike<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.800> was

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
he might have a tainted strike I was

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.380 
he might have a tainted strike I was
thinking<00:03:09.460> reasons<00:03:09.850> he<00:03:09.970> wouldn't<00:03:10.180> equip

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
thinking reasons he wouldn't equip

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.690 
thinking reasons he wouldn't equip
tainted<00:03:10.780> strike<00:03:11.050> is<00:03:11.200> one<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.470> them<00:03:11.620> why<00:03:12.550> would

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
tainted strike is one of them why would

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.950 
tainted strike is one of them why would
he<00:03:12.760> play<00:03:12.910> tainted<00:03:13.300> strike<00:03:13.510> in<00:03:13.630> a<00:03:13.690> red-black

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
he play tainted strike in a red-black

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.400 
he play tainted strike in a red-black
non<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.320> fact<00:03:14.530> deck<00:03:14.740> yeah<00:03:15.130> i'm<00:03:15.220> just<00:03:15.400> going<00:03:15.520> to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
non in fact deck yeah i'm just going to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.360 
non in fact deck yeah i'm just going to
attack<00:03:17.410> with<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:18.780> then<00:03:20.010> depending<00:03:21.010> on

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
attack with this then depending on

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.830 
attack with this then depending on
whether<00:03:21.520> he<00:03:21.670> blocks<00:03:21.880> will<00:03:22.060> not<00:03:22.210> make<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.600> dark

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
whether he blocks will not make a dark

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.880 
whether he blocks will not make a dark
cell<00:03:23.050> Sentinel<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:25.410> doubt<00:03:26.410> he<00:03:26.560> will<00:03:26.680> block

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
cell Sentinel I doubt he will block

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:36.080 
cell Sentinel I doubt he will block
though<00:03:27.040> no<00:03:27.430> he<00:03:27.550> does<00:03:27.700> block<00:03:27.910> okay<00:03:29.610> yeah<00:03:30.610> sure

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.790

indestructible three threes at the
moment<00:03:53.470> which<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.710> looking<00:03:54.190> pretty<00:03:54.310> good<00:03:54.550> I

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
moment which is looking pretty good I

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.550 
moment which is looking pretty good I
don't<00:03:55.450> want<00:03:55.570> news<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.900> case<00:03:56.080> he<00:03:56.200> has<00:03:56.230> some

kind of galvanic burst I have actually
had<00:03:59.890> opponents<00:04:00.370> who<00:04:00.490> activated<00:04:01.000> grant

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
had opponents who activated grant

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.580 
had opponents who activated grant
alqaeda<00:04:01.570> when<00:04:01.750> they<00:04:01.840> didn't<00:04:02.050> need<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.320> and

then had them died as a result I just
shatters<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:04.990> so<00:04:05.380> that's<00:04:05.470> fine<00:04:08.280> so<00:04:09.280> you've

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
shatters that so that's fine so you've

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.020

chapter when I was because when I was

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:17.820 
chapter when I was because when I was
going<00:04:16.420> through<00:04:16.510> reasons<00:04:16.960> he<00:04:17.080> wouldn't<00:04:17.350> equip

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
going through reasons he wouldn't equip

acts i forgot Shasta because I in my
mind<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:19.989> wasn't<00:04:20.200> planning<00:04:20.440> to<00:04:20.620> activate<00:04:21.100> glint

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310

hawk idol so I was kind of discounting
removal<00:04:23.770> but<00:04:25.470> obviously<00:04:26.470> he<00:04:26.620> wasn't<00:04:26.800> because

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
removal but obviously he wasn't because

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.190 
removal but obviously he wasn't because
he<00:04:27.100> didn't<00:04:27.340> know<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.430> had<00:04:27.640> them<00:04:27.900> he<00:04:28.900> didn't<00:04:29.110> know

I wasn't planning to attack with it
arbalest<00:04:33.010> is<00:04:33.220> really<00:04:33.520> irrelevant

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.110 

considering<00:04:36.910> my<00:04:37.320> current<00:04:38.320> board<00:04:38.590> position

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
considering my current board position

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.960 
considering my current board position
well<00:04:40.120> that's<00:04:40.390> a<00:04:40.450> good<00:04:40.570> one<00:04:41.850> that's<00:04:42.850> an

well that's a good one that's an

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.960 
well that's a good one that's an

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
artifact that doesn't lie to a blast so

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.610 
artifact that doesn't lie to a blast so

done<00:05:03.650> nothing<00:05:04.100> both<00:05:04.310> my<00:05:04.490> games<00:05:04.760> but<00:05:05.030> that's

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
done nothing both my games but that's

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.810 
done nothing both my games but that's
mainly<00:05:05.300> because<00:05:05.449> I<00:05:05.780> was<00:05:05.870> either<00:05:06.610> being<00:05:07.610> the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
mainly because I was either being the

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.750 
mainly because I was either being the
