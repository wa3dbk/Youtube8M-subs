tutorial<00:00:07.270> by<00:00:07.419> hot<00:00:07.629> pink<00:00:07.899> zebra<00:00:08.050> polish

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.109 

so<00:00:16.160> we're<00:00:16.280> going<00:00:16.369> to<00:00:16.460> start<00:00:16.490> by<00:00:16.700> creating<00:00:17.000> the

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
so we're going to start by creating the

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.780 
so we're going to start by creating the
smiling<00:00:17.690> with<00:00:17.869> sheer<00:00:18.170> pink<00:00:18.410> so<00:00:19.070> pull<00:00:19.580> the

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
smiling with sheer pink so pull the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.100 
smiling with sheer pink so pull the
excess<00:00:20.090> monomer<00:00:20.480> out<00:00:20.630> of<00:00:20.720> the<00:00:20.779> back<00:00:20.900> of<00:00:21.050> the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
excess monomer out of the back of the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.810 
excess monomer out of the back of the
brush<00:00:21.290> let<00:00:21.590> you<00:00:21.680> have<00:00:21.830> a<00:00:21.860> nice<00:00:22.130> stiff<00:00:22.430> acrylic

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
brush let you have a nice stiff acrylic

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.690 
brush let you have a nice stiff acrylic
and<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.720> then<00:00:23.869> form<00:00:24.770> your<00:00:24.860> smile<00:00:25.160> line<00:00:25.460> and

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
and so then form your smile line and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.630 
and so then form your smile line and
since<00:00:25.910> this<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.420> a<00:00:26.689> squared<00:00:27.650> off<00:00:27.830> nail<00:00:28.130> tip<00:00:28.430> I'm

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
since this is a squared off nail tip I'm

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.130 
since this is a squared off nail tip I'm
going<00:00:29.029> to<00:00:29.119> be<00:00:29.270> making<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.630> smile<00:00:29.869> line

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
going to be making the smile line

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.220 
going to be making the smile line
rounded<00:00:30.740> but<00:00:31.310> not<00:00:31.580> too<00:00:32.449> deep<00:00:32.629> so<00:00:32.900> a<00:00:32.930> nice

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
rounded but not too deep so a nice

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.950 
rounded but not too deep so a nice
gradual<00:00:34.010> curve<00:00:34.340> then<00:00:35.090> add<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.269> letter<00:00:35.540> B<00:00:35.750> to<00:00:35.930> the

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
gradual curve then add a letter B to the

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.810 
gradual curve then add a letter B to the
back<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.500> smooth<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:37.040> over<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.400> first<00:00:37.610> one

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
back and smooth that over the first one

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.330 
back and smooth that over the first one
that<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:38.059> made<00:00:38.300> just<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:39.199> that<00:00:39.379> it<00:00:39.710> has<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.129> nice

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
that you made just so that it has a nice

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.670 
that you made just so that it has a nice
rounded<00:00:40.790> shape<00:00:46.659> let<00:00:47.659> that<00:00:47.839> harden<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:48.470> then

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
rounded shape let that harden and then

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.320 
rounded shape let that harden and then
file<00:00:48.979> the<00:00:49.190> smile<00:00:49.430> line<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:49.850> that<00:00:49.879> it's<00:00:50.150> nice

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
file the smile line so that it's nice

00:00:50.330 --> 00:01:01.010 
file the smile line so that it's nice
and<00:00:50.390> smooth

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.209 

with<00:01:02.020> black<00:01:02.290> acrylic<00:01:02.469> I'm<00:01:02.890> going<00:01:03.070> to<00:01:03.129> be

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
with black acrylic I'm going to be

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.920 
with black acrylic I'm going to be
forming<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.670> stripes<00:01:04.030> first<00:01:04.390> so<00:01:04.690> I'm<00:01:04.780> going

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
forming the stripes first so I'm going

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.240 
forming the stripes first so I'm going
to<00:01:04.960> start<00:01:05.049> with<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.350> stripe<00:01:05.650> that's<00:01:05.920> right

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
to start with a stripe that's right

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.760 
to start with a stripe that's right
along<00:01:06.729> the<00:01:07.479> smile<00:01:07.840> line<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:08.380> this<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.619> almost

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
along the smile line so this is almost

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.940 
along the smile line so this is almost
going<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.070> be<00:01:09.159> outlining<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.729> smile<00:01:10.090> line<00:01:10.240> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
going to be outlining the smile line and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.230 
going to be outlining the smile line and
making<00:01:11.950> these<00:01:12.040> stripes<00:01:12.400> is<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.670> gradual

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
making these stripes is a gradual

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.230 
making these stripes is a gradual
process<00:01:13.300> you<00:01:13.840> have<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.170> just<00:01:14.409> I<00:01:15.240> suggest

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
process you have to just I suggest

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.870 
process you have to just I suggest
working<00:01:16.540> with<00:01:16.690> small<00:01:16.869> beads<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:18.610> so<00:01:18.729> that

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
working with small beads just so that

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.550 
working with small beads just so that
you<00:01:19.000> don't<00:01:19.180> get<00:01:19.330> too<00:01:19.540> much<00:01:19.690> acrylic<00:01:20.110> on<00:01:20.259> at<00:01:20.409> one

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
you don't get too much acrylic on at one

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.430 
you don't get too much acrylic on at one
time<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.390> you're<00:01:22.750> going<00:01:22.869> to<00:01:22.930> want<00:01:22.990> them<00:01:23.290> to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
time and so you're going to want them to

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.649 
time and so you're going to want them to
be<00:01:23.560> thicker<00:01:23.890> or<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.640> thickest<00:01:25.000> on<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.509> edge

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
be thicker or the thickest on the edge

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.480 
be thicker or the thickest on the edge
of<00:01:25.869> the<00:01:25.960> nail<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.409> then<00:01:26.590> get<00:01:26.740> thinner<00:01:27.070> as<00:01:27.340> they

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
of the nail and then get thinner as they

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.030 
of the nail and then get thinner as they
work<00:01:27.700> their<00:01:27.729> way<00:01:28.090> towards<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.570> middle<00:01:29.040> so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
work their way towards the middle so

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.100 
work their way towards the middle so
then<00:01:30.190> just<00:01:30.430> work<00:01:30.610> from<00:01:30.880> side<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.270> side<00:01:31.300> and<00:01:31.780> add

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
then just work from side to side and add

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.710 
then just work from side to side and add
stripes<00:01:32.590> going<00:01:32.979> down<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.580> entire<00:01:33.910> nail<00:01:34.479> tip

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
stripes going down the entire nail tip

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.060 
stripes going down the entire nail tip
and<00:01:34.869> you're<00:01:35.320> going<00:01:35.410> to<00:01:35.500> want<00:01:35.679> these<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:36.039> be

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
and you're going to want these to be

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.340 
and you're going to want these to be
fairly<00:01:36.490> thick<00:01:36.880> so<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.570> way<00:01:37.690> once<00:01:37.929> you<00:01:38.110> place

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
fairly thick so that way once you place

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.900 
fairly thick so that way once you place
the<00:01:38.380> white<00:01:38.710> acrylic<00:01:38.920> over<00:01:39.310> the<00:01:39.399> top<00:01:39.580> of<00:01:39.729> them

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
the white acrylic over the top of them

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.660 
the white acrylic over the top of them
and<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.860> can<00:01:42.009> file<00:01:42.280> away<00:01:42.640> you<00:01:42.700> will<00:01:43.090> see<00:01:43.360> them

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
and you can file away you will see them

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.950 
and you can file away you will see them
so<00:01:45.670> if<00:01:45.789> there's<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.030> really<00:01:46.270> thin<00:01:46.570> spot<00:01:46.840> you're

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
so if there's a really thin spot you're

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.060 
so if there's a really thin spot you're
going<00:01:47.080> to<00:01:47.140> want<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.380> thicken<00:01:47.530> it<00:01:47.710> just<00:01:47.950> so<00:01:48.039> that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
going to want to thicken it just so that

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:56.760 
going to want to thicken it just so that
it'll<00:01:48.340> show<00:01:48.550> up<00:01:48.700> in<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.940> end

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.230 

and<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.780> back<00:01:58.960> of<00:01:59.259> the<00:01:59.380> tip<00:01:59.619> or<00:01:59.859> the<00:02:00.240> actual

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
and if the back of the tip or the actual

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.510 
and if the back of the tip or the actual
nail<00:02:01.659> tip<00:02:01.899> itself<00:02:02.259> gets<00:02:02.859> a<00:02:03.009> little<00:02:03.280> dirty

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
nail tip itself gets a little dirty

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.830 
nail tip itself gets a little dirty
looking<00:02:03.939> it's<00:02:04.119> not<00:02:04.299> going<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.509> matter<00:02:04.570> we're

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
looking it's not going to matter we're

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.480 
looking it's not going to matter we're
going<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.079> cover<00:02:05.229> comfort<00:02:06.039> up<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.399> won't

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
going to cover comfort up and it won't

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:21.480 
going to cover comfort up and it won't
be<00:02:06.700> seen<00:02:07.030> in<00:02:07.299> the<00:02:07.329> final<00:02:07.929> nail

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:44.890

you<00:02:47.239> can<00:02:47.390> gently<00:02:47.659> file<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.290> stripes<00:02:48.620> so<00:02:49.250> you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
you can gently file the stripes so you

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.580 
you can gently file the stripes so you
can<00:02:49.579> just<00:02:49.849> file<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.810> edges<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.319> stripes

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
can just file the edges of the stripes

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.630 
can just file the edges of the stripes
and<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.769> don't<00:02:51.920> want<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.129> push<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.400> them<00:02:52.459> too

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
and you don't want to push on them too

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.030 
and you don't want to push on them too
hard<00:02:52.879> you<00:02:53.030> don't<00:02:53.180> want<00:02:53.329> the<00:02:53.560> thin<00:02:54.560> acrylic<00:02:54.920> to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
hard you don't want the thin acrylic to

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:16.599 
hard you don't want the thin acrylic to
break<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:55.849> you<00:02:55.939> can<00:02:56.120> sharpen<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.659> edges

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.699 

so<00:03:17.609> now<00:03:17.790> when<00:03:18.420> I'm<00:03:18.540> taking<00:03:19.200> white<00:03:19.439> acrylic

I will post a link to another video that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.910 
I will post a link to another video that
uses<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.600> same<00:04:33.840> type<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.110> technique<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.800> the

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
uses the same type of technique in the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:56.700 
uses the same type of technique in the
description<00:04:35.370> box

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.860

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
so now I'm going to cover the tip with

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.140 
so now I'm going to cover the tip with
clear<00:04:59.320> acrylic<00:04:59.620> and<00:04:59.890> this<00:05:00.670> is<00:05:00.820> just<00:05:00.940> going<00:05:01.090> to

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
clear acrylic and this is just going to

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.630 
clear acrylic and this is just going to
make<00:05:01.240> sure<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.840> it's<00:05:02.470> nice<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:02.740> smooth<00:05:03.340> and

make sure that it's nice and smooth and

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.700 
make sure that it's nice and smooth and
the<00:05:03.880> right<00:05:04.060> thickness<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:05.110> once<00:05:05.470> you're<00:05:05.620> done

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
the right thickness so once you're done

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.900 
the right thickness so once you're done
with<00:05:05.770> the<00:05:05.950> clear<00:05:06.160> you're<00:05:06.340> going<00:05:06.490> to<00:05:06.550> want<00:05:06.700> your

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.089 

so<00:05:33.599> now<00:05:33.719> I'm<00:05:33.839> going<00:05:34.050> to<00:05:34.110> be<00:05:34.169> filing<00:05:34.469> the<00:05:34.770> entire
