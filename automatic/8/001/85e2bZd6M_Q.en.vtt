00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.030 
exactly what I've always wanted for 10
years<00:02:17.570> I've<00:02:18.110> always<00:02:18.290> had<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.440> strong<00:02:18.680> opinion

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
years I've always had a strong opinion

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040 
years I've always had a strong opinion
maybe<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.640> little<00:02:19.910> too<00:02:20.000> intense<00:02:20.270> at<00:02:20.510> times<00:02:20.720> but

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
maybe a little too intense at times but

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.780 
maybe a little too intense at times but
I<00:02:21.350> know<00:02:21.830> what<00:02:22.070> I<00:02:22.100> like<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.370> I<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.580> what<00:02:22.760> I

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
I know what I like and I know what I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.170 
I know what I like and I know what I
don't<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.480> it's<00:02:24.050> really<00:02:24.350> easy<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
don't like and it's really easy to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.060 
don't like and it's really easy to
decipher<00:02:26.180> through<00:02:26.540> what<00:02:26.750> doesn't<00:02:27.140> work<00:02:27.260> and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
decipher through what doesn't work and

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.960 
decipher through what doesn't work and
what<00:02:28.310> does

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.030
