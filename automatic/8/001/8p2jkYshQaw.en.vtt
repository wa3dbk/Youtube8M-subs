00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
come into the mediation process and we

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
think we would get those through the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.130 
think we would get those through the
system<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> better<00:01:51.030> result<00:01:51.360> much<00:01:51.899> more

system to a better result much more

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.380 
system to a better result much more
quickly<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.500> using<00:01:52.860> far<00:01:53.040> less<00:01:53.070> resources<00:01:53.729> so

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
quickly and using far less resources so

we encourage you to consider working

we encourage you to consider working
with<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.689> courts<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.229> get<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.770> mandatory
