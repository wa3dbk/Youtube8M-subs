 unprecedented mobilization at the airport 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.510
 of the capital because of the news of a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.630
 aircraft that had as destination cuiabÃ¡ 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.000
 but could not land due to failure in the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.219
 landing gear and returned to the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 great for about an hour the plane 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 flew over the capital to spend 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.100
 fuel and reduce the possibility of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.219
 explosion during landing 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.960
 after much attention the relief at 10 and 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.629
 20 at night you can see the airplane 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.070
 doing the landing procedure and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.590
 the landing gear normally operating 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.300
 but then new moments of tension 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 with the delay in releasing the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.799
 passengers who have remained more than one 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.549
 hour inside the aircraft 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.500
 meanwhile in the most despair soap 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.450
 nervousness and lack of information a 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.549
 the father of one of the passengers 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.150
 I ventured out here there are 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.950
 Shebab against the firefighter is and the plane 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.900
 have any technical problems warned you anything 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.040
 and we were terrified that it is until 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.710
 now there is no news 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.140
 an airplane of your team is on the track and the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.400
 passenger everything open is funny no 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.110
 You know nothing that really happened. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.500
 I could talk now, you 're just crying. 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:38.610
 it's in there it's inside the rose 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.920
 crying is only there 16 complicated because 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 already happened some goal 1 to 1 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.689
 I decided now why I eat with an airplane. 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.780
 of avianca now happens again I do not 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.920
 I know what's going on, tired not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.530
 know what happens 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.240
 after a lot of waiting the delayed hug 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.020
 and whey relieve 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.020
 the big kick 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.909
 according to the company's advisory 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.129
 no one was injured 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.899
 the advisor justified explaining that 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.330
 during the landing procedure in 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.580
 when a bird would have collided with 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.769
 sensors that indicate the position of the 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.450
 equipment on the dashboard and by 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.030
 security for the population decided to 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.610
 return to the big field where they got 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.890
 land safely but avianca 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.530
 did not report the status of the aircraft 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.989
 and what kind of maintenance will be 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.629
 the 90 passengers were accommodated in 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.970
 another flight at two-thirty in the morning and 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.890
 They went to cuiabÃ¡ in the afternoon 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.349
 last Friday a plane of the same 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.660
 company made a forced landing in 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.579
 Brasilia after coming from petrolina in 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 pernambuco had to make the landing 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.010
 forced because the front landing gear 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.510
 did not leave and the aircraft landed with only 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.510
 a rear equipment
