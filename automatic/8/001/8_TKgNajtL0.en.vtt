adversity so all of the teams aren't
perfect

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
perfect

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.559 
perfect
I<00:02:27.370> believe<00:02:27.640> they<00:02:27.760> tried<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.030> shoot<00:02:28.299> for<00:02:28.480> at

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
I believe they tried to shoot for at

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.059 
I believe they tried to shoot for at
least<00:02:28.690> two<00:02:29.049> or<00:02:29.080> three<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> original

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
least two or three of the original

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.410 
least two or three of the original
members<00:02:30.220> of<00:02:30.519> each<00:02:30.640> team<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.360> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
members of each team to make it a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.479 
members of each team to make it a
legitimate<00:02:31.540> team<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.829> all<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.130> them<00:02:33.340> aren't

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
legitimate team so all of them aren't

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.830 
legitimate team so all of them aren't
perfect<00:02:33.910> but<00:02:33.970> I'm<00:02:34.090> gonna<00:02:34.239> go<00:02:34.390> over<00:02:34.599> some<00:02:34.630> of

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
perfect but I'm gonna go over some of

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.479 
perfect but I'm gonna go over some of
the<00:02:34.900> bigger<00:02:35.079> name<00:02:35.290> teams<00:02:35.620> rosters<00:02:36.130> right<00:02:36.340> now

the bigger name teams rosters right now
so<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.760> got<00:02:36.910> complexity<00:02:37.660> aches<00:02:37.930> clay<00:02:38.319> stir

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
so you got complexity aches clay stir

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.380 
so you got complexity aches clay stir
the<00:02:38.709> two<00:02:38.860> original<00:02:39.250> members<00:02:39.280> then<00:02:39.760> John<00:02:40.030> and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.750 
think Friday is the last day but we'll
go<00:04:15.260> over<00:04:15.290> some<00:04:15.590> of<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.770> prizes<00:04:15.950> I<00:04:16.310> believe<00:04:16.579> its

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
go over some of the prizes I believe its

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.110 
go over some of the prizes I believe its
first<00:04:17.000> place<00:04:17.239> is<00:04:17.419> 4000<00:04:18.079> second<00:04:18.380> place<00:04:18.530> is

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
first place is 4000 second place is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.370 
first place is 4000 second place is
$1,000<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:20.239> there's<00:04:20.419> not<00:04:20.540> really<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.780> big<00:04:21.079> prize

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
$1,000 so there's not really a big prize

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.810 
$1,000 so there's not really a big prize
but<00:04:21.680> it's<00:04:21.799> just<00:04:21.889> gonna<00:04:22.070> be<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.250> really<00:04:22.490> really
