any any editing I'm actually playing
this<00:00:20.310> live<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.080> mistakes<00:00:22.080> probably<00:00:22.529> will<00:00:22.680> be

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
this live so mistakes probably will be

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.070 
this live so mistakes probably will be
made<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.130> far<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.430> me<00:00:23.910> speaking<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.750> that's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
made as far as me speaking but that's

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
made as far as me speaking but that's
bound<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> happen<00:00:25.470> when<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:25.890> play<00:00:26.070> live<00:00:26.279> but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
bound to happen when you play live but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.550 
bound to happen when you play live but
now<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.660> I've<00:00:27.750> shown<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.019> what<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.439> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
pretty much all it is is a glitch to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.780 
pretty much all it is is a glitch to
kind<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.630> super<00:00:30.869> sprint<00:00:31.189> but<00:00:32.189> in<00:00:32.550> order

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
kind of just super sprint but in order

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.100

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
of the rolling animation so I'm going to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.999 
of the rolling animation so I'm going to
do<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:15.240> quick<00:01:15.360> holding<00:01:16.350> down<00:01:16.470> l1

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
do a really quick holding down l1

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.039 
do a really quick holding down l1
pushing<00:01:17.549> circle<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.000> r1<00:01:18.330> letting<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> l1

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pushing circle and r1 letting go of l1

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.660 
pushing circle and r1 letting go of l1
and<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.710> there<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.890> go<00:01:20.040> now<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and then there you go now you get a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.960 
and then there you go now you get a
boost<00:01:20.880> depending<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.930> your<00:01:22.049> timing<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.970> pretty

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
boost depending on your timing is pretty

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
boost depending on your timing is pretty
much<00:01:24.180> kind<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.450> determine<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.049> far<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.470> get

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
much kind of determine how far you get

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
much kind of determine how far you get
with<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.060> sometimes<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.240> won't<00:01:27.360> get<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.659> at

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
with this sometimes you won't get it at

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.090 
with this sometimes you won't get it at
all<00:01:27.900> sometimes<00:01:28.200> you'll<00:01:28.500> go<00:01:28.619> really<00:01:28.890> far

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
all sometimes you'll go really far

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
all sometimes you'll go really far
sometimes<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.659> pretty<00:01:30.840> much

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
sometimes you know it's just pretty much

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.660 
sometimes you know it's just pretty much
random<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> said<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:32.340> much<00:01:32.430> all

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
random like I said pretty much all

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.850 
random like I said pretty much all
depending<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> your<00:01:33.329> timing<00:01:33.780> after<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.740> get

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
depending on your timing after you get

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.200 
depending on your timing after you get
used<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:35.850> chain

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
used to it you can kind of just chain

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
used to it you can kind of just chain
them<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.350> kind<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.590> just

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
them up so that way you can kind of just

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.069 
them up so that way you can kind of just
get<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.369> some<00:01:38.759> pretty<00:01:38.909> quickly<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.930> some

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
get to some pretty quickly to some

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.950 
get to some pretty quickly to some
pretty<00:01:40.200> far<00:01:40.439> places<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:40.979> quick<00:01:41.960> that's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
pretty far places really quick that's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.969 
pretty far places really quick that's
pretty<00:01:43.140> much<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.409> wrap<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.829> video

this glitch do you think they should

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.050

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
leave it in do you think they should

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
leave it in do you think they should
patch<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.450> personally<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.890> story<00:01:53.159> mode<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
patch it personally for story mode I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.370 
patch it personally for story mode I
think<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.880> fair<00:01:54.060> use<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.960> seen<00:01:55.200> some

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
think is for fair use I have seen some

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.319 
think is for fair use I have seen some
PvP<00:01:55.770> footage<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> people<00:01:56.460> doing<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.180> I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
PvP footage of people doing this and I

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.270 
PvP footage of people doing this and I
have<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.689> admit<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.110> pretty<00:01:58.229> cheap<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.890> don't

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
have to admit it's pretty cheap I don't

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.969 
have to admit it's pretty cheap I don't
like<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.990> final<00:02:01.140> thoughts<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
like it so my final thoughts are kind of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.649 
like it so my final thoughts are kind of
that<00:02:02.100> they<00:02:02.250> should<00:02:02.460> patch<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:02.909> even<00:02:03.420> though<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
that they should patch it even though it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.270 
that they should patch it even though it
is<00:02:03.750> kind<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.140> bitch<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.350> walk<00:02:04.649> around<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
is kind of a bitch to walk around the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.210 
is kind of a bitch to walk around the
whole<00:02:06.180> story<00:02:06.479> mode<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.380> regular<00:02:07.740> sprint<00:02:08.069> if

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
whole story mode just regular sprint if

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
whole story mode just regular sprint if
you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.239> use<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.420> in<00:02:09.629> PvP<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.200> multiplayer<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
you can use it in PvP and multiplayer I

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.589 
you can use it in PvP and multiplayer I
think<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:11.340> cheap<00:02:11.610> personally<00:02:12.569> I

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
think it's really cheap personally I

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.100 
think it's really cheap personally I
think<00:02:12.690> they<00:02:12.900> say

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
think they say

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.380 
think they say
glitchet<00:02:13.470> or<00:02:13.650> they<00:02:13.890> should<00:02:14.100> fix<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.640> but<00:02:15.180> um

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
glitchet or they should fix it but um

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.420 
glitchet or they should fix it but um

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
if maybe they should patch it or not but

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.960 
if maybe they should patch it or not but
