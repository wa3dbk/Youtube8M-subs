product Indian greens it is a protein

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.780 
product Indian greens it is a protein
supplement<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> base<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.700 
supplement so that the base of it is
whey<00:00:42.030> protein<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:43.020> more<00:00:43.290> importantly<00:00:43.590> whey

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
whey protein or more importantly whey

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.310 
whey protein or more importantly whey
protein<00:00:44.100> isolate<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.870> they're<00:00:46.050> saying

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
protein isolate and what they're saying

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.770 
protein isolate and what they're saying
it's<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.559> fat-burning<00:00:46.860> protein<00:00:47.820> powder<00:00:48.090> matrix

it's a fat-burning protein powder matrix

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's a fat-burning protein powder matrix
so<00:00:49.680> let's<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.219> go<00:00:50.370> through<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.730> comes<00:00:51.239> in

in there but like I said the protein
blend<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.229> just<00:01:31.500> whey<00:01:31.590> protein<00:01:31.979> isolate<00:01:32.689> it

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
blend is just whey protein isolate it

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
blend is just whey protein isolate it
does<00:01:34.140> have<00:01:34.320> sunflower<00:01:34.619> powder<00:01:35.390> which<00:01:36.390> is

powders<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> shares<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> similar<00:01:41.340> fat<00:01:41.880> blend

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
powders so it shares a similar fat blend

powders so it shares a similar fat blend
that<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.649> their<00:01:43.829> syntha-6

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that you would see in their syntha-6

that you would see in their syntha-6
which<00:01:44.820> makes<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> taste<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.170> gives<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
which makes it taste so it gives it that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.270 
which makes it taste so it gives it that
milkshake<00:01:47.340> texture<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> other<00:01:49.860> part<00:01:50.220> of

milkshake texture but the other part of

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.760 
milkshake texture but the other part of
this<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.759> their<00:01:50.939> ISO<00:01:51.180> burn<00:01:51.570> blend<00:01:52.049> or<00:01:52.649> what

who have these problems that their body
doesn't<00:03:51.380> so<00:03:51.560> much<00:03:51.620> release<00:03:52.010> that<00:03:52.130> much<00:03:52.280> left

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
doesn't so much release that much left

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.259 
doesn't so much release that much left
and<00:03:52.700> I<00:03:52.910> eat<00:03:53.329> me<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.569> guess<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.940> just<00:03:55.940> wanted<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
and I eat me I guess I just wanted to

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.039 
and I eat me I guess I just wanted to
throw<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.510> out<00:03:56.660> there<00:03:56.780> because<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.019> know

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
throw that out there because I know

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.710 
throw that out there because I know
somebody's<00:03:57.470> gonna<00:03:57.560> say<00:03:57.739> something<00:03:58.480> but<00:03:59.480> it

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
somebody's gonna say something but it

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.870 
somebody's gonna say something but it
does<00:03:59.900> have<00:04:00.169> some<00:04:00.470> promise<00:04:00.980> there<00:04:01.220> sure<00:04:01.669> but

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
does have some promise there sure but

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.699 
does have some promise there sure but
sort<00:04:02.269> of<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:02.389> similar<00:04:02.870> effects<00:04:03.260> are<00:04:03.440> seen

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
sort of the similar effects are seen

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.190 
sort of the similar effects are seen
with<00:04:03.919> fiber<00:04:04.280> just<00:04:04.639> adding<00:04:05.000> fiber<00:04:05.299> to<00:04:05.750> to

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
with fiber just adding fiber to to

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.479 
with fiber just adding fiber to to
shakes<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.889> things<00:04:07.099> like<00:04:07.250> that

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
shakes and things like that

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.140 
shakes and things like that
so<00:04:08.019> fiber<00:04:09.019> will<00:04:09.290> expand<00:04:09.829> and<00:04:10.220> your<00:04:10.819> stomach

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
so fiber will expand and your stomach

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.879 
so fiber will expand and your stomach
and<00:04:11.299> your<00:04:11.389> intestines<00:04:11.419> and<00:04:12.169> then<00:04:12.319> you<00:04:12.769> know

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
and your intestines and then you know

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.059 
and your intestines and then you know
that<00:04:13.099> tell<00:04:13.430> your<00:04:13.669> for

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
that tell your for

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.080 
that tell your for
-<00:04:14.249> so<00:04:14.959> but<00:04:15.959> yes<00:04:16.500> oh<00:04:17.130> no<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:17.579> not<00:04:17.729> going<00:04:17.940> to

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
- so but yes oh no it's not going to

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.020 
- so but yes oh no it's not going to

carnitine<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.479> paper<00:04:45.720> should<00:04:46.289> be<00:04:46.349> very<00:04:47.130> good

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
carnitine on paper should be very good

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.710 
carnitine on paper should be very good
and<00:04:47.970> work<00:04:48.449> for<00:04:48.930> weight<00:04:49.320> loss<00:04:49.560> basically<00:04:50.720> on

and work for weight loss basically on
paper<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.139> does<00:04:52.289> shuttle<00:04:52.800> fat<00:04:53.099> into<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.669> cell

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
paper it does shuttle fat into the cell

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.240 
paper it does shuttle fat into the cell
or<00:04:54.419> I<00:04:54.479> should<00:04:54.630> say<00:04:54.810> into<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.650> mitochondria

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
or I should say into the mitochondria

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.680 
or I should say into the mitochondria
this<00:04:56.370> stuff<00:04:56.550> to<00:04:56.669> be<00:04:56.759> burned<00:04:56.970> off<00:04:57.150> as<00:04:57.300> energy

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
this stuff to be burned off as energy

the<00:04:58.169> problem<00:04:58.560> without<00:04:58.800> carnitine<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.370> doesn't

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
the problem without carnitine is doesn't

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.540 
the problem without carnitine is doesn't
absorb<00:04:59.970> very<00:05:00.270> well<00:05:00.830> so<00:05:01.830> that's<00:05:02.130> why<00:05:02.310> they

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
absorb very well so that's why they

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.100 
absorb very well so that's why they
bonded<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.300> these<00:05:03.449> all<00:05:03.599> these<00:05:03.720> different

it<00:05:11.580> just<00:05:11.759> doesn't<00:05:12.030> work<00:05:12.120> very<00:05:12.180> well<00:05:12.740> but<00:05:13.740> may

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
it just doesn't work very well but may

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.430 
it just doesn't work very well but may

yeah<00:05:37.860> it<00:05:38.820> can<00:05:39.000> mimic<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.449> effects<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.750> insulin

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
yeah it can mimic the effects of insulin

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.570 
yeah it can mimic the effects of insulin
in<00:05:40.169> the<00:05:40.199> body<00:05:40.349> taking<00:05:40.860> carbohydrates<00:05:41.460> your

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
in the body taking carbohydrates your

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.120 
in the body taking carbohydrates your
body<00:05:41.729> that<00:05:42.360> gets<00:05:42.509> converted<00:05:43.259> into<00:05:43.470> glucose<00:05:43.860> in

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
body that gets converted into glucose in

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.999 
body that gets converted into glucose in
the<00:05:44.190> blood<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:44.669> then<00:05:45.270> your<00:05:45.419> body<00:05:45.630> will

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
the blood and then your body will

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.920 
the blood and then your body will
produce<00:05:47.009> insulin<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.880> shut<00:05:48.300> all<00:05:48.419> that<00:05:48.539> glucose

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
produce insulin to shut all that glucose

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.839 
produce insulin to shut all that glucose
to<00:05:49.080> where<00:05:49.199> it<00:05:49.259> needs<00:05:49.380> to<00:05:49.470> go<00:05:49.560> so<00:05:50.009> it<00:05:50.550> can<00:05:50.699> help

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
to where it needs to go so it can help

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.580 
to where it needs to go so it can help
mimic<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.389> so<00:05:51.570> if<00:05:51.659> you're<00:05:51.780> taking<00:05:51.900> in<00:05:52.169> excess

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
mimic that so if you're taking in excess

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.529 
mimic that so if you're taking in excess
carbohydrates<00:05:52.979> it<00:05:53.340> may<00:05:53.520> help<00:05:53.789> with<00:05:53.909> you<00:05:54.449> know

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
carbohydrates it may help with you know

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.629 
carbohydrates it may help with you know
those<00:05:55.009> carbohydrates<00:05:56.009> getting<00:05:56.220> stored<00:05:56.490> into

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 
those carbohydrates getting stored into

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.580 
those carbohydrates getting stored into
muscle<00:05:57.000> cells<00:05:57.270> rather<00:05:57.599> than<00:05:57.840> being<00:05:58.110> left<00:05:58.349> over

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
muscle cells rather than being left over

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.120 
muscle cells rather than being left over
and<00:05:58.830> converted<00:05:59.280> into<00:05:59.370> body<00:05:59.639> fat<00:06:00.620> that<00:06:01.620> really

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
and converted into body fat that really

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.670 
and converted into body fat that really
is<00:06:02.430> it<00:06:02.820> in<00:06:03.360> terms<00:06:03.539> of<00:06:03.719> the<00:06:03.810> ingredients<00:06:04.320> like<00:06:04.620> I

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
is it in terms of the ingredients like I

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.200 
is it in terms of the ingredients like I
said<00:06:04.949> it<00:06:05.009> comes<00:06:05.099> in<00:06:05.310> three<00:06:05.490> flavors<00:06:05.580> 20

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
said it comes in three flavors 20

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.959 
said it comes in three flavors 20
servings<00:06:06.919> so<00:06:07.919> if<00:06:08.250> you're<00:06:08.370> looking<00:06:08.580> for

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
servings so if you're looking for

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:11.990 
servings so if you're looking for
something<00:06:09.210> that<00:06:09.389> maybe<00:06:09.889> you<00:06:10.889> want<00:06:11.580> to<00:06:11.639> take<00:06:11.820> is

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 
something that maybe you want to take is

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.550 
something that maybe you want to take is
almost<00:06:12.240> a<00:06:12.419> meal<00:06:12.659> replacement<00:06:12.810> although<00:06:13.349> it's

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
almost a meal replacement although it's

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.350 
almost a meal replacement although it's
still<00:06:13.650> only<00:06:13.979> 120<00:06:14.580> calories<00:06:14.789> you<00:06:15.090> might<00:06:15.240> need

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
still only 120 calories you might need

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.709 
still only 120 calories you might need
something

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:15.719 
something

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.809 
something
with<00:06:16.110> it<00:06:16.289> but<00:06:17.099> maybe<00:06:17.219> you<00:06:17.369> want<00:06:17.429> to<00:06:17.549> mix<00:06:17.669> the

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:17.819 
with it but maybe you want to mix the

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:19.369 
with it but maybe you want to mix the
scoop<00:06:17.999> with<00:06:18.119> this<00:06:18.299> with<00:06:18.689> your<00:06:18.899> regular<00:06:19.080> whey

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:19.379 
scoop with this with your regular whey

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:20.929 
scoop with this with your regular whey
protein<00:06:19.860> and<00:06:19.889> maybe<00:06:20.279> it'll<00:06:20.489> help<00:06:20.580> you<00:06:20.729> feel

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:20.939 
protein and maybe it'll help you feel

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:23.479 
protein and maybe it'll help you feel
satiated<00:06:21.209> a<00:06:21.599> little<00:06:21.809> more<00:06:21.929> fuller<00:06:22.309> that<00:06:23.309> would

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:23.489 
satiated a little more fuller that would

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:27.350 
satiated a little more fuller that would
be<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.729> use<00:06:23.939> for<00:06:24.179> this<00:06:25.729> so<00:06:26.729> I<00:06:26.759> wouldn't<00:06:27.239> make

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.360 
be the use for this so I wouldn't make

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.029 
be the use for this so I wouldn't make
it<00:06:27.419> my<00:06:27.659> main<00:06:27.959> protein<00:06:28.469> starts<00:06:28.679> just<00:06:28.829> because

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 
it my main protein starts just because

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.399 
it my main protein starts just because
the<00:06:29.189> price<00:06:29.369> is<00:06:29.610> going<00:06:29.729> to<00:06:29.789> be<00:06:29.849> up<00:06:30.059> there<00:06:30.409> you

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409 
the price is going to be up there you

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:32.539 
the price is going to be up there you
can<00:06:31.559> find<00:06:31.739> other<00:06:31.889> options<00:06:32.249> like<00:06:32.339> where

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:32.549 
can find other options like where

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:35.329 
can find other options like where
syntha-6<00:06:32.879> or<00:06:33.389> their<00:06:33.829> synthetics<00:06:34.829> isolate

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:35.339 
syntha-6 or their synthetics isolate

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:37.549 
syntha-6 or their synthetics isolate
would<00:06:35.789> be<00:06:35.879> another<00:06:36.089> option<00:06:36.299> just<00:06:37.049> as<00:06:37.259> a<00:06:37.289> pure

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:37.559 
would be another option just as a pure

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:39.679 
would be another option just as a pure
protein<00:06:38.009> source<00:06:38.279> but<00:06:38.610> I<00:06:38.969> think<00:06:39.389> that<00:06:39.509> just

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:39.689 
protein source but I think that just

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:41.179 
protein source but I think that just
about<00:06:39.719> covers<00:06:39.989> it<00:06:40.169> if<00:06:40.979> you<00:06:41.069> have<00:06:41.159> any

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
about covers it if you have any

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:42.409 
about covers it if you have any
questions<00:06:41.669> you<00:06:41.759> can<00:06:41.849> post<00:06:42.119> them<00:06:42.239> in<00:06:42.360> the

questions you can post them in the
