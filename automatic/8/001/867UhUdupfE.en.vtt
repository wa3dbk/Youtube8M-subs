or<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.659> village<00:02:01.049> buildings<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.040> I'm

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
or the village buildings and so I'm

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.459 
or the village buildings and so I'm
going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.820> continue<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.360> but<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.020> wanted

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
going to continue on but I just wanted

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.520 
going to continue on but I just wanted
to<00:02:04.530> give<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.799> overview<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.939> use<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.509> tree<00:02:06.960> it

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to give you overview I use this tree it

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.700 
to give you overview I use this tree it
is<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.860> cheap

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
is a cheap

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.850 
is a cheap
little<00:02:09.150> holiday<00:02:10.150> tree<00:02:10.450> but<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.350> looks<00:02:11.620> real

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
little holiday tree but it looks real

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.030 
little holiday tree but it looks real
enough<00:02:11.890> that<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.000> behind<00:02:13.240> my<00:02:14.230> pond<00:02:14.620> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
enough that it's behind my pond and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.210 
enough that it's behind my pond and
therefore<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.090> hides<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:16.600> socket<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.920> now

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
therefore it hides the socket and so now

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.870 
therefore it hides the socket and so now
you<00:02:18.280> see<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:20.530> village<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:21.340> tried<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.850> a

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
you see this village and I tried to do a

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.060 
you see this village and I tried to do a
layout<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.630> seemed<00:02:22.900> feasible<00:02:23.410> for<00:02:23.980> an

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
layout that seemed feasible for an

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.490 
layout that seemed feasible for an
actual<00:02:24.400> village<00:02:24.880> but<00:02:25.120> let<00:02:25.690> me<00:02:25.780> finish<00:02:25.990> up<00:02:26.260> and

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
actual village but let me finish up and

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.050 
actual village but let me finish up and
then<00:02:26.620> I'll<00:02:26.740> show<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:26.980> some<00:02:27.250> more<00:02:27.370> steps<00:02:27.730> as<00:02:27.940> I

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
then I'll show you some more steps as I

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.640 
then I'll show you some more steps as I
go<00:02:28.210> along<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.950> village<00:02:30.460> is<00:02:30.720> complete<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
go along so the village is complete and

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.690 
go along so the village is complete and
I<00:02:33.160> wanted<00:02:33.460> to<00:02:33.520> take<00:02:33.760> just<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.180> really<00:02:34.690> slow

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
I wanted to take just a really slow

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.730 
I wanted to take just a really slow
overview<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.270> for<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:39.690> basically<00:02:40.740> the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
overview of it for you and basically the

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.860 
overview of it for you and basically the
only<00:02:41.950> two<00:02:42.430> things<00:02:42.700> that<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:43.060> well<00:02:43.450> several

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
only two things that I well several

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.350 
only two things that I well several
things<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.230> guess<00:02:44.410> that<00:02:44.440> I<00:02:44.620> added<00:02:44.890> was<00:02:45.850> that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
things I guess that I added was that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.410 
things I guess that I added was that
foliage<00:02:46.960> in<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.380> background<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:49.270> had

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
foliage in the background that I had

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.500 
foliage in the background that I had
just<00:02:49.630> done<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.080> corner<00:02:50.740> earlier<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:51.970> again

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
just done this corner earlier but again

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.690 
just done this corner earlier but again
I<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:52.810> took<00:02:53.230> apart<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.680> garland<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.220> I<00:02:54.370> loved

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
I just took apart a garland that I loved

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.300 
I just took apart a garland that I loved
but<00:02:55.090> it<00:02:55.210> had<00:02:55.360> some<00:02:55.540> berries<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.020> pine<00:02:57.010> cones

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
but it had some berries and pine cones

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.160 
but it had some berries and pine cones
on<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.580> which<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:58.000> was<00:02:58.150> none<00:02:58.360> too<00:02:58.600> enamored<00:02:58.870> of

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
on it which I was none too enamored of

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.650 
on it which I was none too enamored of
and<00:02:59.590> I<00:03:00.010> love<00:03:00.400> it<00:03:00.580> because<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:01.150> looks<00:03:01.360> like<00:03:01.450> an

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
and I love it because it looks like an

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.350 
and I love it because it looks like an
overgrown<00:03:02.470> forest<00:03:02.890> in<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:03.580> background<00:03:04.120> there

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
overgrown forest in the background there

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.830 
overgrown forest in the background there
or<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.080> I<00:03:05.110> think<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.740> then<00:03:06.490> I<00:03:06.790> have<00:03:07.540> these

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
or so I think and then I have these

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.620 
or so I think and then I have these
trees<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:09.490> have<00:03:09.790> lights<00:03:10.120> in<00:03:10.330> them<00:03:10.450> although

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
trees that have lights in them although

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.600 
trees that have lights in them although
I'm<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.140> noticing<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.100> lights<00:03:12.370> on

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
I'm just noticing that the lights on

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.270 
I'm just noticing that the lights on
that<00:03:12.640> particular<00:03:13.420> treatment<00:03:13.690> yet<00:03:14.110> and<00:03:14.800> they

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
that particular treatment yet and they

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.340 
that particular treatment yet and they
have<00:03:15.490> lights<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.240> these<00:03:16.570> trees<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.200> their

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
have lights in these trees and their

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.830 
have lights in these trees and their
Christmas<00:03:17.890> trees<00:03:18.160> for<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.580> village<00:03:18.940> Oh<00:03:19.180> Rama

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
Christmas trees for the village Oh Rama

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.110 
Christmas trees for the village Oh Rama
tree<00:03:20.050> that's<00:03:20.260> why<00:03:20.440> there<00:03:20.620> were<00:03:20.680> no<00:03:20.830> lights<00:03:21.120> and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
tree that's why there were no lights and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.630 
tree that's why there were no lights and
then<00:03:22.390> finally<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.260> sprinkled<00:03:23.980> some<00:03:24.250> snow<00:03:24.610> that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
then finally I sprinkled some snow that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.990 
then finally I sprinkled some snow that
I<00:03:25.270> had<00:03:25.690> picked<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:26.050> from<00:03:26.110> Walmart<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.490> it<00:03:27.820> is<00:03:27.970> a

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
I had picked up from Walmart and it is a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.870 
I had picked up from Walmart and it is a
very<00:03:28.360> light<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:29.020> airy<00:03:29.260> snow<00:03:29.710> so<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.460> was<00:03:30.670> able

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
very light and airy snow so I was able

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.070 
very light and airy snow so I was able
to<00:03:31.060> sprinkle<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.690> on<00:03:31.840> top<00:03:31.900> all<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:34.080> Swiss
