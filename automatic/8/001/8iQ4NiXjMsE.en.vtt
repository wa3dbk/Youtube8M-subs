00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.740
 Hi Mike 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:17.009
 Well, I just think it 's 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.019
 something I hoped would be heavy if life 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.029
 out a video game could hunt down 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.310
 so many also fly around the city 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.409
 rescuing citizens could be 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.449
 invisible in stealing all kinds of banks 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:30.029
 rescue my princess go I would be 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.560
 fantastic 4 would fight pedestrians would eat 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.180
 of all kinds of mushrooms if it were a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.190
 video game more than one would have touched him 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.469
 tits jump and cliffs 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.170
 dangerous and nothing would happen because I have 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.359
 dgt tricks to these initial pieces of 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.309
 pokemon stuck in my box would advance 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.379
 down the street and a zombie would find me 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.780
 if life were a videogame I all 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.339
 I could move forward without fear I would fly 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.020
 with my hair yellow like a dragon ball 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.330
 z 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.700
 in healthy medium it could be hard has been 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.730
 impossible to defeat what they are and 20 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.760
 without fail the restarts escape 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.640
 traps everything everything would be easier never 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.830
 in half room could be hard has been 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.220
 impossible to defeat what they are and there 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.070
 20 without dates the restarts is capable of 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.780
 traps everything everything would be easier would 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.250
 what I like and who does not like it 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.530
 shotgun would have millions of 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.630
 subscribers or if you did not leave them as 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.190
 only be careful with the ball in tazo I am 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.229
 like a god when he pointed to miss bullet 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.240
 directly to your pact 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.220
 I remember could burn your house like 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.560
 my sword was long expired perhaps 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.940
 more than one way that pilot 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.550
 key as it is now to me it's cool 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.860
 I have the voice capable of lifting it, not like 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.080
 the gentleman would be impossible to stretch 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.270
 as bubu would be a crazy goat who does not 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.610
 stop flying, you do not say what 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.170
 want with whomever you want as you want 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.080
 there are no barriers if life were a 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.320
 videogame listen everything would never change 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.970
 you average the cne could be hard agile and 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.090
 impossible to defeat what are the 20 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.300
 failures restarts escape traps 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.820
 everything everything would be easier never makes 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.650
 healthy media could be hard agile and 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.070
 impossible to defeat what they are and there 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:14.330
 of childhoods he restarted escape 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.670
 traps everything everything would be easier 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.880
 mike does not motivate you is that the song is 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.880
 mine
