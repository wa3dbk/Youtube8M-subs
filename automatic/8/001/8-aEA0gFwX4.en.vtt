over<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.230> power<00:00:40.620> zoom<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.219> how<00:00:41.340> well

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
over that power zoom and see how well

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
over that power zoom and see how well
that<00:00:41.579> works<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.270> quietly<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.230> works

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
that works and how quietly it works

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.260 
that works and how quietly it works
we'll<00:00:44.010> look<00:00:44.160> at<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> physical<00:00:44.850> features<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
we'll look at the physical features of

we'll look at the physical features of
the<00:00:45.420> lens<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.930> specs<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.410> how<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.160> it's

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
the lens the specs and how well it's

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
the lens the specs and how well it's
built<00:00:47.550> finally<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.600> most<00:00:48.719> important<00:00:49.320> we'll

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
built finally and most important we'll

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.110 
built finally and most important we'll
see<00:00:49.890> how<00:00:49.950> good<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> video<00:00:50.399> looks<00:00:50.820> when<00:00:51.000> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
see how good the video looks when you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
see how good the video looks when you
use<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:52.079> power<00:00:52.320> zoom<00:00:52.680> really

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
use it that power zoom really

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.680 
use it that power zoom really
distinguishes<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.879> lens<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.270> I'll<00:00:54.420> start

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
distinguishes this lens so I'll start

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.100 
distinguishes this lens so I'll start
with<00:00:54.870> that

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
with that

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.290 
with that
make<00:00:55.739> sure<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> zoom<00:00:56.309> switch<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> lens<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
make sure the zoom switch on the lens is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.599 
make sure the zoom switch on the lens is
on<00:00:57.329> servo<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.039> zoom<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.460> or<00:00:59.579> out

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
on servo then you can zoom in or out

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.189 
on servo then you can zoom in or out
with<00:00:59.940> your<00:01:00.090> left<00:01:00.329> thumb<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.930> hold<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
with your left thumb as you hold the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619 
with your left thumb as you hold the
camera<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.129> servo<00:01:02.520> zoom<00:01:02.550> has<00:01:02.910> eight<00:01:03.210> speeds

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
camera the servo zoom has eight speeds

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.719 
camera the servo zoom has eight speeds
and<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.930> vary<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> speed<00:01:04.920> by<00:01:05.159> how<00:01:05.339> hard<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
and you vary the speed by how hard you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
and you vary the speed by how hard you
push<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> control<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.960> even<00:01:07.200> pressed<00:01:07.439> all

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
push the control but even pressed all

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.250 
push the control but even pressed all
the<00:01:07.619> way<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.189> doesn't<00:01:08.790> move<00:01:08.880> super<00:01:09.270> fast<00:01:09.299> you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the way it doesn't move super fast you

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140 
the way it doesn't move super fast you
can<00:01:10.439> turn<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.770> power<00:01:10.920> zoom<00:01:11.250> off<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:12.000> move

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
can turn the power zoom off just move

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.780 
can turn the power zoom off just move
the<00:01:12.299> zoom<00:01:12.450> switch<00:01:12.750> from<00:01:12.960> servo<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.860> manual<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
the zoom switch from servo to manual the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.149 
the zoom switch from servo to manual the
manual<00:01:14.820> zoom<00:01:15.420> has<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> slight<00:01:16.020> delay<00:01:16.350> both<00:01:16.920> when

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
manual zoom has a slight delay both when

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.490 
manual zoom has a slight delay both when
you<00:01:17.189> start<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.820> stop<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.240> zoom<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.259> start

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
you start and stop a zoom so you start

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.200 
you start and stop a zoom so you start
turning<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.009> zoom<00:01:20.220> ring<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> moment

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
turning the zoom ring and then a moment

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.600 
turning the zoom ring and then a moment
later<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> zoom<00:01:22.650> start<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.520> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
later you see the zoom start so if you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.859 
later you see the zoom start so if you
need<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> zoom<00:01:24.060> while<00:01:24.299> recording<00:01:24.630> video

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
need to zoom while recording video

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.920 
need to zoom while recording video
you'll<00:01:25.710> probably<00:01:25.979> use<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> power<00:01:26.820> zoom<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.509> I

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you'll probably use the power zoom and I

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.560 
you'll probably use the power zoom and I
liked<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.860> use<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.130> zoom<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.759> need<00:01:30.329> one

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
liked it when I use a zoom I need one

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.819 
liked it when I use a zoom I need one
that<00:01:30.689> will<00:01:30.810> give<00:01:30.930> me<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.470> precise

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
that will give me the kind of precise

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.830 
that will give me the kind of precise
and<00:01:32.130> steady<00:01:32.430> speed<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.390> struggled

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
and steady speed that I really struggled

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.109 
and steady speed that I really struggled
to<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> DSLR<00:01:34.770> lens<00:01:35.220> because<00:01:36.000> they're

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
to get with a DSLR lens because they're

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.050 
to get with a DSLR lens because they're
not<00:01:36.240> designed<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.060> beyond

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
not designed for that this one is beyond

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
not designed for that this one is beyond
the<00:01:39.150> convenience<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> power<00:01:40.170> zoom<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
one thing many cinematographers want

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.620 
one thing many cinematographers want
