00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.770
 practically how did I say it 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.489
 because then we are together with the 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:39.960
 Angela, there you are, I think it's 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.199
 possible is for the school to take 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.340
 let's say so there is a perspective of 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:50.370
 school literacy a partner perspective 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.809
 means bringing is more or less 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.230
 less sums up skugor sneh is not about 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.370
 to leave aside the school practices of 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 literacy 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.960
 but it is always considered 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.700
 consider them from this partner perspective 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.420
 is what we are calling 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.330
 a kind of vaccine to be used right 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.530
 to avoid this sterility 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 the difference of working with these 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.820
 projects of literacy or to do 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.209
 didactic sequences for teaching a 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:32.459
 gender difference that has a thing of the 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:34.530
 Other then we're the first thing. 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.440
 remember to differentiate these two 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.509
 types of work the teacher who 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.340
 works with the Olympiad is quite 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.690
 accustomed to thinking of sequences 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.080
 did not you? 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.599
 so this is something that has been 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.490
 widely used also in school 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.679
 then it's the first thing that people 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.770
 have to remember is that when you work 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.259
 of perspective in the didactic sequence 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.890
 just not 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:04.770
 aaaah entry in the choice is a 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.819
 school option, let's say at the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.880
 Gender is the school right while aa 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.010
 entrance of practices 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.209
 literacy is not exactly a school 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 but it's cultural 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.750
 not that is a difference however it is 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.670
 of course to work on a project 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.760
 to design a project for 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.310
 develop 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.220
 literacy practices at school, I go 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.400
 have to choose, for example, genres that 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.500
 will be worked specifically will 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.110
 it is very common to choose a genre 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.120
 a main genre to be say 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.840
 produced by students 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.370
 then this genre can receive a 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.829
 treatment there may be a 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.159
 was designed to work on this 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.659
 genus but not only it not only a 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:55.629
 gender, right? 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.569
 as far as we go we will use 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:01.150
 also together with Joseph Clement the idea 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.280
 of a network of genres then to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.349
 to work on a project of 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.700
 literacy there will be a main genre 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.220
 which is the focus but auxiliary genres like 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.470
 for example to conduct a poll for 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.290
 make a report perform a 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.470
 interview to participate in a debate 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.220
 that is to other genera also then it is 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.349
 we understand that the project 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.079
 literacy practices are not only 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.329
 absolutely and absolutely 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:36.579
 necessary to have sequences 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:39.040
 internally did the project as the 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.470
 the gender issue is placed in its 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.169
 place with a tool 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.780
 work to carry out the project of 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:50.859
 practice of literacy in a difference 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:54.849
 so I would ask that completing what this is 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.799
 just say and wear it on 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.040
 metaphor of the vaccine I was talking about 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:02.049
 now that the organization of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.019
 projects of literacy practices in 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.230
 school can be an excellent antidote. 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.750
 so that the sequence of tactics is not 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.510
 schooling in others and that the teaching of 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.510
 gender does not make an end in itself is 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.130
 because the original idea of the will 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.380
 I work with didactic sequence of 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.180
 teaching a genre is not teaching the genre 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:28.979
 as a theoretical object is to teach the 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.229
 the student to recognize what is that 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.030
 gender and abdominal 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.860
 from the point of view of the reading and 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.560
 view of writing the main purpose 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.330
 this is not a goal to wake up 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.370
 about this genre but is to have a 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.930
 production reading experience 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.570
 significant with it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.810
 and in this sense it is a practice of 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.120
 literacy that shifts the goal of the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.039
 I work teaching and reading for a 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.370
 cultural issue can be an excellent 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.810
 antidote for us to stop 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:03.090
 transforming gender into an object of 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:07.050
 education itself is I also think 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.000
 interesting the fruit the formulation that 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.759
 it's in the text itself 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.830
 according to which one has to look at the 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:18.560
 written as a way of acting 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.910
 socially so writing a genius is 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.070
 write a text of a certain 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.220
 gender must be seen from this perspective 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.599
 is how the individual will be able to act 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.840
 in society 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:33.090
 writing this genius and sometimes ten 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.260
 operate a little until sometimes the point 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.050
 is the beginning of work begins 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:44.070
 developing a didactic sequence 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:47.789
 to teach a fine teacher are 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:51.419
 sensitive to what the students are 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:57.320
 talking and the activities that are going to 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.320
 composing and energizing while it goes 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:05.330
 repertoire building information for 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:09.090
 This you end up the same thing that started 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:12.240
 more is in a more artificial way 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.759
 end up feeling if this text 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.849
 has a purpose if it is 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.919
 published if it circulates in the place where 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:21.810
 it was produced 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.360
 so I think we have experience 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.930
 within the Olympiad that the 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.500
 match is the genre but the teacher will 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.010
 relating to the community will 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.990
 collecting the poems made by 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.170
 people who live 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:42.170
 there and making the murals and bringing them to the 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:45.410
 This is going to make sense in the 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:47.720
 way, because sometimes it 's not very 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.210
 easy teacher and this is what I wanted 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:54.410
 What he said, look at the teacher. 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:59.020
 identify an issue that can be 

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.020
 a seed for a writing project
