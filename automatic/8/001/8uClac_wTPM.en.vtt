 photoshop will see how to improve 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.760
 sharpness and color of a photo 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.199
 Let's select the photo that we want 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.710
 we want to improve and give a zoom is 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:45.050
 you see here the little colorful morning goods 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.920
 And you 're not going to fix it. 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.739
 First step is to unblock the plan 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:59.570
 background ' layering of one of the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:04.189
 ranking and an ok now we go here 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:09.409
 create a fill layer 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.460
 we go in leather but and you here you go 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.390

 being to your liking you close here 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:38.080
 Let's go now on the old layer leaving it 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.990
 Anyway, we're going to fight one against another for 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:50.030
 duplicate it now with it selected 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.440
 let's on uncle other high tone filters 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.310
 frequency 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.490

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.440
 some little thing depending on your door 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.390
 you can increase a little more one 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.560
 just under an ok 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.870
 done that we will now transform 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:16.489
 this layer of normal 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.640
 for indirect light cv that has already improved 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:22.760
 very quality here also you can 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.409
 do bright indirect lights test 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.370
 is the one that was left over from your 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:33.380
 If you like, you confirm the correct 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.400
 layer that are 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.400
 each selected 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:53.230
 mother will you create a new layer of 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:57.290
 fill and goes here in selective color 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:02.090

 photo if it has to improve the yellow it 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.570
 blue and then you're doing tests on the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:13.220
 If I'm going to leave it red here and I'll 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:16.700
 pass the ocean environment 20 people 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.860

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.550
 better than it is 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.460
