00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
career the moment I think it's a massive

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.780 
career the moment I think it's a massive
game<00:01:43.100> obviously<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.280> chance<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.670> win

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
game obviously a chance to win

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
game obviously a chance to win
silverware<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.479> fast<00:01:45.869> knowledge<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.470> massive

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
silverware for fast knowledge is massive

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130 
silverware for fast knowledge is massive
and<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:48.210> haven't<00:01:48.360> won<00:01:48.570> anything<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.110> a

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.420 
and we we haven't won anything for a
long<00:01:49.259> time<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.220> be<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
