still<00:04:01.500> steeping<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.130> keep<00:04:02.400> it<00:04:02.520> on<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.730> top<00:04:02.880> of

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
still steeping I keep it on the top of

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.300 
still steeping I keep it on the top of
my<00:04:03.150> stove<00:04:03.450> but<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.440> be<00:04:04.560> very<00:04:04.590> honest<00:04:05.040> with<00:04:05.160> you

my stove but to be very honest with you
I<00:04:05.340> think<00:04:05.460> these<00:04:05.760> beans<00:04:06.000> are<00:04:06.210> spent<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.690> I

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
I think these beans are spent and I

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.170 
I think these beans are spent and I
think<00:04:06.960> I<00:04:07.080> need<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.910> throw<00:04:08.910> them<00:04:09.030> in<00:04:09.090> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
think I need to throw them in the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.699 
think I need to throw them in the
compost<00:04:09.390> and<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:09.959> some<00:04:10.140> new<00:04:10.260> beans

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
compost and get some new beans

compost and get some new beans

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
is old I mean I did this over a year ago

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.909 
is old I mean I did this over a year ago
as<00:04:46.169> an<00:04:46.290> experiment<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.850> it<00:04:51.030> will<00:04:51.180> work<00:04:51.419> you

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
as an experiment and it will work you

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.219 
as an experiment and it will work you
can<00:04:52.919> see<00:04:53.250> these<00:04:53.910> lemon<00:04:54.300> peels<00:04:54.510> are<00:04:54.690> spent<00:04:54.990> and

can see these lemon peels are spent and

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.340 
can see these lemon peels are spent and
it<00:04:55.500> really<00:04:55.740> needs<00:04:55.950> to<00:04:56.130> be<00:04:56.510> strained<00:04:57.510> otherwise

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
it really needs to be strained otherwise

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.740 
it really needs to be strained otherwise
it's<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.800> become<00:04:58.950> bitter<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.240> accurate

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
it's going to become bitter and accurate

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.600 
it's going to become bitter and accurate
and<00:05:00.900> we<00:05:01.020> don't<00:05:01.169> want<00:05:01.350> that<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:04.310> is<00:05:05.310> what<00:05:05.580> I

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
and we don't want that this is what I

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.969 
and we don't want that this is what I
call<00:05:05.910> my<00:05:05.940> total<00:05:06.390> fail<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.870> wanted<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.710> see<00:05:07.860> what

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
call my total fail I wanted to see what

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.620 
call my total fail I wanted to see what
would<00:05:08.070> happen<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:08.729> try<00:05:08.940> to<00:05:08.970> make<00:05:09.150> almond

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
would happen if I try to make almond

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.630 
would happen if I try to make almond
extract<00:05:10.020> because<00:05:10.169> almond<00:05:10.740> extract<00:05:11.100> expensive

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
extract because almond extract expensive

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.219 
extract because almond extract expensive
too<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.150> thought<00:05:12.330> well<00:05:12.540> I<00:05:12.570> have<00:05:12.660> almonds

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
too and I thought well I have almonds

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.560 
too and I thought well I have almonds
and<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.410> have<00:05:13.620> liqueur<00:05:13.860> so<00:05:14.310> let's<00:05:15.240> give<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.450> a

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
and I have liqueur so let's give it a

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.100 
and I have liqueur so let's give it a
try<00:05:15.979> it<00:05:16.979> did<00:05:17.280> not<00:05:17.430> work<00:05:17.640> out<00:05:17.880> as<00:05:18.210> I<00:05:18.479> had<00:05:18.510> hoped

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
try it did not work out as I had hoped

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.640 
try it did not work out as I had hoped
um<00:05:20.360> this<00:05:21.360> just<00:05:21.630> smells<00:05:21.750> like<00:05:22.020> vodka

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
um this just smells like vodka

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.700 
um this just smells like vodka
it's<00:05:23.520> just<00:05:23.820> murky<00:05:24.240> vodka<00:05:24.900> and<00:05:25.140> it's<00:05:25.350> kind<00:05:25.590> of

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
it's just murky vodka and it's kind of

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.790 
it's just murky vodka and it's kind of
nasty<00:05:25.919> so<00:05:26.510> since<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.630> have<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.870> here<00:05:28.050> I'm<00:05:28.590> just

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
nasty so since I have you here I'm just

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.770 
nasty so since I have you here I'm just
gonna<00:05:28.919> dump<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.250> but<00:05:29.850> you<00:05:30.120> know<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.390> only<00:05:30.510> way

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
gonna dump it but you know the only way

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.510 
gonna dump it but you know the only way
we<00:05:30.930> learn<00:05:31.080> these<00:05:31.229> things<00:05:31.440> is<00:05:31.680> if<00:05:31.890> we<00:05:32.040> try<00:05:32.280> them

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
we learn these things is if we try them

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.500 
we learn these things is if we try them
and<00:05:32.790> it<00:05:33.720> really<00:05:33.990> doesn't<00:05:34.380> take<00:05:34.410> anything<00:05:34.919> and

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
and it really doesn't take anything and

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.890 
and it really doesn't take anything and
it's<00:05:36.510> a<00:05:36.630> lesson<00:05:36.840> learned<00:05:37.040> you<00:05:38.040> know<00:05:38.540> so<00:05:39.540> that

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
it's a lesson learned you know so that

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.249 
it's a lesson learned you know so that
is<00:05:40.890> how<00:05:41.040> we<00:05:41.160> make

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:42.259 
is how we make

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.489 
is how we make
mint<00:05:43.259> extract<00:05:44.360> your<00:05:45.360> extract<00:05:45.719> maybe<00:05:46.049> tinge

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:46.499 
mint extract your extract maybe tinge

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:48.199 
mint extract your extract maybe tinge
green<00:05:46.949> by<00:05:47.219> the<00:05:47.279> time<00:05:47.549> this<00:05:47.729> is<00:05:47.789> all<00:05:47.999> done

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:48.209 
green by the time this is all done

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:49.869 
green by the time this is all done
because<00:05:48.449> a<00:05:48.629> lot<00:05:48.839> of<00:05:48.869> that<00:05:48.989> chlorophyll<00:05:49.529> is

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
because a lot of that chlorophyll is

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.419 
because a lot of that chlorophyll is
going<00:05:50.879> to<00:05:50.939> leach<00:05:51.149> out<00:05:51.179> into<00:05:51.959> the<00:05:52.110> vodka<00:05:52.949> and

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:53.429 
going to leach out into the vodka and

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:55.129 
going to leach out into the vodka and
that's<00:05:53.610> okay<00:05:53.969> but<00:05:54.449> then<00:05:54.599> you'll<00:05:54.749> be<00:05:54.869> able<00:05:54.959> to

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
that's okay but then you'll be able to

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.350 
that's okay but then you'll be able to
easily<00:05:55.289> identify<00:05:55.529> it<00:05:56.129> if<00:05:56.399> you<00:05:56.639> once<00:05:57.239> you

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
easily identify it if you once you

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.549 
easily identify it if you once you
strain<00:05:57.689> this<00:05:57.899> you're<00:05:58.139> going<00:05:58.289> to<00:05:58.349> want<00:05:58.499> to

00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559 
strain this you're going to want to

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:01.789 
strain this you're going to want to
label<00:05:58.799> it<00:05:59.069> well<00:05:59.429> and<00:05:59.849> put<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:00.449> date<00:06:00.719> on<00:06:00.959> it<00:06:00.989> um

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:01.799 
label it well and put the date on it um

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:03.559 
label it well and put the date on it um
it's<00:06:02.099> not<00:06:02.369> going<00:06:02.519> to<00:06:02.579> expire<00:06:02.969> because<00:06:03.269> this
