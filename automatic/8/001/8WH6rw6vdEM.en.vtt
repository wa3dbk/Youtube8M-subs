 They are also older and touches them 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.210
 no and last year they tell me that he was 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.649
 very close to winning administration but 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.300
 there was only economy like we are 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.920
 prepared for this year we have not only 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.780
 passed to other years the truth has been 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.820
 until the last day well fought and the year 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.140
 past you take it economy but this 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.570
 year is fixed which administration earns or 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.940
 be there is no other possibility simply 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.790
 out of whoever wins who loses one 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.410
