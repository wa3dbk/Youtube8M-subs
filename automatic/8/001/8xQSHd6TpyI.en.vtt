is completely still while you're doing

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279 
is completely still while you're doing
this<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.779> going<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> set<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
this and I'm just going to set the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.710 
this and I'm just going to set the
self-timer<00:00:25.859> 22<00:00:26.369> seconds<00:00:26.849> just<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:27.420> when<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
self-timer 22 seconds just so when the

camera takes the pictures it's
completely<00:00:29.939> still<00:00:30.920> so<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.130> see<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.430> auto

some<00:00:35.730> cameras<00:00:36.270> actually<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.690> auto<00:00:36.930> HDR

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230

built<00:00:38.040> into<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> camera<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.660> pretty

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
built into the camera so that's pretty

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.319 
built into the camera so that's pretty
cool<00:00:40.280> alright<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.399> I'm<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.640> using<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.030> screen

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
cool alright so I'm not using a screen

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.020 
cool alright so I'm not using a screen

what you want to do you want to open up

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.720 
what you want to do you want to open up
Photoshop<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> file

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730

pop up then you click browse find the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.880 
pop up then you click browse find the
three<00:00:59.820> different<00:01:00.090> exposure<00:01:01.020> pictures<00:01:01.350> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
three different exposure pictures that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.960 
three different exposure pictures that
you<00:01:02.010> took<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:03.329> merge<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.870> HDR<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> takes

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
you took to merge to HDR and it takes

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.140 
you took to merge to HDR and it takes
about<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.240> minute<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.570> load<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.790> now<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.060> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
about a minute to load and now as you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.990 
about a minute to load and now as you
can<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> very<00:01:10.409> nice<00:01:10.710> exposed<00:01:11.220> HDR

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
can see we have a very nice exposed HDR

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.780 
can see we have a very nice exposed HDR
image<00:01:12.439> now<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.220> took<00:01:14.460> three

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
image now you can see it took three

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.359 
image now you can see it took three
different<00:01:15.049> exposures<00:01:16.049> combine<00:01:17.040> them<00:01:17.220> all

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
different exposures combine them all

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
different exposures combine them all
into<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.939> nice<00:01:18.240> exposure<00:01:18.720> everything's

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
into one nice exposure everything's

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
into one nice exposure everything's
equally<00:01:19.590> exposed<00:01:19.950> nothing's<00:01:20.400> over<00:01:20.640> expose<00:01:20.939> or

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
equally exposed nothing's over expose or

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.510 
equally exposed nothing's over expose or
underexposed<00:01:21.680> you<00:01:22.680> can<00:01:22.799> also<00:01:22.950> mess<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
underexposed you can also mess with this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.570 
underexposed you can also mess with this
curves<00:01:23.880> adjustment<00:01:24.270> thingy<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:26.130> make<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.400> look

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
curves adjustment thingy to make it look

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
curves adjustment thingy to make it look
better<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.509> too<00:01:27.659> dark<00:01:27.960> or<00:01:28.049> too<00:01:28.110> light<00:01:28.229> just

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
better it's too dark or too light just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.399 
better it's too dark or too light just
make<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.220> like<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.659> click<00:01:30.659> OK<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.320> now

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
make it how you like it click OK and now

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.109 
make it how you like it click OK and now
we<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.979> mess<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> gamma<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
we can mess with the gamma on the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.450 
we can mess with the gamma on the
exposure<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.930> would<00:01:34.710> mess<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> exposure

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
exposure I would mess with the exposure

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.420 
exposure I would mess with the exposure
too<00:01:35.790> much<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.990> uh<00:01:37.020> if<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.860> mess<00:01:38.040> around<00:01:38.070> with

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
too much but uh if you mess around with

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.310 
too much but uh if you mess around with
the<00:01:38.520> gamma<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.540> looks<00:01:39.689> pretty<00:01:39.840> cool<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.200> can

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the gamma it looks pretty cool you can

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
the gamma it looks pretty cool you can
get<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> nice<00:01:40.560> effect<00:01:40.740> out<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.610> uh<00:01:41.640> move

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
get a nice effect out of it so uh move

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.109 
get a nice effect out of it so uh move
it<00:01:42.720> up<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.020> down<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:44.670> know<00:01:44.790> move<00:01:45.000> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it up or down just you know move it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
it up or down just you know move it
anywhere<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.840> not<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.290> there's<00:01:46.470> no<00:01:46.619> rules
