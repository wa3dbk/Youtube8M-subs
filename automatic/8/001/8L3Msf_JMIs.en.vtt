00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the first thing I'm going to do is start

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
the first thing I'm going to do is start
with<00:01:34.140> probably<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.100> pantry<00:01:35.700> take<00:01:36.060> everything

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
with probably the pantry take everything

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.800 
with probably the pantry take everything
out<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:38.340> put<00:01:38.729> everything<00:01:38.939> back<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.240> when

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
out and then put everything back in when

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.719 
out and then put everything back in when
it<00:01:39.930> makes<00:01:40.079> sense<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.340> okay<00:01:41.369> so

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it makes sense so here we go okay so

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.289 
it makes sense so here we go okay so
here's<00:01:42.090> part<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.509> during<00:01:43.290> process<00:01:44.070> um<00:01:44.430> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
here's part of the during process um I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
here's part of the during process um I
started<00:01:46.049> organizing<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:46.920> forgot<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
started organizing and then forgot that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.200 
started organizing and then forgot that
I<00:01:47.700> should<00:01:48.060> probably<00:01:48.439> show<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:50.000> some<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
I should probably show you some of the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
I should probably show you some of the
process<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.140> these<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.799> all<00:01:52.890> things<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.369> need
