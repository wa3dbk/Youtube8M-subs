purchased<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.539> silicone<00:00:51.539> lubricant<00:00:52.170> now

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
purchased this silicone lubricant now

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.410 
purchased this silicone lubricant now
this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> wd-40<00:00:53.670> brand<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.239> were<00:00:54.300> other

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
this is wd-40 brand but there were other

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.439 
this is wd-40 brand but there were other
brands<00:00:55.190> what<00:00:56.190> I'm<00:00:56.309> gonna<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.180> coat<00:00:58.020> these

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
brands what I'm gonna do is coat these

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
brands what I'm gonna do is coat these
these<00:01:00.449> friction<00:01:00.899> pads<00:01:01.109> with<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.710> silicone

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
these friction pads with this silicone

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
these friction pads with this silicone
lubricant<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:03.930> should<00:01:04.589> probably

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
lubricant so I know I should probably

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.219 
lubricant so I know I should probably
take<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.220> off<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.900> want<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.080> risk

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
take them off but I don't want to risk

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.270 
take them off but I don't want to risk
damaging<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.189> I'm<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:13.100> it's<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
damaging it so I'm gonna it's going to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.760 
damaging it so I'm gonna it's going to
kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.520> let<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.700> soak<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.770> I'll

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
kind of let it soak in there see I'll

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.120 
kind of let it soak in there see I'll
zoom<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:17.729> more

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
being the lifesaver for this for these

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.880 
being the lifesaver for this for these
friction<00:01:42.260> pads<00:01:42.470> on<00:01:42.740> this<00:01:43.240> Proform<00:01:44.240> brand<00:01:44.510> bike

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
friction pads on this Proform brand bike

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.800 
friction pads on this Proform brand bike
like<00:01:45.890> I<00:01:46.010> said<00:01:46.220> this<00:01:46.370> bike<00:01:46.610> and<00:01:46.940> actually<00:01:47.690> my

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
like I said this bike and actually my

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.310 
like I said this bike and actually my
previous<00:01:48.230> model<00:01:48.620> this<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.920> a<00:01:48.950> 300s<00:01:49.580> px<00:01:50.320> but

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
previous model this is a 300s px but

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.740 
previous model this is a 300s px but
both<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.530> them<00:01:51.980> were<00:01:52.520> great<00:01:52.880> exercise<00:01:53.420> bikes

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
both of them were great exercise bikes

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.460 
both of them were great exercise bikes
with<00:01:54.650> this<00:01:54.830> one<00:01:55.100> blatant<00:01:55.640> flaw<00:01:55.940> so<00:01:56.360> I'm<00:01:56.990> hoping

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
with this one blatant flaw so I'm hoping

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.410 
with this one blatant flaw so I'm hoping
that<00:01:57.530> has<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.280> result<00:01:58.580> of<00:01:58.790> putting<00:01:58.910> silicone

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
that has a result of putting silicone

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.880 
that has a result of putting silicone
spray<00:01:59.600> on<00:01:59.780> here<00:01:59.960> that<00:01:59.990> I<00:02:00.140> can<00:02:00.320> prolong<00:02:00.650> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
spray on here that I can prolong the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.370 
spray on here that I can prolong the
life<00:02:01.400> of<00:02:01.760> my<00:02:02.860> of<00:02:03.860> my<00:02:04.040> friction<00:02:04.610> pads<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:05.380> again

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
life of my of my friction pads so again

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.900 
life of my of my friction pads so again

actually not funny because it's it's
wasteful<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.820> price<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.510> bike<00:02:27.100> if

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
wasteful but the price of this bike if

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.470 
wasteful but the price of this bike if
one<00:02:28.370> was<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.580> compare<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.269> gym

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
one was to compare it to the gym

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.960 
one was to compare it to the gym
membership<00:02:30.190> even<00:02:31.190> with<00:02:31.310> having<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.700> replace

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
membership even with having to replace

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.300 
membership even with having to replace
this<00:02:32.390> bike<00:02:32.660> because<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.769> pads<00:02:33.980> are<00:02:34.190> so

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
this bike because the pads are so

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.280 
this bike because the pads are so
expensive<00:02:34.640> every<00:02:35.570> few<00:02:35.750> years<00:02:35.870> or<00:02:35.989> so<00:02:36.200> it

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
expensive every few years or so it

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.810 
expensive every few years or so it
actually<00:02:36.620> still<00:02:36.800> comes<00:02:37.010> out<00:02:37.130> less<00:02:37.340> expensive

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
actually still comes out less expensive

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.449 
actually still comes out less expensive
than<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.000> gym<00:02:38.209> membership<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.040> hate<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.370> be

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
than the gym membership but I hate to be

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.170 
than the gym membership but I hate to be
a<00:02:40.489> wasteful<00:02:40.910> person<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.600> and<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.650> hope<00:02:42.830> that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
a wasteful person and and I hope that

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.080 
a wasteful person and and I hope that
you<00:02:44.180> know<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:44.480> silicon<00:02:45.470> spray<00:02:46.090> technique

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
you know this silicon spray technique

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.610 
you know this silicon spray technique
will<00:02:47.300> help<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.600> prolong<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.080> life<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.410> pad

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
will help to prolong the life of the pad

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.920 
will help to prolong the life of the pad
so<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.250> shared<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.150> video<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.570> others
