break<00:01:35.310> different<00:01:35.670> ways<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.240> won't<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.720> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
break different ways you won't see the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
break different ways you won't see the
same<00:01:37.020> scripted<00:01:37.680> moves<00:01:37.920> break<00:01:38.310> through<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
same scripted moves break through the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.060 
same scripted moves break through the
tables<00:01:38.850> every<00:01:39.060> single<00:01:39.299> time<00:01:39.619> we<00:01:40.619> really<00:01:40.890> want

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
tables every single time we really want

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.160 
tables every single time we really want
to<00:01:41.130> recreate<00:01:41.579> those<00:01:41.820> crazy<00:01:42.299> TLC<00:01:42.750> matches<00:01:42.960> you

a lot of fun we think fans gonna be able

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
a lot of fun we think fans gonna be able
to<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.110> create<00:01:55.380> some<00:01:55.530> crazy<00:01:55.920> moments<00:01:56.399> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
to you know create some crazy moments of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.520 
to you know create some crazy moments of
their<00:01:56.549> own<00:01:56.670> on<00:01:56.969> okay<00:01:57.750> all<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:58.140> let's<00:01:58.380> talk

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
their own on okay all right let's talk

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.870 
their own on okay all right let's talk
about<00:01:58.590> exactly<00:01:59.130> how<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> work

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
about exactly how this is going to work

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
about exactly how this is going to work
because<00:02:00.119> what<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:01.079> does<00:02:01.200> dynamic<00:02:01.649> physics

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
because what what does dynamic physics

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.649 
because what what does dynamic physics
do<00:02:02.189> for<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.430> objects<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:03.060> didn't<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.479> in

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
do for the objects that it didn't do in

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
do for the objects that it didn't do in
years<00:02:03.869> past<00:02:03.930> yeah<00:02:04.590> what's<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> happen

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
years past yeah what's going to happen

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.280 
years past yeah what's going to happen
is<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.670> each<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.180> know<00:02:06.270> each<00:02:06.450> object<00:02:06.719> itself

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
is that each you know each object itself

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.589 
is that each you know each object itself
is<00:02:07.560> going<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.099> moving<00:02:08.759> with<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.179> physics

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
is going to be moving with this physics

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.999 
is going to be moving with this physics
system<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.170> every<00:02:10.410> single<00:02:10.619> time<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.800> interact

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
system so every single time you interact

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.380 
system so every single time you interact
with<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.270> going<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.540> dynamic<00:02:13.080> because

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
with it it's going to be dynamic because

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.910 
with it it's going to be dynamic because
I<00:02:13.420> can<00:02:13.540> be<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> scripted<00:02:14.170> events<00:02:14.290> when<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.710> pick

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I can be a scripted events when I pick

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.950 
I can be a scripted events when I pick
up<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.160> ladder<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:16.060> throw<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.450> at<00:02:16.569> someone<00:02:16.780> is

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
up a ladder and I throw it at someone is

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.199 
up a ladder and I throw it at someone is
going<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.170> throw<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.130> normal<00:02:18.610> platter

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
going to throw like a normal platter

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.820 
going to throw like a normal platter
with<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> throne<00:02:19.870> and<00:02:20.350> it's<00:02:20.530> going<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.709> hit

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
with the throne and it's going to hit

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.900 
with the throne and it's going to hit
your<00:02:20.980> opponent<00:02:21.069> it's<00:02:21.459> going<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.640> go<00:02:21.760> flying

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
your opponent it's going to go flying

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.270 
your opponent it's going to go flying
down<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.540> also<00:02:23.410> when<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.590> break<00:02:23.800> a<00:02:23.830> table

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
down and also when you break a table

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.400 
down and also when you break a table
sometimes<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.360> doesn't<00:02:25.780> always<00:02:25.840> break<00:02:26.200> right

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
sometimes it doesn't always break right

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.809 
sometimes it doesn't always break right
in<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.560> middle<00:02:26.709> right<00:02:26.860> sometimes<00:02:27.580> it<00:02:27.700> breaks

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
in the middle right sometimes it breaks

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.430 
in the middle right sometimes it breaks
off<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.209> side<00:02:28.450> sometimes<00:02:29.080> doesn't<00:02:29.319> even

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
off to the side sometimes doesn't even

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.290 
off to the side sometimes doesn't even
break<00:02:29.590> maybe<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.010> legs<00:02:30.220> get<00:02:30.490> swept<00:02:30.850> up<00:02:31.030> from

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
break maybe the legs get swept up from

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.690 
break maybe the legs get swept up from
under<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.020> collapses<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:33.340> really<00:02:33.550> want

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
under it and it collapses we really want

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.880 
under it and it collapses we really want
to<00:02:33.760> bring<00:02:33.910> out<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.060> those<00:02:34.450> moments<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.680> that's

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
to bring out all those moments so that's

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.810 
to bring out all those moments so that's
what<00:02:36.010> some<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.310> things<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.520> can<00:02:36.640> be<00:02:36.700> able

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
what some of the things you can be able

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.550 
what some of the things you can be able
to<00:02:36.880> see<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.300> build<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.990> folk<00:02:38.170> you'll<00:02:38.410> two

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
to see you build a folk you'll two

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.810 
to see you build a folk you'll two
ladders<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.040> ladders<00:02:39.220> will<00:02:39.340> actually<00:02:39.580> bend

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
ladders and ladders will actually bend

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.210 
ladders and ladders will actually bend
and<00:02:40.030> break<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:41.440> you'd<00:02:41.650> be<00:02:41.739> able<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.920> stack

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
and break and you'd be able to stack

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.479 
and break and you'd be able to stack
ladders<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:43.480> tables<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.080> touhy<00:02:44.230> area<00:02:44.770> of<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
ladders and tables on touhy area of the

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.010 
ladders and tables on touhy area of the
the<00:02:45.970> rain<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.209> if<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.630> want<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.810> stack<00:02:46.989> it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
the rain so if you want to stack it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.350 
the rain so if you want to stack it
against<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.470> barricade<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.520> ring<00:02:48.760> ropes<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
against the barricade the ring ropes the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.910 
against the barricade the ring ropes the
corner<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.230> want<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> stack<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.620> ladder

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
corner you want to stack a ladder

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.290 
corner you want to stack a ladder
against<00:02:51.220> another<00:02:51.459> ladder<00:02:51.700> standing<00:02:52.180> up

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
against another ladder standing up

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300 
against another ladder standing up
they'll<00:02:52.750> do<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.230> crazy<00:02:53.530> stuff<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:54.010> this

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
they'll do all that crazy stuff in this

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.460 
they'll do all that crazy stuff in this
match<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.570> superstars<00:02:56.050> will<00:02:56.260> sort

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
match and and the superstars will sort

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.650 
match and and the superstars will sort
of<00:02:56.560> react<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.040> what's<00:02:57.280> happening<00:02:57.540> however<00:02:58.540> you

very easy to put through the tables and

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.310 
very easy to put through the tables and
that<00:04:16.120> new<00:04:16.239> control<00:04:16.720> is<00:04:16.840> really<00:04:17.019> gonna<00:04:17.109> be<00:04:17.200> able

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
that new control is really gonna be able

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.930 
that new control is really gonna be able
to<00:04:17.470> make<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:17.890> happen<00:04:18.190> when<00:04:18.609> something

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
to make that happen when something

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.250 
to make that happen when something
breaks<00:04:19.030> apart<00:04:19.390> like<00:04:19.539> a<00:04:19.600> ladder<00:04:19.810> or<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:20.079> table

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
breaks apart like a ladder or a table

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.900 
breaks apart like a ladder or a table
the<00:04:20.500> pieces<00:04:20.829> stay<00:04:20.979> in<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.190> ring<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.609> pieces

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
the pieces stay in the ring the pieces

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.740 
the pieces stay in the ring the pieces
are<00:04:21.970> gonna<00:04:22.030> stay<00:04:22.210> in<00:04:22.240> there<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.570> little

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
are gonna stay in there for a little

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.029 
are gonna stay in there for a little
while<00:04:22.870> we<00:04:23.349> want<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:23.620> to<00:04:23.680> be<00:04:23.740> able<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.919> have<00:04:23.979> a

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
while we want you to be able to have a

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.350 
while we want you to be able to have a
lot<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.370> tables<00:04:24.729> a<00:04:24.910> lot

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
lot of tables a lot

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.820 
lot of tables a lot
so<00:04:25.659> you<00:04:26.050> know<00:04:26.139> eventually<00:04:26.379> we<00:04:26.560> going<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.740> have

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
so you know eventually we going to have

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.890 
so you know eventually we going to have
them<00:04:26.919> fade<00:04:27.129> out<00:04:27.370> but<00:04:28.180> we<00:04:28.270> like<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.569> effect<00:04:28.810> of

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
them fade out but we like the effect of

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.350 
them fade out but we like the effect of
having<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.199> pieces<00:04:29.530> in<00:04:29.680> there<00:04:29.909> seeing<00:04:30.909> you

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
having the pieces in there seeing you

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.879 
having the pieces in there seeing you
check<00:04:31.629> out<00:04:31.659> all<00:04:31.840> your<00:04:31.960> carnage<00:04:32.409> out<00:04:32.560> there<00:04:32.740> you

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
check out all your carnage out there you

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.189 
check out all your carnage out there you
can<00:04:32.979> see<00:04:33.009> no<00:04:33.280> 5<00:04:33.729> broken<00:04:33.969> tables<00:04:34.569> and<00:04:34.870> all<00:04:35.020> that

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
can see no 5 broken tables and all that

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.510 
can see no 5 broken tables and all that
we<00:04:35.349> want<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.620> be<00:04:35.710> able<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.919> see<00:04:36.069> that<00:04:36.219> but

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
we want you to be able to see that but

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.219 
we want you to be able to see that but
yeah<00:04:37.240> in<00:04:37.419> order<00:04:37.629> for<00:04:37.719> you<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:37.960> be<00:04:38.020> able<00:04:38.080> to

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
yeah in order for you to be able to

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:39.839 
yeah in order for you to be able to
bring<00:04:38.379> out<00:04:38.530> 20<00:04:38.919> tables<00:04:39.310> whatever<00:04:39.580> it<00:04:39.639> is<00:04:39.699> won't

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
bring out 20 tables whatever it is won't

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.369 
bring out 20 tables whatever it is won't
have<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.120> eventually<00:04:40.300> fade<00:04:40.629> some<00:04:40.870> out<00:04:41.020> right

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
have to eventually fade some out right

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.839 
have to eventually fade some out right
for<00:04:41.889> performance<00:04:42.400> otherwise<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.789> have

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
for performance otherwise you have

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.320 
for performance otherwise you have
stacks<00:04:43.210> of<00:04:43.479> wood<00:04:43.930> all<00:04:44.080> over<00:04:44.319> the<00:04:44.409> place<00:04:45.330> well

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
stacks of wood all over the place well

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.999 
stacks of wood all over the place well
let<00:04:46.419> me<00:04:46.509> ask<00:04:46.629> you<00:04:46.719> then<00:04:46.930> about<00:04:47.169> the<00:04:47.740> chairs

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
let me ask you then about the chairs

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.469 
let me ask you then about the chairs
we've<00:04:48.400> talked<00:04:48.639> about<00:04:48.759> tables<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.240> ladders

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
we've talked about tables and ladders

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.689 
we've talked about tables and ladders
but<00:04:49.629> chairs<00:04:49.900> give<00:04:50.289> some<00:04:50.500> specific<00:04:50.740> new<00:04:51.430> moves

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
but chairs give some specific new moves

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.010 
but chairs give some specific new moves
for<00:04:51.909> the<00:04:51.939> chairs<00:04:52.210> right<00:04:52.479> that's<00:04:52.659> right<00:04:52.870> yeah

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
for the chairs right that's right yeah

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.600 
for the chairs right that's right yeah
Cheers<00:04:53.349> we've<00:04:53.560> also<00:04:53.740> spent<00:04:54.099> some<00:04:54.129> time<00:04:54.250> with

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
Cheers we've also spent some time with

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.709 
Cheers we've also spent some time with
that<00:04:54.789> they're<00:04:54.909> also<00:04:55.060> have<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.389> physics

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:55.719 
that they're also have the physics

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.330 
that they're also have the physics
working<00:04:55.930> on<00:04:56.110> them<00:04:56.229> as<00:04:56.349> well<00:04:56.500> but<00:04:56.680> we<00:04:57.099> allow<00:04:57.280> you

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
working on them as well but we allow you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.309 
working on them as well but we allow you
to<00:04:57.639> throw<00:04:57.909> the<00:04:57.939> chairs<00:04:58.330> as<00:04:58.539> well<00:04:58.750> now<00:04:58.990> so<00:04:59.259> you

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
to throw the chairs as well now so you

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.899 
to throw the chairs as well now so you
can<00:04:59.529> go<00:04:59.650> ahead<00:04:59.710> and<00:04:59.830> pick<00:05:00.250> up<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.430> chair<00:05:00.639> throw

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
can go ahead and pick up a chair throw

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.820 
can go ahead and pick up a chair throw
right<00:05:01.120> at<00:05:01.210> your<00:05:01.300> opponents<00:05:01.840> do<00:05:02.469> a<00:05:02.500> lot<00:05:02.650> of<00:05:02.680> new

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
right at your opponents do a lot of new

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.709 
right at your opponents do a lot of new
cool<00:05:03.069> moves<00:05:03.310> that<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.789> and<00:05:04.029> everyone's<00:05:04.569> gonna

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 
cool moves that it and everyone's gonna

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.570 
cool moves that it and everyone's gonna
be<00:05:04.810> able<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.050> check<00:05:05.199> out<00:05:05.349> III<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.009> it<00:05:06.279> sounds

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
be able to check out III and it sounds

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.189 
be able to check out III and it sounds
like<00:05:06.610> this<00:05:06.699> physics<00:05:07.240> system<00:05:07.539> will<00:05:07.870> apply

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
like this physics system will apply

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.869 
like this physics system will apply
itself<00:05:08.650> in<00:05:08.770> other<00:05:08.979> types<00:05:09.219> of<00:05:09.340> matches<00:05:09.699> right

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
itself in other types of matches right

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.610 
itself in other types of matches right
that's<00:05:10.120> where<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.270> keep<00:05:10.479> saying<00:05:10.659> TLC<00:05:11.259> because

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
that's where I keep saying TLC because

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:12.869 
that's where I keep saying TLC because
that's<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:11.889> match<00:05:12.099> we're<00:05:12.279> showing<00:05:12.490> off<00:05:12.729> but

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
that's the match we're showing off but

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.640 
that's the match we're showing off but
really<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.270> dynamic<00:05:13.900> physics<00:05:14.229> is<00:05:14.349> working

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
really the dynamic physics is working

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.379 
really the dynamic physics is working
through<00:05:14.800> any<00:05:15.310> weapon<00:05:15.789> but<00:05:16.120> there's<00:05:16.300> a

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
through any weapon but there's a

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:18.719 
through any weapon but there's a
sledgehammer<00:05:16.689> the<00:05:17.050> steel<00:05:17.409> steps<00:05:17.740> any<00:05:18.250> object

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
sledgehammer the steel steps any object

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.459 
sledgehammer the steel steps any object
that<00:05:18.759> we<00:05:18.909> have<00:05:19.120> in<00:05:19.389> the<00:05:19.569> ring<00:05:19.779> it's<00:05:20.289> gonna<00:05:20.379> be

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:20.469 
that we have in the ring it's gonna be

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:22.019 
that we have in the ring it's gonna be
using<00:05:20.680> these<00:05:20.830> physics<00:05:21.279> you<00:05:21.370> can<00:05:21.550> do<00:05:21.639> a<00:05:21.669> lot<00:05:21.909> of

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
using these physics you can do a lot of

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:23.790 
using these physics you can do a lot of
different<00:05:22.090> things<00:05:22.330> with<00:05:22.659> them<00:05:22.810> very<00:05:23.319> nice<00:05:23.500> and

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
different things with them very nice and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.369 
different things with them very nice and
of<00:05:24.039> course<00:05:24.330> we<00:05:25.330> have<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.509> match<00:05:25.750> type<00:05:26.080> but<00:05:26.319> we

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:26.379 
of course we have the match type but we

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:28.290 
of course we have the match type but we
should<00:05:26.620> also<00:05:26.740> talk<00:05:26.949> about<00:05:27.009> the<00:05:27.250> guys<00:05:27.520> the

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
should also talk about the guys the

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.969 
should also talk about the guys the
wrestlers<00:05:28.659> that<00:05:28.719> are<00:05:28.900> in<00:05:29.020> this<00:05:29.229> in<00:05:29.560> this<00:05:29.740> demo

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
wrestlers that are in this in this demo

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:31.619 
wrestlers that are in this in this demo
who<00:05:30.159> would<00:05:30.550> be<00:05:30.759> playing<00:05:31.060> at<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.330> yeah<00:05:31.509> we're

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:31.629 
who would be playing at it yeah we're

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:33.570 
who would be playing at it yeah we're
gonna<00:05:31.719> pre<00:05:31.930> bring<00:05:32.680> out<00:05:32.770> four<00:05:33.009> guys<00:05:33.190> for<00:05:33.460> this

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
gonna pre bring out four guys for this
