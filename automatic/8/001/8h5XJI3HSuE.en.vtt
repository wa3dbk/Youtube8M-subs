00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
1600 megahertz ddr3 memory so let's get

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.750 
1600 megahertz ddr3 memory so let's get
started<00:00:27.289> first<00:00:28.289> up<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.740> cinebench<00:00:29.400> which

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
started first up we have cinebench which

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.190 
started first up we have cinebench which
will<00:00:30.000> run<00:00:30.929> some<00:00:31.230> opengl<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.239> cpu<00:00:33.239> tests<00:00:33.780> so

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
will run some opengl and cpu tests so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.260 
will run some opengl and cpu tests so
let's<00:00:34.710> run<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.070> opengl<00:00:35.730> one<00:00:35.910> first<00:00:38.270> it's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
let's run the opengl one first it's

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.369 
let's run the opengl one first it's
preparing<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> as<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.870> intel<00:00:46.170> core

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
preparing so as you can see intel core

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.430 
preparing so as you can see intel core
i7<00:00:46.469> two<00:00:47.399> cores<00:00:47.760> for<00:00:48.059> threads<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:48.899> thirds

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440

64-bit intel HD graphics 4000 tons you
so<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.370> just<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:58.430> just<00:00:59.430> render

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
so now it's just going to just render

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.780 
so now it's just going to just render
some<00:01:00.359> images<00:01:00.719> etc<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:02.660> test<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> out<00:01:04.790> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
some images etc and just test it out so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.780 
some images etc and just test it out so
the<00:01:06.030> opengl<00:01:06.930> test<00:01:07.409> results<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.920> come<00:01:08.070> in<00:01:08.610> um

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the opengl test results have come in um

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
the opengl test results have come in um
it<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.950> seventeen<00:01:10.950> point<00:01:11.430> 79<00:01:12.229> FPS<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.500> that's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
it is seventeen point 79 FPS and that's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.039 
it is seventeen point 79 FPS and that's
not<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.750> actually

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
not really that good and I have actually

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.249 
not really that good and I have actually
ran<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.860> run<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.340> test<00:01:17.580> before<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:19.049> did

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
ran and run this test before and I did

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.789 
ran and run this test before and I did
get<00:01:19.470> much<00:01:19.830> better<00:01:20.070> results<00:01:20.240> but<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.540> know

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
get much better results but you know

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.950 
get much better results but you know
it's<00:01:22.799> fine<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.909> let's<00:01:24.420> run<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.900> CPU<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it's fine so let's run the CPU so this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
it's fine so let's run the CPU so this
will<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.350> render<00:01:28.979> some<00:01:29.189> images<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.210> will

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
will just render some images and it will

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.940 
will just render some images and it will
see<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.840> long<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.320> takes<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.740> render<00:01:32.189> them<00:01:33.950> so

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
see how long it takes to render them so

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
see how long it takes to render them so
the<00:01:35.220> vendor<00:01:35.640> test<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> CPU<00:01:37.170> test<00:01:37.470> has

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
the vendor test or the CPU test has

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.910 
the vendor test or the CPU test has
completed<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:39.060> got<00:01:39.270> two<00:01:39.570> points73<00:01:40.259> points

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
completed and we got two points73 points

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.249 
completed and we got two points73 points
and<00:01:41.250> as<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.939> see<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.420> comparisons

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and as you can see in the comparisons

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.310 
and as you can see in the comparisons
and<00:01:44.100> where<00:01:44.759> shows<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> other<00:01:45.360> systems<00:01:45.869> it's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and where shows the other systems it's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
and where shows the other systems it's
not<00:01:46.560> really<00:01:46.890> back<00:01:47.220> into<00:01:47.490> score<00:01:47.759> but<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.600> will

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
not really back into score but I will

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.080 
not really back into score but I will
say<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.860> done<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.189> test<00:01:50.520> before<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
say and I have done this test before and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.399 
say and I have done this test before and
I<00:01:51.329> have<00:01:51.509> gotten<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.079> better<00:01:52.380> score<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.750> next

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I have gotten a better score so up next

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.929 
I have gotten a better score so up next
we<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:56.689> black<00:01:57.689> magic<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.439> will<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.219> disk

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
we have black magic it will it's a disk

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.690 
we have black magic it will it's a disk
speed<00:02:00.360> test<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.979> it'll<00:02:01.979> tell<00:02:02.130> us<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.460> read

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
speed test and it'll tell us the read

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.230 
speed test and it'll tell us the read
and<00:02:02.969> write<00:02:03.479> speeds<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.070> SSD<00:02:05.640> which<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.119> a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and write speeds for the SSD which is a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.070 
and write speeds for the SSD which is a
512<00:02:06.990> gigabyte<00:02:07.560> flash<00:02:08.550> storage<00:02:09.080> all-flash

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
512 gigabyte flash storage all-flash

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.850 
512 gigabyte flash storage all-flash
storage

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.950 

so<00:02:13.860> now<00:02:14.160> i'm<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.580> start<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.240> disk<00:02:15.600> speed

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so now i'm going to start the disk speed

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.840 
so now i'm going to start the disk speed
test<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.960> time<00:02:22.140> we<00:02:22.320> got<00:02:22.440> about

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
test so for right this time we got about

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.620 
test so for right this time we got about
400<00:02:23.930> around<00:02:25.670> 404<00:02:26.670> read<00:02:26.910> we<00:02:27.720> got<00:02:28.070> 447<00:02:29.070> or<00:02:29.630> 448

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
400 around 404 read we got 447 or 448

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.680 
400 around 404 read we got 447 or 448
it's<00:02:31.110> around<00:02:31.320> 450<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:33.090> let's<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.450> run<00:02:33.570> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
it's around 450 so let's just run that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.160 
it's around 450 so let's just run that
one<00:02:33.870> more<00:02:34.050> time<00:02:34.460> see<00:02:35.460> again<00:02:35.940> around<00:02:36.240> 400<00:02:36.990> for

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
one more time see again around 400 for

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:48.770 
one more time see again around 400 for
right<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:40.670> around<00:02:41.670> 450<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:42.990> read<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:48.030> now

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
right and around 450 for read so now

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.890 
right and around 450 for read so now
let's<00:02:49.380> move<00:02:49.560> on<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.220> last<00:02:50.340> test<00:02:51.090> which

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
let's move on to the last test which

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.880 
let's move on to the last test which
will<00:02:52.170> be<00:02:52.430> Nova<00:02:53.430> bench<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.840> Nova<00:02:55.710> bench

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
will be Nova bench so Nova bench

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.760 
will be Nova bench so Nova bench
basically<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.700> does<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.330> overall<00:02:58.290> speed<00:02:58.500> test

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
basically just does a overall speed test

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.160 
basically just does a overall speed test
of<00:02:59.010> everything<00:02:59.550> it<00:03:00.150> did<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> speed<00:03:00.750> test<00:03:00.900> on<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
of everything it did a speed test on the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.310 
of everything it did a speed test on the
ramp<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.710> did<00:03:01.890> some<00:03:02.340> cpu<00:03:02.970> tests<00:03:03.420> graphic<00:03:03.870> tests

overall<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.470> very<00:04:07.500> good<00:04:07.709> machine<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> you

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
overall it's a very good machine and you

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.430 
overall it's a very good machine and you
know<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.120> Nova<00:04:09.390> bench<00:04:09.600> score<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.190> 7-7<00:04:11.190> 11<00:04:12.440> 711

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
know the Nova bench score is 7-7 11 711

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.250 
know the Nova bench score is 7-7 11 711
so<00:04:13.709> um<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.550> know<00:04:14.670> it's<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.570> fine<00:04:15.810> score<00:04:16.140> it's

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
so um you know it's a fine score it's

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.520 
so um you know it's a fine score it's
not<00:04:16.410> it's<00:04:16.680> not<00:04:16.770> the<00:04:17.010> best<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:17.580> you<00:04:17.609> know<00:04:18.060> um

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
not it's not the best and you know um

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.080 
not it's not the best and you know um
there<00:04:19.530> there<00:04:19.739> are<00:04:19.770> variables<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.729> I<00:04:20.910> have<00:04:21.030> a

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
there there are variables like I have a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.590 
there there are variables like I have a
couple<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.450> other<00:04:21.540> programs<00:04:21.870> running

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
couple of other programs running

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.390 
couple of other programs running
so<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.200> not<00:04:23.350> really<00:04:23.410> the<00:04:23.680> best<00:04:24.100> and<00:04:24.340> most

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
so it's not really the best and most

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.930 
so it's not really the best and most
accurate<00:04:24.970> scores<00:04:25.270> but<00:04:25.810> you<00:04:26.020> know<00:04:26.430> it'll<00:04:27.430> get

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
accurate scores but you know it'll get

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.360 
accurate scores but you know it'll get
the<00:04:28.060> job<00:04:28.090> done<00:04:28.270> so<00:04:29.230> thanks<00:04:29.710> for<00:04:29.740> watching<00:04:30.160> and
