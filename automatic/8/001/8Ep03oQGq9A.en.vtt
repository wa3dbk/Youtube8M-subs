00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
talking about but we're actually

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.660 
talking about but we're actually
standing<00:03:31.120> on<00:03:31.420> stilts<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.320> when<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.400> were<00:03:33.519> at

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
standing on stilts and when we were at

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.270 
standing on stilts and when we were at
our<00:03:33.700> old<00:03:34.180> location<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:35.620> room<00:03:35.920> was<00:03:36.100> actually

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
our old location this room was actually

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.210 
our old location this room was actually
nestled<00:03:37.120> in<00:03:37.269> amongst<00:03:37.630> big<00:03:37.900> avocado<00:03:38.620> trees<00:03:38.950> and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
so you actually felt like you're kind of

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.050 
so you actually felt like you're kind of
in<00:03:41.049> a<00:03:41.140> treehouse<00:03:41.410> in<00:03:41.830> this<00:03:41.980> room<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.910> what

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
makes it kind of unique is this beam

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.430 
makes it kind of unique is this beam
right<00:03:44.620> above<00:03:45.160> our<00:03:45.370> head<00:03:45.640> Syria<00:03:46.090> is<00:03:46.600> actually<00:03:47.290> a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
right above our head Syria is actually a

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.460 
right above our head Syria is actually a
branch<00:03:47.950> of<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:49.000> tree<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.540> was<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.320> old

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470

eucalyptus burl and these came to us cut
about<00:06:00.650> this<00:06:00.860> thickness<00:06:01.310> and<00:06:01.520> stacked<00:06:01.940> just

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
about this thickness and stacked just

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.510 
about this thickness and stacked just
the<00:06:02.450> way<00:06:02.570> they<00:06:02.720> were<00:06:02.780> cut<00:06:03.169> from<00:06:03.380> from<00:06:03.770> a<00:06:03.889> burl<00:06:04.100> a

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
the way they were cut from from a burl a

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.149 
the way they were cut from from a burl a
burl<00:06:05.000> is<00:06:05.090> usually<00:06:05.690> a<00:06:05.720> big

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
burl is usually a big

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.519 
burl is usually a big
kind<00:06:07.489> of<00:06:07.550> growth<00:06:07.909> that<00:06:07.939> this<00:06:08.419> is<00:06:08.869> usually<00:06:09.349> down

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:09.529 
kind of growth that this is usually down

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.949 
kind of growth that this is usually down
towards<00:06:09.949> this<00:06:10.159> a<00:06:10.399> base<00:06:10.759> of<00:06:10.789> a<00:06:11.119> certain<00:06:11.629> trees

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:11.959 
towards this a base of a certain trees

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:15.699 
towards this a base of a certain trees
and<00:06:12.489> what<00:06:13.489> makes<00:06:13.699> them<00:06:13.939> so<00:06:14.629> desirable<00:06:15.229> is<00:06:15.499> that

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:15.709 
and what makes them so desirable is that

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.659 
and what makes them so desirable is that
they'll<00:06:15.889> have<00:06:15.949> this<00:06:16.819> just<00:06:17.119> wild<00:06:18.339> figure<00:06:19.339> in<00:06:19.519> it

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669 
they'll have this just wild figure in it

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:24.369 
they'll have this just wild figure in it
yeah<00:06:20.119> I<00:06:21.999> really<00:06:22.999> think<00:06:23.209> this<00:06:23.330> is<00:06:23.509> just<00:06:23.749> a<00:06:23.869> quite

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
yeah I really think this is just a quite

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.379 
yeah I really think this is just a quite
a<00:06:24.409> unique<00:06:24.619> showpiece<00:06:25.279> and<00:06:25.849> but<00:06:26.029> you'll<00:06:26.149> notice

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:26.389 
a unique showpiece and but you'll notice

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.299 
a unique showpiece and but you'll notice
that<00:06:26.509> that<00:06:27.050> what<00:06:27.559> we've<00:06:27.709> done<00:06:27.919> is<00:06:28.129> we've<00:06:28.279> taken

00:06:28.299 --> 00:06:28.309 
that that what we've done is we've taken

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:32.409 
that that what we've done is we've taken
such<00:06:28.849> a<00:06:29.059> a<00:06:29.439> completely<00:06:30.439> natural<00:06:31.009> natural<00:06:31.879> edge

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419 
such a a completely natural natural edge

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:35.169 
such a a completely natural natural edge
