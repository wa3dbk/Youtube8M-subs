I'm<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:22.050> going<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> choose<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.460> build<00:00:23.580> it

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.740 

sike<00:00:27.779> liner<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.500> going<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.359> build<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> which<00:00:30.630> it

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
sike liner is going to build it which it

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.569 
sike liner is going to build it which it
seems<00:00:30.990> you've<00:00:31.140> done<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.390> let's<00:00:34.460> see<00:00:35.460> this

we have the white text on the purple you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.940 
we have the white text on the purple you
know<00:00:41.820> background<00:00:42.629> suspended<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> large

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
know background suspended in a large

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
know background suspended in a large
white<00:00:44.250> field<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.450> wanted<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.170> for

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
white field what I really wanted was for

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.010 
white field what I really wanted was for
the<00:00:46.829> purple<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.700> fill<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> browser<00:00:48.629> window

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the purple to fill up the browser window

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
the purple to fill up the browser window
no<00:00:49.140> matter<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.530> large<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:51.059> that's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
no matter how large it was and so that's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.340 
no matter how large it was and so that's
what<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.750> learn<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> do<00:00:52.140> right

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
what we're going to learn to do right

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
what we're going to learn to do right
now<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.980> just<00:00:55.980> need<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> use<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
now so to do this we just need to use a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.599 
now so to do this we just need to use a
color<00:00:57.390> overlay<00:00:57.690> layer<00:00:57.960> effects<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.500> name<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
color overlay layer effects and name the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
color overlay layer effects and name the
labor<00:00:59.789> certain<00:01:00.180> way<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> name

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
labor certain way so I'm going to name

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.189 
labor certain way so I'm going to name
this<00:01:02.070> layer<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.670> purple<00:01:03.059> layer<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.780> going

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
this layer this purple layer I'm going

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.700 
this layer this purple layer I'm going
to<00:01:04.260> name<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.439> layer<00:01:04.710> browser<00:01:06.710> background

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
to name this layer browser background

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.280 
to name this layer browser background
color<00:01:09.380> his<00:01:10.380> name<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:11.000> important<00:01:12.140> that<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> be

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
color his name is important that it be

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.190 
color his name is important that it be
both<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.310> first<00:01:14.549> part<00:01:14.700> b<00:01:14.880> browser<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.689> the

both the first part b browser and the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
both the first part b browser and the
second<00:01:16.530> part<00:01:16.619> b<00:01:16.830> background<00:01:17.250> color<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:18.000> can

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
second part b background color we can

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.570 
second part b background color we can
use<00:01:18.299> background<00:01:18.840> color<00:01:19.080> layers<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:20.280> other

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
use background color layers in other

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.640 
use background color layers in other
places<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.630> example<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.990> footer<00:01:22.229> background

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
places for example a footer background

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.440 
places for example a footer background
color<00:01:22.890> under<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:23.729> other<00:01:23.790> places<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
color under some other places it can be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.600 
color under some other places it can be
used<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.290> very<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:26.130> very<00:01:26.220> important

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
used so it's very it's very important

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.010 
used so it's very it's very important
that<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> name<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.330> first<00:01:27.570> part<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> UV

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
that the name the first part of the UV

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
that the name the first part of the UV
browser<00:01:28.320> otherwise<00:01:28.799> sidewinder<00:01:29.340> won't<00:01:29.850> know

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
browser otherwise sidewinder won't know

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.630 
browser otherwise sidewinder won't know
what<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.509> them<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.860> isn't<00:01:32.220> enough

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
what to do with them this isn't enough

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.010 
what to do with them this isn't enough
though<00:01:32.820> we<00:01:32.970> also<00:01:33.150> need<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> apply<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.720> color

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
though we also need to apply the color

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
though we also need to apply the color
overlay<00:01:34.439> layer<00:01:34.829> effects<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.090> going

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
overlay layer effects to it so I'm going

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.840 
overlay layer effects to it so I'm going
to<00:01:38.600> I'm<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> choose<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.170> color<00:01:40.439> overlay

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.109 
to I'm going to choose the color overlay
layer<00:01:41.850> effect<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.439> color<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.070> choose<00:01:44.579> here

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
layer effect and the color I choose here

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.039 
layer effect and the color I choose here
is<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.290> color<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.189> going<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.759> used<00:01:48.210> so

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
is the color that is going to be used so

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.710
