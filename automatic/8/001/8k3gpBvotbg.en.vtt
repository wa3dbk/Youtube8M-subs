00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.080
 they wash pretty nice ideas to my channel 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.939
 this time our something in this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.099
 video that deals with a makeup that 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.349
 is a little loaded girls because the 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.570
 eyelashes is as big as you can 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.550
 give account this makeup is worth 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 very much worth it this is the actor that 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.900
 it makes the eyes were very big like 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 you can appreciate it we are going to 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.570
 begin the first thing we will do is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.970
 put a first one on our face or 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.650
 in magnesium placing in the areas that 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.860
 we do not get more shine girls because 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.930
 remember that my skin is oily after 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.300
 of appearing all the granites that in 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 this time I have many and also 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 my little spots you know that 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.820
 corrector is the one that I'm using in 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.340
 these moments because in videos 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.290
 the previous already had shown him 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.540
 The only thing I will do is blur it with my 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.490
 fingers that can do it with this must 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.499
 girls because she 's weakest of all 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.120
 then I will take my base on this occasion 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:10.770
 is the mac 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.200
 1 nc 25 and blur everything very well and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.180
 then try on my circles under the same 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.180
 a concealer that covers my granites 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.300
 then we will leave everything very well with a 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.490
 translucent powder once we have 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.340
 finished that I will take my palette that is for 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.920
 contour my girls face and contour 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.290
 of the right areas for the kind of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 face that I have I have a video where 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.820
 I explain where they have to outline 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.530
 depending on the type of face that 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.230
 have an army of information 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.420
 I'll link to watch it pass 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.180
 Once we have finished that I will take my 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.670
 blush this is from Milan and I will place it in 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.040
 the cheeks blurring everything very 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.100
 all right 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.710
 then I will take my base to place the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.630
 shadow and this lasts me longer but 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.720
 now I will only place it in the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.510
 Almond of the eye with the drama palette 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.700
 I will take this little color that is beautiful 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.399
 because it has such a beautiful brightness and what 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.580
 I will place in the whole almond later with 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.680
 a brown pencil draws from the basin girls 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.230
 just as I am doing what you 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.840
 can appreciate very well and blur 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:28.550
 with a shade of shadow similar to the pencil 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:30.860
 with a brush to blur now 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.290
 delineates my eyes girls you know 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.330
 that I love the dramatic but if 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.990
 you do not like it so dramatic and 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.680
 marked can be made light 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.680
 delineated and ready 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.129
 with a flat brush we will take this 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.500
 color and we will place it blurring the 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.230
 very well at the bottom of our 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.870
 eye as I put false eyelashes 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.540
 here the only thing I'm doing is joining 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.130
 mine with the fake ones and then 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.130
 we will also paint the ones below 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.680
 as not only the eyes are going to be the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.780
 protagonists of this look too 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.960
 we will paint our lips with a tone 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.180
 strong these products are the same 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.820
 girls but in different presentation 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.680
 so I will only paint my lips and 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.659
 ready 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.120
 that is the final result girls 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.819
 obviously it changes a lot already with the 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.250
 hairstyle and some accessory I hope you 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.349
 I liked to send them a few kisses 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.780
 from panda and see you in the next 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:56.659
 video remember that if they liked hand 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.659
