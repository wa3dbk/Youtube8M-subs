00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.640
 go on we start on the right side 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.640
 so what is it 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.310
 that's nothing very interesting about 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.630
 left side either on the pardon 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.109
 no longer on the left side 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.990
 that's it and then we'll come back 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.520
 interesting it's on the bench then 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.200
 support watch the few false notes 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.219

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.390
 3.0 anti lost watches if you 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.730
 move away appetite m 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.110
 she's ringing there's a dictaphone pedometer 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.760
 synchronization with the phone 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.980
 notification sms email calendar 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.800
 directory put the names there is the microphone 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 usb and its rebound access to see that more 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.719
 in detail just for the beginning the la the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.199
 the box 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.999
 I like it so much so that's because 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.939
 that we immediately have obviously 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:16.380
 show you go back right after that 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:19.979
 in fact nothing at all I have this little 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:26.549
 usb micro usb power cable 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.560
 I had never unpacked yet that is 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.149
 really the quality is really not 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 terrible terrible 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:36.270
 I even think it's broken or the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.619
 tours is there and how does it do it's 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 really all the loaves I ever 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.639
 open yet the cord is really 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.259
 very very soft it does not bring the 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:48.389
 quality of all materials to use 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.609
 all brilliant making cheap can 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:52.739
 simply reach his watches 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.349
 which is around 100 euros I 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:02:02.740
 believe this is actually you know that it 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:08.709
 have a little deliverer here 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:12.480
 otherwise there is nothing else that makes it very 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:16.510
 light good it's not very serious 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.080
 precisely I take you away then 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:23.970
 this watch there I'm already trying to 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.970
 to remove it even has this coaching 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.489
 I'm coming a little bit of time 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.730
 here is good first grip 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:41.019
 go very light she is a little bit more 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.940
 thick as galaxy gears 2 that is 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.650
 just there in near london 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.519
 we do not really see that these galaxies 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:54.730
 rear window lock up the arm this client 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.170
 itself does - months or all simply 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.080
 because there are several little things 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.680
 like that I had little watch to sÃ¨te 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.760
 did not work very expensive here ap 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.109
 I will remove it a hundred days ago from 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.640
 different against 7 show the seven 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:14.709
 dwarfs but the month is not terrible 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.859
 terrible so with a sign or art to 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.859
 ide 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.579
 however, there is something that 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:28.540
 I like it is that you can 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:33.579
 directly plugged the microusb 2.0 on 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:38.140
 the watch here is there you have a small 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:42.549
 button on off on the left side was doing 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.900
 nothing more in the bessin do a 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.920
 first start left for you 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.920
 account for a little bit 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:03.820
 quick comparison between the two I 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.810
 the impression that the polarity a little 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.810
 least a little bit my law 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:27.130
 arch are really little fingers 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:30.400
 because it works pretty well for the 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.840
 little that I tried here maybe this is a 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.210
 little is a little more complete a little 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.190
 further so that's it for this watch 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.740
 the Polaroid watch so that is 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.440
 available in several colors 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.440
 I took a black go between justin 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.960
 she is not very thick not very 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.220
 heavy a little thicker though 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.220
 obviously that this one
