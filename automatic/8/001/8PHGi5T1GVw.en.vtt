these three bathtubs you'd like to step

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.420 
these three bathtubs you'd like to step
into<00:00:47.780> this<00:00:48.780> one<00:00:50.000> which<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.180> freezing<00:00:51.719> cold<00:00:52.430> or

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
into this one which is freezing cold or

into this one which is freezing cold or
this<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.800> which<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.829> boiling<00:00:56.280> hot<00:00:56.989> or<00:00:57.989> this

this one which is boiling hot or this
one<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.250> neither<00:00:59.460> too<00:00:59.760> hot<00:00:59.969> nor<00:01:00.000> too

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
one which is neither too hot nor too

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.549 
one which is neither too hot nor too
cold<00:01:01.219> it's<00:01:02.219> an<00:01:02.370> easy<00:01:02.520> choice<00:01:02.789> isn't<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.559> well

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
cold it's an easy choice isn't it well

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.060 
cold it's an easy choice isn't it well
go<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.710> step<00:01:05.640> into<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> middle<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.920> thing<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
go on step into the middle one thing is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
go on step into the middle one thing is
just<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> bit<00:01:08.520> too<00:01:08.549> hot<00:01:08.880> doesn't<00:01:09.530> try<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> other

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
just a bit too hot doesn't try the other

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.510 
just a bit too hot doesn't try the other
foot<00:01:10.890> oh<00:01:12.200> no<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.409> feels<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:13.770> too<00:01:13.920> cold

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
foot oh no it feels a bit too cold

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.670 
foot oh no it feels a bit too cold
well<00:01:15.299> perhaps<00:01:15.540> judging<00:01:16.080> whether<00:01:16.259> something

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
well perhaps judging whether something

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.390 
well perhaps judging whether something
is<00:01:16.799> hot<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:17.220> cold<00:01:17.460> isn't<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:17.970> easy<00:01:18.180> after<00:01:18.450> all

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
is hot or cold isn't so easy after all

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.980 
is hot or cold isn't so easy after all
this<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> human<00:01:21.270> body<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.780> only

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
this is because the human body can only

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.480 
this is because the human body can only
notice<00:01:22.229> differences<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.979> hotness<00:01:23.310> or

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
notice differences in hotness or

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.270 
notice differences in hotness or
coldness<00:01:23.570> how<00:01:24.570> hot<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.049> cold<00:01:25.110> something<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.009> in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
coldness how hot or cold something is in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.660 
coldness how hot or cold something is in
comparison<00:01:26.700> with<00:01:27.299> something<00:01:27.630> else<00:01:28.280> but<00:01:29.280> even

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
comparison with something else but even

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490

your<00:01:29.790> own<00:01:29.970> feet<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.509> can't<00:01:30.810> agree<00:01:30.990> about<00:01:31.320> how
