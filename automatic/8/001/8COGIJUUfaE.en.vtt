00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.940
 the overlap so that I temporarily nailed this 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.610
 beam to the pillars and now we are ready 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.340
 overlap you need to be sure 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.500
 in the evenness of the board we first insert 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.869
 they are beam to pocket which we 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:21.810
 left earlier now i will put 16 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.350
 clamps on the back of the other end 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.480
 stick we hammer nails at an angle now 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.730
 this overlap kind of reminds shoulder 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.949
 lever on the beam and i like this 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.550
 system for several reasons she 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.350
 forgives inaccuracies when installing pillars 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 shortens the beam spacing I like 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.140
 what it looks like your designs you 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.030
 could have done something differently you 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.930
 can use shortened balkis 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.000
 re bracket 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.940
 i.e. your overlap will be flush 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.129
 from the top of the beam of course the top 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.770
 part of the beam will be aligned with the transverse 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.320
 your terrace will be a little pointy 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.399
 now continue to lay out the rest 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.399
 overlap parts 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.109
 I secured the edges of the beam I will lay 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.030
 overlap according to the established 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:30.679
 brackets for but transverse beams then 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:33.259
 eat every 24 inches then for 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.329
 reliability of overlap made homemade 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:53.329
 clip cutting off one side of 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:56.780
 bracket these overlaps are large at 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:05.000
 cutting I support the board with my foot so 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:07.390
 saw will not see the earth make sure that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.230
 edges of each floor quality and 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:17.239
 adjust their position with each 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:25.269
 sides of the overlap whip the nail under 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:25.269
 interrupt the bracket 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.280
 finish posting overlap you 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.220
 can use fast and simple 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.540
 way using a simple joint like us 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.000
 doing went here 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.090
 connect high school to hide these rudeness 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.010
 slightly up well right here at the end 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.879
 of each ceiling beam we also 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.879
 nailing 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.319
 now one more thing we need to make sure 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.329
 that our terrace is square we 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.920
 took care of this began planning 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.430
 but we have to double check ours 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:13.079
 diagonal to be sure 108 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.079
 count now we will find out whether we are square 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.349
 one hundred eight and eight well we are within a hundred 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.690
 eight 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.360
 so we are close to our scheduled 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.769
 terrace if the ceiling is much larger 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.510
 possible we will have to regulate 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.510
 relationship beams pillar 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.090
 here 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.739
 reign little these times we started 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.439
 spread overlap on large 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.390
 the terrace floor and i use big 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.670
 triangle to accommodate 1 beam 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.069
 overlaps perpendicular transverse 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.109
 beams pick up our tape measure 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.989
 location on this terrace walker 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:03.109
 long distance their center 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.090
 should be every 16 inches like and 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:18.259
 used to hammer nails at an angle with 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:20.109
 each side of the beam well i have 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:21.229
 assistant that raises and lowers 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.660
 framing 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:28.580
 and while I work it keeps them flush 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.070
 with beams even on such a complicated terrace 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.139
 like this with varying angle levels 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.840
 dice crushing beams is not difficult 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.940
 ms synergy here is the end of our 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.889
 the overlaps are joined with another transverse 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.889
 beam and they meet at an angle 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.650
 OK 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.540
 Cord punching off at this mark we have 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.820
 our overlap which is longer than 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.700
 can i want to shorten them all at once 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.590
 start the one where the floor stands this way 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:25.530
 after punching off we will have the perfect 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:29.910
 direct our edge to make a cut 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.560
 i mark the line at right angles from i don't 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.670
 I love to eat sawdust 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.670
 so wear a mask 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.940
 sharply downward much easier you 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.530
 can see i had to hold it 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.530
 at an angle to make 3 notches 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:26.540
 well below let me see if everything is fine 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:26.540
 Yes, great now on the other hand
