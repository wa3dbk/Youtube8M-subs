only thing I had to do like I said was

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.600 
only thing I had to do like I said was
Flatiron<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.590> top<00:02:33.920> portion<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.400> my<00:02:34.489> hair

which is the easiest to flat iron and it

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.610 
which is the easiest to flat iron and it
doesn't<00:02:37.280> take<00:02:37.430> as<00:02:37.610> much<00:02:37.850> heat<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.750> do<00:02:38.930> so

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
doesn't take as much heat to do so

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.380 
doesn't take as much heat to do so
that's<00:02:39.860> why<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.069> had<00:02:40.430> opted<00:02:40.819> out<00:02:40.970> for<00:02:41.239> that
