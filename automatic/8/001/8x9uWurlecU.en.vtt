00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.420 
use in pretty much every game mode and I
just<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.839> way<00:00:16.109> this<00:00:16.379> gun<00:00:16.650> plays<00:00:17.039> in

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
just like the way this gun plays in

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.310 
just like the way this gun plays in
comparison<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> dsr-50<00:00:18.779> which<00:00:19.170> is

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320

I'll<00:00:53.010> kill<00:00:53.190> him<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> second<00:00:53.940> anyway<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
I'll kill him here in a second anyway so

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
I'll kill him here in a second anyway so
me<00:00:55.379> microplane<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:55.949> we're<00:00:56.219> both<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.579> for

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
me microplane and we're both going for

me microplane and we're both going for
some<00:00:56.879> sniping<00:00:57.120> streaks<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:58.230> couldn't<00:00:58.440> do

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
some sniping streaks and we couldn't do

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.000 
some sniping streaks and we couldn't do
it<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.940> Mike<00:01:00.120> got<00:01:00.420> -<00:01:01.379> boarded<00:01:01.829> on

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
it like I think Mike got - boarded on

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
it like I think Mike got - boarded on
like<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> 28<00:01:02.670> gun<00:01:02.850> streak<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.210> something<00:01:03.539> on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
like a 28 gun streak or something on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
like a 28 gun streak or something on
standoff<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.729> way<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> die<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.210> gameplay

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
standoff and the way I die this gameplay

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.350 
standoff and the way I die this gameplay
is<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.290> prestige<00:01:07.979> master<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> light

machine gun target finder it spawns

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
machine gun target finder it spawns
directly<00:01:11.970> behind<00:01:12.090> me<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:12.750> completely

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
directly behind me and just completely

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
directly behind me and just completely
dominates<00:01:14.070> me<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.430> two<00:01:14.640> bullets<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.210> is

dominates me with two bullets which is

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.570 
dominates me with two bullets which is
pretty<00:01:15.689> unfortunate<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> consider<00:01:17.400> how

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
pretty unfortunate when you consider how

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
pretty unfortunate when you consider how
close<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> nuclear<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.900> your

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
close I was to the nuclear your your

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.350 
close I was to the nuclear your your
cell<00:01:19.470> familiar<00:01:19.979> many<00:01:20.340> gun<00:01:20.670> kills<00:01:20.939> I'd<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.270> two

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
cell familiar many gun kills I'd get two

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
cell familiar many gun kills I'd get two
in<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.540> row<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> think<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.200> 26<00:01:22.680> or<00:01:22.799> 27<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
in a row I think it's like 26 or 27 I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
in a row I think it's like 26 or 27 I
don't<00:01:24.119> actually<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.259> tried<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> play<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
don't actually know so I tried to play a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.020

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
little bit different in this game

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
little bit different in this game
because<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.330> realized<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.810> whenever<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.680> open

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
playing way too aggressively to get some

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.910 
playing way too aggressively to get some
consistent<00:02:39.150> streaks<00:02:39.420> beforehand<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.230> even

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
consistent streaks beforehand and even

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.380 
consistent streaks beforehand and even
when<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.340> seeked<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.910> played<00:02:42.150> more

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
when I seeked and played more

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.510 
when I seeked and played more
