00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 The artist has created this painting in 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.333
 Darkness. This 

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:17.334
 The action represents a primitive, prism image, pre-timed imaging update. 

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:21.100
 The artist stammers in the dark, that is what we do 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.800
 When we fall in love. I bought rabbits from rabbits' rabbits for food. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.100
 I brought them home and removed their necks 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.467
 Cautious. Place a large plate 

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:40.000
 Of colored photo paper, and then put 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.233
 Rabbits on paper in the dark. I relied on the sense of touch only for that. And then their presentation 

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.000
 For light photography 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.367
 Fast. 

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:57.333
 Only at the end of the process when he has enhanced the images he saw 

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:07.667
 For the first time what he did. There is something magical about it. Get 

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.000
 Sensory explosion of color. and he 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.100
 Something you can not control 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 You can not predict it. When he did this work, 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.367
 Artist Adam Ves, was suffering from a difficult romantic period. 

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:29.433
 He used the symbols of fertility and innocence 

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:34.600
 And sacrifice. It's a picture of love and things that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.800
 You get us when we open ourselves 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.367
 We are associated with other people. It's the slogan of suffering. 

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:49.934
 When you fall in love and then lose it, you feel 

00:01:49.934 --> 00:01:53.200
 You lose what is inside you, it is uprooting what is inside, 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.233
 That is the feeling 

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.700
 Representative acting. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.967
 This imaging process 

00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:15.400
 Like love, not knowing where you are going or what 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.900
 Your link will be final, and then it is done 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.200
 Show it to you at 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.934
 Light shiny and surprising. 

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:27.367
 This is what the wonderful artwork does, it transforms 

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:31.667
 These feelings to form 

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:42.800
 Visible addresses everyone looking at it.
