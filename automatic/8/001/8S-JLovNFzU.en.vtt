00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.940
 hello to all, recently we learned how to do 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.910
 bottle for dolls of any type 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.330
 Today we will learn how to make glasses 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:21.029
 that he would need any 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:27.750
 form shaped transparent to this 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:31.579
 from the cap you can take for example from 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.399
 pens take the cap 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:39.149
 cut off the desired piece and you 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.860
 will is such a little thing here I 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:48.270
 already had such a ready thing and if u 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.430
 you have a hole out of this thing 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.430
 you can just take hot glue and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.210
 pour hot glue on the inside to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.869
 It turned out as builds but also to us 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.909
 need a transparent tubule or 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:14.159
 transparent some slice from some 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:17.850
 items for example from the old pen from 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.369
 sand paste we can cut and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.369
 cut the main small piece 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.729
 because if you cut it hard 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.799
 big piece 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.460
 he will not fit your doll a 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.130
 then it is all glue well, I have not 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.659
 agreed that we still need but 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.790
 also we will need 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.040
 maybe someone has a house like that 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.579
 see plates 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:53.340
 from them the cap or the plate itself 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.649
 to cut a circle for glasses Well 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.810
 for starters we will certainly cut a circle 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.430
 that was a little easier circle maybe 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.430
 absolutely any 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:13.340
 and if you want your circle to be 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:16.140
 exactly like your glass 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.890
 good this size you can 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:26.100
 glue the glass first the same let but I 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:29.190
 Still I do first circle that is on 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.930
 what will stand and then with the clip 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.970
 side marker which writes on disks 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.430
 or on something else i get out 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:43.110
 that is, sketched a circle like this 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:47.250
 in the same his ulta you can also take not 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:51.240
 only from the lid of such here 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:57.840
 plates and you can still take from someone from 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:03:01.350
 cows and for something like dolls 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.270
 unless of course the box you need can 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:10.040
 stay here is such as plastic not 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:14.600
 I know how it is called correctly and 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.390
 you can cut such a piece now 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:25.070
 we are left with hot glue to glue these 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:27.800
 all the details among themselves that is to this 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:32.160
 stand or shall we call so cute we 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:36.120
 glue the part that holds our 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:42.890
 the main part of the glass and we should 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:46.310
 It should turn out to be us poppy 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.950
 now your dolls are ready fully to 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.480
 any holiday 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.820
