00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
it with the right hand lead or you play

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.330 
it with the right hand lead or you play
the<00:00:51.989> left<00:00:52.140> hand<00:00:52.350> lead<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.770> doesn't<00:00:53.190> switch

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the left hand lead it doesn't switch

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.650 
the left hand lead it doesn't switch
back<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.579> forth<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> paradiddle<00:00:54.480> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
back and forth like a paradiddle you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
back and forth like a paradiddle you
govern<00:00:56.390> the<00:00:57.390> paradiddle<00:00:57.930> diddle<00:00:58.350> goes<00:01:01.670> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
govern the paradiddle diddle goes so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.380 
govern the paradiddle diddle goes so
it's<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> six<00:01:03.210> note<00:01:03.619> grouping<00:01:04.880> and<00:01:05.880> sticking

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it's a six note grouping and sticking

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.140 
it's a six note grouping and sticking
even<00:01:07.260> slower<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> single<00:01:11.220> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
even slower is so you have a single and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:20.359 
even slower is so you have a single and
then<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.920> double<00:01:13.920> so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.320 

okay<00:01:21.369> and<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:24.250> know<00:01:24.340> just<00:01:24.580> if<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:25.060> play<00:01:25.210> that

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
okay and you know just if I play that

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.830 
okay and you know just if I play that
fast<00:01:25.570> it's<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:28.619> right

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.100 

okay<00:01:33.409> so<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.210> itself<00:01:35.479> is<00:01:35.659> very<00:01:35.899> cool

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
okay so that in itself is very cool

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.050 
okay so that in itself is very cool
right<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:37.189> can<00:01:37.340> there's<00:01:37.490> lots<00:01:37.640> of<00:01:37.729> things<00:01:37.850> you

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
right you can there's lots of things you

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.030 
right you can there's lots of things you
can<00:01:38.210> do<00:01:38.329> with<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.659> if<00:01:39.140> you<00:01:39.320> take<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:39.829> you

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
can do with that if you take it and you

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:50.849 
can do with that if you take it and you
apply<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.520> drum<00:01:40.729> set

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.679 

right<00:01:51.859> so<00:01:52.130> that's<00:01:52.640> pretty<00:01:52.789> cool<00:01:53.090> right<00:01:53.539> in

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
right so that's pretty cool right in

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.630 
right so that's pretty cool right in
itself<00:01:53.990> but<00:01:54.439> it's<00:01:54.590> pretty<00:01:54.740> basic<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.189> know<00:01:55.399> I

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
itself but it's pretty basic you know I

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.669 
itself but it's pretty basic you know I
want<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.179> I<00:01:56.210> want<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.479> take<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:56.990> kind<00:01:57.560> of

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
want to I want to take it and kind of

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.410 
want to I want to take it and kind of
shape<00:01:58.100> it<00:01:58.250> expand<00:01:58.670> it<00:01:58.789> a<00:01:58.850> little<00:01:58.880> bit<00:01:59.119> more<00:01:59.329> and

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
shape it expand it a little bit more and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.200 
shape it expand it a little bit more and
see<00:01:59.600> what<00:01:59.719> else<00:01:59.840> I<00:01:59.929> can<00:01:59.990> come<00:02:00.140> up<00:02:00.259> with<00:02:00.319> so<00:02:01.210> one

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
see what else I can come up with so one

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.669 
see what else I can come up with so one
of<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.390> lips<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.899> like<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.229> do<00:02:03.409> is<00:02:05.679> I'll

of the lips that I like to do is I'll

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.759 
of the lips that I like to do is I'll
substitute<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:08.479> last<00:02:08.810> note<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.500> is<00:02:09.619> the

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.410 
sixth note to left form with my bass
drum<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:15.080> I'm<00:02:15.200> substituting<00:02:15.799> my<00:02:16.610> left<00:02:17.150> hand

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.280 

six<00:06:26.640> no<00:06:26.850> but<00:06:27.240> on<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.420> fifth<00:06:27.660> no<00:06:27.840> I'm<00:06:28.020> throwing

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
six no but on the fifth no I'm throwing

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:36.410 
six no but on the fifth no I'm throwing
in<00:06:28.470> another<00:06:28.530> accent<00:06:29.130> with<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.370> left<00:06:29.580> hand

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:36.420 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.930 

now<00:06:36.900> I've<00:06:37.020> got<00:06:37.200> this

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.510 

now<00:06:41.390> I<00:06:41.420> can<00:06:41.690> completely<00:06:42.050> disguise<00:06:42.560> where<00:06:43.220> one

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 
now I can completely disguise where one

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.030 
now I can completely disguise where one
is<00:06:43.820> especially<00:06:44.720> if<00:06:44.810> I<00:06:44.930> don't<00:06:45.290> lay<00:06:45.530> an<00:06:45.650> accent

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
is especially if I don't lay an accent

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.650 
is especially if I don't lay an accent
on<00:06:46.100> the<00:06:46.160> first<00:06:46.250> note<00:06:46.730> so<00:06:47.090> it<00:06:47.210> ends<00:06:47.360> up<00:06:47.420> being

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
on the first note so it ends up being

00:06:47.660 --> 00:07:08.400 
on the first note so it ends up being
like

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.830 

think<00:07:08.710> so<00:07:08.950> a<00:07:09.280> lot<00:07:09.850> of<00:07:10.000> cool<00:07:10.210> things<00:07:10.240> you<00:07:10.540> can<00:07:10.720> do

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:10.840 
think so a lot of cool things you can do
