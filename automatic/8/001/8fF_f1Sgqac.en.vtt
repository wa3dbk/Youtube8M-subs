00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:11.929
 Hello everyone, I decided to take a review 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.750
 about cars who might be interested rf novel 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:20.240
 look because I personally duck up 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.449
 how to buy this car at all 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.010
 knew nothing about the projector but she didn't even have 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.980
 knew how she looks inside of herself 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.070
 represents and no matter how planned 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.040
 buying such a car is not what I wanted 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:39.110
 just at work offered sausage was 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.730
 she stood and he offered it to me and this 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.440
 he had only one car owner 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.210
 from scratch there is one man like me older 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.180
 don't even know well shorter and work on 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.460
 he has all the tractor factory 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.440
 the car itself was not running 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:01:00.559
 110,000 kilometers seventy children what in 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.559
 principle ok for so big and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.020
 of that age 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.460
 full service history she is here time 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.570
 did the service in this garage I would work 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.250
 all ideally that's why i took 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.650
 how would we show a little bit 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:25.189
 This car that I like that does not 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:33.640
 like in general such a dashboard 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:33.640
 everything here has climate control 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.579
 such a beer key 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.509
 tick 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:57.119
 computer check everything does not work for you 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:03.180
 everything shows computer consumption too 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 gasoline that is all it is here it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.600
 direct control how you regulate here 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.739
 all temperatures conditioner and all bullshit 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.769
 such a pretty comfortable panel 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.380
 In principle, everything is simple and clear there settings 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:28.580
 go to the construction site to change something there 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.580
 possible on the language and the date is all shorter 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.590
 here are funny ashtrays 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.840
 Nile charging include such a place 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.209
 positively no that's not like there is no 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.010
 cups for these coasters 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:50.910
 I had a vector here nothing 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.130
 fog there is in front this is something i 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.390
 I do not know how to turn it off probably counter 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.970
 another system for the knife some 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.500
 you adjust the mirrors 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:09.710
 here water is water temperature but radiator 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:15.920
 and it is written gasoline in Italian but also 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.140
 here the clock is not visible very much at night 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.530
 pretty beautifully it burns it all 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.930
 red color all dashboard all 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.620
 here it is very red 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.620
 funny 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.310
 turn signals all the garbage I'm here with her 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.709
 cruise control too 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.530
 figured it out here turn on the computer 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:55.480
 when I am with this kind of salon here 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.500
 too wipers all sorts of put cute as 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.500
 usually in all machines 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.870
 so that's cool role is pretty 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.180
 tight in control vector he's such as 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.920
 easier noise and here Stepan to more 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.870
 sports all the buttons work 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.510
 I have an illegal man 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:19.870
 the original is also there but I prefer 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:21.040
 so no income in the glove box pretty 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.290
 little ones 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:31.600
 comparison sects such a shirt I drive with 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:38.320
 you just in case he glavnar wig 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:43.300
 hiv banks rob well all the pillows and eat 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:47.289
 pillows here pillows here pillows in 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.110
 the seat cushion is here back there too 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:52.030
 she has pillows on the side that is all 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.810
 pretty safe everywhere there is a light bulb 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.710
 I object light was not here 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:03.090
 here light skin pretty well, 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:06.310
 Salon is basically spacious 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.590
 the only thing is that the boot size 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:14.169
 the trunk of me was a vector and 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:18.240
 great here especially do not shove here 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.240
 what don't i like 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:26.890
 that until you turn on the ignition 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.930
 nothing works neither music 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.680
 nothing but this principle in many cars 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:36.630
 so but I liked the vectors that you 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.620
 how do you get on the car all i'm already working 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.020
 windows you can open them 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.210
 and music also didn't work for me 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.410
 had to turn on the machine to work 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:49.270
 music that is salat is about the cabin so 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.480
 as if pretty nice 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.350
 looks like a solo ok engine here 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.350
 double 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.540
 pretty nimble machine 16 valves 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:11.610
 and zen also go away and click 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:18.500
 pedal strongly show what's under the hood 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.500
 they fast 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:25.849
 It looks like this can 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.900
 such a motor 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.889
 I donâ€™t see much here because 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.889
 everything is fine and 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.509
 Yemen 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:59.860
 what red nikotero you 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.210
 nothing here is a little schoolboy 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:10.510
 let me show you how to fix this 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:12.540
 here on the mirror too she is 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:18.760
 ass 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:22.060
 pretty that such a car trunk 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:26.830
 the dish hide me to you already loaded 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:31.129
 small but ok so interesting 

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:34.779
 We can somehow parse it did 

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:37.729
 sounds pretty good I like 

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:40.149
 so good luck to everyone 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:43.599
 and fuss on the canal if anyone watches 

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:43.599
 go with yourself
