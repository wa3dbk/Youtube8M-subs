 classification are based on software 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.259
 control of the highest technology 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.670
 through electronic sensors and cameras 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.220
 digitals that get the data 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.800
 needed to determine the weight 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.500
 color size or defect of the fruit u 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.130
 vegetable ensuring a precision of 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.400
 plus minus 1% by weight and color and more less 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.110
 one millimeter in diameter the number of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.030
 lines and exits for the fruit are 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.610
 determined according to the size of the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.550
 production or customer request and 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.310
 they can go from 2 to 8 lines and up to 40 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.690
 outputs the amount of output favors 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.000
 production optimization 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.790
 managing to separate the fruit in the way 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.690
 more convenient thus reaching a range 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.190
 of minor waste the sorters 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.110
 computerized then work like 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.350
 The central part of the packaging line 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.910
 since in addition to its main function 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.590
 provide statistical reports with 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.110
 those who can know the volume 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.959
 total production thus supporting the 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.820
 information and control processes 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.530
 this way all the systems 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.110
 developed by industrial corporation 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.090
 uruapan always seek innovation in 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.650
 their technologies offering their 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.260
 customers the necessary tools 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.769
 to raise competitiveness within 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.060
 its productive sector we go ahead and 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.370
 our vision is 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.380
 and here expansion takes us to search

 services throughout the national territory 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.330
 and continue to cultivate the markets of 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.970
 latin america in ciu fabricando 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.590
 integral solutions for the process
