here<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:08.620> read<00:01:08.979> somewhere<00:01:09.010> that<00:01:09.520> Karen<00:01:09.970> Gillan

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
here I read somewhere that Karen Gillan

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.330 
here I read somewhere that Karen Gillan
is<00:01:10.479> taking<00:01:10.780> a<00:01:10.870> break<00:01:11.170> from<00:01:11.229> time<00:01:11.770> travelling

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
is taking a break from time travelling

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.069 
is taking a break from time travelling
to<00:01:12.460> do<00:01:12.580> another<00:01:12.820> production<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.960> just

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
to do another production so this is just

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.600 
to do another production so this is just
a<00:01:17.200> theory<00:01:17.439> it<00:01:17.619> might<00:01:17.799> be<00:01:17.979> certain<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.460> might

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
a theory it might be certain you might

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.010 
a theory it might be certain you might
have<00:01:18.700> already<00:01:18.820> read<00:01:19.119> this<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.479> think<00:01:19.689> oh<00:01:19.810> yeah

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
have already read this and think oh yeah

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.920 
have already read this and think oh yeah
it's<00:01:20.170> definitely<00:01:20.409> but<00:01:20.950> I<00:01:21.189> doubt<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.930> maybe

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
it's definitely but I doubt it maybe

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.749 
it's definitely but I doubt it maybe

goes<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.200> war<00:02:11.410> that<00:02:12.280> looks<00:02:12.610> like<00:02:12.850> his<00:02:13.180> body<00:02:13.510> on

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
goes to war that looks like his body on

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.210 
goes to war that looks like his body on
the<00:02:13.930> beach<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.870> maybe<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.319> leading<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
the beach so maybe it is leading up to

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.270 
the beach so maybe it is leading up to
that<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> last<00:02:21.940> episode<00:02:22.239> so

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
that in the last episode so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.550 
that in the last episode so
now<00:02:23.850> we're<00:02:24.209> going<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> see<00:02:24.569> those<00:02:24.780> 200<00:02:25.410> for<00:02:25.530> the

now we're going to see those 200 for the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.230 
now we're going to see those 200 for the
next<00:02:25.890> part<00:02:26.040> series<00:02:26.430> set<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.700> we<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:26.850> see<00:02:27.060> those

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
baby with a song melody pond so this is

what's<00:02:39.780> going<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.110> happen<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:41.480> he's

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
what's going to happen I think he's

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.850

going<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.750> go<00:02:42.900> find<00:02:43.650> her<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:45.410> he<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:46.590> be<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
going to go find her and he will be the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.670 
going to go find her and he will be the
one<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.220> takes<00:02:47.459> her<00:02:47.640> from<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.000> orphanage

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
one that takes her from the orphanage

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.920 
one that takes her from the orphanage
the<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:50.010> steals<00:02:50.310> her<00:02:50.580> not<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.270> silence

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
the one that steals her not the silence

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.680 
the one that steals her not the silence
like<00:02:52.290> we<00:02:52.470> all<00:02:52.590> originally<00:02:53.370> fought<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.030> stuff

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
like we all originally fought and stuff

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.670 
like we all originally fought and stuff
and<00:02:55.530> then<00:02:56.250> he's<00:02:56.880> gonna<00:02:57.090> raise<00:02:57.450> her<00:02:57.870> but<00:02:58.470> first

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and then he's gonna raise her but first

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.580 
and then he's gonna raise her but first
she's<00:02:58.890> gonna<00:02:59.070> think<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.430> him<00:02:59.580> as<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.760> dad<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
she's gonna think of him as a dad and

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.370 
she's gonna think of him as a dad and
then<00:03:01.590> eventually<00:03:02.420> she's<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.480> gonna<00:03:03.750> grub<00:03:04.050> of

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
then eventually she's just gonna grub of

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.610 
then eventually she's just gonna grub of
him<00:03:05.250> as<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> friend<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.840> she's<00:03:07.230> eventually

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
him as a friend and she's eventually

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.100 
him as a friend and she's eventually
like<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.250> meeting<00:03:08.640> gonna<00:03:09.600> start<00:03:09.840> loving<00:03:10.350> him<00:03:10.590> so

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
like a meeting gonna start loving him so

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.220 
like a meeting gonna start loving him so
the<00:03:13.110> fact<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.830> she<00:03:14.519> goes<00:03:15.510> home<00:03:15.720> as<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> friend

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
the fact that she goes home as a friend

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.870 
the fact that she goes home as a friend
that's<00:03:16.440> why<00:03:16.650> he<00:03:16.860> always<00:03:16.980> treats<00:03:17.370> her<00:03:17.580> like<00:03:17.610> she

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
that's why he always treats her like she

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.580 
that's why he always treats her like she
always<00:03:17.970> says<00:03:18.239> how<00:03:18.330> he<00:03:18.390> took<00:03:18.630> me<00:03:18.750> ice<00:03:18.870> skating

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
always says how he took me ice skating

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.910 
always says how he took me ice skating
he<00:03:20.340> took<00:03:20.580> me<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.150> bone<00:03:21.300> meadows<00:03:21.600> he<00:03:22.530> treats

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
he took me to the bone meadows he treats

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.470 
he took me to the bone meadows he treats
her<00:03:23.190> because<00:03:23.640> they're<00:03:24.239> really<00:03:24.690> good<00:03:24.900> friends

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
her because they're really good friends

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.630 
her because they're really good friends
so<00:03:27.480> they<00:03:27.840> don't<00:03:28.079> have<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.380> get<00:03:28.709> married<00:03:28.860> that's

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
so they don't have to get married that's

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.310 
so they don't have to get married that's
also<00:03:29.850> wise<00:03:30.209> like<00:03:30.510> he<00:03:30.870> was<00:03:31.019> really<00:03:31.260> excited

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
also wise like he was really excited

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.340 
also wise like he was really excited
about<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.400> when<00:03:32.519> she<00:03:32.549> found<00:03:32.940> out<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.600> that

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
about it when she found out and that

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.550 
about it when she found out and that
would<00:03:34.560> also<00:03:34.829> make<00:03:35.250> sense<00:03:35.700> because<00:03:36.030> if<00:03:36.720> she<00:03:37.260> was

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
would also make sense because if she was

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.350 
would also make sense because if she was
the<00:03:37.860> girl<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.400> astronaut<00:03:38.910> which<00:03:39.150> is

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
the girl in the astronaut which is

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.270 
the girl in the astronaut which is
almost<00:03:39.510> certain<00:03:40.290> now<00:03:42.799> it<00:03:43.799> would<00:03:44.040> make<00:03:44.250> sense

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
almost certain now it would make sense

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.699 
almost certain now it would make sense
why<00:03:44.730> he<00:03:44.760> just<00:03:45.180> let<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.600> astronaut<00:03:46.049> kill<00:03:46.380> him

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
why he just let the astronaut kill him

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.850 
why he just let the astronaut kill him
he'll<00:03:46.950> just<00:03:47.220> say<00:03:47.400> up<00:03:48.060> yeah<00:03:48.420> it's<00:03:49.380> okay<00:03:49.709> i<00:03:49.739> know

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
he'll just say up yeah it's okay i know

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.250 
he'll just say up yeah it's okay i know
you<00:03:50.070> issue<00:03:50.489> right<00:03:51.150> then<00:03:51.420> because<00:03:51.810> he<00:03:52.019> knows<00:03:52.230> he

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
you issue right then because he knows he

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.370 
you issue right then because he knows he
has<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.620> do<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.220> he<00:03:53.310> trusts<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.090> girl

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
has to do that and he trusts the girl

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.270 
has to do that and he trusts the girl
cuz<00:03:55.380> he's<00:03:56.239> raised<00:03:57.239> her<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.980> would<00:03:59.130> make

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
cuz he's raised her and it would make

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.810 
cuz he's raised her and it would make
sense<00:03:59.310> well<00:04:00.049> why<00:04:01.049> river<00:04:01.950> song<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.519> storm

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
sense well why river song is in storm

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.860 
sense well why river song is in storm
cage<00:04:03.120> because<00:04:03.570> she<00:04:03.720> killed<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.079> good<00:04:04.260> man<00:04:04.500> but

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
cage because she killed a good man but

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.000 
cage because she killed a good man but
that<00:04:06.870> doesn't<00:04:07.769> quite<00:04:08.070> add<00:04:08.310> up<00:04:08.340> yet<00:04:08.820> and<00:04:10.010> that's

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
that doesn't quite add up yet and that's

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.009 
that doesn't quite add up yet and that's
why<00:04:11.310> she<00:04:11.640> was<00:04:11.670> specifically<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.810> girls

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
why she was specifically the girls

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.530 
why she was specifically the girls
saying<00:04:13.380> helped<00:04:14.190> me<00:04:14.340> specifically<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.420> the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
saying helped me specifically to the

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.719 
saying helped me specifically to the
doctor<00:04:15.989> because<00:04:16.079> she<00:04:16.350> trusted<00:04:16.799> him<00:04:16.979> but<00:04:17.579> he

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
doctor because she trusted him but he

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.240 
doctor because she trusted him but he
didn't<00:04:18.000> trust<00:04:18.269> her<00:04:18.570> yet<00:04:18.840> because<00:04:19.100> he<00:04:20.100> hasn't

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
didn't trust her yet because he hasn't

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.420 
didn't trust her yet because he hasn't
met<00:04:20.609> her<00:04:20.820> yet<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.530> that's<00:04:22.530> where<00:04:22.860> my<00:04:23.100> theory

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
met her yet and that's where my theory

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.460 
met her yet and that's where my theory
of<00:04:23.669> saying<00:04:23.970> when<00:04:24.150> i<00:04:24.180> first<00:04:24.479> met<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.750> doctor<00:04:25.080> i

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
of saying when i first met the doctor i

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.620 
of saying when i first met the doctor i
was<00:04:25.860> a<00:04:25.950> scared<00:04:26.310> little<00:04:26.490> girl<00:04:26.669> from<00:04:27.150> rivers<00:04:27.479> all

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
was a scared little girl from rivers all

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.540 
was a scared little girl from rivers all
saying<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.350> now<00:04:28.979> makes<00:04:29.880> sense<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:31.550> was

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
saying that it now makes sense I was

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.360 
saying that it now makes sense I was
right<00:04:32.789> about<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.440> this<00:04:34.440> is<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.680> weird<00:04:34.890> parts

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
right about that this is the weird parts

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.399 
right about that this is the weird parts
now<00:04:35.610> that

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
now that

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.899 
now that
make<00:04:36.559> sense<00:04:37.179> I<00:04:38.739> hope<00:04:39.739> that<00:04:39.949> was<00:04:40.009> enough<00:04:40.189> you<00:04:40.729> to

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:40.909 
make sense I hope that was enough you to

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:48.999 
make sense I hope that was enough you to
take<00:04:41.209> in<00:04:41.569> because<00:04:46.119> and<00:04:47.119> so<00:04:47.959> that's<00:04:48.469> like<00:04:48.679> were

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:49.009 
take in because and so that's like were

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.089 
take in because and so that's like were
hard<00:04:49.869> so<00:04:50.869> basically<00:04:51.169> all<00:04:51.289> he<00:04:51.469> does<00:04:51.679> he<00:04:51.889> raised

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
hard so basically all he does he raised

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.249 
hard so basically all he does he raised
himself<00:04:52.550> when<00:04:53.029> he<00:04:53.179> trusts<00:04:53.479> her<00:04:53.629> to<00:04:53.779> kill<00:04:54.019> him

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
himself when he trusts her to kill him

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.619 
himself when he trusts her to kill him
and<00:04:54.769> that's<00:04:54.919> why<00:04:55.069> he<00:04:55.099> treats<00:04:55.519> her<00:04:55.729> in<00:04:55.909> and

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
and that's why he treats her in and

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.379 
and that's why he treats her in and
stuff<00:04:57.019> in<00:04:57.229> later<00:04:57.649> life<00:04:58.039> but<00:04:58.399> then<00:04:58.580> still<00:04:59.089> that

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
stuff in later life but then still that

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.609 
stuff in later life but then still that
wouldn't<00:05:00.080> quite<00:05:00.409> make<00:05:00.739> sense<00:05:01.719> mmm<00:05:02.719> cuz<00:05:03.529> the

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:03.619 
wouldn't quite make sense mmm cuz the

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:05.379 
wouldn't quite make sense mmm cuz the
dogs<00:05:03.860> would<00:05:04.129> still<00:05:04.339> have<00:05:04.489> to<00:05:04.519> come<00:05:04.789> back<00:05:04.819> alive

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
dogs would still have to come back alive

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.559 
dogs would still have to come back alive
when<00:05:05.809> he<00:05:06.159> should<00:05:07.159> treat<00:05:07.399> her<00:05:07.669> as<00:05:07.699> she's<00:05:08.059> older

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569 
when he should treat her as she's older

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:14.649 
when he should treat her as she's older
ah<00:05:09.639> my<00:05:10.639> theory<00:05:11.179> ruined<00:05:11.869> maybe<00:05:12.679> not<00:05:13.179> maybe<00:05:14.179> the

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
ah my theory ruined maybe not maybe the

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.290 
ah my theory ruined maybe not maybe the
hand<00:05:15.439> got<00:05:15.889> back<00:05:16.099> on<00:05:16.279> the<00:05:16.309> beach<00:05:16.610> off<00:05:16.909> the<00:05:17.119> boat

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
hand got back on the beach off the boat

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.819 
hand got back on the beach off the boat
because<00:05:17.509> he<00:05:17.809> was<00:05:17.959> coming<00:05:18.289> back<00:05:18.439> like<00:05:20.829> that

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:21.829 
because he was coming back like that

00:05:21.829 --> 00:05:24.040 
because he was coming back like that
makes<00:05:22.129> sense<00:05:22.399> but<00:05:23.329> what<00:05:23.539> doesn't<00:05:23.779> make<00:05:23.989> sense

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
makes sense but what doesn't make sense

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.869 
makes sense but what doesn't make sense
