00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
wheel one and push it up salts in line

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.430 
wheel one and push it up salts in line
and<00:02:18.459> don't<00:02:19.459> push<00:02:20.299> the<00:02:20.480> clint<00:02:20.690> fully<00:02:20.989> down<00:02:21.290> to

push it fully it won't spin so pull it
up<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.820> bit<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.720> sign<00:02:33.019> is<00:02:33.049> about<00:02:34.090> how<00:02:35.090> much<00:02:35.269> gap

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
up a bit the sign is about how much gap

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.729 
up a bit the sign is about how much gap
you<00:02:35.720> can<00:02:35.840> hardly<00:02:36.170> see<00:02:36.470> it<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:38.780> it'll<00:02:39.170> help<00:02:39.500> it

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
you can hardly see it but it'll help it

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:46.150 
you can hardly see it but it'll help it
to<00:02:39.950> spin<00:02:41.920> at<00:02:43.030> now<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.329> back<00:02:44.510> wheel<00:02:45.100> go<00:02:46.100> to

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
to spin at now for the back wheel go to

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.300 
to spin at now for the back wheel go to
use<00:02:46.400> this<00:02:46.579> and<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.680> just<00:02:48.860> poke<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.280> through

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
use this and you just poke it through

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.960 
use this and you just poke it through
this<00:02:49.610> pop<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:53.570> can<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:53.840> see<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> bulb

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
this pop you can just see it on the bulb

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.630 
this pop you can just see it on the bulb
and<00:02:55.970> you're<00:02:56.120> done<00:02:56.320> simple<00:02:57.320> screwed<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:57.739> let's

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
and you're done simple screwed on let's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.230 
and you're done simple screwed on let's
