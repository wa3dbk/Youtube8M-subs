you're presented with a list of songs

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.880 
you're presented with a list of songs
and<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.980> flip<00:02:14.280> through

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
and you can flip through

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.790 
and you can flip through
one<00:02:15.670> at<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.910> time<00:02:16.120> extra<00:02:16.660> which<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.590> not<00:02:17.770> really

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
one at a time extra which is not really

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.380 
one at a time extra which is not really
convenient<00:02:18.430> especially<00:02:18.610> if<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.030> have<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.180> long

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
convenient especially if you have a long

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.990 
convenient especially if you have a long
song<00:02:19.720> list<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.830> do<00:02:21.100> is<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.970> can

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
song list so you can do is you can

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.260 
song list so you can do is you can
rotate<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.690> device<00:02:24.720> horizontally<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.010> thus

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
rotate the device horizontally and thus

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
rotate the device horizontally and thus
automatically<00:02:28.270> switch<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.569> a<00:02:28.780> different<00:02:28.990> mode

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
automatically switch to a different mode

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.740 
automatically switch to a different mode

game mode is sensitive to tilt commands

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.320 
game mode is sensitive to tilt commands
and<00:02:36.250> not<00:02:36.730> necessarily<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.540> motion<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:39.520> by

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
and not necessarily the motion so by

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.210 
and not necessarily the motion so by
tilting<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> device<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.500> scroll<00:02:41.739> up<00:02:41.950> and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
tilting the device I can scroll up and

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.310 
tilting the device I can scroll up and
down<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:44.350> so<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.700> I<00:02:46.330> want<00:02:46.510> when<00:02:47.020> I<00:02:47.050> want<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
down like so and I want when I want to

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.979 
down like so and I want when I want to
stop<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.590> tilt<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.450> would<00:02:49.450> just<00:02:49.630> return<00:02:49.780> it

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
stop the tilt I would just return it

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.380 
stop the tilt I would just return it
return<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.950> device<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.489> home<00:02:51.850> zone<00:02:52.120> and

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
return the device to the home zone and

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.110 
return the device to the home zone and
the<00:02:53.080> home<00:02:53.290> zone<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.830> set<00:02:55.019> by<00:02:56.019> when<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:57.459> change

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
the home zone is set by when you change

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.060 
the home zone is set by when you change
the<00:02:58.269> device<00:02:58.540> orientation<00:02:58.860> so<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:01.209> was<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
the device orientation so this was the

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.290 
the device orientation so this was the
if<00:03:03.070> let's<00:03:03.310> say<00:03:03.370> right<00:03:03.610> now<00:03:03.760> I'm<00:03:03.820> holding<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
if let's say right now I'm holding the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.470 
if let's say right now I'm holding the
device<00:03:04.420> at<00:03:04.780> a<00:03:04.840> 45<00:03:05.290> degree<00:03:05.320> angle<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:07.239> were

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
device at a 45 degree angle and I were

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.790 
device at a 45 degree angle and I were
to<00:03:07.720> change<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.530> orientation<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:11.410> angle

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
to change the orientation this angle

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.680 
to change the orientation this angle
this<00:03:11.890> 45<00:03:12.340> degree<00:03:12.370> angle<00:03:13.030> would<00:03:13.180> be<00:03:13.239> my<00:03:13.450> home

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
this 45 degree angle would be my home

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.620 
this 45 degree angle would be my home
zone<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.230> if<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.440> told<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.739> device<00:03:14.950> down<00:03:15.630> you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
zone so if I told the device down you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.300 
zone so if I told the device down you
will<00:03:16.780> scroll<00:03:17.080> if<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.440> return<00:03:17.560> it<00:03:17.800> back<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:18.190> will

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
will scroll if I return it back it will

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.100 
will scroll if I return it back it will
stop<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.400> same<00:03:21.730> goes<00:03:21.760> for<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:23.160> tilt<00:03:24.160> up

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
stop and the same goes for the tilt up

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.350 
stop and the same goes for the tilt up
so<00:03:26.110> I'm<00:03:26.620> actually<00:03:26.799> exact<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.790> same<00:03:27.820> concept

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
so I'm actually exact the same concept

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.740 
so I'm actually exact the same concept
here<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.810> push<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:29.709> pull<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.190> can<00:03:30.570> prove<00:03:31.570> to

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
here of push and pull you can prove to

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.650 
here of push and pull you can prove to
set<00:03:31.900> up<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.170> song<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.650> I'm<00:03:36.060> pull<00:03:37.060> together<00:03:37.299> on

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
set up a song and I'm pull together on

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.380 
set up a song and I'm pull together on
it<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.910> with<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> song<00:03:40.390> playing<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:41.380> course

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
it and with a song playing and of course

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.640 
it and with a song playing and of course
change<00:03:43.390> the<00:03:43.570> orientation<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:44.140> device<00:03:44.380> once

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
change the orientation of device once

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.640 
change the orientation of device once
again<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.810> let's<00:03:47.019> take<00:03:47.200> a<00:03:47.260> look<00:03:47.470> at<00:03:47.590> another

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
again so let's take a look at another

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.740 
again so let's take a look at another
application<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.640> uses<00:03:48.790> exactly<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.540> same

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
application that uses exactly the same

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.190 
application that uses exactly the same
concepts<00:03:50.320> as<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> music<00:03:50.680> player<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:52.200> will

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
concepts as the music player I will

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.069 
concepts as the music player I will
click<00:03:53.410> my<00:03:53.620> hand<00:03:53.920> from<00:03:54.160> left<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.549> right<00:03:55.079> to

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
click my hand from left to right to

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.100 
click my hand from left to right to
select<00:03:56.560> different<00:03:56.860> pictures<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.959> could<00:03:58.959> also

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
select different pictures I could also

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.270 
select different pictures I could also
just<00:03:59.590> change<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.610> orientation<00:04:01.860> and<00:04:02.860> scroll

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
just change the orientation and scroll

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.949 
just change the orientation and scroll
continuously<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:05.370> can<00:04:06.370> call<00:04:06.549> back<00:04:06.610> I<00:04:07.150> can

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
continuously I can call back I can

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.050 
continuously I can call back I can
actually<00:04:08.110> use<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.680> push<00:04:08.860> command<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.610> select

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
actually use the push command to select

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.670 
actually use the push command to select
the<00:04:10.180> picture<00:04:12.630> like<00:04:13.630> so<00:04:13.930> and<00:04:16.380> continue<00:04:17.380> flip

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
the picture like so and continue flip

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.310 
the picture like so and continue flip
you<00:04:17.859> through<00:04:18.100> pictures<00:04:18.750> by<00:04:19.750> flicking<00:04:20.049> my

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
you through pictures by flicking my

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.590 
you through pictures by flicking my
wrist<00:04:20.560> what<00:04:21.519> I'm<00:04:21.640> done<00:04:21.850> only<00:04:22.000> have<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:22.360> do<00:04:22.479> is

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
wrist what I'm done only have to do is

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.320 
wrist what I'm done only have to do is
just<00:04:22.630> pull<00:04:22.990> up

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.999 

to<00:04:26.289> get<00:04:26.470> out<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:27.069> pull<00:04:27.400> up<00:04:27.520> again<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:29.919> have

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
to get out and pull up again you have

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.350 
to get out and pull up again you have
previously<00:04:30.220> seen<00:04:30.490> two<00:04:30.819> different<00:04:31.120> modes<00:04:31.180> of

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
previously seen two different modes of

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.580 
previously seen two different modes of
operation<00:04:31.530> one<00:04:32.530> relies<00:04:32.830> on<00:04:32.860> flaking<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:34.590> the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
operation one relies on flaking and the

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.790 
operation one relies on flaking and the
other<00:04:35.710> relies<00:04:36.099> on<00:04:36.129> tilt<00:04:40.169> but<00:04:41.169> how<00:04:41.469> would<00:04:41.530> you

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
other relies on tilt but how would you

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.290 
other relies on tilt but how would you
switch<00:04:42.039> the<00:04:42.250> modes<00:04:42.430> of<00:04:42.550> operation<00:04:42.669> without

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
switch the modes of operation without

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.429 
switch the modes of operation without
actually<00:04:44.129> rotating<00:04:45.129> the<00:04:45.189> device<00:04:45.599> well<00:04:46.599> we've

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
actually rotating the device well we've

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.179 
actually rotating the device well we've
implemented<00:04:48.569> and<00:04:49.569> that<00:04:50.229> way<00:04:50.439> so<00:04:50.500> you<00:04:50.830> can<00:04:51.009> use

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
implemented and that way so you can use

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.089 
implemented and that way so you can use
the<00:04:51.340> pen<00:04:51.580> key<00:04:52.259> to<00:04:53.259> toggle<00:04:53.650> between<00:04:53.830> different

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
the pen key to toggle between different

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.670 
the pen key to toggle between different
modes<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:55.240> right<00:04:55.449> now<00:04:55.479> I<00:04:55.930> switch<00:04:56.740> to<00:04:56.800> tilt<00:04:57.280> mode

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
modes so right now I switch to tilt mode

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.450 
modes so right now I switch to tilt mode
while<00:04:59.680> in<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.039> portrait<00:05:00.310> orientation<00:05:01.349> and<00:05:02.460> by

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
while in the portrait orientation and by

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.890 
while in the portrait orientation and by
pressing<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.500> band<00:05:05.500> key<00:05:05.740> again<00:05:06.159> I<00:05:06.400> will

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
pressing the band key again I will

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.920 
pressing the band key again I will
toggle<00:05:07.900> the<00:05:08.169> moment<00:05:08.440> back<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.770> flick<00:05:08.979> action

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
toggle the moment back to flick action

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:48.990 
toggle the moment back to flick action
and<00:05:10.930> here's<00:05:11.229> how<00:05:11.409> you<00:05:11.469> can<00:05:11.530> play<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:11.919> game

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.580 

can<00:05:50.000> rotate<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.389> screen<00:05:53.169> and<00:05:54.169> you<00:05:54.259> can<00:05:54.409> do<00:05:54.560> a

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
can rotate the screen and you can do a
