here and sometimes when it gets big it
slow<00:01:32.430> me<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.509> hard<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.869> into<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> wave

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
slow me and it's hard to get into a wave

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.289
