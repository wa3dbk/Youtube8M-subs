keyboard got slammed in the door after
rehearsal<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> know<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.650> should<00:00:31.769> have<00:00:31.830> had

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
rehearsal and I know I should have had

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.459 
rehearsal and I know I should have had
in<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.130> case<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.540> situation<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.380> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
in the case but the situation is just a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.790 
in the case but the situation is just a
little<00:00:34.680> easier<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.989> put<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> keyboard<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
little easier to put the keyboard in the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
little easier to put the keyboard in the
case<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.550> let<00:00:38.760> me<00:00:38.850> put<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.090> keyboard<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
case and let me put the keyboard in the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.209 
case and let me put the keyboard in the
car<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.290> come<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.920> there

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
car and just come on there

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
in order to get to the key bit on the 88

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.399 
in order to get to the key bit on the 88
key<00:01:13.500> ones<00:01:13.770> only<00:01:14.189> thing<00:01:14.369> he<00:01:14.430> had<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.790> was

and the push-button boards and all that
stuff<00:01:30.509> out<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.020> keyboard<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.860> order<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
stuff out of the keyboard in order to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.649 
stuff out of the keyboard in order to
get<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.400> key<00:01:32.579> bed<00:01:33.110> but<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:35.310> don't<00:01:36.240> trust<00:01:36.390> our

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
get to the key bed but I don't trust our

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.990 
get to the key bed but I don't trust our
repair<00:01:36.990> center<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> wanted<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
repair center here and so I wanted to

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
repair center here and so I wanted to
make<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.150> little<00:01:42.360> video<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.110> show<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
make this little video just to show this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.270 
make this little video just to show this
much<00:01:45.020> as<00:01:46.020> far<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> got<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> inside

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
much as far as how I got to the inside

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
much as far as how I got to the inside
of<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.790> maybe<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.149> will<00:01:48.270> help<00:01:48.420> someone<00:01:48.630> out

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
of it maybe this will help someone out

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.810 
of it maybe this will help someone out
in<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> future<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.189> these<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.549> end

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
in the future but are these little end

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.630 
in the future but are these little end
caps<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.390> they<00:01:51.750> go<00:01:51.960> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.340> side<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
caps here they go on the side of the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.249 
caps here they go on the side of the
board<00:01:54.590> there's<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:56.030> few<00:01:57.030> screws<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:58.079> there's

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
board there's a few screws think there's

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.880 
board there's a few screws think there's

interfere with anything and then the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
some screws right across the bottom of

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.690 
some screws right across the bottom of
here<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.120> top<00:02:50.450> row<00:02:50.780> only<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.650> top<00:02:51.830> row<00:02:52.070> don't

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
here the top row only the top row don't

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.190 
here the top row only the top row don't
leak<00:02:52.970> don't<00:02:53.210> take<00:02:53.420> these<00:02:53.570> off<00:02:53.810> because<00:02:53.930> that's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
leak don't take these off because that's

leak don't take these off because that's
the<00:02:54.350> hinges<00:02:54.740> there's<00:02:55.310> one<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.560> then<00:02:57.560> there's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
the hinges there's one and then there's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.710 
the hinges there's one and then there's
another<00:02:58.070> set<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.550> hinges<00:02:58.880> down<00:02:59.060> there<00:02:59.360> there's

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
another set of hinges down there there's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.340 
another set of hinges down there there's
two<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.590> just<00:03:00.710> take<00:03:00.920> off<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.930> set<00:03:03.200> of

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
two so you just take off the the set of

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.110 
two so you just take off the the set of
screws<00:03:03.560> across<00:03:03.770> the<00:03:03.950> top<00:03:04.130> they're<00:03:04.580> kind<00:03:05.060> of

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
screws across the top they're kind of

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.220 
screws across the top they're kind of
big<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.360> take<00:03:05.750> those<00:03:05.960> out<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.880> then

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
big you take those out and then

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.010 
big you take those out and then
miraculously<00:03:09.370> just<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.520> the<00:03:10.640> 88<00:03:11.000> key<00:03:11.210> you

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
miraculously just like the 88 key you

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.340 
miraculously just like the 88 key you
lift<00:03:12.230> this<00:03:12.380> hinge<00:03:12.620> up<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:14.200> then<00:03:15.200> you<00:03:15.320> have

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
lift this hinge up and then you have

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.290 
lift this hinge up and then you have
access<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:16.550> the<00:03:16.670> key<00:03:16.850> bay

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
access to the key bay

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.180 
access to the key bay
I<00:03:17.330> just<00:03:17.870> wanted<00:03:18.110> to<00:03:18.170> show<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.530> really

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
I just wanted to show that really

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.910 
I just wanted to show that really
quickly<00:03:20.170> maybe<00:03:21.170> that<00:03:21.410> will<00:03:21.500> help<00:03:21.650> somebody

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
quickly maybe that will help somebody

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.400 
quickly maybe that will help somebody
now<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.610> just<00:03:22.700> got<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.000> figure<00:03:23.270> out<00:03:23.570> how<00:03:24.200> to<00:03:24.260> get

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
now I just got to figure out how to get

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.740 
now I just got to figure out how to get
this<00:03:24.560> key<00:03:24.800> off<00:03:24.950> so<00:03:25.489> I<00:03:25.730> hope<00:03:26.360> this<00:03:26.540> helped

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
this key off so I hope this helped

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.770 
this key off so I hope this helped
someone<00:03:27.020> thanks<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.500> lot
