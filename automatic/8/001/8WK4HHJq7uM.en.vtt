you<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.430> know<00:01:12.520> we<00:01:12.670> sit<00:01:13.270> here<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:13.600> there's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
you you know we sit here and there's

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.930 
you you know we sit here and there's
it's<00:01:14.229> neat<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.740> cool<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.220> watch<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.820> rather

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
it's neat and cool to watch and rather

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.180 
it's neat and cool to watch and rather
scary<00:01:16.420> with<00:01:16.630> that<00:01:16.720> little<00:01:16.840> green<00:01:17.140> thing<00:01:17.890> going

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
scary with that little green thing going

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.730 
scary with that little green thing going
on<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.850> watch<00:01:19.060> Watson<00:01:19.750> house<00:01:20.020> those<00:01:20.409> winners

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
on to watch Watson house those winners

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.940 
on to watch Watson house those winners
but<00:01:21.159> this<00:01:21.970> is<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.150> broader<00:01:22.450> problem<00:01:23.080> perhaps<00:01:23.710> in

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
but this is a broader problem perhaps in

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.399 
but this is a broader problem perhaps in
our<00:01:24.010> society<00:01:25.110> absolutely<00:01:26.110> there's

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
our society absolutely there's

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.380 
our society absolutely there's
definitely<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.740> Hal<00:01:27.040> sense<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.670> seeing<00:01:27.939> Watson

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
definitely a Hal sense to seeing Watson

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.210 
definitely a Hal sense to seeing Watson
out<00:01:28.570> there<00:01:28.810> in<00:01:28.900> action<00:01:29.200> what<00:01:29.740> witnessing

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
out there in action what witnessing

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.460 
out there in action what witnessing
right<00:01:30.400> now<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:30.820> really<00:01:31.210> a<00:01:31.330> paradigm<00:01:31.900> shift<00:01:31.930> and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
right now is really a paradigm shift and

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.080 
right now is really a paradigm shift and
how<00:01:32.530> we<00:01:32.590> interact<00:01:33.100> with<00:01:33.460> machines<00:01:33.579> and

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
how we interact with machines and

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.969 
how we interact with machines and
anytime<00:01:34.570> there<00:01:34.899> is<00:01:34.929> a<00:01:35.020> paradigm<00:01:35.530> shift<00:01:35.560> its

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
anytime there is a paradigm shift its

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.310 
anytime there is a paradigm shift its
oftentimes<00:01:36.159> met<00:01:36.820> with<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.299> bit<00:01:37.600> of<00:01:37.750> reticence

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
oftentimes met with a bit of reticence

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.679 
oftentimes met with a bit of reticence
so<00:01:38.950> when<00:01:39.070> we<00:01:39.159> saw<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.429> telegraph<00:01:40.149> operator

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
so when we saw the telegraph operator

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.260 
so when we saw the telegraph operator
give<00:01:41.049> way<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.320> cell<00:01:41.979> phones<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:43.000> different

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
give way to cell phones and different

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.810 
give way to cell phones and different
communications<00:01:43.840> those<00:01:44.710> automations<00:01:45.520> and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
communications those automations and

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.149 
communications those automations and
artificial<00:01:46.359> intelligence<00:01:46.840> ultimately<00:01:47.710> opens

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
artificial intelligence ultimately opens

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.399 
artificial intelligence ultimately opens
avenues<00:01:48.579> for<00:01:48.609> new<00:01:49.210> jobs<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.719> new<00:01:49.810> employments

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.279 
avenues for new jobs and new employments
for<00:01:50.890> people<00:01:51.219> so<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:51.850> not<00:01:51.969> necessarily

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
for people so it's not necessarily

robots are going to be taking the jobs
that<00:01:55.359> are<00:01:55.509> available<00:01:55.539> it's<00:01:56.170> how<00:01:56.439> humans<00:01:56.829> are

about<00:03:19.030> with<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.840> lesson<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.350> Watson<00:03:20.920> is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
about with the lesson of Watson is

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.190 
about with the lesson of Watson is
something<00:03:21.610> called<00:03:21.730> neuro<00:03:22.090> plasticity<00:03:22.720> it's

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
something called neuro plasticity it's

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.830 
something called neuro plasticity it's
where<00:03:23.560> your<00:03:24.070> brain<00:03:24.400> changes<00:03:25.150> based<00:03:25.420> on<00:03:25.660> the

many<00:03:38.620> messages<00:03:39.100> coming<00:03:39.310> out<00:03:39.520> us<00:03:39.700> there's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
many messages coming out us there's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.570 
many messages coming out us there's
Twitter<00:03:40.239> there's<00:03:40.510> your<00:03:40.840> newsfeed<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.250> we

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
Twitter there's your newsfeed and so we

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.699 
Twitter there's your newsfeed and so we
don't<00:03:43.090> realize<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:44.170> way<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.530> we're

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
don't realize that the way that we're

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.979 
don't realize that the way that we're
different<00:03:45.160> from<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.550> machine<00:03:45.730> is<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:46.630> we<00:03:46.810> can

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
different from a machine is that we can

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.770 
different from a machine is that we can
synthesize<00:03:47.200> we<00:03:48.040> can<00:03:48.220> analyze<00:03:48.820> we<00:03:49.360> can<00:03:49.540> think

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
synthesize we can analyze we can think

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.470 
synthesize we can analyze we can think
and<00:03:49.930> act<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.620> make<00:03:51.010> decisions<00:03:51.480> emotionally

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
and act and make decisions emotionally

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.449 
and act and make decisions emotionally
not<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.140> based<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.500> data<00:03:53.769> which<00:03:54.100> is<00:03:54.130> all<00:03:54.430> that

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
not just based on data which is all that

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.910 
not just based on data which is all that
Watson<00:03:55.150> can<00:03:55.390> do<00:03:55.690> Watson<00:03:56.380> won<00:03:56.620> all<00:03:56.739> that<00:03:56.860> money

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
Watson can do Watson won all that money

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.890 
Watson can do Watson won all that money
and<00:03:57.160> didn't<00:03:57.430> say<00:03:57.519> great<00:03:57.760> Jim<00:03:58.120> Watson<00:03:58.450> jr.<00:03:58.600> can

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
and didn't say great Jim Watson jr. can

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.009 
and didn't say great Jim Watson jr. can
now<00:03:59.049> go<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.290> college<00:03:59.680> Watson<00:04:00.430> just<00:04:00.660> as<00:04:01.660> bad<00:04:01.840> as

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
now go to college Watson just as bad as

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.320 
now go to college Watson just as bad as
bits<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.650> bytes<00:04:02.860> we<00:04:03.130> don't<00:04:03.340> do<00:04:03.549> that<00:04:03.820> so<00:04:04.299> I

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
bits and bytes we don't do that so I

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.240 
bits and bytes we don't do that so I
think<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.750> lesson<00:04:04.959> we<00:04:05.230> can<00:04:05.260> take<00:04:05.620> from<00:04:05.680> Watson

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
think the lesson we can take from Watson

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.030 
think the lesson we can take from Watson
is<00:04:06.400> what<00:04:06.970> our<00:04:07.000> strengths<00:04:07.630> are<00:04:07.840> not<00:04:08.080> how<00:04:08.769> we're

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
is what our strengths are not how we're

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.590 
is what our strengths are not how we're
worse<00:04:09.280> than<00:04:09.549> Watson<00:04:09.940> that's<00:04:10.269> true<00:04:10.450> and<00:04:10.510> we

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
worse than Watson that's true and we

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.210 
worse than Watson that's true and we
give<00:04:10.720> Watson<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.200> name<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.620> all<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.799> sudden<00:04:12.010> I

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
give Watson a name and all the sudden I

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.370 
give Watson a name and all the sudden I
he<00:04:12.400> does<00:04:12.580> become<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.940> little

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
he does become a little

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.690 
he does become a little
anthropomorphised<00:04:14.380> right<00:04:14.830> so<00:04:15.370> Natalie

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
anthropomorphised right so Natalie

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.920 
anthropomorphised right so Natalie
what's<00:04:16.060> interesting<00:04:16.269> though<00:04:16.540> is<00:04:16.570> you're<00:04:16.810> also

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
what's interesting though is you're also

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.170 
what's interesting though is you're also
saying<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.410> more<00:04:18.040> automation<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.850> more

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
saying that more automation and more

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.729 
saying that more automation and more
information<00:04:19.780> can<00:04:19.959> make<00:04:20.140> our<00:04:20.290> jobs<00:04:20.530> easier

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
information can make our jobs easier

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.370 
information can make our jobs easier
what<00:04:21.010> do<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.130> deal<00:04:21.310> though<00:04:21.459> with<00:04:21.609> this<00:04:21.790> um<00:04:22.380> how

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
what do you deal though with this um how

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.330 
what do you deal though with this um how
do<00:04:23.440> you<00:04:23.500> do<00:04:23.590> with<00:04:23.650> the<00:04:23.770> issue<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.100> fact

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
do you do with the issue of the fact

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.180 
do you do with the issue of the fact
that<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.520> means<00:04:24.760> that<00:04:24.850> jobs<00:04:25.150> are<00:04:25.450> lost<00:04:26.190> well

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
that that means that jobs are lost well

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.190 
that that means that jobs are lost well
like<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.700> said<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.910> think<00:04:28.000> that<00:04:28.390> we<00:04:28.660> should<00:04:28.690> think

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
like I said I think that we should think

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.380 
like I said I think that we should think
about<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.590> jobs<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:29.950> we<00:04:30.250> can<00:04:30.550> automate<00:04:31.150> and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
about the jobs that we can automate and

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.090 
about the jobs that we can automate and
think<00:04:31.840> okay<00:04:32.110> that's<00:04:32.350> something<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.860> human

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
think okay that's something that a human

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.700 
think okay that's something that a human
once<00:04:33.400> did<00:04:33.729> but<00:04:33.880> there<00:04:34.090> are<00:04:34.180> jobs<00:04:34.419> now<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:35.500> we

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
once did but there are jobs now that we

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.760 
once did but there are jobs now that we
can<00:04:35.979> put<00:04:36.430> our<00:04:36.490> strengths<00:04:37.180> into<00:04:37.600> what<00:04:37.930> if<00:04:38.229> we

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
can put our strengths into what if we

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.350 
can put our strengths into what if we
all<00:04:38.950> went<00:04:39.160> to<00:04:39.340> work<00:04:39.520> every<00:04:39.880> day<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.210> thought

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
all went to work every day and thought

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.000 
all went to work every day and thought
well<00:04:40.540> the<00:04:40.750> reason<00:04:41.140> that<00:04:41.350> I'm<00:04:41.560> better<00:04:41.770> than<00:04:41.830> a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
well the reason that I'm better than a

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.250 
well the reason that I'm better than a
machine<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.550> because<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.880> can<00:04:43.240> synthesize<00:04:43.960> I

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
machine is because I can synthesize I

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.409 
machine is because I can synthesize I
can<00:04:44.680> think<00:04:44.890> more<00:04:44.979> profoundly<00:04:45.790> so<00:04:46.060> I'm<00:04:46.180> going

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
can think more profoundly so I'm going

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.170 
can think more profoundly so I'm going
to<00:04:46.479> capitalize<00:04:47.320> on<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.590> ability<00:04:48.400> as<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> human

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
to capitalize on that ability as a human

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.940 
to capitalize on that ability as a human
and<00:04:49.360> then<00:04:49.900> instead<00:04:50.229> of<00:04:50.290> just<00:04:50.380> trying<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.830> get

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
and then instead of just trying to get

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.040 
and then instead of just trying to get
on<00:04:51.070> an<00:04:51.190> assembly<00:04:51.460> line<00:04:51.700> we<00:04:52.390> all<00:04:52.570> thought<00:04:52.810> about

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
on an assembly line we all thought about

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.659 
on an assembly line we all thought about
how<00:04:53.260> we<00:04:53.320> can<00:04:53.560> think<00:04:53.740> outside<00:04:53.860> the<00:04:54.070> bus<00:04:54.340> I<00:04:54.520> mean

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
how we can think outside the bus I mean

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:55.719 
how we can think outside the bus I mean
when<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.270> workplace

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
when the workplace

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.420 
when the workplace
be<00:04:55.849> such<00:04:56.029> a<00:04:56.059> better<00:04:56.449> place<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.139> be<00:04:57.370> it's<00:04:58.370> an

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
be such a better place to be it's an

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.010 
be such a better place to be it's an
interesting<00:04:58.639> point<00:04:59.029> John<00:04:59.389> what<00:04:59.629> about<00:04:59.719> that

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
interesting point John what about that

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.420 
interesting point John what about that
you<00:05:00.169> know<00:05:00.199> but<00:05:00.439> some<00:05:00.589> people<00:05:00.830> make<00:05:00.949> sure<00:05:01.069> okay

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
you know but some people make sure okay

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.790 
you know but some people make sure okay
first<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:01.879> was<00:05:02.059> in<00:05:02.870> India<00:05:03.139> now<00:05:03.439> you've<00:05:03.650> got

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
first it was in India now you've got

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.739 
first it was in India now you've got
doctors<00:05:04.219> there<00:05:04.430> who<00:05:04.610> can<00:05:04.759> look<00:05:04.939> at<00:05:05.150> cat-scans

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:05.749 
doctors there who can look at cat-scans

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.390 
doctors there who can look at cat-scans
instead<00:05:06.110> of<00:05:06.199> people<00:05:06.469> here<00:05:06.710> I<00:05:06.740> mean<00:05:06.889> every

instead of people here I mean every
