00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.080
This is a story about a girl named Tris who
lives in a society that is divided into different

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.219
factions based on personality type and preference.

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.900
Her faction, Dauntless, recently attacked
her old faction, Abnegation, as the Dauntless

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.960
soldiers were under the control of the Erudite
through a brain simulation.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.130
Tris and those who managed to escape the attack
arrive at Amity headquarters.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.800
She is joined by her brother, Caleb, and her
trainer and romantic interest, Tobias, or

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.800
Four.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.030
The Amity leaders decide that the group can
only stay for a short time so Tris and her

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.379
group try to fit in.

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.750
Tris is hiding a hard drive that contains
valuable information related to the attacks

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.180
on the Abnegation by the Dauntless.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.579
However, Peter, a fellow runaway and Dauntless,
tries to take it and Tris attacks him.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.440
Because it’s against Amity policy to fight,
Tris is given a special serum that makes her

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.000
relax and happy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.730
The Erudite arrive and search the Amity buildings
for Tris and her group.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.180
However, Tris and her group manage to escape
by running into a field.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.550
They ride a train and encounter a group of
factionless, who take them to their secret

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.550
headquarters.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.780
There, they see that the factionless are more
organized than previously thought and that

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.890
Tobias' mother, Evelyn, is their leader, who
Tris thought was dead.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.159
Evelyn wants Tobias to help them fight against
the Erudite and Dauntless traitors, but Tobias

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.049
doesn't know what to do and leaves for Candor
headquarters to seek help.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.190
When Tobias and Tris arrive in Candor headquarters,
they are arrested and given truth serum that

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.640
reveals what happened with the Dauntless simulation.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.770
Under the serum, Tris reveals that she shot
her friend, Will, in self-defense during the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.770
attack.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.780
Tris meets up with some of the other Dauntless,
including some of her old friends.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.110
However, they are attacked by the Dauntless
traitors, led by Eric, a Dauntless leader,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.260
but aren’t killed.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.189
Eric only wants to find people who are Divergent
to take back to Jeanine.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.070
Tris is captured, but is rescued by her Dauntless
friends.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.970
Jack Kang, leader of the Candor, decides to
negotiate with Jeanine and the Erudite faction.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.119
Tris and a few of her friends sneak under
the bridge while the negotiations are going

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.119
on.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.600
However, Jeanine isn’t there, but is represented
by a Dauntless leader named Max.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.500
The negotiations go bad and shooting ensues.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.840
Tris realizes that Jeanine is nearby and so
she runs to a nearby building, but Jeanine

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840
escapes.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.590
The Dauntless also choose new leaders, Tori,
Harrison, and Tobias, which means they can

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.560
order the execution of Eric.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.310
Tobias shoots Eric in the head.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.780
Jack Kang announces the terms offered by Erudite,
which prompts the Dauntless to leave and return

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.780
home.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.260
There, a few of the Dauntless become controlled
under a simulation and jump off a building.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.000
A message from Erudite indicates that each
day more Dauntless will kill themselves unless

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.580
those who are Divergent turn themselves in.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.290
Tris decides to turn herself in and so she
goes to the Erudite headquarters.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.450
She is given a series of medical tests, which
reveal the workings of her brain and why she

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.480
is Divergent.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.140
She also discovers that Tobias turns himself
in and that her brother, Caleb, is working

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.140
with Jeanine.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.040
Tris is eventually scheduled to be executed
by a poison serum.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.870
The serum is injected and everyone believes
she’s dead.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.300
However, Peter changes the serum and so it
only paralyzes her.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.440
Peter helps her escape with Tobias and they
make it back to the Factionless hideout.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.209
Tris recovers from her injuries and talks
with Marcus, who reveals that there is something

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.540
beyond the fence that they don’t know about.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.880
He convinces her to work with him to retrieve
the information.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.950
Evelyn leads the factionless and the Dauntless
forces toward the Erudite headquarters, while

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.660
Marcus leads a secret team through the city
to recover the secret file that explains everything.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.810
The group enters the city and sneaks into
Erudite headquarters through a window.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.190
Tris eventually finds Jeanine, but Tori is
about to kill her.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.239
Tris fights Tori, saying that they need Jeanine
alive.

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.780
However, Tori stabs Jeanine and kills her.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.840
Tris is taken away as a traitor as the factionless
forces are victorious.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.159
However, Evelyn orders the Dauntless to give
up their weapons and reveals that the new

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.599
society will not have factions.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.629
In the end, a video plays over the screens
and reveals that all of the people in the

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.980
city were put there because of how cruel the
outside world has become and that they are

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.599
to be released back into the world when they
become Divergent.
