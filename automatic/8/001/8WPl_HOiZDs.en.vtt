like Ironman heads which I also agree
with<00:00:14.710> I<00:00:15.580> want<00:00:16.240> that<00:00:16.420> a<00:00:16.509> little<00:00:16.779> bit<00:00:16.869> more<00:00:17.170> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
with I want that a little bit more so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.380 
with I want that a little bit more so
here<00:00:19.029> we<00:00:19.090> go

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
here we go

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.859 
here we go
so<00:00:20.230> what<00:00:21.130> I<00:00:21.160> guess<00:00:21.490> you<00:00:21.520> can<00:00:21.789> say<00:00:22.029> is<00:00:22.330> a<00:00:22.359> mark

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
so what I guess you can say is a mark

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.480 
so what I guess you can say is a mark
one<00:00:23.260> I<00:00:23.560> use<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.670> red<00:00:25.359> glue<00:00:25.570> Torian<00:00:26.019> head<00:00:26.490> only

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
one I use a red glue Torian head only

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.089 
one I use a red glue Torian head only
the<00:00:27.849> fact<00:00:28.180> that<00:00:28.240> is<00:00:28.390> already<00:00:28.660> red<00:00:29.289> I<00:00:29.500> don't

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
the fact that is already red I don't

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.390 
the fact that is already red I don't
have<00:00:30.220> any<00:00:30.429> red<00:00:30.609> paint<00:00:30.640> with<00:00:31.029> me<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:32.439> that<00:00:33.280> would

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
have any red paint with me so that would

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.200 
have any red paint with me so that would
just<00:00:33.640> be<00:00:34.330> easier<00:00:34.540> for<00:00:34.750> me<00:00:34.930> as<00:00:35.199> you<00:00:35.890> can<00:00:36.040> see<00:00:36.280> I

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
just be easier for me as you can see I

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.890 
just be easier for me as you can see I
have<00:00:37.900> also<00:00:38.739> gold<00:00:39.280> paint<00:00:39.580> so<00:00:40.000> I<00:00:40.330> started

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
have also gold paint so I started

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.000 
have also gold paint so I started
painting<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.409> and<00:00:41.559> here<00:00:42.370> are<00:00:42.430> my<00:00:42.519> results<00:00:42.580> and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
painting it and here are my results and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910 
painting it and here are my results and
actually<00:00:45.010> looks<00:00:45.190> pretty<00:00:45.250> decent<00:00:46.920> actually

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
actually looks pretty decent actually

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.770 
actually looks pretty decent actually
does<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.339> I'm<00:00:48.400> actually<00:00:48.610> I<00:00:49.000> was<00:00:49.330> happy<00:00:49.629> with

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
does and I'm actually I was happy with

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.590 
does and I'm actually I was happy with
the<00:00:49.809> mark<00:00:50.140> one<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:51.000> show<00:00:52.000> you<00:00:52.059> a<00:00:52.180> picture<00:00:52.390> of

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
the mark one and show you a picture of

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.770 
the mark one and show you a picture of
him<00:00:52.930> on<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.470> car<00:00:54.540> some<00:00:55.540> other<00:00:55.750> more<00:00:56.019> pictures

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
him on a car some other more pictures

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.160 
him on a car some other more pictures
front<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.860> guess<00:01:02.860> it<00:01:02.979> looks<00:01:03.129> cool<00:01:03.339> on<00:01:03.369> him

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
front so I guess it looks cool on him

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.750 
front so I guess it looks cool on him
also<00:01:05.170> what<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.799> guess<00:01:06.040> would<00:01:06.250> be<00:01:06.280> his<00:01:06.549> lead

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
also what I guess would be his lead

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.760 
also what I guess would be his lead
farmer<00:01:07.090> costume<00:01:08.940> basically<00:01:09.940> before<00:01:10.930> he<00:01:11.290> had<00:01:11.500> a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
farmer costume basically before he had a

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.390 
farmer costume basically before he had a
attack<00:01:12.430> his<00:01:12.640> helmet<00:01:13.590> only<00:01:14.590> because<00:01:14.860> so<00:01:15.220> it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
attack his helmet only because so it

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.370 
attack his helmet only because so it
make<00:01:15.580> him<00:01:15.670> look<00:01:15.820> like<00:01:15.970> a<00:01:16.030> scroll<00:01:16.570> warrior<00:01:17.080> but

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
make him look like a scroll warrior but

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.160 
make him look like a scroll warrior but
I<00:01:17.590> think<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.100> blue<00:01:18.430> barracks<00:01:18.850> helmet<00:01:19.270> with

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
I think the blue barracks helmet with

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.670 
I think the blue barracks helmet with
the<00:01:20.470> little<00:01:20.890> scarf<00:01:21.220> thing<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:21.670> his<00:01:21.850> mouth<00:01:22.150> is

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the little scarf thing on his mouth is

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.250 
the little scarf thing on his mouth is
much<00:01:23.680> better<00:01:23.860> and<00:01:24.190> much<00:01:24.340> more<00:01:24.900> lead<00:01:25.900> farmer

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
much better and much more lead farmer

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.010 
much better and much more lead farmer
like<00:01:27.270> except<00:01:28.270> for<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.450> fact<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.720> the

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
like except for the fact that the

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.740 
like except for the fact that the
barracks<00:01:29.650> helmet<00:01:29.980> is<00:01:30.100> not<00:01:30.280> really<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.660> one<00:01:31.660> of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
barracks helmet is not really a one of

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.050 
barracks helmet is not really a one of
those<00:01:33.570> hats<00:01:34.570> that<00:01:35.080> they<00:01:35.110> used<00:01:35.530> in<00:01:35.860> Vietnam<00:01:36.250> but

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
those hats that they used in Vietnam but

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.970 
those hats that they used in Vietnam but
oh<00:01:37.360> well<00:01:37.690> so<00:01:38.680> uh<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:40.020> basically<00:01:41.020> used<00:01:41.530> something

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
oh well so uh I basically used something

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.280 
oh well so uh I basically used something
called<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.550> backlight<00:01:43.540> which<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.900> actually<00:01:44.260> a

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
called the backlight which is actually a

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.890 
called the backlight which is actually a
purple<00:01:44.680> light<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.130> what<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.060> does<00:01:46.210> is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
purple light and what it does is

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.380

so I'm gonna probably find a way to take

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:05.339 
so I'm gonna probably find a way to take
good<00:05:00.580> care<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.419> it<00:05:01.569> so<00:05:03.750> here's<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.810> picture<00:05:04.990> of

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
him of it on top and also on the back

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.450 
him of it on top and also on the back
and<00:05:10.289> now<00:05:13.050> surprisingly<00:05:14.050> enough<00:05:14.439> well<00:05:15.250> not

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
and now surprisingly enough well not

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.110 
and now surprisingly enough well not
surprisingly<00:05:15.939> enough<00:05:16.180> but<00:05:17.129> helmets<00:05:18.129> still

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
surprisingly enough but helmets still

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.089 
surprisingly enough but helmets still
fit<00:05:19.300> on<00:05:19.419> him<00:05:19.599> even<00:05:19.779> though<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.229> actually

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
fit on him even though I actually

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.749 
fit on him even though I actually
painted<00:05:21.849> in<00:05:22.300> plus<00:05:22.870> rod<00:05:23.139> I<00:05:23.229> put<00:05:23.469> paint<00:05:23.759> inside

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
painted in plus rod I put paint inside

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.309 
painted in plus rod I put paint inside
the<00:05:24.939> plus<00:05:25.120> rod<00:05:25.330> and<00:05:25.509> painted<00:05:26.319> blanket<00:05:28.319> painted

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
the plus rod and painted blanket painted

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.249 
the plus rod and painted blanket painted
all<00:05:29.499> inside<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.729> the<00:05:31.120> plus<00:05:31.330> rods<00:05:31.599> and<00:05:31.810> also<00:05:32.139> on

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:32.259 
all inside of the plus rods and also on

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:33.959 
all inside of the plus rods and also on
the<00:05:32.349> pasta<00:05:32.770> rides<00:05:32.919> on<00:05:33.099> the<00:05:33.219> side<00:05:33.550> of<00:05:33.669> his<00:05:33.789> head

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:33.969 
the pasta rides on the side of his head

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:36.390 
the pasta rides on the side of his head
or<00:05:34.419> basically<00:05:35.139> I<00:05:35.169> guess<00:05:35.529> the<00:05:35.710> ears<00:05:35.949> would<00:05:36.189> be

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
or basically I guess the ears would be

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.179 
or basically I guess the ears would be
and<00:05:36.870> plus<00:05:37.870> rod<00:05:38.050> pieces<00:05:38.500> and<00:05:38.770> anything<00:05:39.039> like

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
and plus rod pieces and anything like

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.320 
and plus rod pieces and anything like
that<00:05:39.250> they<00:05:39.460> still<00:05:39.699> go<00:05:39.819> and<00:05:39.969> even<00:05:40.180> though

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
that they still go and even though

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.089 
that they still go and even though
there's<00:05:40.539> paint<00:05:40.810> there<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:41.229> I<00:05:41.319> was<00:05:41.800> exactly

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
there's paint there and I was exactly

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:43.860 
there's paint there and I was exactly
surprised<00:05:42.580> because<00:05:42.849> the<00:05:43.120> paint<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.719> red

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
surprised because the paint the red

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.059 
surprised because the paint the red
