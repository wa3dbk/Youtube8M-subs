00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.829
 Hi everyone 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.590
 then one of the most frequently asked questions 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.490
 that is sent to me 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.539
 when we say you users ask me 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.189
 advice on preparing herbs 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:28.890
 then Ayurvedic to all healing herbs 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.260
 have bedin stories and how do you make it 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.530
 the most spreadable batter 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.870
 this happens because some plants or 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.730
 flowers, however, some herbs because it 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.559
 all the herbs are sheets and some are 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.120
 some flowers are roots depends on 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.640
 so many things are not successful 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.890
 a micro nizar is good so they remain a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.829
 little bit minced in a way 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.260
 coarse so when we go to 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.000
 kneading does not create a cream but yes 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.899
 create a dough a little grainy 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.890
 so when we go to this 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.189
 problem we can make several attempts 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.610
 to try to say how to make this 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.290
 more muddy cream so that it is 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.750
 even more comfortable to spread than not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.670
 fall apart while while Africa 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.490
 because it's really uncomfortable and there 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.740
 I understand why you know how much each 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430
 I make herbs on my hair 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.329
 then you can always add us in the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.540
 batter the flaxseed gel which is yes 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.110
 against being done at home you can add us 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.640
 also the gel from the eu but be careful 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.610
 don't overdo it because then it gets too much 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.590
 so much liquid and throw away those who don't have it 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 now at home or something even more 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 very cool in my opinion 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.250
 you know that the made of fenugreek when 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.979
 is left in warm water or as 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 you always want water is for a couple 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.540
 hours 23 hours issue 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.610
 images these mucilages tend to 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.610
 create a very very dough 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.770
 muddy and that becomes almost a kind of 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.440
 I don't mean glue in the sensors 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.770
 sticky but something so much 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.320
 pleasant if not then mixed 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.510
 if you put the meti that is left in 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.880
 contact with water for two hours and it 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.600
 mix with the herbs you already have 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.170
 prepared becomes a spreadable cream 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.270
 yes but it is a very very pleasant thing 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.610
 obviously if you have many needs in 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.709
 then and there are no white hairs 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.300
 don't use a lot of mids because 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.489
 we know that the mids is not an herb 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.870
 tinctoria, however, can help us 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.110
 from the point of view of the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.480
 spreadability another method we say for 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.140
 with to make the batter more 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.640
 spreadable is to insert inside 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.100
 of the batter when we prepare it 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.100
 balms or masks of those 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.540
 nutrients of those nutrients here though 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.060
 care must be taken 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.980
 not because who knows what could happen 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.959
 but because being substances that 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.400
 basically they are fat because they are 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.390
 composed of oils and butters of many 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.030
 substances could prevent the perfect 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.670
 contact the bond between tinctoria e 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.510
 hair so if you do healing herbs 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.519
 you can easily put the 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.860
 balm the mask that is not so 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.959
 you say we need stories below 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.209
 this point of view is instead you have to 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.340
 make snow you need to understand you have to 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.250
 cover white hair and then in 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.430
 that case it is better to have difficulty 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.270
 during the application rather than 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.920
 put a balm or an oil or a cream 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.990
 which makes the application spreadable 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.280
 but at the same time you could 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.980
 get the result not exceptional 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.690
 because oils and butters tend anyway 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.380
 a little bit to film the hair for 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.170
 which if there is no contact between hair herbs 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.660
 the hat can hardly be colored let's say 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.420
 which therefore has difficulties 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.470
 are the methods that I obviously use 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.870
 but there are so many others there was ho 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.840
 noticed that there are even gods 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.989
 particular types of bienne proper of 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.670
 some brands when they leave 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.060
 challenge in your own lemon juice 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.250
 I speak of n lauson inermis sele use 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.530
 only with water and then wait for l 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.060
 I use immediately and immediately apply them 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.830
 a bit grainy six to leave 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.560
 challenge a note of lemon juice o 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.530
 in the vinegar they become creamier I don't know 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.930
 what can this depend on? 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.100
 but what you do with your attempts you know 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.590
 good that there are no rules 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.870
 set these things up 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.670
 so do your tried and tested attempts 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.080
 on our hair and so you can 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.260
 be accountable and get an idea 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.380
 let me know how you prepare better 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.110
 your story of food to make it 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.150
 as spreadable as possible I thank you 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.750
 for the vision and we will meet again soon 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.750
 Hello
