so<00:00:04.209> every<00:00:05.209> other<00:00:05.330> hole<00:00:05.720> on<00:00:06.049> the<00:00:06.410> rim<00:00:07.029> is

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
so every other hole on the rim is

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.450 
so every other hole on the rim is
exposed<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:09.139> all<00:00:09.650> of<00:00:09.860> those<00:00:10.009> should<00:00:10.429> be

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
exposed and all of those should be

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.169 
exposed and all of those should be
facing<00:00:10.820> the<00:00:11.240> non-drive<00:00:11.900> side<00:00:11.960> of<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.799> rim<00:00:13.179> now

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
facing the non-drive side of the rim now

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.620 
facing the non-drive side of the rim now
when<00:00:14.570> lacing<00:00:15.019> the<00:00:15.589> non-drive<00:00:16.160> side<00:00:16.219> I<00:00:16.939> prefer

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
when lacing the non-drive side I prefer

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.540 
when lacing the non-drive side I prefer
to<00:00:18.560> do<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:20.480> knees<00:00:21.349> first<00:00:21.830> meaning<00:00:22.430> that

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
to do the the knees first meaning that

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.910 
to do the the knees first meaning that
they're<00:00:22.730> coming<00:00:23.029> from<00:00:23.179> the<00:00:23.300> outside<00:00:23.480> of<00:00:24.230> the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
flange and the key to those is you want

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.389 
flange and the key to those is you want
to<00:00:31.880> select<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.780> hole<00:00:34.000> that<00:00:35.000> allows<00:00:35.420> you<00:00:35.840> to

to select the hole that allows you to

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.569 
to select the hole that allows you to

hammer but you'll want to be able to
lace<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:54.050> spoke<00:00:57.910> into<00:00:59.440> the<00:01:00.440> larger<00:01:00.890> gap<00:01:01.219> so

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
lace the spoke into the larger gap so

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.140 
lace the spoke into the larger gap so
that<00:01:02.269> you<00:01:02.329> can<00:01:02.510> actually<00:01:02.809> move<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.680> spoke<00:01:04.150> if

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
that you can actually move the spoke if

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.060 
that you can actually move the spoke if
I<00:01:05.360> was<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:06.080> lace<00:01:07.210> this<00:01:08.210> hole<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.900> next<00:01:09.740> hole<00:01:09.920> on

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
I was to lace this hole the next hole on

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.810 
I was to lace this hole the next hole on
the<00:01:10.190> hub<00:01:10.400> I<00:01:11.390> would<00:01:11.990> find<00:01:12.290> myself<00:01:12.500> only<00:01:13.070> able<00:01:13.520> to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
the hub I would find myself only able to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.900 
the hub I would find myself only able to
put<00:01:14.030> it<00:01:14.150> through<00:01:14.390> here<00:01:14.750> into<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:16.370> already

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
put it through here into this already

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.120 
put it through here into this already
formed<00:01:17.300> tight<00:01:17.540> triangle<00:01:18.170> where<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.410> could<00:01:19.010> not

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
formed tight triangle where I could not

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.910 
formed tight triangle where I could not
do<00:01:19.340> anything<00:01:19.580> with<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.970> spoke<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.230> in<00:01:21.500> that

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
do anything with the spoke so in that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.100 
do anything with the spoke so in that
also<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:22.730> kind<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.360> self-fulfilling

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
also it's kind of a self-fulfilling

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.510 
also it's kind of a self-fulfilling
prophecy<00:01:25.720> in<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.810> way<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:27.680> it<00:01:27.830> directs<00:01:28.220> you

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
prophecy in a way because it directs you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.420 
prophecy in a way because it directs you
as<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.240> as<00:01:29.510> to<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.080> obvious<00:01:30.260> placement<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.310> the

as to as to the obvious placement of the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.180 
as to as to the obvious placement of the
spokes<00:01:31.730> so<00:01:34.750> we<00:01:35.750> will<00:01:35.900> go<00:01:36.050> around<00:01:36.200> once<00:01:37.040> we

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
spokes so we will go around once we

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.490 
spokes so we will go around once we
locate<00:01:37.430> one<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:37.880> those<00:01:38.120> we<00:01:38.570> simply<00:01:39.050> go<00:01:39.380> around

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
locate one of those we simply go around

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
locate one of those we simply go around
skip<00:01:40.040> every<00:01:40.430> other<00:01:40.460> hole<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.540> drop<00:01:41.840> in

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
skip every other hole and drop in

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.410 
skip every other hole and drop in
another<00:01:43.600> seven<00:01:44.600> spokes<00:01:44.990> from<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.530> outside

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
another seven spokes from the outside

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.940 
another seven spokes from the outside
I'm<00:01:47.420> using<00:01:47.930> my<00:01:48.170> thumb<00:01:48.790> at<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.940> far<00:01:50.180> side<00:01:50.950> just

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
I'm using my thumb at the far side just

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.440 
I'm using my thumb at the far side just
it's<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:52.570> existing<00:01:53.570> spokes<00:01:53.960> out<00:01:54.260> of<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.470> way

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
it's the existing spokes out of the way

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.080 
it's the existing spokes out of the way
okay<00:01:56.450> now<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:57.500> have<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.920> set<00:01:58.370> of<00:01:58.550> eight<00:01:58.730> spokes

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
okay now we have a set of eight spokes

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.790 
okay now we have a set of eight spokes
so<00:01:59.710> we've<00:02:00.710> dropped<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.460> ink<00:02:01.820> folks<00:02:02.590> on<00:02:03.590> the

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
so we've dropped the ink folks on the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.980 
so we've dropped the ink folks on the
non-drive<00:02:04.010> side<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.000> flange<00:02:05.270> into<00:02:05.900> the

non-drive side of the flange into the
hub<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:09.410> next<00:02:09.710> step<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.490> low

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
hub and the next step is to low

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.869 
hub and the next step is to low
key<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:12.040> bell<00:02:12.220> pole<00:02:12.640> on<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> rim<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:14.879> the

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
key the bell pole on the rim and the

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.509 
key the bell pole on the rim and the
existing<00:02:16.780> lace<00:02:17.019> spoke<00:02:17.500> that's<00:02:17.860> next<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
existing lace spoke that's next to the

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.059 
existing lace spoke that's next to the
valve<00:02:18.730> hole<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.330> rim<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.530> we'll<00:02:20.709> follow

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
valve hole on the rim and we'll follow

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.080 
valve hole on the rim and we'll follow
that<00:02:21.190> up<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.879> hub<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.569> we<00:02:22.629> want<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.080> select

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that up the hub and we want to select

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.300 
that up the hub and we want to select
the<00:02:25.090> spoke<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.989> non-drive<00:02:26.230> side<00:02:26.590> that's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the spoke on the non-drive side that's

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.660 
the spoke on the non-drive side that's
opposite<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.569> hole<00:02:31.830> which<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.280> spoke

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
opposite that hole which it's this spoke

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.160 
opposite that hole which it's this spoke
here<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:37.440> again<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:39.099> is<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.489> create

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
here so again that that is to create

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.100 
here so again that that is to create
parallel<00:02:41.220> spokes<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.640> either<00:02:43.329> side<00:02:43.690> of<00:02:43.720> the

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
parallel spokes on either side of the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.240 
parallel spokes on either side of the
valve<00:02:44.319> hole<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:46.180> we<00:02:46.390> fault<00:02:47.319> all<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.890> one<00:02:48.069> up

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
valve hole so we fault all the one up

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.420 
valve hole so we fault all the one up
that's<00:02:48.459> existing<00:02:49.120> that's<00:02:49.450> waste<00:02:50.130> we<00:02:51.130> look<00:02:51.280> at

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
that's existing that's waste we look at

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.750 
that's existing that's waste we look at
that<00:02:51.610> slope<00:02:52.530> go<00:02:53.530> straight<00:02:53.890> across<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:55.150> axle

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
starting networks so and now we again

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.520 
starting networks so and now we again
continue<00:03:57.579> with<00:03:57.790> our<00:03:57.819> pattern<00:03:58.349> we'll<00:03:59.349> go<00:03:59.470> to

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
continue with our pattern we'll go to

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.250 
continue with our pattern we'll go to
the<00:03:59.739> next<00:03:59.859> spoke<00:04:00.389> we'll<00:04:01.389> skip<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:03.840> an<00:04:04.840> empty

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
the next spoke we'll skip a an empty

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.240 
the next spoke we'll skip a an empty
hole<00:04:05.620> along<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:06.010> rim<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.769> we'll<00:04:08.950> save<00:04:09.220> that

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
hole along the rim and we'll save that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.170 
hole along the rim and we'll save that
for<00:04:09.819> smokes<00:04:10.359> coming<00:04:10.989> out<00:04:11.650> of<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.639> side<00:04:12.880> that

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
for smokes coming out of the side that

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.759 
for smokes coming out of the side that
valleys<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:15.250> we'll<00:04:15.459> skip<00:04:15.790> every<00:04:16.389> other<00:04:16.769> but

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
valleys so we'll skip every other but

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.009 
valleys so we'll skip every other but
again<00:04:17.919> it's<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.340> same<00:04:18.370> pattern<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.150> one<00:04:19.630> two

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
again it's the same pattern of one two

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:20.610 
again it's the same pattern of one two
three

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620

throughout<00:04:24.699> the<00:04:25.419> entire<00:04:25.720> room<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.620> and<00:04:26.800> now

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
throughout the entire room so and now

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.240 
throughout the entire room so and now
we'll<00:04:27.160> continue<00:04:27.190> with<00:04:27.699> our<00:04:27.850> pattern<00:04:29.250> every

we'll continue with our pattern every
fourth<00:04:30.580> hole<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.500> start<00:04:32.830> at<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:33.040> bellpull

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510

don't drop the nipple in to the rim if

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.870 
don't drop the nipple in to the rim if
it's<00:04:59.260> a<00:04:59.350> deep<00:04:59.530> section<00:05:00.070> rim<00:05:00.310> because<00:05:00.669> you'll

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
it's a deep section rim because you'll

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.840 
it's a deep section rim because you'll
lose<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.330> inside<00:05:01.990> doing<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:03.400> have<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.610> speed

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.370 
lose it inside doing you have to speed
it<00:05:03.880> with<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.419> Peter<00:05:04.660> spoke<00:05:05.050> from<00:05:05.320> the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
it with the Peter spoke from the

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.879 
it with the Peter spoke from the
backside<00:05:05.919> so<00:05:07.080> we've<00:05:08.080> established<00:05:08.229> our

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
backside so we've established our

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:13.680 
backside so we've established our
pattern<00:05:09.370> and<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:12.340> last<00:05:12.580> quarter<00:05:13.450> of<00:05:13.570> the

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
pattern and the the last quarter of the

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.340 
pattern and the the last quarter of the
spokes<00:05:13.990> are<00:05:14.380> pretty<00:05:15.220> obvious<00:05:15.639> where<00:05:15.850> they<00:05:15.970> go

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
spokes are pretty obvious where they go

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.250 
spokes are pretty obvious where they go
and<00:05:17.350> they<00:05:17.770> drop<00:05:18.160> in<00:05:19.110> from<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.380> inside<00:05:21.960> so<00:05:22.960> you

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
and they drop in from the inside so you

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.180 
and they drop in from the inside so you
simply<00:05:23.710> drop<00:05:23.949> those<00:05:24.220> in<00:05:25.740> all<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:26.889> way<00:05:26.979> around

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
simply drop those in all the way around

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.010 
simply drop those in all the way around
the<00:05:27.340> hub<00:05:32.340> will<00:05:33.340> grab<00:05:34.030> those<00:05:34.300> from<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.630> bottom

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
the hub will grab those from the bottom

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.620 
the hub will grab those from the bottom
while<00:05:35.200> they're<00:05:35.350> hanging<00:05:35.770> kind<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.300> place<00:05:37.300> them

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
get the elbow of the spoke placed

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.279 
get the elbow of the spoke placed

properly on the flange of the pub and

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.260 
properly on the flange of the pub and
now<00:05:56.560> we<00:05:57.039> no<00:05:57.220> longer<00:05:57.250> have<00:05:57.729> to<00:05:57.789> concern

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
now we no longer have to concern

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.779 
now we no longer have to concern
ourselves<00:05:58.300> with<00:05:59.849> with<00:06:00.849> the<00:06:01.440> valve<00:06:02.440> pole<00:06:02.830> we

ourselves with with the valve pole we

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.190 
ourselves with with the valve pole we
simply<00:06:04.270> grab<00:06:05.050> any<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.550> last<00:06:06.789> 8<00:06:07.599> of<00:06:07.960> the

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
simply grab any of the last 8 of the

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:16.460 
simply grab any of the last 8 of the
spokes<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:08.860> we<00:06:09.780> cross<00:06:13.710> over

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
spokes and we cross over

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:27.470 
spokes and we cross over
under<00:06:22.860> so<00:06:23.860> we're<00:06:24.040> going<00:06:24.660> over<00:06:25.660> over<00:06:25.930> and<00:06:26.350> under

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
under so we're going over over and under

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.890 
under so we're going over over and under
over<00:06:28.480> over<00:06:29.020> under<00:06:29.680> and<00:06:32.460> when<00:06:33.460> you<00:06:33.550> do<00:06:33.700> this<00:06:33.900> you

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
over over under and when you do this you

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.750 
over over under and when you do this you
want<00:06:35.020> to<00:06:35.140> try<00:06:35.590> to<00:06:35.680> hold<00:06:35.920> on<00:06:36.130> to<00:06:36.280> the<00:06:36.370> end<00:06:36.550> of<00:06:36.700> the

want to try to hold on to the end of the

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.510 
want to try to hold on to the end of the
stove<00:06:37.090> so<00:06:37.420> there's<00:06:38.020> not<00:06:38.170> to<00:06:38.350> scratch<00:06:38.770> your<00:06:39.250> rim

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
stove so there's not to scratch your rim

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.130 
stove so there's not to scratch your rim
when<00:06:40.000> you<00:06:40.090> pull<00:06:40.390> it<00:06:40.450> back<00:06:40.480> up<00:06:40.870> because<00:06:40.960> you

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
when you pull it back up because you

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.920 
when you pull it back up because you
have<00:06:41.230> to<00:06:41.320> tuck<00:06:41.590> it<00:06:41.770> under<00:06:42.130> and<00:06:42.160> pull<00:06:42.670> it<00:06:42.760> out

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:42.930 
have to tuck it under and pull it out

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.100 
have to tuck it under and pull it out
okay

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
okay

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.170 
okay
and<00:06:44.410> then<00:06:44.530> we<00:06:44.650> continue<00:06:45.310> with<00:06:45.430> our<00:06:45.580> pattern

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.480 

which<00:06:49.180> is<00:06:49.480> pretty<00:06:50.290> self-evident<00:06:50.800> at<00:06:51.340> this

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
which is pretty self-evident at this

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.830 
which is pretty self-evident at this
point<00:06:52.230> over<00:06:53.230> over<00:06:53.830> under<00:06:54.390> and<00:06:55.390> then<00:06:55.510> we<00:06:55.630> want

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 
point over over under and then we want

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.280 
point over over under and then we want
to<00:06:55.990> verify<00:06:56.590> that<00:06:56.950> we<00:06:57.640> have<00:06:57.670> parallel<00:06:58.660> spokes

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
to verify that we have parallel spokes

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.220 
to verify that we have parallel spokes
at<00:06:59.740> the<00:07:00.070> valve<00:07:00.280> hole<00:07:01.860> which<00:07:02.860> we<00:07:03.070> do<00:07:03.930> at<00:07:04.930> this

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
at the valve hole which we do at this

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.510 
at the valve hole which we do at this
point<00:07:05.500> it's<00:07:05.860> a<00:07:06.040> good<00:07:06.070> idea<00:07:06.280> to<00:07:06.490> verify<00:07:08.520> your

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 
point it's a good idea to verify your

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.390 
point it's a good idea to verify your
spokes<00:07:09.910> that<00:07:10.420> there<00:07:10.660> that<00:07:11.200> all<00:07:11.470> of<00:07:11.620> them<00:07:11.800> are

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
spokes that there that all of them are

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.190 
spokes that there that all of them are
going<00:07:12.640> over<00:07:13.180> over<00:07:13.570> under

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.200 
going over over under

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.550 
going over over under
so<00:07:15.130> we'll<00:07:15.280> spin<00:07:15.550> the<00:07:15.700> wheel<00:07:15.880> and<00:07:16.230> you'll<00:07:17.230> feel

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:17.560 
so we'll spin the wheel and you'll feel

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.790 
so we'll spin the wheel and you'll feel
that<00:07:17.590> it's<00:07:17.920> over<00:07:18.370> over<00:07:18.700> under<00:07:19.030> over<00:07:19.800> over

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 
that it's over over under over over

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.100 
that it's over over under over over
under<00:07:21.010> flip<00:07:21.730> it<00:07:21.850> over<00:07:22.000> you<00:07:22.450> do<00:07:22.570> the<00:07:22.660> same<00:07:22.870> thing

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
under flip it over you do the same thing

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:27.600 
under flip it over you do the same thing
on<00:07:23.200> the<00:07:23.320> other<00:07:23.380> side<00:07:24.030> we're<00:07:25.030> going<00:07:26.400> over<00:07:27.400> over

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
on the other side we're going over over

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.190 
on the other side we're going over over
under<00:07:28.380> it's<00:07:29.380> critical<00:07:29.800> that<00:07:29.830> the<00:07:30.070> spokes

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:31.200 
under it's critical that the spokes

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.290 
under it's critical that the spokes
cross<00:07:32.200> over<00:07:33.190> each<00:07:33.820> other

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
cross over each other

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.950 
cross over each other
touching<00:07:35.230> that<00:07:35.380> or<00:07:35.560> not<00:07:35.970> if<00:07:36.970> we<00:07:37.180> forget<00:07:37.600> to<00:07:37.810> go

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:37.960 
touching that or not if we forget to go

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.970 
touching that or not if we forget to go
under<00:07:38.350> and<00:07:38.590> the<00:07:39.070> spokes<00:07:39.370> are<00:07:39.580> not<00:07:39.790> touching

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:40.980 
under and the spokes are not touching

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.890 
under and the spokes are not touching
not<00:07:41.980> only<00:07:42.310> will<00:07:42.580> it<00:07:42.610> change<00:07:42.940> the<00:07:43.360> lacing<00:07:43.780> of

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:43.900 
not only will it change the lacing of

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.900 
not only will it change the lacing of
the<00:07:43.990> wheel<00:07:44.170> so<00:07:44.950> we<00:07:44.980> want<00:07:45.220> to<00:07:45.280> verify<00:07:45.520> that

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:45.910 
the wheel so we want to verify that

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.450 
the wheel so we want to verify that
that's<00:07:46.360> taking<00:07:47.140> place<00:07:47.200> on<00:07:47.650> both<00:07:47.830> sides<00:07:48.190> of<00:07:48.370> the

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:48.460 
that's taking place on both sides of the

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.200 
that's taking place on both sides of the
wheel<00:07:48.640> but<00:07:49.540> also<00:07:49.750> that<00:07:50.050> serves<00:07:50.320> a<00:07:50.470> purpose<00:07:50.740> of

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.210 
wheel but also that serves a purpose of

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.940 
wheel but also that serves a purpose of
transferring<00:07:52.210> the<00:07:52.600> load<00:07:52.630> on<00:07:53.260> the<00:07:53.320> wheel<00:07:53.800> with

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:53.950 
transferring the load on the wheel with

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.950 
transferring the load on the wheel with
Bill<00:07:54.660> okay<00:07:55.660> the<00:07:55.840> next<00:07:56.080> step<00:07:56.230> is<00:07:56.680> to<00:07:57.810> true<00:07:58.810> the

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 
Bill okay the next step is to true the

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.540 
Bill okay the next step is to true the
wheel<00:07:59.140> and<00:08:00.330> the<00:08:01.330> first<00:08:02.040> thing<00:08:03.040> that<00:08:03.070> we'll<00:08:03.370> do

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:03.550 
wheel and the first thing that we'll do

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.180 
wheel and the first thing that we'll do
when<00:08:04.300> truing<00:08:04.660> the<00:08:04.750> rail<00:08:04.930> is<00:08:05.230> to<00:08:05.410> bring<00:08:05.680> all<00:08:05.860> the

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:06.190 
when truing the rail is to bring all the

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.670 
when truing the rail is to bring all the

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:08.680 
nipples up to the spoke threads to give

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.520 
nipples up to the spoke threads to give
it<00:08:08.800> more<00:08:09.130> for
