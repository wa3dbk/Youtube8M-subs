00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020 
I keep thinking that this um this thing
can<00:00:43.649> be<00:00:43.680> used<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> probably<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.879> some

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
can be used to probably get to some

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.569 
can be used to probably get to some
really<00:00:45.360> hidden<00:00:46.050> areas<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.770> here<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> use<00:00:47.370> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
really hidden areas like here I use it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
really hidden areas like here I use it
to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> starting<00:00:49.320> room<00:00:49.500> elevator

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to get from the starting room elevator

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
to get from the starting room elevator
the<00:00:50.370> place<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.879> puts<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> where<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the place that it puts you where the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
the place that it puts you where the
keys<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.829> actually<00:00:52.949> get<00:00:53.190> back<00:00:53.430> there

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
keys are you can actually get back there

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.400 
keys are you can actually get back there
may<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.210> grab<00:00:54.449> another<00:00:54.719> backup<00:00:55.020> key

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
may be like grab another backup key

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500 
may be like grab another backup key
after<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.829> set<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> elevator<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.360> just

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
after you set the elevator so you just

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.240 
after you set the elevator so you just
take<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> launcher<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.350> launch<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
take the launcher and launch up here and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.240 
take the launcher and launch up here and
it<00:00:59.969> works<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.270> fine<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.949> got<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> be

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
it works just fine now I'm you got to be

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
it works just fine now I'm you got to be
careful<00:01:02.399> maybe<00:01:02.699> jumping<00:01:03.090> back<00:01:03.329> maybe<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.229> it's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
careful maybe jumping back maybe if it's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
careful maybe jumping back maybe if it's
already<00:01:04.739> ready<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> launch<00:01:05.670> again<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
already ready to launch again and you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.030 
already ready to launch again and you
come<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.540> jump<00:01:06.780> back<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.350> could<00:01:07.680> launch<00:01:07.890> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
come to jump back it could launch you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
come to jump back it could launch you
right<00:01:08.070> back<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.570> convenient

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
right back this is a really convenient

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
right back this is a really convenient
to<00:01:10.110> pick<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.470> extra<00:01:10.560> key<00:01:10.979> after<00:01:11.340> resetting

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to pick up an extra key after resetting

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.390 
to pick up an extra key after resetting
the<00:01:11.939> elevator<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.900> works<00:01:13.650> pretty<00:01:13.860> good<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the elevator and works pretty good so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
the elevator and works pretty good so
one<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> other<00:01:15.450> spots<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.080> over<00:01:16.290> here

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
one of the other spots is over here

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920 
one of the other spots is over here
where<00:01:17.189> these<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.610> pink<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.659> little

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
where these little pink these little

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.590 
where these little pink these little
pink<00:01:19.110> bed<00:01:19.350> things<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.890> mattresses<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
pink bed things are mattresses now this

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.749 
pink bed things are mattresses now this
was<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> really<00:01:22.049> sketchy<00:01:22.380> spot<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.860> jump<00:01:23.189> but

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
was a really sketchy spot to jump but

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.679 
was a really sketchy spot to jump but
it's<00:01:24.000> from<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> think<00:01:24.630> close<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.590> where<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.689> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
it's from I think close to where the the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's from I think close to where the the
shaft<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.799> elevator<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.810> way

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
shaft to the elevator is all the way

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.810 
shaft to the elevator is all the way
over<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.130> where<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.650> dragon<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:35.610> where

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
over here to where the dragon it's where

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.370 
over here to where the dragon it's where
the<00:01:35.939> dragon<00:01:36.329> roof<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.170> below

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the dragon roof is but like right below

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.640 
the dragon roof is but like right below
it<00:01:37.579> so<00:01:38.579> those<00:01:39.450> are<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> only<00:01:39.930> spots<00:01:40.439> that

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
it so those are like the only spots that

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.230 
it so those are like the only spots that
I<00:01:40.740> found<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.549> jump<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I found that I can actually jump but I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
I found that I can actually jump but I
have<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.450> feeling<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.530> are<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> lot<00:01:43.920> more

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
have a feeling that there are a lot more

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.830 
have a feeling that there are a lot more
hidden<00:01:44.579> spots<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.360> might<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.540> able<00:01:45.689> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
hidden spots that you might be able to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.810 
hidden spots that you might be able to
fling<00:01:46.110> yourself<00:01:46.259> into<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.549> for<00:01:47.790> instance

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
fling yourself into like for instance

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.609 
fling yourself into like for instance
say<00:01:48.299> you're<00:01:48.450> stuck<00:01:48.720> here<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.229> want<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.500> go

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
say you're stuck here and you want to go

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.160 
say you're stuck here and you want to go
ahead<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.110> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
ahead and you want to get to you want to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.020 
ahead and you want to get to you want to
get<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> box<00:01:52.680> but<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.130> can't<00:01:53.369> quite<00:01:53.700> get

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
get to the box but you can't quite get

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.999 
get to the box but you can't quite get
over<00:01:54.090> there<00:01:54.540> because<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> can't<00:01:55.590> jump<00:01:55.860> up

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
over there because you can't jump up

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.399 
over there because you can't jump up
there<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:57.060> could<00:01:57.329> fling<00:01:57.750> yourself<00:01:57.869> over

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
there but you could fling yourself over

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.340 
there but you could fling yourself over
there<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.799> therefore<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.689> can<00:02:00.899> actually<00:02:01.049> go

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
there and therefore you can actually go

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.990 
there and therefore you can actually go
hit<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> box<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.310> come<00:02:02.579> back<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.820> get

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
hit the box and then come back and get

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
hit the box and then come back and get
your<00:02:03.180> finger<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.320> good<00:02:04.469> way<00:02:04.649> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
your finger and this is a good way to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.370 
your finger and this is a good way to
get<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.189> box<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.700> also<00:02:06.119> run<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.960> area

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
get the box and also run this area

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.940 
get the box and also run this area
without<00:02:07.860> having<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.520> risk<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:09.780> down<00:02:09.920> so<00:02:10.920> I

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
without having to risk going down so I

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.559 
without having to risk going down so I
mean<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.340> use<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.730> flogger<00:02:12.060> thing<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.510> a

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
mean you can use this flogger thing in a

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.870 
mean you can use this flogger thing in a
lot

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
lot

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.430 
lot
a different<00:02:13.270> ways<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:14.320> it's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
a different ways and I do think it's

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.040 
a different ways and I do think it's
really<00:02:14.710> worth<00:02:14.740> it<00:02:15.190> but<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> key

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
really worth it but is this the key

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.070 
really worth it but is this the key
possibly<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.860> get<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.280> PhD<00:02:18.700> flopper<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.480> there

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
possibly to get to PhD flopper is there

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.690 
possibly to get to PhD flopper is there
a<00:02:20.110> place<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:20.740> can<00:02:20.860> launch<00:02:21.070> yourself<00:02:21.280> that

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
a place that we can launch yourself that

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.000 
a place that we can launch yourself that
I<00:02:21.760> haven't<00:02:22.180> seen<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:23.440> could<00:02:23.590> take<00:02:23.740> us<00:02:23.890> a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
I haven't seen and it could take us a

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.220 
I haven't seen and it could take us a
secret<00:02:24.220> areas<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.330> I<00:02:25.360> tried<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.750> like<00:02:25.930> launch

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
secret areas so I tried to like launch

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.130 
secret areas so I tried to like launch
back<00:02:26.650> into<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.160> maze<00:02:27.700> type<00:02:28.120> place<00:02:28.450> but<00:02:29.110> I

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
back into the maze type place but I

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.360 
back into the maze type place but I
figured<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.560> wouldn't<00:02:29.800> work<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.160> it's<00:02:30.310> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
figured it wouldn't work but it's the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.280 
figured it wouldn't work but it's the
only<00:02:30.430> other<00:02:30.700> place<00:02:30.940> i<00:02:31.090> found<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.510> launch<00:02:31.750> so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
only other place i found the launch so

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.960 
only other place i found the launch so
give<00:02:32.440> me<00:02:32.470> some<00:02:32.590> ideas<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.070> places<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.610> launch

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
give me some ideas of places to launch

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.730 
give me some ideas of places to launch
and<00:02:34.300> i<00:02:34.600> will<00:02:34.750> try<00:02:34.990> them<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.260> see<00:02:35.320> if<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.530> can't

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
and i will try them and see if we can't

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.110 
and i will try them and see if we can't
