that could have been repeated million

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.510 
that could have been repeated million
times<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> smaller<00:01:16.950> scale<00:01:17.340> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
times because on a smaller scale of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.980 
times because on a smaller scale of
course<00:01:17.759> there<00:01:17.970> were<00:01:18.090> many<00:01:18.119> people<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.720> owned

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
course there were many people that owned

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320 
course there were many people that owned
works<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.470> art<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:20.190> had<00:01:20.369> been<00:01:20.550> taken<00:01:20.940> and<00:01:21.090> had

works of art that had been taken and had

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.830 
works of art that had been taken and had
lost<00:01:21.750> lives<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.310> it's<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> story<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
humanity and it's it's a sad and dark

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.469 
humanity and it's it's a sad and dark
chapter<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.659> think<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.010> portrait<00:01:29.729> itself<00:01:30.180> is

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
chapter I think the portrait itself is

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.030 
chapter I think the portrait itself is
something<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.320> need<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.620> see<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
something that you need to see in the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.210 
something that you need to see in the
flesh<00:01:32.510> because<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.869> has<00:01:34.110> many<00:01:34.350> elements<00:01:34.920> that

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
flesh because it has many elements that

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.640 
flesh because it has many elements that
do<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.520> reproduce<00:01:35.909> well<00:01:36.530> there<00:01:37.530> are

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
do not reproduce well there are

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.039 
do not reproduce well there are
three-dimensional<00:01:37.979> aspects<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.420> then

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
three-dimensional aspects to it and then

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.500 
three-dimensional aspects to it and then
of<00:01:40.170> course<00:01:40.200> it's<00:01:40.710> just<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.460> woman<00:01:41.820> she's

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
of course it's just the woman she's

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.340 
of course it's just the woman she's
mysterious<00:01:43.229> she<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.280> an<00:01:44.400> intellectual<00:01:45.350> she

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
mysterious she was an intellectual she

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.929 
mysterious she was an intellectual she
surrounded<00:01:46.890> herself<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.369> very<00:01:47.670> interesting

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
surrounded herself with very interesting

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.990 
surrounded herself with very interesting
people<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:50.040> she<00:01:50.250> died<00:01:50.430> at<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.790> rather

people and and she died at a rather

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.280 
people and and she died at a rather
young<00:01:51.150> age<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.830> are<00:01:52.950> many<00:01:53.100> layers<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:54.290> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
young age so there are many layers to a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.590 
young age so there are many layers to a

Vint was a rather shy man when he was in
his<00:02:02.280> studio<00:02:02.970> nobody<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> disturb<00:02:04.470> him<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
his studio nobody was to disturb him and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.630 
his studio nobody was to disturb him and
he<00:02:04.920> painted<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.520> these<00:02:05.729> smocks<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
he painted in these smocks and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.010 
he painted in these smocks and
reportedly<00:02:08.640> wore<00:02:08.910> nothing<00:02:09.300> underneath<00:02:09.600> and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
reportedly wore nothing underneath and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.620 
reportedly wore nothing underneath and
then<00:02:10.709> he<00:02:10.890> had<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> very<00:02:11.160> sort<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:12.030> an<00:02:12.180> official

then he had a very sort of an official
role<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.200> see<00:02:13.500> him<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.950> the
