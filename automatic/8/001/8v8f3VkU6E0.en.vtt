00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
battlefield and cold you it obviously

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.350 
battlefield and cold you it obviously
but<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:41.220> feel<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.549> my<00:03:41.580> opinion<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.060> lot<00:03:42.269> of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
but I feel in my opinion is a lot of

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.400 
but I feel in my opinion is a lot of
slower<00:03:42.510> page<00:03:42.750> don't<00:03:42.930> fit<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.170> was<00:03:43.290> my

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
slower page don't fit that was my

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.470 
slower page don't fit that was my
opinion<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.860> was<00:03:43.950> more<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.190> fact<00:03:44.459> it's<00:03:45.420> a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
opinion if it was more of a fact it's a

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.620 
opinion if it was more of a fact it's a
lot<00:03:45.660> slower<00:03:45.810> paced<00:03:46.459> but<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.120> things<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.480> can

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
lot slower paced but the things you can

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.690 
lot slower paced but the things you can
do<00:03:48.780> on<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.989> game<00:03:49.170> it<00:03:49.530> makes<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.190> just<00:03:50.370> make<00:03:50.579> it

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
do on the game it makes it just make it

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.979 
do on the game it makes it just make it
stand<00:03:50.940> out<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.150> bit<00:03:51.269> more<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.630> will<00:03:51.810> say<00:03:51.930> it

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
stand out a bit more I will say it

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:52.910 
stand out a bit more I will say it
sounds<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.260> modern<00:03:52.500> called<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.769> it's

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
sounds that modern called you it's

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.319 
sounds that modern called you it's
called<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.340> definitely<00:03:53.670> need<00:03:53.790> gaming<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
called you is definitely need gaming the

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.180 
called you is definitely need gaming the
first-person<00:03:54.720> shooter<00:03:55.110> in<00:03:55.200> my<00:03:55.350> opinion<00:03:55.709> but

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
first-person shooter in my opinion but

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.560 
first-person shooter in my opinion but
that<00:03:56.489> battlefield<00:03:56.820> 4<00:03:57.060> definitely<00:03:57.450> has<00:03:57.540> a

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
that battlefield 4 definitely has a

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.690 
that battlefield 4 definitely has a
separate<00:03:58.170> kind<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.890> odds<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.250> terms<00:03:59.430> of<00:03:59.610> his

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
separate kind of odds in terms of his

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.069 
separate kind of odds in terms of his
bigger<00:03:59.880> map<00:04:00.120> slower<00:04:00.390> pace<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.780> can<00:04:00.900> do<00:04:00.959> all

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
bigger map slower pace you can do all

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.960 
bigger map slower pace you can do all
this<00:04:01.170> different<00:04:01.350> stuff<00:04:01.590> like<00:04:01.920> blow<00:04:02.400> tanks<00:04:02.790> up

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
this different stuff like blow tanks up

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.750 
this different stuff like blow tanks up
so<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.660> stands<00:04:04.019> out<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.380> way<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.860> the

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
so it stands out in that way and the

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.670

my<00:06:00.270> opinion<00:06:00.630> they're<00:06:00.750> pretty<00:06:00.960> useless<00:06:01.350> but

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:01.920 
my opinion they're pretty useless but

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.530 
my opinion they're pretty useless but
this<00:06:02.070> is<00:06:02.220> arguably<00:06:02.670> one<00:06:02.940> of<00:06:02.970> my<00:06:03.090> favorites

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540
