00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
here it makes the whole world of

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.060 
here it makes the whole world of
difference<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:48.080> put<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.710> little<00:04:48.890> bit

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
difference just put it a little bit

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.560 
difference just put it a little bit
thicker<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.640> makes<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.090> little<00:04:50.240> bit<00:04:50.450> more

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
thicker it makes it a little bit more

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.890 
thicker it makes it a little bit more
rocker<00:04:50.870> it<00:04:51.080> and<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.980> may<00:04:52.730> not<00:04:52.910> be<00:04:52.970> for<00:04:53.360> every

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
rocker it and it may not be for every

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.780 
rocker it and it may not be for every
single<00:04:54.080> day<00:04:54.260> but<00:04:54.320> it's<00:04:54.680> still<00:04:54.860> fun<00:04:55.280> and<00:04:55.550> you

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
single day but it's still fun and you
