hi this is video two of my video series
about<00:00:05.850> my<00:00:06.779> home<00:00:07.140> flight<00:00:07.529> simulator<00:00:08.040> cockpit

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
about my home flight simulator cockpit

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.350 
about my home flight simulator cockpit
today<00:00:10.290> i'll<00:00:10.380> be<00:00:10.469> reviewing<00:00:11.540> the<00:00:13.340> desktop

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
today i'll be reviewing the desktop

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
aviator pulse generator 2120 long as the

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.900 
aviator pulse generator 2120 long as the
switches<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.400> how<00:00:23.730> my

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
switches so as you can see how my

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
switches so as you can see how my
switches<00:00:24.180> cover<00:00:24.650> auto<00:00:25.650> pilot<00:00:25.859> controls<00:00:26.930> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
switches cover auto pilot controls to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.790 
switches cover auto pilot controls to
just<00:00:28.699> miscellaneous<00:00:29.699> controls<00:00:30.800> parking

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
just miscellaneous controls parking

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.520 
just miscellaneous controls parking
brake<00:00:33.829> battery<00:00:34.829> alternator<00:00:35.250> etc<00:00:39.379> all<00:00:40.379> right

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
brake battery alternator etc all right

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.779 
brake battery alternator etc all right
behind<00:00:40.829> here<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.680> I've

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
behind here you can see that I've

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
behind here you can see that I've
soldered<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.820> switches<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:47.660> wires<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.200> run

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
soldered the switches to wires that run

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
soldered the switches to wires that run
all<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> way<00:00:52.129> here<00:00:55.190> to<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.219> board<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.820> they

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
all the way here to the board and they

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.119 
all the way here to the board and they
come<00:00:57.859> into<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.730> board<00:01:00.440> via<00:01:01.440> connectors<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
come into the board via connectors that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.000 
come into the board via connectors that
are<00:01:02.430> included<00:01:03.080> when<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.229> buy<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.470> board<00:01:07.010> so

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
are included when you buy this board so

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.200 
are included when you buy this board so
it's<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.850> messy<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:10.700> that's<00:01:11.700> how

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it's just kind of messy but that's how

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's just kind of messy but that's how
it's<00:01:12.420> done<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.159> would<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.600> recommend<00:01:15.600> doing

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
it's done I would not recommend doing

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.890 
it's done I would not recommend doing
this<00:01:17.000> unless<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.740> know<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.920> way<00:01:20.900> around

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this unless you know your way around

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.149 
this unless you know your way around
soldering<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:24.320> electronics<00:01:27.259> but<00:01:28.259> overall<00:01:28.770> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
soldering and electronics but overall I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.850 
soldering and electronics but overall I
like<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.110> mapping<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> switches<00:01:31.650> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
like it mapping the switches is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.749 
like it mapping the switches is
sometimes<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.549> pain<00:01:33.020> but<00:01:34.020> once<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.610> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
sometimes a pain but once you get it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.420 
sometimes a pain but once you get it
done<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.930> pretty<00:01:37.170> much<00:01:37.259> do<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.680> once<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
done you pretty much do it once and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.310 
done you pretty much do it once and
you're<00:01:38.640> done<00:01:40.400> these<00:01:41.400> labels<00:01:42.110> didn't<00:01:43.110> come

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you're done these labels didn't come

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.760 
you're done these labels didn't come
with<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.640> labels<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:46.079> made<00:01:46.409> with<00:01:46.740> a

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
with it the labels I just made with a

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.340 
with it the labels I just made with a
label<00:01:47.250> machine<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:48.210> Walmart<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.750> cost<00:01:49.110> me

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
label machine from Walmart that cost me

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.550 
label machine from Walmart that cost me
ten<00:01:50.009> dollars<00:01:52.880> as<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.990> switches

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
ten dollars as you can see the switches

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.670 
ten dollars as you can see the switches
are<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.100> home-built<00:01:56.969> frame<00:02:00.530> which<00:02:01.530> is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
are on a home-built frame which is

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.930 
are on a home-built frame which is
attached

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
attached

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:22.690 
attached
to<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.720> shelf<00:02:05.240> these<00:02:06.240> zip<00:02:06.600> ties

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.089 

whole<00:02:23.700> thing<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.150> pretty<00:02:24.360> sturdy<00:02:25.020> as<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.920> can

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
whole thing is pretty sturdy as you can

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.570 
whole thing is pretty sturdy as you can
see<00:02:29.150> pulse<00:02:30.150> generator<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.989> hooked<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
see pulse generator is hooked up to the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.300 
see pulse generator is hooked up to the
computer<00:02:32.610> via<00:02:33.270> a<00:02:33.870> USB<00:02:33.959> cable<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:37.560> don't<00:02:37.860> have

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
computer via a USB cable you don't have

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.830 
computer via a USB cable you don't have
to<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:39.209> any<00:02:39.390> stuff<00:02:39.720> with<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.380> actual<00:02:40.860> programs

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
to do any stuff with the actual programs

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.910 
to do any stuff with the actual programs
the<00:02:42.840> drivers<00:02:43.440> or<00:02:45.110> windows<00:02:46.110> will<00:02:46.380> find<00:02:46.680> them

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
the drivers or windows will find them

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.570 
the drivers or windows will find them
there<00:02:47.910> in<00:02:48.120> our<00:02:48.330> windows<00:02:48.810> update<00:02:49.349> so<00:02:50.310> it's

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
there in our windows update so it's

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.839 
there in our windows update so it's
pretty<00:02:50.790> much<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.810> solder<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.380> switches<00:02:52.860> you

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
pretty much you solder the switches you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.840 
pretty much you solder the switches you
plug<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.450> windows<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.739> tells<00:02:55.950> drivers<00:02:56.190> and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
plug it in windows and tells drivers and

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.809 
plug it in windows and tells drivers and
then<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.019> map<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.380> switches<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.220> it's

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
then you map the switches and it's

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.949 
then you map the switches and it's
pretty<00:03:00.090> much<00:03:00.209> ready<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.569> use<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:02.840> drink<00:03:03.840> this

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
pretty much ready to use I drink this

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.729 
pretty much ready to use I drink this
maybe<00:03:04.230> six<00:03:04.980> stars<00:03:05.280> out<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.580> 10<00:03:05.930> maybe<00:03:06.930> seven<00:03:07.560> I

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
maybe six stars out of 10 maybe seven I

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.559 
maybe six stars out of 10 maybe seven I
really<00:03:08.519> like<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.000> way<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.239> works<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:12.180> board

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
really like the way it works the board

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.920 
really like the way it works the board
itself<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:15.500> it<00:03:16.500> does<00:03:16.680> require<00:03:16.860> some<00:03:17.340> work<00:03:17.930> so

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
itself and it does require some work so

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.330 
itself and it does require some work so
you<00:03:19.019> have<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:19.319> willing<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.830> put<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.160> some

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
you have to be willing to put in some

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.640 
you have to be willing to put in some
work<00:03:21.269> also<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.500> price<00:03:22.910> price<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.290> $43<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
work also the price price is $43 and

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.340 
work also the price price is $43 and
with<00:03:25.769> shipping<00:03:26.130> it's<00:03:26.519> around<00:03:27.209> fifty<00:03:27.720> dollars

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.110 

so<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.410> mean<00:03:31.829> it's<00:03:32.010> pretty<00:03:32.519> big<00:03:32.760> money

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
so I mean it's pretty big money

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.610 
so I mean it's pretty big money
commitment<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.959> guess<00:03:34.640> and<00:03:35.640> work<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:37.290> you

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
commitment I guess and work you you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.120 
commitment I guess and work you you
still<00:03:37.859> have<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.069> do<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.250> lot<00:03:38.489> when<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.760> comes<00:03:40.130> you

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
still have to do a lot when it comes you
