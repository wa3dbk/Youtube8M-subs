00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
that's going to you know make the math

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.220 
that's going to you know make the math
work<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.640> will<00:02:34.820> that's<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.720> term<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:35.989> we

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
work if you will that's a term that we

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.170 
work if you will that's a term that we
use<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.440> lot<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.709> skywest<00:02:37.280> these<00:02:37.610> days<00:02:37.880> that<00:02:38.060> if

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
use a lot of skywest these days that if

the<00:02:38.300> math<00:02:38.480> works<00:02:38.750> great<00:02:39.110> if<00:02:39.230> not<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:39.709> you

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
the math works great if not then you

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.620 
the math works great if not then you
know<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.640> need<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.850> move<00:02:40.940> on<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.239> do<00:02:41.390> some<00:02:41.540> of

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
because I mean given the fact that we

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.979 
because I mean given the fact that we
have<00:03:27.530> a<00:03:27.739> large<00:03:28.310> portion<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.940> our<00:03:29.060> fleet<00:03:29.390> that's

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
have a large portion of our fleet that's

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.110 
have a large portion of our fleet that's
50<00:03:30.470> seat

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
50 seat

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.660 
50 seat
crap<00:03:31.390> and<00:03:31.959> we<00:03:32.110> do<00:03:32.260> not<00:03:32.440> have<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.769> manufacturer

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
crap and we do not have a manufacturer

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.970 
crap and we do not have a manufacturer
making<00:03:34.180> any<00:03:34.390> more<00:03:34.629> 50cc<00:03:35.080> aircraft<00:03:35.709> that's<00:03:35.890> a

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
making any more 50cc aircraft that's a

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.000 
making any more 50cc aircraft that's a
very<00:03:36.280> big<00:03:36.519> problem<00:03:36.819> for<00:03:37.299> our<00:03:37.360> industry<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.890> a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
very big problem for our industry it's a

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.800 
very big problem for our industry it's a
problem<00:03:39.310> also<00:03:39.610> for<00:03:39.940> manufacturers<00:03:40.599> because

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
problem also for manufacturers because

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.839 
problem also for manufacturers because
when<00:03:41.379> you<00:03:41.470> look<00:03:41.650> at<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.890> demand<00:03:42.310> you<00:03:42.459> look<00:03:42.700> at

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
when you look at the demand you look at

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.610 
when you look at the demand you look at
the<00:03:42.940> das<00:03:43.450> step<00:03:43.720> there's<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.409> much

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
the das step there's that much

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.170 
the das step there's that much
uncertainty<00:03:45.280> out<00:03:45.340> there<00:03:45.489> and<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:45.909> make<00:03:46.060> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
uncertainty out there and to make the

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.780 
uncertainty out there and to make the
capital<00:03:46.629> commitment<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:48.069> build<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.370> new<00:03:48.400> fleet

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
capital commitment to build a new fleet

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.180 
capital commitment to build a new fleet
or<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.030> do<00:03:49.180> something<00:03:49.569> different<00:03:49.599> there

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
or to do something different there

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.399 
or to do something different there
that's<00:03:51.190> a<00:03:51.310> very<00:03:51.610> very<00:03:51.849> big<00:03:52.120> challenge<00:03:52.409> from

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
that's a very very big challenge from

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.000 
that's a very very big challenge from
that<00:03:53.590> perspective<00:03:55.140> what<00:03:56.140> we<00:03:56.319> see<00:03:56.530> our<00:03:56.680> fleet

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
that perspective what we see our fleet

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.039 
that perspective what we see our fleet
is<00:03:57.129> continuing<00:03:57.730> our<00:03:57.849> particular<00:03:58.329> 50c

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
is continuing our particular 50c

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.869 
is continuing our particular 50c
complete<00:03:59.379> continuing<00:03:59.920> to<00:04:00.010> age<00:04:00.099> we<00:04:00.340> also<00:04:00.519> see

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
complete continuing to age we also see

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.640 
complete continuing to age we also see
that<00:04:00.909> the<00:04:01.120> regional<00:04:01.510> industry<00:04:02.290> is<00:04:02.379> going<00:04:02.560> to

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
that the regional industry is going to

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.050 
that the regional industry is going to
still<00:04:02.860> continue<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.310> grow<00:04:03.549> into<00:04:03.760> larger

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
still continue to grow into larger
