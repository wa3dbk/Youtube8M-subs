hello in on this tutorial I'll just show

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.450 
hello in on this tutorial I'll just show
you<00:00:02.700> how<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> make<00:00:03.449> glass<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.770> i'll<00:00:05.220> show<00:00:05.250> you

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
you how to make glass and i'll show you

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.799 
you how to make glass and i'll show you
how<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.670> make<00:00:07.700> yeah<00:00:08.700> just<00:00:08.970> make<00:00:09.269> a<00:00:09.450> brick

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
how to make yeah just make a brick

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.110 
how to make yeah just make a brick
transparent<00:00:10.969> and<00:00:11.969> i'll<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:13.110> delete<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:14.120> if

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
transparent and i'll just delete it if

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.269 
transparent and i'll just delete it if
you<00:00:15.839> want<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.350> make<00:00:16.500> glass<00:00:18.080> man<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.470> I'm

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
you want to make glass man it's like I'm

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
you want to make glass man it's like I'm
just<00:00:20.490> click<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.029> doesn't<00:00:21.539> matter<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.869> breath

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
just click it doesn't matter what breath

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.259 
just click it doesn't matter what breath
because<00:00:22.740> yeah<00:00:23.250> if<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.609> pick<00:00:23.789> black<00:00:24.060> it's

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
because yeah if you pick black it's

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.490 
because yeah if you pick black it's
probably<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.840> be<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.960> little<00:00:25.230> bit<00:00:25.350> more

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
probably going to be a little bit more

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.990 
probably going to be a little bit more
realistic<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.550> then<00:00:27.180> go<00:00:27.300> view<00:00:29.000> properties

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
realistic and then go view properties

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
realistic and then go view properties
and<00:00:31.309> then<00:00:32.309> go<00:00:33.710> reflectance<00:00:34.820> well<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.059> don't

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
and then go reflectance well you don't

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.709 
and then go reflectance well you don't
have<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:36.750> reflect<00:00:37.190> reflectance<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.719> if

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
have to do reflect reflectance but if

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.260 
have to do reflect reflectance but if
you<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:40.070> 0.3<00:00:41.719> it'll<00:00:42.719> look<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.079> realistic

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
you go 0.3 it'll look more realistic

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.700 
you go 0.3 it'll look more realistic
when<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.660> section<00:00:46.350> where<00:00:46.579> mean<00:00:47.579> window<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
when it's section where mean window and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.310 
when it's section where mean window and
transparency<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:50.039> varies<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> depends<00:00:51.719> if<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
transparency it varies it depends if you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.099 
transparency it varies it depends if you
want<00:00:52.530> your<00:00:53.600> window<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.930> very<00:00:55.230> dark<00:00:57.109> 0.8

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
want your window to be very dark 0.8

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.319 
want your window to be very dark 0.8
will<00:00:58.440> probably<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.890> highest<00:00:59.370> because<00:01:00.180> if

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
will probably be the highest because if

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.090 
will probably be the highest because if
you<00:01:00.420> it'll<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.140> black<00:01:01.440> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:02.000> one

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
you it'll just be black if you have one

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.130 
you it'll just be black if you have one
yeah<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> want<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.869> quite

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
yeah and if you want just to be quite

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.210 
yeah and if you want just to be quite
like<00:01:07.380> like<00:01:08.060> 0.3<00:01:09.060> ah<00:01:11.600> it's<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:12.810> good<00:01:13.070> if<00:01:14.070> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
like like 0.3 ah it's not good if we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.110 
like like 0.3 ah it's not good if we
just<00:01:14.369> click<00:01:14.580> properties

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.140 

so<00:01:17.810> that's<00:01:18.260> just<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.800> applicant<00:01:19.670> if<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.000> go

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
so that's just the applicant if I go

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:28.620 
so that's just the applicant if I go
over<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.990> three<00:01:21.460> it's<00:01:22.460> quite<00:01:23.450> um<00:01:24.080> see-through

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.050 

yeah<00:01:29.630> if<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.870> want<00:01:30.080> it<00:01:30.170> quite<00:01:30.350> dark<00:01:30.560> like<00:01:30.770> that

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
yeah if you want it quite dark like that

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.510 
yeah if you want it quite dark like that
yeah<00:01:32.060> yeah<00:01:32.630> all<00:01:33.440> right<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.980> can<00:01:34.040> have<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.400> love

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
yeah yeah all right you can have it love

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.580 
yeah yeah all right you can have it love

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
it and yeah 0.5 I like it because it

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.060 
it and yeah 0.5 I like it because it
looks<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:40.370> best<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.900> has<00:01:42.110> like<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.350> couple

looks the best and it has like a couple

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.470 
looks the best and it has like a couple
a<00:01:43.280> little<00:01:43.700> bit<00:01:43.820> of<00:01:43.910> shimmer<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:46.820> it's<00:01:47.060> it's

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
a little bit of shimmer so it's it's

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.430 
a little bit of shimmer so it's it's
sort<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:47.990> like<00:01:48.200> real<00:01:49.010> glass<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.150> yeah<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:51.260> want

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
sort of like real glass so yeah you want

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.430 
sort of like real glass so yeah you want
to<00:01:51.560> it's<00:01:52.420> yeah<00:01:53.420> that's<00:01:53.810> pretty<00:01:53.960> much<00:01:54.080> us<00:01:54.320> how

want to make it transparent just make

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.320 
want to make it transparent just make
your<00:02:00.530> brick<00:02:01.660> view<00:02:02.660> properties<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.850> then<00:02:05.090> just

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
your brick view properties and then just

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.370 
your brick view properties and then just
go<00:02:06.100> transparency<00:02:07.210> you<00:02:08.210> want<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.420> make<00:02:08.570> it<00:02:08.720> like

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
go transparency you want to make it like

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.780 
go transparency you want to make it like
chants<00:02:09.740> parent<00:02:10.010> link<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.369> see<00:02:10.580> through
