 taipei fan 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.269
 the assassin's proposal may or may not 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.519
 pass the false end-of-cycle impression 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799
 this is probably reinforced by your 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.740
 virtually simultaneous launch of the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.770
 awaited assassin's creed unitins well 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.470
 nothing could be more wrong 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.660
 yes it is true that steal does not sail much 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.390
 away from the beaches conquered by 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.510
 the franchise over seven years only 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.180
 this seems to have done very well even the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.520
 first contacts with the game shows a 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.730
 natural evolution of the consecrated formula 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.590
 here is a mature mature game but 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
 there is also a title as one of the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.520
 denser stories already told in a 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.129
 Assassin Subscriber 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:55.170
 let's go to the details the full protagonist 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.899
 asks how it is in the center of this 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 dramatic experience if the assassins 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.699
 of previous games had perspired the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 old smo xei can be regarded as 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.030
 necessarily a natural evolution 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.490
 converted into a Templar after 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.320
 question the methods of the murderers 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.570
 he soon escapes from the face of any 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.950
 stereotype of the hero in the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.350
 society 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 moved by this own ideas 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.909
 well- mixed character 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.220
 perfectly your free spirit to a 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.430
 unwavering sense of duty 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.560
 that way when chen finally turns 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.369
 and decides to defend that 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.369
 known cross everything seems simply 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.369
 Natural 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.280
 if you played 'assassin's creed black 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.290
 flag or assassin's creed 3 globe must 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.180
 sound familiar enough 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.479
 there are no major differences 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.060
 gameplay and the whole action still split 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.570
 between stealth maneuvers and attacks 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.049
 direct naval combats and administration 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.270
 of locations conquered by the map 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.459
 but the fact that the movements of full 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.649
 take a large part of the players to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.260
 a familiar terrain makes the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.340
 game story gain 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.340
 highlight it deserves 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.549
 I arrived sure you have your style. 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.760
 own combat 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.069
 Perhaps the main addition here is 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.890
 jumps between walls leading quickly 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:34.819
 the character to the top of structures 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:37.459
 alai ninja gaiden and his fan the return 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.400
 of the data of Eduardinho and again with 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.680
 two ammunition is available 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.709
 put enemies to sleep or 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.620
 make him hopelessly insane 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.489
 in this case just watch the whole thing of 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.489
 cabin 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.799
 it is impossible to deny the Templars have the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.560
 best toys 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.079
 when joining arrives wins a launcher 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.620
 of grenades with ammunition of smoke and 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:09.470
 shrapnel and the association with the subject 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.069
 of the cross also brings cutting-edge weapons 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.959
 for your ship the morgan 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.269
 the good history and size of the 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.250
 world of assassin's creed hobby is up 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.799
 hard not to turn a blind eye to 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.000
 some oddities of its inhabitants 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.889
 virtual 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.160
 only thing sometimes gets really 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.290
 are enemies who ignore the 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.930
 fellow shot dead 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.780
 the Bulgarian soldiers who insist on 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.389
 always repeat the same movement until the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.540
 someone takes them out of their misery they arrive 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:47.480
 ship morgan at the very beginning of the plot 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.579
 even a little jumbled it's easy to see 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.290
 ubi has squeezed some of the 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.290
 naval assassin's creed battles 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:59.090
 mobi is faster and more controllable 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.669
 than a ship of l word that Noah 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.099
 In addition, the ship also has 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.379
 various weapons and ammunition 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.840
 already the addition of a last stage of 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.639
 speed should make life easier on the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.169
 to cover wider distances 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:17.630
 assassin's creed globe is more than 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.370
 the seventh assassins' last effort 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.070
 console generation 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.200
 although familiarity with the black flag and 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.160
 assassin's creed 3 can suggest to 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.620
 unsuspecting 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.750
 more of the same are the first 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.270
 contacts with the dramatic and 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.410
 Gray pet shape how to 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:39.380
 realize that there is much more behind 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.810
 consecrated mechanics there is a beautiful 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.750
 a history full of secrets 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.650
 family and new relatives to the old 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.710
 plots 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.590
 addition additions use the maneuvers 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.230
 body and naval combat makes 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.720
 ubisoft's commitment to forging is evident. 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.220
 a stel gameplay that borders on 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.820
 perfection 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.230
 because it may even be worth joining 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.230
 to the front of the Templars 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.030
