00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:32.179
 show dies then there are 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.179
 no sense yanal because clip said anal 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:50.120
 it was close but after so vki 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.489
 promised comfort barrier super 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.829
 fabian thÃ¼lig was at waverider man 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.530
 I want to lose until you lose what is it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.000
 Now I'm going crazy too 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.629
 also burns under the fingernails 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.280
 is it really the hottest edf but me 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.360
 Now do not stop here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.220

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 folder I am the only one of the fabian 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.890
 schoo and really 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 want to see what's wrong with me 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.360
 everything is right with you my friend that is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 the problem of all these networks 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.860
 they all always have this same 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 currents characters who make-up 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.549
 the let's play 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.030
 but now really a daring one 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.780
 format where you stand the success formally 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.000
 can still have a comment from 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.329
 a very lovable person 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.729
 I do damned with brutal 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.020
 I would have read through the contract 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.149
 I am with this network 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.810
 have different from the dear 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.810
 love songs here 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.130
 nobody says I'm really deep in 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.030
 the shit friends really deep bent 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.060
 first march in front of me 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:24.500
 that's an ambition that she does not 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:28.170
 spend to spend 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.670
 you have to achieve something in life 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:37.140
 have a pity that you are not enough 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:39.260
 Cosmo Coco could be the one I know 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.810
 great fan of what you do great 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:45.210
 We are happy but unfortunately works now 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.380
 no more did you think I say 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.120
 ask to think of something new 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.950
 beauty area and then I take in there 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:57.630
 and in Buddhism you say mouse as a mouse 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.330
 In Buddhism it stays that way 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:03.600
 micro dot point of running gag 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:08.010
 but I hope so why do you have that 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.450
 Otherwise can you leave the running gag 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.800
 otherwise the other children in kindergarten 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.200
 about right and insist that that 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.110
 micro we run out of space simon ready 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.850
 is is what the whole is because only 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.160
 Anyway and what is this idea with 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.250
 the miniseries on a similar level should 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.680
 it be as a kind of nesting 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.050
 the nesting nee i want 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.120
 Just this miniserie on bio 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.739
 level that this is what you do here 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.030
 you see, obviously, no mini 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.370
 series on 1 2 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.070

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.170

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.660

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.750
 Everyone from the office is so beautiful 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.269

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.610
 Johannes extension like a wild it 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:56.870
 is the madness here is really a 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.870
 little bit to 2 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:08.260
 what sometimes filmed yes and I do 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.349
 your face is better chester now 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.359
 writes johannes you do not want to join 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.859
 cancel it and instead 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.750
 become a kindergarten teacher 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:19.150
 youtube a subscribers under 1000 like 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:27.750
 that does not write me again little money 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:32.259
 earn with her or apex asterisks 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:38.770
 gaming at the highest level to clamp 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:40.870
 brace too much creative with df if you 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.840

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.930

 smiley as I do not know with what white 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:57.060
 but I am wrong what the for 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:05:00.280
 Driving cars and what 's up 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.370
 approved that can never be with his 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.360
 with a normal salary you 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.760
 good question financed apex we buy 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.710
 but just an envelope and a 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:18.430
 stamp and sends you are so far 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:20.440
 you let go of your 150 judge 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.150
 to the people and says post in all 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.349
 social networks house the thing must 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.470
 be pushed 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.539
 best format on youtube keep it up 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.150
 I think so too does all this 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.039
 fabrice pushes this format we want 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.190
 all become superstars 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.479
 This must be such a huge sacrifice 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.470
 With hashtags victories will be sent 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.400
 unfortunately that me that me alone 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.400
 that I think about it 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.270
 heartbreaking
