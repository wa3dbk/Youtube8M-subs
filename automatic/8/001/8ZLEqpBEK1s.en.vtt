well<00:00:01.079> arthritis<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:01.740> general<00:00:02.159> term<00:00:02.340> Larry

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
well arthritis is a general term Larry

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.430 
well arthritis is a general term Larry
there<00:00:02.850> are<00:00:02.970> different<00:00:03.600> types<00:00:03.870> of<00:00:04.049> arthritis

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
there are different types of arthritis

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.079 
there are different types of arthritis
but<00:00:04.710> when<00:00:04.890> we<00:00:05.040> think<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.400> arthritis<00:00:05.549> for<00:00:06.000> the

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
but when we think of arthritis for the

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.600 
but when we think of arthritis for the
most<00:00:06.299> part<00:00:06.540> we<00:00:07.109> think<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.429> osteoarthritis<00:00:08.429> and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
most part we think of osteoarthritis and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.610 
most part we think of osteoarthritis and
rheumatoid<00:00:08.670> arthritis<00:00:09.300> osteoarthritis<00:00:10.080> is

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis is

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.620 
rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis is
the<00:00:10.769> one<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.040> affects<00:00:11.130> most<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:12.120> us<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.450> we

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
the one that affects most of us as we

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.180 
the one that affects most of us as we
age<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:13.019> that's<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.410> people<00:00:13.620> think<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
age and that's the one people think of

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.730 
age and that's the one people think of
that's<00:00:14.429> when<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.299> cartilage<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:16.170> our<00:00:16.289> joints

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
that's when the cartilage in our joints

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590 
that's when the cartilage in our joints
breaks<00:00:17.340> down<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:17.850> degenerates<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
breaks down and degenerates and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.120 
breaks down and degenerates and
essentially<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.230> cartilage<00:00:19.590> works<00:00:19.890> like<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
essentially that cartilage works like a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.529 
essentially that cartilage works like a
cushion<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> joint<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.240> when<00:00:21.449> you

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
cushion in the joint so that when you

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.509 
cushion in the joint so that when you
walk<00:00:21.750> or<00:00:22.080> move<00:00:22.230> your<00:00:22.350> fingers<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.160> joints

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
walk or move your fingers the joints

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.429 
walk or move your fingers the joints
don't<00:00:23.699> hurt<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> cartilage<00:00:25.289> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
don't hurt but when a cartilage is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.380 
don't hurt but when a cartilage is
degraded<00:00:26.010> or<00:00:26.099> broken<00:00:26.490> down<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.939> get<00:00:27.090> bone

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
degraded or broken down you get bone

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.179 
degraded or broken down you get bone
rubbing<00:00:27.720> against<00:00:28.050> bone<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.650> joints<00:00:29.010> get

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
rubbing against bone and the joints get

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
rubbing against bone and the joints get
stiff<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.730> sore<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.689> hurt<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
stiff and sore and they really do hurt a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.600 
stiff and sore and they really do hurt a
lot<00:00:31.109> that's<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> one<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.830> most<00:00:31.890> people<00:00:32.489> know

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
lot that's the one that most people know

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.510 
lot that's the one that most people know
about<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.210> once<00:00:33.450> rheumatoid<00:00:34.520> rheumatoid

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
about and once rheumatoid rheumatoid

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.569 
about and once rheumatoid rheumatoid
arthritis<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:37.500> an<00:00:37.680> arthritis<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.550> a

arthritis is it's an arthritis that is a
that<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.270> caused<00:00:39.540> by<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:40.020> abnormality<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
that is caused by an abnormality in the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160 
that is caused by an abnormality in the
immune<00:00:41.460> system<00:00:41.969> where<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.270> body<00:00:42.510> actually

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
immune system where your body actually

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.069 
immune system where your body actually
starts<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.800> destroy<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.629> lining<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.870> the

joints and in rheumatoid arthritis the
treatment<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.680> somewhat<00:00:50.129> different<00:00:50.399> because

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
treatment is somewhat different because

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.360 
treatment is somewhat different because
it's<00:00:51.210> caused<00:00:51.629> by<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> immune<00:00:52.920> system

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
it's caused by that immune system

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.619 
it's caused by that immune system
problem<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.000> different<00:00:54.480> than
