00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.329
 Last December 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.770
 PDVSA and 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.589
 mickelson 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:08.909
 elements of the 

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:09.939
 in a kind of 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.939
 the Alicante club 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:16.960
 I have a program is not new 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 Let's start to analize 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.649
 let's not lose 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.589
 my mother 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:31.489
 both athletes 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.680
 in this way the camera goes down but it's not like that and that's what 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.380
 well stand out months 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.700
 It took a while to design it 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.690
 programmed 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.690
 possible with engines if one can not die 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.679
 these cuts 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.240
 It's like that early morning 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.790
 Applied robotics 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.760
 with this perera what we are going to see now I think the mobile is wrong 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.100
 I think we're going to do 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.090
 the step is seeing if I do not tell you we have frayed know moderate 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.090
 forward 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.469
 the company 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:11.280
 pasito montequín and loans we chose to martín jáuregui has gone super to 

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:11.900
 what john 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.020
 enjoy educational robotics in others here we have two tables 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.130
 and they have profile 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.190
 the new social classes do not even welcome those countries that 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.600
 face a little 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.640
 how it arises 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.940
 the pediatrician of mechanical robotics 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.170
 hello that such an entity 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.790
 I learned to love life 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.430
 jáuregui and study good day to all 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.370
 i look 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.140
 the idea of ​​robotics was something that is showing up little by little 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.160
 Kennedy that always electronic and suddenly 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.150
 I was happy and what it was and kits that serve to be robotics 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.420
 at a level 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.530
 it's amateur 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.230
 it was an educational level 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.560
 and good with that research until I find a place in Buenos Aires is my 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.980
 first training 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.720
 bought the first team 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.950
 gillette i after good 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.660
 when little by little by orlando 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.020
 percent and get more into this topic 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.420
 to measure the fact that there is the possibility of working with 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.359
 Boys 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.009
 ee looking 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.039
 what really has to enhance this matter 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.709
 what is a great didactic aid 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.579
 my dignity the possibility of being able to teach using robotics we 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.069
 provides a very useful tool 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.719
 because interact with other subjects not only the physical exam that they are 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.280
 robotics experts 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.409
 but they are working together with physical mathematics 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.949
 this start of activity 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.059
 ban ban asked Moscow and Kiev world of robotics 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.460
 the point below 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.709
 countless subjects complementing the 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.180
 pizzi costa de josé enrique always madila emphasizes the air the theme of 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.119
 Boys 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:58.979
 while it is expected also having fun as are the passions the 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:59.999
 which is closer 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.299
 it's how kids start aida citation will be educational robotics 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.249
 good the boys start from 6 7 years old 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.269
 onwards 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.569
 and the playful part airs a primordial part in this matter because 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.309
 well a very particular attraction 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.469
 i the good thing is that it has a very low level 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.140
 d at the beginning of difficulty 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.849
 then the boys in their first class can 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.290
 they grabbed for not learning how to assemble pieces because they could 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.589
 appreciate they are all Inca pieces 3 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.729
 here a little village are doing their first structures 

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:39.129
 where they are shuffling things like the inpec and tiberio center of gravity 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.409
 without talking about center of gravity ee that they also antica joke of the 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:46.289
 robberies 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:50.039
 And little by little they are working with the computer being also a little 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.509
 of programming first very simple 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:55.739
 I'll miss the fun part 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.389
 that when they face their robots 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.719
 the guru with each other 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.060
 He really is what I call chaos in the classroom 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.539
 but there is only one 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.210
 a tremendous fun 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.129
 among all because they have fun and we have fun too 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.219
 really and this matter to me who I love as much as they 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:18.370
 you also have to handle the attachment 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.590
 but he's going to forget and we're with 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.360
 santiago country our producer 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.930
 I could not get him out next to the girls in a telephone interview 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.639
 guaranteed that they will ask the odd good question for the plant 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.639
 while we remember Jorge vara to complain about this he called me to the images 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.520
 of the girls 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.500
 cool these acrobats who had armed pepe ros astana assured that the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.470
 grabbed to think of another human action the high-speed train and 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.909
 the platforms one thing yes more threat 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.860
 Yes Yes Yes yes Yes 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.860
 the idea operation to follow the things that guys do 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.659
 and the nice thing is that when that chaos starts that competition 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.580
 percent 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.440
 It is very important 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.990
 how they are modifying their construction this 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.999
 because sometimes they come from your house 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:12.379
 after having done a job a weekend if they go all week and 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.590
 They are thinking 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.360
 that are going to be Saturday when they return to class 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.219
 they begin to be in the construction which they want to compete with the theft of their 

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.409
 Sarandi companion 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:24.750
 that is required 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.469
 restless are doing 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:32.169
 That is to break something or see that your partner's robot is superior in 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.689
 something that I felt already begin to part 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.160
 of improvisation 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.790
 that they say 'good claim to get it wanted because this does not 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.099
 it worked 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.330
 then they go ahead 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.289
 the bread surpassing 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.479
 i ban progressed good shape 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:49.949
 percent and masters 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.029
 Automatic knife is not that one demands them 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.629
 that achieve this or that objective is not only go the yes I want to warn that the 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.959
 head these girls sandra sponge for health also from all pressure 

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:02.330
 a quick 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.819
 what is so incredible 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:05.159
 it says yes 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.760
 look at my amazement are amazement does not stop to amaze me every day 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.319
 to see how they 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.219
 they are learning at the speed they are learning 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.289
 and this does nothing but affirm by reaffirming 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.939
 the concept that I have and that we have many blocks the educational robotics 

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:24.300
 is a subject that is practically taught alone 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.500
 and to the kids it helps them to grow in the intellectual part to the development of their 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.740
 creativity 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.440
 in a lot of things that help here they develop better up as beings 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.889
 humans because they have to work in a team clearly count 1 with the 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.819
 trust is what the other is doing 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.819
 so that the team can reach a positive result 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:48.469
 this then good has so many factors 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:51.479
 that does not give me pink and it would be half of that 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.139
 but that all add up for what 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.139
 this matter reaches a point where we can not justify 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:59.870
 that they are not in speech today 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.870
 this time it was in vain Valencian Saturdays 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.310
 in defense is not in line with those of the film health highlighted 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.510
 ll year there is a pulse that is winning in school at school 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.780
 technical break him with ushuaia 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.340
 what if it is in a curricular space as a pilot matter 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.080
 which was increased this year 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.080
 i - started the punches 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.610
 because one thing is what they call in speech that at the end of the year that 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.930
 they work in that headquarters 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.069
 I have material that I was acquiring during this time 

00:07:36.069 --> 00:07:39.379
 and another thing is to pretend that in the technical school where you have to 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:45.119
 coordinate a lot of areas it could be that something is with greater 

00:07:45.119 --> 00:07:46.319
 professionalism 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:50.649
 there is no need to do it wrong but it could not be done at the level that was intended
