the middle of the back of the head and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.029 
the middle of the back of the head and
around<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> outside<00:00:51.590> step<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> actually

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
around the outside step two is actually

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
around the outside step two is actually
attaching<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.730> product<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> cap

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
attaching the product and we have a cap

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.330 
attaching the product and we have a cap
here<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.350> has<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.860> bit<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.039> stretch

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
here which has a little bit of stretch

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
here which has a little bit of stretch
so<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.699> fit<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.910> different<00:00:57.329> head<00:00:57.480> shapes

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so it will fit all different head shapes

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.420 
so it will fit all different head shapes
but<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.350> pressure<00:00:58.620> sensitive<00:00:59.129> Clips

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
but we have pressure sensitive Clips

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.670 
but we have pressure sensitive Clips
inside<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.300> attach<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.199> hair<00:01:01.440> and
