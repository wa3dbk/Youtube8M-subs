ones on the Left James

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.890 
ones on the Left James
yeah<00:00:24.680> they<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> thing<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:29.900> cool

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
yeah they have a thing for that cool

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.630 
yeah they have a thing for that cool
bond<00:00:31.080> until<00:00:31.289> we<00:00:31.529> feel<00:00:31.769> comfortable<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.460> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
bond until we feel comfortable with it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.970 
bond until we feel comfortable with it
that's<00:00:32.910> how<00:00:33.059> long<00:00:33.210> it'll<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.450> going<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.980> well

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that's how long it'll be going for well

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.690 
that's how long it'll be going for well
this<00:00:35.100> also<00:00:35.309> oh<00:00:38.809> whoops<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.309> didn't<00:00:41.309> turn<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.489> on

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
this also oh whoops I didn't turn it on

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.660 
this also oh whoops I didn't turn it on
there<00:00:42.329> we<00:00:42.420> go<00:00:43.100> set<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.250> back<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> latest

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
there we go set that back to latest

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
there we go set that back to latest
donation<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.930> yeah<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.289> two<00:00:46.440> options<00:00:46.620> for

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
donation so yeah we have two options for

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.110 
donation so yeah we have two options for
happening<00:00:47.129> now<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.399> case<00:00:47.550> there's<00:00:47.730> two<00:00:47.910> things

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
happening now in case there's two things

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.970 
happening now in case there's two things
happening<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.930> good<00:00:51.920> shouldn't<00:00:52.920> be

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
happening so that's good shouldn't be

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.069 
happening so that's good shouldn't be
that<00:00:53.070> much<00:00:53.160> more<00:00:53.219> equity<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.699> we've<00:00:53.820> got<00:00:55.910> five

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
that much more equity so we've got five

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.160 
that much more equity so we've got five
six<00:00:58.079> microphones<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.609> year<00:01:00.000> we've<00:01:00.690> got<00:01:00.899> two

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
six microphones this year we've got two

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.009 
six microphones this year we've got two
area<00:01:01.680> mics<00:01:01.920> hanging<00:01:02.280> from<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> ceiling<00:01:03.019> I've

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
area mics hanging from the ceiling I've

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.990 
area mics hanging from the ceiling I've
got<00:01:04.260> my<00:01:04.470> own<00:01:04.680> microphone<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.610> in

little desk desk microphone over in

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.800 
little desk desk microphone over in
engineering<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.270> can<00:01:15.390> hear<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.689> if

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
engineering so that you can hear that if

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.999 
engineering so that you can hear that if
you<00:01:15.900> want<00:01:16.110> oh<00:01:18.229> yeah<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.409> should<00:01:19.590> show<00:01:19.830> them

you want oh yeah you should show them
show<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.340> engineering<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.409> camera<00:01:30.020> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
show them engineering and the camera so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.830 
show them engineering and the camera so
for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> first<00:01:31.860> time<00:01:32.100> ever<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.090> behind<00:01:33.750> the

advantage having the space to do a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.499 
advantage having the space to do a
cartwheel<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.130> must<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.460> able<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.299> can

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
cartwheel is a must be able to do I can

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
cartwheel is a must be able to do I can
I<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.930> attempt<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.189> would<00:02:02.310> probably

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
look quite like what a car wheels

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:14.580 
look quite like what a car wheels
supposed<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.900> look<00:02:04.990> like<00:02:05.050> but<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.590> could<00:02:13.590> 1337
