2013 should be particularly a year where
a<00:01:08.100> significant<00:01:09.060> growth<00:01:09.270> should<00:01:09.600> continue<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
a significant growth should continue to

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.609 
a significant growth should continue to
be<00:01:11.130> executed<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:13.049> had<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
be executed and two had one that you

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
be executed and two had one that you
mentioned<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.189> both<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> situation<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.090> China

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and the strong in in Japan but both seem

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.820 
and the strong in in Japan but both seem
to<00:01:17.400> be<00:01:17.580> showing<00:01:17.790> signs<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.270> recovery<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:19.110> guess

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to be showing signs of recovery I guess

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.770 
to be showing signs of recovery I guess
how<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.250> assess<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> prospects<00:01:21.270> therapy

good<00:01:26.220> wins<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.630> 2013<00:01:28.850> following

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
good wins you know in 2013 following

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.380 
good wins you know in 2013 following
these<00:01:30.030> two<00:01:30.329> obstacles<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> yen<00:01:32.640> giving<00:01:33.119> some

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
these two obstacles the yen giving some

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
these two obstacles the yen giving some
signs<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:34.340> little<00:01:35.340> by<00:01:35.460> little<00:01:35.490> coming<00:01:36.060> back<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
signs of little by little coming back to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.270 
signs of little by little coming back to
more<00:01:36.600> natural<00:01:37.049> territory<00:01:37.259> we're<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.100> there

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
more natural territory we're not there

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.969 
more natural territory we're not there
we're<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.939> there<00:01:39.119> obviously<00:01:39.710> athn<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
we're not there obviously athn to the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.770 
we're not there obviously athn to the
dollar<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.369> much<00:01:41.549> better<00:01:41.790> than<00:01:41.880> 70<00:01:42.299> 80<00:01:42.479> m<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
dollar is much better than 70 80 m to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.800 
dollar is much better than 70 80 m to
the<00:01:42.810> dollar<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.799> frankly<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> consider<00:01:44.700> that

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
the dollar but frankly I consider that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.569 
the dollar but frankly I consider that
unless<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.869> reach<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.380> 100-yen<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> dollar

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
unless we reach a 100-yen to the dollar

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.270 
unless we reach a 100-yen to the dollar
we<00:01:47.820> will<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.119> be<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.630> neutral<00:01:49.530> territory<00:01:49.560> so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
we will not be in neutral territory so

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.780 
we will not be in neutral territory so
there<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> better<00:01:51.689> situation<00:01:52.399> we<00:01:53.399> still<00:01:53.640> not

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
there is a better situation we still not

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.899 
there is a better situation we still not
there<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.509> yen<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.869> still<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.259> handicap<00:01:55.860> for<00:01:56.790> us

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
there the yen is still a handicap for us

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.929 
there the yen is still a handicap for us
in<00:01:57.869> China<00:01:58.200> yes<00:01:58.979> situation<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.549> getting<00:01:59.670> better

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
in China yes situation is getting better

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.749 
in China yes situation is getting better
but<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.659> would<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.960> frankly<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.009> fundamental

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
but we would like frankly a fundamental

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.330 
but we would like frankly a fundamental
resolution<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.420> problem<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.840> mean

product availability how do you see the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.670 
product availability how do you see the
EV<00:02:44.000> sales<00:02:44.299> being<00:02:44.630> impacted<00:02:44.959> by<00:02:45.349> this<00:02:45.410> new

EV sales being impacted by this new

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.069 
EV sales being impacted by this new
product<00:02:46.069> look<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.910> think<00:02:47.360> everything<00:02:47.870> we're

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
product look I think everything we're

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.920 
product look I think everything we're
doing<00:02:48.110> is<00:02:48.470> positive<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.280> EV<00:02:49.579> sales<00:02:49.930> but

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
doing is positive to the EV sales but

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.440 
doing is positive to the EV sales but
frankly<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.620> was<00:02:51.769> predicted<00:02:52.250> because<00:02:52.610> we

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
frankly it was predicted because we

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.420 
frankly it was predicted because we
never<00:02:53.569> had<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.930> strategy<00:02:54.440> by<00:02:54.769> which<00:02:54.799> we<00:02:55.250> will

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
never had the strategy by which we will

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.920 
never had the strategy by which we will
assemble<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:56.030> leaf<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.420> assemble<00:02:56.840> the

building<00:03:08.959> cars<00:03:09.350> in<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.590> United<00:03:09.829> States<00:03:09.889> is

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
building cars in the United States is

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.099 
building cars in the United States is
more<00:03:10.519> efficient<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.180> less<00:03:11.239> costly<00:03:11.840> than

building cars and shipping card from

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.120 
building cars and shipping card from
Japan<00:03:14.000> so<00:03:14.329> that's<00:03:15.319> one<00:03:15.470> of<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.709> reasons<00:03:15.980> for

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
Japan so that's one of the reasons for

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.210 
Japan so that's one of the reasons for
which<00:03:16.280> we<00:03:16.459> cut<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:17.239> price<00:03:17.480> for<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> consumer

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
which we cut the price for the consumer

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.580 
which we cut the price for the consumer
because<00:03:19.220> by<00:03:20.209> making<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.109> battery<00:03:21.410> in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
because by making the battery in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.379 
because by making the battery in
Tennessee<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.340> assembling<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.090> car<00:03:23.239> in

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
the United States it helped us reduce

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.650 
the United States it helped us reduce
the<00:03:28.099> cost<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.519> car<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:28.970> make<00:03:29.510> the
