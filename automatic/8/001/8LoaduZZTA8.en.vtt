most<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.320> really<00:00:19.830> based

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
most of what you do here is really based

most of what you do here is really based
on<00:00:20.430> where<00:00:20.850> fox<00:00:21.240> or<00:00:21.449> falco<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.960> when<00:00:22.500> they're

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
on where fox or falco is when they're

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.550 
on where fox or falco is when they're
able<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.039> recover<00:00:23.400> there<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.480> actually<00:00:25.050> three

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
able to recover there are actually three

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.679 
able to recover there are actually three
hundred<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.279> fifty-two<00:00:27.029> different<00:00:27.390> angles

hundred and fifty-two different angles

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.630 
hundred and fifty-two different angles
that<00:00:27.750> fox<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.289> falco<00:00:28.439> can<00:00:28.890> take<00:00:29.130> out<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> their

up bees so edge guarding is like really
intricate<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.510> we'll<00:00:34.020> take<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> few<00:00:34.530> more

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

tutorials to fully explain but for now
we<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:38.040> limit<00:00:38.219> down<00:00:38.430> those<00:00:38.670> options<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.329> watch

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
we can limit down those options to watch

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479 
we can limit down those options to watch
for<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> most<00:00:39.989> common<00:00:40.290> ones<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.770> expand<00:00:41.399> to

for the most common ones and expand to

for the most common ones and expand to
the<00:00:41.579> rest<00:00:41.610> later<00:00:41.940> there<00:00:42.899> are<00:00:42.930> three<00:00:43.379> general

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the rest later there are three general

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.459 
the rest later there are three general
places<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.399> fox<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.879> recover<00:00:45.149> from<00:00:45.469> above

the<00:00:46.680> stage<00:00:47.180> horizontal<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> stage<00:00:48.690> where

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the stage horizontal to the stage where

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.200 
the stage horizontal to the stage where
a<00:00:49.260> side<00:00:49.649> bee<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.100> put<00:00:50.399> them<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
a side bee will put them right at the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.439 
a side bee will put them right at the
ledge<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.800> below<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.980> stage<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:54.059> easiest

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
ledge and below the stage the easiest

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.119 
ledge and below the stage the easiest
way<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.809> think<00:00:54.989> about<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.440> hedge<00:00:55.680> guarding

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
way to think about your hedge guarding

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.910 
way to think about your hedge guarding
is<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> try<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.640> get<00:00:56.820> fox<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.390> falco<00:00:57.530> down<00:00:58.530> below

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is to try to get fox or falco down below

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
is to try to get fox or falco down below
the<00:00:59.129> stage<00:00:59.399> because<00:00:59.789> he's<00:01:00.090> usually<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the stage because he's usually the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.900 
the stage because he's usually the
easiest<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> edge<00:01:01.170> guard<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.649> first<00:01:02.550> we'll

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
easiest to edge guard there first we'll

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
easiest to edge guard there first we'll
take<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> look<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.449> fox<00:01:03.690> being<00:01:03.930> above<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> stage

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
take a look at fox being above the stage

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.340 
take a look at fox being above the stage
this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> where<00:01:05.760> fox<00:01:06.060> has<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.510> most<00:01:06.869> amount<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
this is where fox has the most amount of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.740 
this is where fox has the most amount of
options<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:08.040> while<00:01:08.729> they're<00:01:08.909> about<00:01:09.210> five

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
options and while they're about five

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.420 
options and while they're about five
main<00:01:10.110> options<00:01:10.530> fox<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.920> take<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.220> here

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
main options fox can take from here

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910 
main options fox can take from here
we'll<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.299> look<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.510> three<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.960> now<00:01:13.080> both

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
we'll just look at three for now both

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.070 
we'll just look at three for now both
his<00:01:14.189> illusion<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> fire<00:01:15.210> fox<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.750> be<00:01:15.869> used

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
his illusion and fire fox can be used

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
his illusion and fire fox can be used
and<00:01:16.290> his<00:01:16.680> fire<00:01:16.890> fox<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.430> be<00:01:17.520> used<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.880> multiple

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and his fire fox can be used at multiple

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.600 
and his fire fox can be used at multiple
angles<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.619> first<00:01:19.890> thing<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> want<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> look

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
angles the first thing you want to look

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.719 
angles the first thing you want to look
for<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.479> they<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.900> be<00:01:22.140> right<00:01:22.380> away<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.890> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
for is if they up be right away in this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.999 
for is if they up be right away in this
case<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.390> best<00:01:24.630> thing<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.900> do<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.470> jump<00:01:25.799> out

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
case the best thing to do is jump out

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.980 
case the best thing to do is jump out
and<00:01:26.250> forward<00:01:26.820> air<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.180> shield<00:01:27.479> breaker<00:01:27.720> them

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and forward air or shield breaker them

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.499 
and forward air or shield breaker them
this<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.770> pretty<00:01:28.950> much<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.280> guaranteed<00:01:29.970> kill<00:01:30.240> as

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
this is pretty much a guaranteed kill as

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.179 
this is pretty much a guaranteed kill as
long<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.140> start<00:01:31.350> jumping<00:01:31.590> early<00:01:31.979> enough

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
long as you start jumping early enough

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
long as you start jumping early enough
so<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:32.850> your<00:01:33.000> best<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> try<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.630> predict<00:01:33.930> when

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so do your best to try and predict when

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.130 
so do your best to try and predict when
they<00:01:34.350> usually<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:35.070> their<00:01:35.280> recovery<00:01:35.700> move

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
they usually do their recovery move

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.539 
they usually do their recovery move
typically<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.350> side<00:01:37.770> beef<00:01:38.009> from<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.340> height

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
typically a side beef from this height

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
typically a side beef from this height
isn't<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.119> good<00:01:39.299> option<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.049> how<00:01:40.229> easy

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
isn't a good option because of how easy

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.080 
isn't a good option because of how easy
it<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.979> react<00:01:41.310> during<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> lag<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.880> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it is to react during the lag of the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.929 
it is to react during the lag of the
move<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.590> focus<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.280> fire<00:01:44.490> fox

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
so this is the key the Marth player

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.480 
so this is the key the Marth player

Fox goes straight atom forward smash if

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.580 
Fox goes straight atom forward smash if

the<00:05:58.229> last<00:05:58.500> option<00:05:58.830> we<00:05:59.070> need<00:05:59.219> to<00:05:59.370> look<00:05:59.520> for<00:05:59.759> is

the last option we need to look for is

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.570 
the last option we need to look for is
an<00:06:00.150> illusion<00:06:00.659> onto<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.080> platform<00:06:01.530> again<00:06:02.310> the

an illusion onto the platform again the

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.070 
an illusion onto the platform again the

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.080 
best thing to do here would be to go out

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.930

expectations<00:07:11.990> all<00:07:12.370> pros<00:07:13.370> are<00:07:13.610> able<00:07:13.970> to<00:07:14.000> move

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
expectations all pros are able to move

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.240 
expectations all pros are able to move
faster<00:07:14.630> not<00:07:14.900> only<00:07:15.440> because<00:07:15.770> they<00:07:15.920> have<00:07:16.010> seen

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
faster not only because they have seen

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.640 
faster not only because they have seen
these<00:07:16.550> situations<00:07:17.180> hundreds<00:07:17.630> of<00:07:17.750> times<00:07:17.990> but

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
these situations hundreds of times but

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.930 
these situations hundreds of times but
also<00:07:18.800> because<00:07:19.220> their<00:07:19.400> fingers<00:07:19.670> move

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
also because their fingers move

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.030 
also because their fingers move
automatically<00:07:20.780> doing<00:07:21.290> actions<00:07:21.830> they've

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.040 
automatically doing actions they've

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.400 
automatically doing actions they've
practiced<00:07:22.520> thousands<00:07:23.240> of<00:07:23.330> times<00:07:23.540> and<00:07:23.810> because

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
practiced thousands of times and because

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.410 
practiced thousands of times and because
they<00:07:24.560> can<00:07:24.710> predict<00:07:25.070> with<00:07:25.310> more<00:07:25.550> accuracy<00:07:26.120> and

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.420 
they can predict with more accuracy and

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.450 
they can predict with more accuracy and
confidence<00:07:26.630> than<00:07:27.170> the<00:07:27.260> average<00:07:27.560> player<00:07:27.830> that

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:28.460 
confidence than the average player that

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.100 
confidence than the average player that
these<00:07:28.790> certain<00:07:29.060> situations<00:07:29.600> will<00:07:29.750> happen

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110 
these certain situations will happen

these certain situations will happen
this<00:07:30.770> is<00:07:30.830> a<00:07:31.010> huge<00:07:31.520> topic<00:07:31.730> that<00:07:32.090> we<00:07:32.180> can<00:07:32.270> discuss

this is a huge topic that we can discuss

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.410 
this is a huge topic that we can discuss
at<00:07:32.750> a<00:07:32.780> later<00:07:33.050> time<00:07:33.110> but<00:07:33.800> just<00:07:34.070> know<00:07:34.220> that

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420 
at a later time but just know that

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.030 
at a later time but just know that
literally<00:07:35.420> everybody<00:07:35.960> can<00:07:36.500> accomplish<00:07:36.770> this

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.040 
literally everybody can accomplish this

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.950 
literally everybody can accomplish this
type<00:07:37.250> of<00:07:37.280> reaction<00:07:37.820> as<00:07:37.970> long<00:07:38.450> as<00:07:38.570> you<00:07:38.660> put<00:07:38.870> in

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 
type of reaction as long as you put in

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:51.710 
see what works for you once fox and

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.410 
see what works for you once fox and
falco<00:07:51.860> are<00:07:52.340> hit<00:07:52.670> below<00:07:53.000> the<00:07:53.180> stage

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:53.420 
falco are hit below the stage

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.810 
falco are hit below the stage
edgeguarding<00:07:54.410> becomes<00:07:54.860> like<00:07:55.220> a<00:07:55.250> hundred

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820 
edgeguarding becomes like a hundred

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.090 
edgeguarding becomes like a hundred
times<00:07:55.940> simpler<00:07:56.420> and<00:07:56.600> will<00:07:57.500> show<00:07:57.680> you<00:07:57.740> how<00:07:57.920> this

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:58.100 
times simpler and will show you how this

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.020 
times simpler and will show you how this
works<00:07:58.310> in<00:07:58.460> part<00:07:58.670> two<00:07:58.820> thanks<00:07:59.570> for<00:07:59.720> watching
