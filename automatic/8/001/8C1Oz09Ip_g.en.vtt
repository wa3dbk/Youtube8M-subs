00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.570 
I do have to say that it is very
connection<00:01:42.479> dependent<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.440> I've<00:01:44.190> noticed

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
connection dependent and I've noticed

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.270 
connection dependent and I've noticed
that<00:01:44.729> there<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.930> you're<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> host<00:01:46.590> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
went negative pretty bad so I'm not sure

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.680

just matchmaking make matchmaking a

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.530 
just matchmaking make matchmaking a
little<00:02:11.040> bit<00:02:11.130> better<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.060> get<00:02:12.180> paired

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
little bit better so that you get paired

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.840 
little bit better so that you get paired
up<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.810> people<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.140> are<00:02:13.320> closer<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.950> or

and<00:02:38.860> all<00:02:39.519> this<00:02:39.790> means<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:41.440> are<00:02:41.620> super

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099

and all this means is you are super
badass<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:43.000> don't<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:43.900> know<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.190> if<00:02:45.190> your

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
badass I don't really know I if your

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.479 
badass I don't really know I if your
suit<00:02:47.170> doesn't<00:02:47.530> run<00:02:47.830> out<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.280> can<00:02:48.400> just

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
suit doesn't run out so you can just

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.309 
suit doesn't run out so you can just
have<00:02:48.640> armor<00:02:49.030> on<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.450> guess<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:50.050> could<00:02:50.200> have

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
have armor on I guess I could have

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.660 
have armor on I guess I could have
stealth<00:02:50.650> myself<00:02:51.160> as<00:02:51.340> well<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.860> don't<00:02:54.430> know

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
stealth myself as well and I don't know

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.190 
stealth myself as well and I don't know
how<00:02:54.849> long<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.269> lasts<00:02:55.810> but<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:58.450> are<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.720> badass

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
how long it lasts but you are a badass

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.559 
how long it lasts but you are a badass
while<00:02:59.769> you<00:02:59.890> have<00:02:59.980> maximum<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.580> know<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:01.120> don't

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
while you have maximum you know I don't

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.589 
while you have maximum you know I don't
even<00:03:01.660> know<00:03:01.870> if<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.049> can<00:03:02.319> be<00:03:02.500> killed<00:03:03.480> that's<00:03:04.480> a

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
even know if it can be killed that's a

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.729 
even know if it can be killed that's a
good<00:03:04.780> question<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.890> don't<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:08.470> this

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
good question and I don't know and this

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.690 
good question and I don't know and this
is<00:03:08.799> kind<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.280> like<00:03:09.549> a<00:03:10.299> napalm<00:03:11.080> or<00:03:11.680> an<00:03:12.040> airstrike

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
is kind of like a napalm or an airstrike

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.539 
is kind of like a napalm or an airstrike
and<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.989> was<00:03:14.110> trying<00:03:14.349> to<00:03:14.410> figure<00:03:14.560> out<00:03:14.650> how<00:03:15.519> to

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
and I was trying to figure out how to

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.750 
and I was trying to figure out how to
use<00:03:15.819> it<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.269> have<00:03:16.329> to<00:03:16.450> just<00:03:17.280> call<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.310> in<00:03:18.579> and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
use it you have to just call it in and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.759 
use it you have to just call it in and
then<00:03:18.849> plus<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.209> to<00:03:19.360> actually<00:03:19.840> fire<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.680> and

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
then plus a to actually fire it and

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.850 
then plus a to actually fire it and
shoots<00:03:21.269> fiery<00:03:22.269> depths<00:03:22.840> from<00:03:23.560> above<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:25.860> here's

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
shoots fiery depths from above so here's

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.780 
shoots fiery depths from above so here's
where<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.069> finally<00:03:27.459> died<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.680> seventeen<00:03:30.610> and

heard some PC players say that they

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.900 
heard some PC players say that they
didn't<00:04:00.010> like<00:04:00.130> it<00:04:00.340> because<00:04:00.519> it<00:04:00.760> was<00:04:00.880> like

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
didn't like it because it was like

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.849 
didn't like it because it was like
ported<00:04:01.420> for<00:04:01.600> consoles<00:04:02.139> so<00:04:02.410> they<00:04:02.530> kind<00:04:02.769> of

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
ported for consoles so they kind of

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.250 
ported for consoles so they kind of
toned<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:03.819> down<00:04:03.850> so<00:04:04.299> consoles<00:04:04.750> could<00:04:04.930> run<00:04:05.109> it

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
toned it down so consoles could run it

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.370 
toned it down so consoles could run it
but<00:04:05.940> only<00:04:06.940> only<00:04:07.299> like

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
but only only like

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.070 
but only only like
hmm<00:04:09.370> well<00:04:09.790> as<00:04:09.850> far<00:04:10.000> as<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:10.210> black<00:04:10.480> ops<00:04:10.720> is

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
hmm well as far as like black ops is

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.870 
hmm well as far as like black ops is
concerned<00:04:11.500> like<00:04:14.190> 63%<00:04:15.190> of<00:04:15.280> people<00:04:15.520> play<00:04:15.730> on

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
concerned like 63% of people play on

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.240 
concerned like 63% of people play on
xbox<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.750> then<00:04:16.900> there's<00:04:17.110> like<00:04:17.260> 30-some

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
xbox and then there's like 30-some

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.920 
xbox and then there's like 30-some
percent<00:04:18.280> play<00:04:18.880> on<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:20.130> ps3<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.700> then<00:04:21.930> under

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
percent play on on ps3 and then under

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.010 
percent play on on ps3 and then under
10%<00:04:23.230> play<00:04:23.770> on<00:04:23.830> PC<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:24.670> there's<00:04:25.390> a<00:04:25.480> big<00:04:25.750> market

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
10% play on PC so there's a big market

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.460 
10% play on PC so there's a big market
in<00:04:26.440> consoles<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:30.220> guess<00:04:30.670> they<00:04:30.910> just<00:04:31.470> wanted

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
in consoles and I guess they just wanted

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.430 
in consoles and I guess they just wanted
to<00:04:32.530> tone<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.340> game<00:04:34.060> graphics<00:04:34.720> down<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> little

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
to tone the game graphics down a little

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.990 
to tone the game graphics down a little
bit<00:04:35.590> I<00:04:35.620> never<00:04:35.920> really<00:04:36.160> played<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.520> first<00:04:36.700> one

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
bit I never really played the first one

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.750 
bit I never really played the first one
so<00:04:37.270> I'm<00:04:37.930> not<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.200> big<00:04:38.710> PC<00:04:39.130> player<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.430> haven't

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
so I'm not a big PC player I haven't

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.100 
so I'm not a big PC player I haven't
really<00:04:39.940> played<00:04:40.060> mini<00:04:40.360> PC<00:04:40.750> games<00:04:41.020> at<00:04:41.230> all<00:04:42.600> so<00:04:43.600> it

really played mini PC games at all so it

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.330 
really played mini PC games at all so it

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
looked good to me it's one of the

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.410 
looked good to me it's one of the
prettiest<00:04:46.120> looking<00:04:46.450> games<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.930> I've<00:04:47.080> played

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
and there are some things in the game
