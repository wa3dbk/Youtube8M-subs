today<00:00:10.950> i'm<00:00:11.070> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.309> reviewing<00:00:11.370> an<00:00:11.880> app

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
today i'm going to be reviewing an app

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.379 
today i'm going to be reviewing an app
called<00:00:12.360> tiny<00:00:12.809> wings<00:00:13.170> oh<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:14.580> i<00:00:14.700> put<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.150> case

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
called tiny wings oh and i put that case

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.760 
called tiny wings oh and i put that case
on<00:00:15.630> from<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.139> auto<00:00:16.440> skins<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:18.060> they<00:00:18.270> uh

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
on from the auto skins this one they uh

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
on from the auto skins this one they uh
was<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> space<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.430> layers<00:00:20.640> looks<00:00:21.600> pretty<00:00:21.720> cool

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
was a space as layers looks pretty cool

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.450 
was a space as layers looks pretty cool
so<00:00:22.199> far<00:00:22.230> i'll<00:00:22.500> probably<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.920> reviewing<00:00:23.310> it

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
so far i'll probably be reviewing it

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.230 
so far i'll probably be reviewing it
maybe<00:00:24.029> tomorrow<00:00:24.380> I'm<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.619> sure<00:00:26.240> anyways

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
maybe tomorrow I'm not sure anyways

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.720 
maybe tomorrow I'm not sure anyways
that's<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> icon<00:00:28.439> looks<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.740> tiny

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
that's what the icon looks like tiny

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.290 
that's what the icon looks like tiny
wings<00:00:30.650> go<00:00:31.650> into<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.850> here's<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.180> basic

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
wings go into it so here's the basic

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.130 
wings go into it so here's the basic
menu<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.930> got<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> play<00:00:34.380> button<00:00:34.649> scores<00:00:36.140> yet

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
menu you got the play button scores yet

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.400 
menu you got the play button scores yet
top<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:38.149> 75,000<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:39.899> probably<00:00:40.200> not<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
top that 75,000 it's probably not that

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.889 
top that 75,000 it's probably not that
great<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.040> guys<00:00:41.070> could<00:00:41.340> probably<00:00:41.520> dead<00:00:41.899> but

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
great you guys could probably dead but

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.729 
great you guys could probably dead but
um<00:00:43.170> yeah<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.160> goes<00:00:44.309> down<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.760> 32<00:00:45.739> really

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
um yeah it goes down to like 32 really

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.299 
um yeah it goes down to like 32 really
random<00:00:46.950> number<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.610> whatever<00:00:48.260> um<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:50.190> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
random number but whatever um here you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.270 
random number but whatever um here you
can<00:00:50.399> flip<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> screen<00:00:51.649> no<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.800> doesn't<00:00:53.100> flip

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
can flip the screen no it doesn't flip

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.860 
can flip the screen no it doesn't flip
when<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:53.699> flip<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.360> there's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
when you just flip it like this there's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.959 
when you just flip it like this there's
a<00:00:54.960> reason<00:00:55.350> for<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.949> you'll<00:00:56.640> find<00:00:56.850> out

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a reason for that and you'll find out

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.029 
a reason for that and you'll find out
later<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.539> don't<00:00:57.960> want<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> spoil<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.649> surprise

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
later I don't want to spoil the surprise

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.360 
later I don't want to spoil the surprise
but<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.260> right<00:01:01.260> here<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> really<00:01:02.190> cool

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
but and right here this is a really cool

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
but and right here this is a really cool
thing<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.840> start<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> nest

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
thing so we start off you get a nest

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920 
thing so we start off you get a nest
it's<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> basic<00:01:05.729> nests<00:01:05.939> give<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> score

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
it's a basic nests give a score

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.350 
it's a basic nests give a score
multiplier<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.850> level<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.299> your

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
multiplier and you can level up your

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149 
multiplier and you can level up your
nest<00:01:09.689> by<00:01:09.900> completing<00:01:10.320> these<00:01:10.560> little<00:01:10.860> goals

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
nest by completing these little goals

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.640 
nest by completing these little goals
right<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> for<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.990> once<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.229> complete

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
right here and for it once you complete

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.140 
right here and for it once you complete
a<00:01:13.710> goal<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.010> little<00:01:14.250> red<00:01:14.340> X<00:01:14.369> next<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> will

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
a goal this little red X next to it will

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
a goal this little red X next to it will
turn<00:01:15.270> green<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:16.530> right<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:16.920> do<00:01:17.100> ten

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
turn green like right here do ten

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.670 
turn green like right here do ten
perfect<00:01:18.030> jumps<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.630> valid<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.560> i<00:01:19.619> do

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
perfect jumps on valid one so if i do

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.280 
perfect jumps on valid one so if i do
that<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.580> will<00:01:20.759> turn<00:01:20.970> green<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.420> then

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
that that will turn green and then

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
that that will turn green and then
you'll<00:01:22.439> upgrade<00:01:22.770> your<00:01:22.860> nest<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.310> every<00:01:23.670> time

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you'll upgrade your nest and every time

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.670 
you'll upgrade your nest and every time
you<00:01:23.909> finish<00:01:24.330> level<00:01:24.570> your<00:01:24.840> score<00:01:25.140> multiplier

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you finish level your score multiplier

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.149 
you finish level your score multiplier
with<00:01:26.460> x<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.229> determined<00:01:28.409> by<00:01:28.920> what

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
with x this which is determined by what

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.880 
with x this which is determined by what
level<00:01:29.520> your<00:01:29.729> nest<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.380> so<00:01:31.380> let's<00:01:31.560> start<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
level your nest is so let's start the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.399 
level your nest is so let's start the
game<00:01:32.070> play<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.479> game<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.290> a

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
game play what this game is it's a

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.830 
game play what this game is it's a
little<00:01:34.650> bird<00:01:34.829> who<00:01:35.159> ducked<00:01:35.549> who<00:01:35.790> cannot<00:01:36.119> fly<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
little bird who ducked who cannot fly so

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.289 
little bird who ducked who cannot fly so
he<00:01:37.110> uses<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.790> gravity<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.409> wind<00:01:41.210> let<00:01:42.210> me

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
he uses like gravity and the wind let me

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.840 
he uses like gravity and the wind let me
turn<00:01:42.450> this<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:44.100> use<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> gravity<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
turn this down and use the gravity in

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.550 
turn this down and use the gravity in
the<00:01:44.880> wind<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.479> he<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.840> pretend<00:01:46.320> he's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the wind so that he can pretend he's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.929 
the wind so that he can pretend he's
fine<00:01:46.860> i<00:01:47.100> guess<00:01:48.049> so<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.590> would<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.759> he

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
fine i guess so you would what you do he

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.700 
fine i guess so you would what you do he
flaps<00:01:51.329> his<00:01:51.329> wings<00:01:51.570> when<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> don't<00:01:52.380> hold<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
flaps his wings when you don't hold the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.990 
flaps his wings when you don't hold the
screen<00:01:52.920> when<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.159> hold<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> screen<00:01:53.759> he

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
screen when you hold the screen he

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.660 
screen when you hold the screen he
closes<00:01:54.630> him<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:54.990> this<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.500> helps<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.310> dive

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
closes him like this and helps them dive

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
closes him like this and helps them dive
down<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.229> got<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.500> all<00:01:58.560> those<00:01:58.860> blue

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
down so you got to do all those blue

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.840 
down so you got to do all those blue
ones<00:01:59.159> they<00:01:59.670> shoot<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.119> up<00:02:00.329> and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
ones they shoot you up and

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.849 
it's really smooth it doesn't drop any
frame<00:03:33.359> so<00:03:33.599> it's<00:03:33.720> not<00:03:33.810> good<00:03:33.959> like<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.109> lag<00:03:34.349> on<00:03:34.650> you
