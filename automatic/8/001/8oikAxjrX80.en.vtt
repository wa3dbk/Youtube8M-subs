like this and have like uh I don't know

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.910 
like this and have like uh I don't know
how<00:02:54.830> long<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:56.090> have<00:02:56.390> this<00:02:56.690> much<00:02:56.959> up

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
how long this is that have this much up

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.570 
how long this is that have this much up
here<00:02:57.980> from<00:02:58.610> your<00:02:59.420> neck<00:02:59.630> like<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.459> it's

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
here from your neck like that so it's

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.820 
here from your neck like that so it's
just<00:03:01.700> hanging<00:03:02.000> out<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.270> know<00:03:02.330> this<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.380> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
just hanging out you know this is the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.240 
just hanging out you know this is the
double<00:03:04.310> Windsor<00:03:04.730> ty<00:03:04.970> ty<00:03:05.480> ty<00:03:05.930> technique<00:03:06.650> by<00:03:07.190> the

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
double Windsor ty ty ty technique by the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.890 
double Windsor ty ty ty technique by the
way<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.930> go<00:03:09.050> across<00:03:10.030> grab<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.560> take<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.680> out<00:03:13.900> so

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
way you go across grab it take it out so

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.410 
way you go across grab it take it out so
you<00:03:14.930> know<00:03:15.200> how<00:03:15.320> you<00:03:15.380> went<00:03:15.709> across<00:03:16.190> to<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:17.120> left

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
you know how you went across to the left

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.199 
you know how you went across to the left
now<00:03:18.110> you're<00:03:18.500> gonna<00:03:18.650> go<00:03:18.830> to<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.400> right<00:03:19.610> so

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
now you're gonna go to the right so

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.030 
now you're gonna go to the right so
right<00:03:20.720> take<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.769> to<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.730> back<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:23.410> then<00:03:24.410> you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
right take that to the back and then you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.259 
right take that to the back and then you
I<00:03:25.930> guess<00:03:26.950> just<00:03:27.950> this<00:03:28.070> side<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.850> right<00:03:28.880> and

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
I guess just this side to the right and

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.750 
I guess just this side to the right and
now<00:03:29.900> you're<00:03:30.050> gonna<00:03:30.140> shove<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.590> in<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.550> middle

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
now you're gonna shove it in the middle

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.280 
now you're gonna shove it in the middle
like<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.650> create<00:03:34.100> a<00:03:34.239> symmetrical

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
like that so you create a symmetrical

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.550 
like that so you create a symmetrical
triangular<00:03:36.290> shape<00:03:36.530> like<00:03:37.430> that<00:03:37.459> and<00:03:37.850> then<00:03:38.690> when

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
triangular shape like that and then when

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.850 
triangular shape like that and then when
you<00:03:39.650> have<00:03:39.800> this<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.430> go<00:03:40.610> across<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.750> front

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
you have this you go across the front

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.059 
you have this you go across the front
and<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.790> take<00:03:45.030> it<00:03:45.150> out<00:03:45.209> in<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.360> middle<00:03:45.599> and

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
and you take it out in the middle and

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.040 
and you take it out in the middle and
then<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.310> shove<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.730> down<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.270> little<00:03:48.480> loop

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
then you shove it down the little loop

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.699 
then you shove it down the little loop
that<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.530> created<00:03:49.920> by<00:03:50.250> going<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:50.849> the<00:03:51.120> center

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
that you created by going to the center

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.380 
that you created by going to the center
okay<00:03:53.090> show<00:03:55.190> like<00:03:56.190> so<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.730> now<00:03:56.940> you<00:03:57.000> need<00:03:57.300> to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
okay show like so and now you need to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.839 
okay show like so and now you need to
like<00:03:57.540> kind<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.930> like<00:03:57.989> push<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:58.950> down<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.610> do

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
like kind of like push this down and do

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.339 
like kind of like push this down and do
all<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.090> stuff<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:02.269> there<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.420> go<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:04.140> want

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
all that stuff and there you go you want

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.199 
all that stuff and there you go you want
that<00:04:04.410> little<00:04:04.680> dimple<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.340> now<00:04:05.760> you<00:04:05.819> can<00:04:06.030> just

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
that little dimple and now you can just

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.990 
that little dimple and now you can just
pull<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.569> up<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:07.620> there<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.860> go<00:04:07.950> perfection

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.540 

and<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:12.959> just<00:04:13.110> take<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.349> off<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.709> go<00:04:14.370> like

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
and you can just take it off and go like
