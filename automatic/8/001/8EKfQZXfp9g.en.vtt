00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello very good everyone brings you a new 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.879
 tutorial and in your history I will teach you to 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.140
 disable one drive or skydrive this 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.360
 cloud service that has included 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.820
 microsoft in windows 8 in windows 8.1 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 fairly simple program and that one 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.770
 As you will see in the tutorial, I say it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.690
 It is quite simple and you will have 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.970
 files that you need in the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.170
 description and good also the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.510
 Frequently asked questions if there are 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.580
 you finished you will have in the description and 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.900
 Well, let's continue with the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.490
 tutorial and the first thing we're going to have 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 what to do would be to download this file 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.410
 which is excessive because then I would get 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 to disable it and then we have 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.329
 the ordo file that will serve us for 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.239
 then to reactivate it in case 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.250
 of equipment we want to activate it again 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.140
 Well then let's disable it 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 because that's what we're going to do now and 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.829
 I'm going to open the file explorer 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 so you can see what is android like 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 you see here and now we are going to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.230
 disable the first thing we're going to 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.050
 have to do is go to the subway 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.149
 windows and android writing as you see already 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.070
 it comes out and now what we have to do is 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.199
 give the second option no one drive 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.379
 if there is no storage space in 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.280
 one drive 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.750
 we give it to him and here we will all get 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.180
 all organizations and everything that 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.850
 So we have the synchronization theme 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.619
 of photos of things like that and so what 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.659
 we are going to have to do next 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.119
 would disable it all this as 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.189
 you see here we have this option that the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.619
 we have activated we are going to disable what 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.780
 same with the album we are going to disable 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.289
 this option and do not upload photos what 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.579
 next the sync auckland 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.579
 we disable and like the day of blows 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.319
 disables all connections of average use 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.479
 well, we also enabled ourselves and the vice 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.909
 they ask you for active then the same everything 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.770
 disabled and that's it 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.170
 Once this is done, we close what 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.119
 is that application and now what are we going 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.039
 to do is to execute this network point so 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.439
 what we are going to have to do is in the 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.759
 case that greets you then vote a right 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.810
 run as administrator as you see 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.049
 I do not get what you're going to have 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.369
 what to do is give it twice as the 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.340
 same normal and current we are going to give it 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.830
 execute we give you permission and here we go 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.410
 to see that yes 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.030
 now the accept and now let's open 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.700
 the file explorer to check 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.100
 that is not as you see, because not anymore 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.470
 we have here what is one drive 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.030
 so good as you see in a way 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.360
 very simple we have disabled one 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.310
 drive and it will not bother us anymore 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.950
 we go to the windows subway yet 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.710
 We will have one drive here as you can see 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.660
 good 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.550
 here if you want you can use it and 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.330
 but as you can see it is as we say 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.560
 escaped then here we can not do 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.960
 many things as you see I have been 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.940
 giving and then as it stays caught and 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.490
 as you see now, I do not get anything 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.920
 So, I think it's already 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.840
 completely uninhabited and good you can 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.850
 see for your own eyes because 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.550
 will fall here nothing comes out because I think that 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.080
 it is already quite uninhabited the only thing 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.910
 bad is as I say it is because you have to 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.350
 be here in the subway clogging 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.569
 You can also unpin if you do not want 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.640
 see here and everything is good 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.439
 as you see disabling it is very simple 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.959
 Well the same thing will be to enable it 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:13.859
 because it's going to be just going to be 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.420
 do the opposite process but for 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.580
 Now we will have to go because we 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.100
 the same 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.430
 to the meter of windows we are going to put one 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.990
 drive let's go to the space option 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.250
 storage of juan drive 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.120
 activate it that we are going to open 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.930
 disabled and well after this 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.000
 Well what we have to do is 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.680
 execute this file as we have 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.120
 done then before and in this way then 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.930
 giving him the permits to accept and others 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.880
 Well, we have activated one again 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.530
 drive in the case then that you repaint 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.410
 have removed it because here you have this 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.870
 option to re-enable tell them 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:55.550
 also that after let's say then 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.520
 open the file and give the permissions and 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.959
 all those things directly no no 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.940
 will happen the same thing that happened with this 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.670
 that will come out here already directly 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.400
 disabled then what you have to 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.280
 do after opening the file that 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.980
 will allow us to reactivate one drive 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.400
 after this we will have to restart 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.520
 the pc and then already directly no longer 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.860
 one drive will come out again and that's it 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.090
