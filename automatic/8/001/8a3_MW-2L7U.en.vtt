00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:15.879
 he marked in the recharge the entrance of the mining government bet on the house of the 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.039
 culture because of the holiday on the roads this Monday enjoy 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.930
 I'm worried about worsening each side 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.420
 the vote does not add anything concrete we have in mind about dating 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.849
 among the population 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.370
 of the rescue of the human body 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 position for the good-humored and confident winner 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.230
 the fall in price but at least in the next five rounds and in life 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.170
 literary 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.090
 penna will seek in productive efficiency while the controversy linked it 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.969
 need to have a doctorate in seul in planning 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.940
 begins the race to sell on request the other floors 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.990
 only accepts the cassock to optimize the productive potential and at the moment 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.560
 two months prior to the opening of the 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.930
 of the apparition 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.549
 the producer has already started 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.410
 today the nutritional management of herds 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.970
 to give 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.240
 two months when 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.799
 if the appearance of this cow is already prepared for the next lactation that 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:25.720
 initiates 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.010
 So what would it be like to show it to him? 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.640
 the importance of each of these phases 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.920
 before delivery 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.360
 and then during a performance the other subsequent phases 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.570
 its importance 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.650
 should make in the herd a 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.540
 separation of these 3% 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.880
 in which step 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.260
 pointing out his tents are 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.360
 he manages to make a food friend for each of these steps 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.030
 navana nana at the time that the cow can produce more quantity than the peak 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.530
 gives 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 of voting 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.000
 is a time that for a physiological issue cow eats less 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.600
 so he has to understand that there to do a diet with a high 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.590
 energy concentration 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.529
 in the 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.999
 the brand already starts eats more 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.629
 and a little later production begins to fall 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.289
 and now how to eat more 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:21.729
 so he has to prepare this voucher to complain who to be pregnant for 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:24.059
 her next lactation 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:26.639
 and that he was driving 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.459
 they understand that there 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.569
 it takes greater efficiency 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.679
 of milk production 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.399
 it is able to reduce the feeding costs that it 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:40.249
 need of the cow he is not doing her a feeding 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.199
 beyond your need 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.089
 so you're not spending more than this than you should 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.809
 if he understands each of these phases he can do an alimentary management 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:50.599
 of the flock 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.089
 efficiency in executive production 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.389
 with the new management of life death as the note points out 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.800
 the expression for the raw material vera feeds years 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.349
 he booked nothing in common agreement marked 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.749
 is provided to students principles of journalism the producer should affect 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:11.340
 before given time of appearance of the cow he has to make an initial balance 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.389
 very good 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:13.439
 on day 3 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.579
 at the time of the apparition of sabata that one begins lactation 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:20.269
 the demand for example by mineral 'cause is very large 

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:25.449
 so he has to prepare this physiologically physiological plate of the cow 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.619
 so that she can mobilize this calcium from the bones 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:32.859
 how does he do this by making a suitable mineral balance? 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.409
 at this stage he also has to 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:37.320
 prepared this animal 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.899
 for he has a food consumption 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.239
 only in a world that gives you a great management capacity in the box 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:46.739
 at the time of lactation 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.399
 then in the next phase that would be 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:51.939
 map after appearance 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:54.939
 this brand has to have a concentration of energy 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:58.719
 dress cotton 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.719
 barrels some malt food concentration of energy 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.609
 so that it can transform its production 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.859
 in the following stages it decreases the quantity 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.849
 based on diet and increases the amount of bulky 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.919
 so he understood that there would be basically the principles that 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.039
 must respect 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.470
 every year the process will have the least incidence incidence of Corintians 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.680
 was loaded into the final product a in the recommendation that collected evidence 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.720
 scenario producers this is a guy in milk production as a company 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.689
 - can not promise kassio nunes on the electric gÃ¡vea 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.449
 the first 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.909
 there is as he said understand 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.439
 no rush what dairy activity he is not a milk producer 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.380
 he is an entrepreneur that a company that has different segments organize 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.110
 each of the steps 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.219
 he understands each of the steps he has inside his dairy company 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.999
 he makes decisions that only serves to those who have ten stalls to whom he has 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.770
 three hundred seats 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.879
 paiva nunes in the understanding 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.879
 he doing this there is easier decision making of him 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.020
 the organization food management of reproductive health poster 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:08.900
 all of them 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.300
 but if you start 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.099
 I thought of quality from the beginning 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.039
 the next we act well in the Paraguayan and today 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.449
 a scenario that happened in Brazil five years ago 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.689
 ie it will have plants producing milk powder 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:23.939
 the export 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.569
 so if the product already has a Paraguayan product already has begins to work 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:29.909
 with quality from now 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.909
 as the market was gaining market share 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.840
 already consolidated
