00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.050
 20 grams is interesting result then 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.150

 huh 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.390
 here is not a protein that can be 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.549
 compared to milk has high content 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.770
 of fiber that fights some types of 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.320
 cancer and everything else that compounds 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.790
