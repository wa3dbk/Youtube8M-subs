00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.400
 de bon jovi right now we are taking 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.320
 Romantic songs and that for the 14 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.150
 February and well I think there are many 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280
 that if they have a partner and others do not leave 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.640
 here below a comment if they are 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.930
 married single widowers divorced now 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.119
 I know they also have to follow 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 by facebook and twitter to be able to 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.500
 leave so many more voting requests and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.000
 also here below leave me your request and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.330
 come I already know we have video demonstration 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.980
 here he enters and well let's do this 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 song totally adapted for 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.140
 acoustic guitar and perfect for 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.140
 beginners so well and we're going to 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 start let's start with the intro 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.190
 loans use my 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.720
 after the but what we are going to do with 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.370
 this is that we are going to leave 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.370
 these two strings to the air 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.070
 then we will use C sharp 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.290
 less 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.030
 here when sustained minor we leave the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.030
 air what would be the first 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.570
 the brush should not cost work since 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.220
 really does not wear the number 1 finger what 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.970
 who does nothing more than touch the fifth string 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:24.390
 then we pass like this and here in this case 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.850
 let's leave these two on the air 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 ok check how we would get the intro 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.340
 let's go donated with a radio to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340
 down 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.149
 you 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.070
 and there is the piano 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.420
 ok and we would have our intro the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.540
 part of the stanzas is the same we use 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.460
 the same chords and well in different 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.200
 order nothing else the only thing that will change 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.540
 is going to be the strum we are going to position 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.880
 our fingers in the C minor that 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.590
 teach in the lower sharp do so with 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.590
 this to the air and we started 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.100
 yes 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.100
 33 between the inti 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.100
 because if 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.650
 although they are dominating little by little 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.099
 so that it runs smoothly so 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.049
 I was going to do it fast you know that 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.599
 then we are doing slow because 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.599
 who are beginning to have 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.040
 we passed like this 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.340
 to 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.150
 from the tererÃ© 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.150
 recently we repeated should I have 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.170
 then the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.000
 yes 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.950
 here as you see this change is a little 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.720
 fast so let's slow it down 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.720
 because we are beginning to start 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.390
 without having to have 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.590
 here in the change and we repeat again 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.730
 comes the change 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.990
 t 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.880
 okay 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.090
 then it comes already what would be the pre 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.550
 this chorus we will go as it is for 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.170
 down and up to give you a 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.890
 little more than punch in the strum 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.890
 chequen know 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.210
 It is done 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.470
 let's give him parts 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.470
 the baby 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.120
 and here we are going to make it slow for the 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:29.360
 that are starting 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.360
 we started 3 2 1 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.000
 and 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.110
 Y 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.190
 tun tun tun there is no one is a radio like 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.190
 be green in the change 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.450
 okay 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.760
 So now we are going to part of 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.980
 choir is watching to use any 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:08.380
 Extra keeping more than art and them 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:08.380
 I taught and well we started fast 3 2 1 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.310
 change 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.260
 change 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.060
 we repeat 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.700
 and 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.350
 ah 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:40.969
 and then would come what would already be like 

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:43.239
 second part of the chorus and comes is the 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:43.239
 we make 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.770
 i 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.139
 as they realize the chords are 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.630
 they repeat a lot 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.150
 just dominate them and it seemed fine 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.240
 teach them like that without being followed since well 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.580
 Well it sounds good and I would not be so tired 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.740
