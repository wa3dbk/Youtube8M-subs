the<00:01:09.120> difference<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:10.560> size<00:01:11.240> man<00:01:12.240> oh<00:01:12.570> man<00:01:12.990> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the difference in size man oh man this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.770 
the difference in size man oh man this
one<00:01:13.560> would<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.980> twelve<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:15.300> you<00:01:15.480> took<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
one would be like twelve if you took the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
one would be like twelve if you took the
plastic<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.710> take<00:01:16.950> joke<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.370> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
plastic you know take joke in the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.220 
plastic you know take joke in the
process<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.850> 12<00:01:18.240> millimeters<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.050> is

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
process like 12 millimeters and this is

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.570 
process like 12 millimeters and this is
44<00:01:20.100> zero<00:01:20.550> millimeters<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.190> this<00:01:23.190> is<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
44 zero millimeters and this is the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.700 
44 zero millimeters and this is the
small<00:01:23.970> believe<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.990> or<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.200> this<00:01:25.410> is<00:01:25.620> the

small size and it weighs near five

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.380 
small size and it weighs near five
pounds<00:01:29.370> so<00:01:30.110> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.880> when<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.910> comes<00:01:33.120> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
pounds so you know when it comes to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.450 
pounds so you know when it comes to
delaying<00:01:35.240> cutting<00:01:36.470> this<00:01:37.470> thing<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.920> gonna<00:01:38.130> do

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
delaying cutting this thing is gonna do

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
delaying cutting this thing is gonna do
its<00:01:38.670> job<00:01:39.170> as<00:01:40.170> far<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:40.770> locking<00:01:41.190> mechanism

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
its job as far as the locking mechanism

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.600 
its job as far as the locking mechanism
goes<00:01:42.090> let<00:01:42.990> me<00:01:43.020> show<00:01:43.410> you<00:01:43.470> really<00:01:43.800> fast<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.460> can

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
goes let me show you really fast you can

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730 
goes let me show you really fast you can
see<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.150> key<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:46.050> it<00:01:46.230> is<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:46.500> inner

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
see from the key that it is an inner

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.630 
see from the key that it is an inner
groove<00:01:47.270> core<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.430> they<00:01:50.430> did

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
groove core in there and they did

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.840 
groove core in there and they did
something<00:01:50.880> kind<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.300> clever<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:53.250> make<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.670> cuz

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
something kind of clever to make it cuz

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.250 
something kind of clever to make it cuz
you<00:01:53.880> know<00:01:54.060> inner<00:01:54.240> groove<00:01:54.570> locks<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:55.110> be

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
you know inner groove locks can be

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260 
you know inner groove locks can be
picked<00:01:55.560> we<00:01:55.800> all<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> they<00:01:56.610> sell<00:01:57.060> in

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
picked we all know that and they sell in

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.770 
picked we all know that and they sell in
our<00:01:57.390> dedicated<00:01:58.020> inner<00:01:58.350> groove<00:01:58.650> picks<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
our dedicated inner groove picks but the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.270 
our dedicated inner groove picks but the
clever<00:02:01.140> thing<00:02:01.290> they<00:02:01.500> did<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.830> they<00:02:01.980> made<00:02:02.130> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
clever thing they did is they made it

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.130 
clever thing they did is they made it
super<00:02:02.520> long<00:02:02.940> look<00:02:03.510> at<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.750> look<00:02:03.930> at<00:02:04.020> it

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
super long look at that look at it

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.660 
super long look at that look at it
compared<00:02:04.470> to<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.590> regular<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.160> groove<00:02:05.400> key

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
compared to a regular in a groove key

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.749 
compared to a regular in a groove key
it's<00:02:06.210> super<00:02:06.750> long<00:02:06.900> to<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:08.250> don't<00:02:08.550> think

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
it's super long to just I don't think

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.760 
it's super long to just I don't think
you<00:02:08.970> use<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:09.479> standard<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.020> groove<00:02:10.319> pick<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
you use your standard and groove pick to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.709 
you use your standard and groove pick to
pick<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:11.459> because<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.090> length<00:02:12.299> so

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:12.719 
pick this just because of the length so

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.809 
pick this just because of the length so
it's<00:02:13.439> just<00:02:13.829> clever<00:02:14.659> addition<00:02:15.659> clever

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
it's just clever addition clever

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.270 
it's just clever addition clever
designed<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.659> make<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:18.170> harder<00:02:18.439> to<00:02:18.469> pick<00:02:18.769> we

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
designed to make it harder to pick we

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.420 
designed to make it harder to pick we
could<00:02:19.430> see<00:02:19.700> how<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:19.939> operates<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:21.370> by<00:02:22.370> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
could see how it operates here by the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.280 
could see how it operates here by the
way<00:02:22.639> this<00:02:23.540> part<00:02:24.349> of<00:02:24.439> the<00:02:24.499> keyway<00:02:24.950> is<00:02:25.249> not<00:02:26.290> where

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
way this part of the keyway is not where

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.839 
way this part of the keyway is not where
you<00:02:27.409> tension<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.859> lock<00:02:28.099> notice<00:02:28.579> how<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.819> just

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
you tension the lock notice how it just

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.910 
you tension the lock notice how it just
spins<00:02:29.299> around<00:02:29.480> that's<00:02:30.079> just<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.379> cover

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
spins around that's just a cover

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
dark but if I turn the key there it is

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.720 
dark but if I turn the key there it is
okay<00:06:06.260> so<00:06:06.320> there's<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:06.890> locking<00:06:07.250> dogs<00:06:07.430> so<00:06:07.669> you
