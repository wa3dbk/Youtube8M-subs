00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
they don't have a toy breed so that's

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.410 
they don't have a toy breed so that's
the<00:00:49.289> smallest<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.789> one<00:00:51.120> and

like<00:03:11.329> about<00:03:11.390> castor<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.440> pollux<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
like about castor and pollux is the

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:20.170 
like about castor and pollux is the
ingredients<00:03:14.299> are<00:03:14.450> organic<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:18.760> these<00:03:19.760> ones

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
ingredients are organic and these ones

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.830 
ingredients are organic and these ones
are<00:03:20.569> not<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.250> chose<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:26.030> get<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.480> small

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
are not so I chose to get the small

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.400 
are not so I chose to get the small
breed<00:03:27.139> size<00:03:27.500> because<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.190> noticed<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:29.269> that<00:03:29.750> the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
breed size because I noticed is that the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.949 
breed size because I noticed is that the
regular<00:03:30.859> dog<00:03:31.160> formulas<00:03:31.910> are<00:03:32.180> like<00:03:32.389> way<00:03:32.690> bigger

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
regular dog formulas are like way bigger

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.170 
regular dog formulas are like way bigger
so<00:03:33.470> that's<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.920> wellness<00:03:34.310> court<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.970> the

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
so that's the wellness court in the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.059 
so that's the wellness court in the
original<00:03:35.569> formula<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.950> this<00:03:37.819> one<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:39.859> one

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
original formula and this one is the one

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.830 
original formula and this one is the one
in<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.400> small<00:03:40.700> breed<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.730> look<00:03:43.730> at<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:44.030> size<00:03:44.299> and

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
in a small breed so look at the size and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.009 
in a small breed so look at the size and
then<00:03:45.590> this<00:03:45.950> one<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.639> other<00:03:46.849> wellness<00:03:47.569> and

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
then this one is the other wellness and

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:59.159 
then this one is the other wellness and
then<00:03:48.769> this<00:03:49.069> one<00:03:49.459> is<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:51.370> castor<00:03:52.370> and<00:03:52.459> pollux

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.949 

there<00:04:00.169> there's<00:04:00.620> a<00:04:00.709> more<00:04:00.950> clear<00:04:01.220> shot<00:04:01.519> but<00:04:01.959> see

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
there there's a more clear shot but see

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.710 
there there's a more clear shot but see
they're<00:04:03.349> just<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.859> lot<00:04:04.310> smaller<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.269> it's

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
they're just a lot smaller so it's

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.360 
they're just a lot smaller so it's
easier<00:04:05.810> for<00:04:06.530> her<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.739> chew

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.190 

okay<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.430> what<00:04:15.030> do<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.270> think<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:15.930> her

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
okay so what do you think is her

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.430 
okay so what do you think is her
favorite<00:04:18.410> that<00:04:19.410> one<00:04:19.850> that<00:04:20.850> one<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.690> one<00:04:21.900> or

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
favorite that one that one that one or

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.780 
favorite that one that one that one or
that<00:04:22.860> one<00:04:26.390> it's<00:04:27.390> gonna<00:04:27.840> be<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.620> think<00:04:29.100> that<00:04:29.520> one

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
that one it's gonna be I think that one

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.200 
that one it's gonna be I think that one
because<00:04:30.330> she<00:04:30.720> eats<00:04:31.170> that<00:04:31.560> right<00:04:32.010> away<00:04:32.310> every

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
because she eats that right away every

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.230 
because she eats that right away every
time<00:04:33.630> I<00:04:34.020> try<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.680> give<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.280> her<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.670> test<00:04:36.000> it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
time I try to give it to her and test it

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.130 
time I try to give it to her and test it
out<00:04:36.330> she'll<00:04:36.630> eat<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.870> right<00:04:37.170> away<00:04:37.230> I<00:04:38.930> mean<00:04:39.930> in

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
out she'll eat it right away I mean in

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.580 
out she'll eat it right away I mean in
the<00:04:40.290> end<00:04:40.470> she<00:04:40.950> does<00:04:41.190> eat<00:04:41.580> all<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.000> them<00:04:42.600> but<00:04:43.080> it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
the end she does eat all of them but it

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.640 
the end she does eat all of them but it
just<00:04:43.770> seems<00:04:44.340> like<00:04:44.540> that<00:04:45.540> one<00:04:45.870> she'll<00:04:46.380> always

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
just seems like that one she'll always

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.560 
just seems like that one she'll always
eat<00:04:47.070> whenever<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.460> give<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.910> her<00:04:48.000> that<00:04:48.060> one

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
eat whenever I give it to her that one

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.640 
eat whenever I give it to her that one
she<00:04:49.520> sometimes<00:04:50.520> eat<00:04:50.880> but<00:04:51.270> she<00:04:51.300> eats<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.930> more

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
she sometimes eat but she eats it more

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.890 
she sometimes eat but she eats it more
often<00:04:52.919> than<00:04:53.790> the<00:04:54.090> other<00:04:54.330> two<00:04:56.120> these<00:04:57.120> two<00:04:57.419> she

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
often than the other two these two she

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.750 
often than the other two these two she
doesn't<00:04:58.260> really<00:04:58.350> like<00:04:58.770> as<00:04:59.010> much<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.430> don't<00:04:59.490> know

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
doesn't really like as much I don't know

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.330 
doesn't really like as much I don't know
maybe<00:05:00.030> it's<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.510> shape<00:05:01.230> because<00:05:01.740> only

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
maybe it's the shape because only

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.520 
maybe it's the shape because only
similarities<00:05:03.270> I<00:05:03.450> can<00:05:03.630> tell<00:05:03.840> between<00:05:03.990> those

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
similarities I can tell between those

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.840 
similarities I can tell between those
two<00:05:04.980> are<00:05:05.660> that<00:05:06.770> they're<00:05:07.770> circular<00:05:08.370> and<00:05:08.580> those

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
two are that they're circular and those

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.940 
two are that they're circular and those
two<00:05:09.150> triangular<00:05:11.240> but<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.600> don't<00:05:12.810> know<00:05:13.050> I<00:05:13.380> mean<00:05:13.590> I

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
two triangular but I don't know I mean I

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.190 
two triangular but I don't know I mean I
heard<00:05:14.550> well<00:05:15.150> people<00:05:15.480> have<00:05:15.630> been<00:05:15.690> telling<00:05:15.960> me

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
heard well people have been telling me

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.110 
heard well people have been telling me
that<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.890> should<00:05:17.460> get<00:05:17.790> my<00:05:18.060> dog<00:05:18.419> be<00:05:18.780> smaller

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
that I should get my dog be smaller

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.760 
that I should get my dog be smaller
formula<00:05:21.120> not<00:05:21.570> only<00:05:21.960> because<00:05:22.260> it's<00:05:22.440> smaller

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
formula not only because it's smaller

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.460 
formula not only because it's smaller
and<00:05:22.950> easier<00:05:23.280> for<00:05:23.729> her<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:23.880> chew<00:05:24.300> but<00:05:24.840> the

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
and easier for her to chew but the

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.450 
and easier for her to chew but the
benefits<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.280> are<00:05:26.700> made<00:05:27.620> with<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:28.680> formula

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
benefits that are made with the formula

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.560 
benefits that are made with the formula
of<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:29.729> small<00:05:30.030> breed<00:05:30.300> dog<00:05:30.600> are<00:05:30.990> supposed<00:05:31.560> to

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
of a small breed dog are supposed to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.500 
of a small breed dog are supposed to
benefit<00:05:33.570> my<00:05:33.990> dog<00:05:34.290> more<00:05:34.740> than<00:05:35.370> the<00:05:35.910> regular

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
benefit my dog more than the regular

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.690 
benefit my dog more than the regular
formulas<00:05:37.080> which<00:05:37.380> are<00:05:37.560> made<00:05:37.830> for<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.310> guess

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
formulas which are made for I guess

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.080 
formulas which are made for I guess
bigger<00:05:39.210> dogs<00:05:39.620> so<00:05:40.620> I'm<00:05:40.890> not<00:05:41.040> sure<00:05:41.100> tell<00:05:41.790> me<00:05:41.910> what

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
bigger dogs so I'm not sure tell me what

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.790 
bigger dogs so I'm not sure tell me what
you<00:05:42.240> guys<00:05:42.390> think<00:05:42.810> what<00:05:43.140> do<00:05:43.200> you<00:05:43.260> feed<00:05:43.590> your

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
you guys think what do you feed your

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.360 
you guys think what do you feed your
dogs

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
dogs

dogs
you<00:05:44.520> feed<00:05:44.729> him<00:05:44.820> organic<00:05:45.150> do<00:05:45.780> you<00:05:45.900> feed<00:05:46.110> him<00:05:46.229> the

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
you feed him organic do you feed him the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.570 
you feed him organic do you feed him the
better<00:05:46.919> ones<00:05:47.220> or<00:05:47.520> do<00:05:47.640> you<00:05:47.760> just<00:05:47.790> feed<00:05:48.270> them<00:05:48.570> the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
better ones or do you just feed them the

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.510 
better ones or do you just feed them the
regular<00:05:50.580> you<00:05:51.510> know<00:05:51.540> big<00:05:52.140> name<00:05:52.380> companies<00:05:53.070> like

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
regular you know big name companies like

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.510 
regular you know big name companies like
AIIMS<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:55.970> Beneful<00:05:56.970> I<00:05:57.270> heard<00:05:57.660> those<00:05:58.020> were

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
AIIMS and Beneful I heard those were

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.140 
AIIMS and Beneful I heard those were
also<00:05:59.520> good

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
also good

small breed formula because it's

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.439 
small breed formula because it's
supposed<00:06:40.800> to<00:06:40.860> be<00:06:40.979> better<00:06:41.130> for<00:06:41.370> her<00:06:41.520> joints<00:06:42.240> and

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 
all that because she's tiny but she

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.309

00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 
formula I mean she does he bowing to but

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:54.710 
formula I mean she does he bowing to but
she<00:06:52.770> really<00:06:53.340> likes<00:06:53.490> that<00:06:53.669> like<00:06:54.090> that<00:06:54.360> she'll

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 
she really likes that like that she'll

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.270 
she really likes that like that she'll
eat<00:06:54.960> and<00:06:55.199> like<00:06:55.380> I<00:06:55.500> said<00:06:55.770> she<00:06:55.919> hasn't<00:06:56.069> been

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440

eat but it seems like she doesn't like
her<00:07:01.710> food<00:07:02.930> but<00:07:03.930> when<00:07:04.139> I<00:07:04.169> gave<00:07:04.409> her<00:07:04.590> that<00:07:04.620> for

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:05.310 
her food but when I gave her that for

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.219 
her food but when I gave her that for
the<00:07:05.400> first<00:07:05.669> time<00:07:05.970> she<00:07:06.360> gobbled<00:07:06.810> it<00:07:06.840> up<00:07:06.990> and

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
the first time she gobbled it up and

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.689 
the first time she gobbled it up and
every<00:07:07.530> time<00:07:07.560> I've<00:07:07.889> tried<00:07:07.919> to<00:07:08.190> give<00:07:08.430> it<00:07:08.460> to<00:07:08.610> her

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 
every time I've tried to give it to her

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:10.820 
every time I've tried to give it to her
she'll<00:07:09.330> eat<00:07:09.539> it<00:07:09.569> compared<00:07:10.110> to<00:07:10.139> the<00:07:10.319> other<00:07:10.500> food

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:10.830 
she'll eat it compared to the other food

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.460 
she'll eat it compared to the other food
she'll<00:07:11.159> like<00:07:11.430> try<00:07:12.150> it<00:07:12.180> first<00:07:12.659> or<00:07:13.909> you<00:07:14.909> know<00:07:15.470> not

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:16.470 
she'll like try it first or you know not

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.760 
she'll like try it first or you know not
try<00:07:16.919> it<00:07:16.949> spit<00:07:17.759> it<00:07:17.880> out<00:07:18.090> that<00:07:18.539> one<00:07:18.780> I<00:07:18.810> think<00:07:18.990> she

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
try it spit it out that one I think she

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.249 
try it spit it out that one I think she
right<00:07:20.099> away<00:07:20.250> and<00:07:20.940> that<00:07:21.569> one<00:07:21.720> shake<00:07:21.900> right<00:07:22.020> away

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 
right away and that one shake right away

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:24.469 
right away and that one shake right away
I<00:07:22.289> think<00:07:22.560> that<00:07:22.860> one<00:07:23.069> she<00:07:23.280> didn't<00:07:23.699> like<00:07:24.060> the

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
I think that one she didn't like the

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:26.300 
I think that one she didn't like the
first<00:07:24.690> time<00:07:24.870> I<00:07:24.960> ever<00:07:25.139> like<00:07:25.590> introduced<00:07:26.099> it<00:07:26.280> to

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310 
first time I ever like introduced it to

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.520 
first time I ever like introduced it to
her<00:07:26.460> but<00:07:26.789> eventually<00:07:27.690> like<00:07:27.870> I<00:07:27.900> said<00:07:28.199> she<00:07:28.469> ate

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 
her but eventually like I said she ate

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.310 
her but eventually like I said she ate
all<00:07:28.740> of<00:07:28.770> them<00:07:29.219> those<00:07:30.090> two<00:07:30.509> she<00:07:30.930> eats<00:07:31.080> more

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.320 
all of them those two she eats more

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.740 
all of them those two she eats more
often<00:07:31.800> this<00:07:32.099> one<00:07:32.400> every<00:07:33.090> single<00:07:33.270> time<00:07:33.570> I've

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:33.750 
often this one every single time I've

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.610 
often this one every single time I've
given<00:07:33.900> it<00:07:34.139> to<00:07:34.289> her<00:07:34.500> she's<00:07:35.310> eaten<00:07:35.849> it<00:07:36.229> so<00:07:37.229> I

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 
given it to her she's eaten it so I

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.709 
given it to her she's eaten it so I
guess<00:07:38.250> we'll<00:07:38.550> see<00:07:38.789> you<00:07:38.969> and<00:07:39.120> tell<00:07:39.330> me<00:07:39.479> what<00:07:39.599> you
