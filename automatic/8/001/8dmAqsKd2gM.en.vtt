00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
you oh my god is I think the best part

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.050 
you oh my god is I think the best part
is<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.380> see<00:02:48.800> what<00:02:49.010> color<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.280> comes<00:02:49.550> off<00:02:49.700> like

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
is like see what color it comes off like

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.640 
is like see what color it comes off like
even<00:02:50.690> though<00:02:50.750> it's<00:02:50.870> not<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.110> color<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.530> will

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
even though it's not the color that will

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.890 
even though it's not the color that will
transfer<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.040> your<00:02:52.190> hair<00:02:52.370> I<00:02:52.520> think<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:53.750> the

mix the won't be the exact color but

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.260 
mix the won't be the exact color but
it's<00:02:56.570> a<00:02:56.660> really<00:02:56.870> exciting<00:02:56.959> because<00:02:58.270> just
