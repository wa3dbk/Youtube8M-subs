diseases that occur in the abdomen and I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.640 
diseases that occur in the abdomen and I

like doing procedures as well so this
was<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> natural<00:00:23.519> fit<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:23.730> me<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.240> did<00:00:24.600> my

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
was a natural fit for me I I did my

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
was a natural fit for me I I did my
training<00:00:24.779> at<00:00:25.199> Emory<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.650> Atlanta<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.250> we

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
training at Emory in Atlanta and we

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040 
training at Emory in Atlanta and we
wanted<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.760> my<00:00:27.210> wife<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:27.570> wanted<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.840> stay

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
wanted to my wife and I wanted to stay

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.109 
wanted to my wife and I wanted to stay
in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> south<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.010> wanted<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> join<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> big

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
in the south and I wanted to join a big

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
in the south and I wanted to join a big
group<00:00:30.390> which<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.869> important<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.500> me<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.800> it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
group which was important to me and it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
group which was important to me and it's
been<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.369> good<00:00:32.550> fit<00:00:32.790> for<00:00:33.540> us<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.809> think<00:00:33.960> there<00:00:34.320> are

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
been a good fit for us I think there are

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.650 
been a good fit for us I think there are
a<00:00:34.410> lot<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.739> benefits<00:00:35.430> from<00:00:35.640> from<00:00:36.000> being<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
a lot of benefits from from being in a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.450 
a lot of benefits from from being in a
large<00:00:36.899> group<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.530> think<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> main

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
large group and I think that the main

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.700 
large group and I think that the main
benefit<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:40.309> it<00:00:41.309> allows<00:00:42.710> individual

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
benefit is that it allows individual

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.130 
benefit is that it allows individual
doctors<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> carve<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.910> specialty<00:00:45.480> areas<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
doctors to carve out specialty areas and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.110 
doctors to carve out specialty areas and
niches<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:47.280> they<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.730> become<00:00:47.910> very

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
niches that they can become very

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.819 
niches that they can become very
proficient<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.910> because<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.940> our<00:00:51.149> size<00:00:51.360> we

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
proficient at and because of our size we

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.750 
proficient at and because of our size we
have<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> lot<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> patients<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> our<00:00:53.699> practice

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
have a lot of patients in our practice

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.049 
have a lot of patients in our practice
and<00:00:54.469> those<00:00:55.469> patients<00:00:55.949> who<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.250> uncommon<00:00:56.940> and

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and those patients who have uncommon and

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.060 
and those patients who have uncommon and
usual<00:00:57.420> diseases<00:00:57.960> we<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.350> follow<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.920> those

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
usual diseases we can follow to those

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430 
usual diseases we can follow to those
physicians<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.699> our<00:00:59.789> practice<00:01:00.329> who<00:01:01.050> have

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
physicians in our practice who have

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.039 
physicians in our practice who have
especially<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.219> those<00:01:02.370> diseases<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
especially in those diseases and as a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.200 
especially in those diseases and as a
result<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> lot<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.850> lot

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
result they get to see a lot of on a lot

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.990 
result they get to see a lot of on a lot
of<00:01:06.390> uncommon<00:01:07.110> diseases<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> regular<00:01:08.580> basis

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
of uncommon diseases on a regular basis

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.520 
of uncommon diseases on a regular basis
and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.869> makes<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> better

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and I think that makes for a better

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.890 
and I think that makes for a better
clinical<00:01:11.040> outcome<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> patient<00:01:11.970> my

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
clinical outcome for the patient my

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.200 
clinical outcome for the patient my
philosophy<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:13.920> screen<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:14.520> cancer<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.970> think

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
philosophy on screen for cancer I think

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
philosophy on screen for cancer I think
it's<00:01:15.390> well<00:01:15.900> worth<00:01:15.930> doing<00:01:16.560> I've<00:01:16.770> had<00:01:17.009> my

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's well worth doing I've had my

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.960 
it's well worth doing I've had my
colonoscopy<00:01:17.750> when<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> turned<00:01:19.110> 50<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:20.009> wife

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
colonoscopy when I turned 50 and my wife

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
colonoscopy when I turned 50 and my wife
will<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.390> hers

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
will have hers

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
will have hers
actually<00:01:22.619> she's<00:01:22.799> had<00:01:22.979> hers<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> there's<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
actually she's had hers is there's a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.080 
actually she's had hers is there's a
family<00:01:24.060> history<00:01:24.180> there<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.159> we<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.460> try<00:01:27.030> to
