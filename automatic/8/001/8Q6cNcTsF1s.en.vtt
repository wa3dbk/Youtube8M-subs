00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
of gun that we see here was also used by

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.300 
of gun that we see here was also used by
Luke<00:02:16.480> Skywalker<00:02:16.959> as<00:02:17.230> well<00:02:17.410> in<00:02:17.650> impulse<00:02:18.100> of<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
Luke Skywalker as well in impulse of the

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.660 
Luke Skywalker as well in impulse of the
film<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.140> resin<00:02:21.040> weapon<00:02:21.520> so

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
film this is just a resin weapon so

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.190 
film this is just a resin weapon so
there's<00:02:21.819> a<00:02:21.850> not<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.300> live<00:02:22.510> fire<00:02:22.720> weapon<00:02:23.110> even

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
there's a not a live fire weapon even

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.570 
there's a not a live fire weapon even
though<00:02:23.350> they<00:02:23.470> would<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.739> had<00:02:23.860> a<00:02:23.890> life<00:02:24.130> far<00:02:24.400> as

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
though they would have had a life far as

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.280 
though they would have had a life far as
well<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.390> this<00:02:25.540> would<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:25.780> been<00:02:25.810> used<00:02:26.050> for

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
well so this would have been used for

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.670 
well so this would have been used for
action<00:02:26.770> sequences<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:28.390> scenes<00:02:29.260> where<00:02:29.560> they

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
action sequences and scenes where they

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.870 
action sequences and scenes where they
wouldn't<00:02:29.860> have<00:02:30.010> wanted<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.430> live<00:02:30.670> fire

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
wouldn't have wanted to have a live fire

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.449 
wouldn't have wanted to have a live fire
weapon<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.390> set<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:32.020> would<00:02:32.230> be<00:02:32.380> built<00:02:32.650> with<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
weapon on set it would be built with a

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.970 
weapon on set it would be built with a
methyl<00:02:33.900> internal<00:02:34.900> support<00:02:35.080> structure<00:02:35.680> for<00:02:35.709> it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
methyl internal support structure for it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.370 
methyl internal support structure for it
as<00:02:36.069> well<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:36.760> resin<00:02:37.180> can<00:02:37.420> become<00:02:37.660> fragile<00:02:37.959> at

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
as well as resin can become fragile at

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.290 
as well as resin can become fragile at
certain<00:02:38.680> times<00:02:38.890> too<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:39.760> we<00:02:39.940> acquired

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
certain times too and this we acquired

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.800
