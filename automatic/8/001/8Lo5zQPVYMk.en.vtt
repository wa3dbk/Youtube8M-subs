00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello very good everyone today I bring you 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.649
 a review of a bot le monde to see how 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.990
 it was called already forgotten as joystick 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.809
 what is the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 be the mod brother to call from some 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.910
 way of happy wheels vale is that only 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.400
 has a graf that they have nothing more than 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.310
 that you are going to teach right now 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.580
 We put a stick behind metal 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.180
 here one rusty in the middle and two is 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.500
 line balls will give us support this value is 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.350
 it's that easy 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.590
 that has this character 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.460
 so 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.840
 We put this here and see 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:48.390
 Right click we climb up 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.630
 they have not gone up to my mother is that it is already 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.270
 and you see that just getting on this starts at 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.270
 jump although I will surrender the computer 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.870
 and there for there 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 You see, it's just this 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 this goes super well for 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.980
 to move you I will try to include 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.870
 the series of motorcycles 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.240
 and I do not know why I'm doing so badly 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:21.100
 right now 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.630
 I have no idea worth and 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.259
 it is simply this I have a doubt 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.000
 that if I wanted to be the space bar 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.119
 it jumps higher 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.240
 I have that doubt I think not but good 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.509
 come jump from one house to another 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.509
 we can 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.459
 almost come up 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.929
 if not 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.950
 he's very cool and over 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.750
 see what 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.240
 it goes pretty fast especially 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.500
 moving forward with this although I am 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 slowing down the computer 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.660
 but I'm going to think that I'm going to step on 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.660
 some crop 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.700
 rodeos 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:24.340
 fuck i know 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.340
 and now that now now what 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.210
 ok this does not break you just do 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.790
 this then there is I take it is like this 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.470
 easy is a super simple mod that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.630
 something that I have seen I have done super 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.020
 of grace over 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.860
 because it's super simple but very very 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.080
 fun to use 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.170
 so well this has been a whole video 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.890
 very very short for the second of the day 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.670
 and until next time 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.670
 goodbye
