00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.119
 welcome to talk about joaquin press 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.710
 caparrÃ³s and emperors lift when 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.150
 want you first question have 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.810
 here the microphone 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.150
 mister good night gives the feeling of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.489
 that football today has won the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.760
 lift but in the end the points are 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.980
 it takes to madrid it hurts a lot I imagine 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.070
 politically that I do not know the high 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.719
 competition that does not exist is not a 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.570
 It's a pity I think we 've done it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.089
 almost everything to win we have left over 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 three minutes or four minutes with four 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.479
 minutes that will come down from the game already there 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.340
 you have to finish party that is not 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.620
 play more 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.310
 no more game is played and therefore 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.810
 of us we have lacked in some 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.489
 footballers a little bit of experience 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.290
 because there is no need to play more 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.810
 party knowing they were 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.300
 playing since they had put all the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.250
 offensive potential because that we have it 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.140
 that know how to handle us and work 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 the four minutes with the status of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.340
 anxiety and knowing what they in this 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.570
 party they were juana after 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.510
 do the hardest because when 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.850
 we were a little more good because more 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.160
 tired the golden abyss has come and that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.740
 he had to give us the oxygen and without 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.149
 However, I insist that it is a pity 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.100
 because the team's effort has been 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.930
 tremendous 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.880
 there was a magnificent atmosphere with our 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.150
 hobby we wanted to give that joy to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.530
 our people and we're leaving 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.720
 because I think it's good that the 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.970
 madrid from here takes the three very much 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.140
 points but in the reality of football what 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.140
 what are they worth? 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.740
 in the end the triumphs and to us 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.020
 passed in other matches and sure not 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.810
 it has happened and we have to continue 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.640
 keeping this intensity here behind 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.890
 joaquin good night how is the 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.650
 wardrobe after complicated a game 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.870
 it's hard 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.460
 a madrid match we knew it was 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.369
 very difficult but the team faces it 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.770
 we have done a match very well 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.510
 first part well and we have come out very 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.000
 well the second part we have come out very 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.770
 well and we had our options 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
 I die until good again because I believe 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.410
 which is one of the most 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 highlight of madrid because with plays 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.980
 punctual has been good because he has done 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.890
 good stops today it is painful but 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.440
 well this has to be useful for us 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.360
 to mature and grow if something can 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.370
 be worth something that has to be that for 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.160
 mature in other situations 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 I insist that we have to know more 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.860
 drive 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.450
 and have control of the party not 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.860
 we have the game because it was already in 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.980
 but if we have to manage the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.540
 control of the joaquin party by level 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.580
 of equipment that you face today and through 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.660
 the image that the team has given is the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.310
 better lift of the season as I'm 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.930
 I believe that each one I believe in each 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.240
 match the 10 points that have the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.640
 footballers because in the end they have 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.260
 done good things in matches this 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.540
 it's been a very much act party 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.330
 disciplined does not know why the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.770
 otherwise it was demanded otherwise but 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.420
 I insist that the points that the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.570
 team that has also won and 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.210
 got the points at the last minute but 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.860
 well, in the matches phase 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.860
 previous and that we have been seeing 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.900
 but we have to keep working 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.820
 in the East has reached the 90th minute 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.350
 winning the match 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.930
 I already know that it is difficult and that it is almost 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.550
 Unexplained told you not 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.350
 I should have played more what that 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.630
 it means that it does not have a little 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.680
 also the feeling that the team has 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.620
 also recoiled too much in that time 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.439
 of the power that Madrid had 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.540
 regular we have regulated logically we have 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.069
 regulated because the madrid got you to 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.260
 through is that it has removed all those who 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.319
 they had that has gotten all the potential 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.939
 offensive that he had and we were 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.650
 already quite tired both 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.780
 midcentres stretches both paper and 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.189
 we were threads and the three of us 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.650
 footballers that the mother is over or for 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.659
 their people 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.349
 fresh and with tremendous quality and is 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.599
 what makes you you to get behind what 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.419
 he does it being cool so more in the 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.100
 90 minute when you are already with that 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.320
 but that's why I 'm telling you that there we have 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.070
 we who handle another make another 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.900
 control of the party no less than daily 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.569
 the world 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.429
 for putting a but 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.740
 they mark the rivals too soon 

00:04:31.429 --> 00:04:36.050
 when you mark the ball is to say the day the 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.110
 Valladolid passed and today has gone well 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.509
 It should be especially close play at 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.979
 stopped ball that we were 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.209
 neutralizing well it's true that I have 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.709
 changed the second part because 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.419
 we knew that we were there 

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:48.830
 defending to see but including 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.689
 we had talked all that guy 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.759
 of situations and that goal you can not 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.589
 put you can get a move that 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:56.839
 reject a wall as they are good has 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:58.129
 tremendous quality but the first goal 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:01.990
 they put us in, we have to be 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:04.460
 much more forceful at the time of 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.800
 mister commented that only in the end are worth 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.320
 the three points but they do not leave many 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.940
 positive readings this game fits me 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.020
 the fact the positive but with that what 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:16.690
 we eat we eat with what 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.419
 with reality and reality is to add and 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.940
 we have not added therefore good if 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.820
 we have left 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.460
 we have been there we have known 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.320
 compete that was what I was saying to you 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.090
 principle of 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.670
 the press conference yesterday that what 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.630
 we wanted to compete and that we have 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.790
 done but in the end we have left over those 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.120
 34 minutes I insist that we had to 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.080
 to have 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.360
 and acted in another way 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.560
 the coach is clear that it was difficult 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.210
 but following the line of what 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.470
 asked the compaÃ±era yes that there 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.229
 players that have a growth 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.680
 clear and I think he has made a great 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.810
 match 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.449
 simao hector there are many who leave 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.240
 adding to the cause and adding well that 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.509
 well we have to have everyone 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.120
 the players trying to be at a 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.889
 very balanced level because the 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.360
 season in a demanding one is there 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.740
 very much equality to set the 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.040
 results that are occurring and so 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.110
 So much good we need everyone 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:19.250
 more players in this to a level 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.740
 available mostly to pay 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.840
 good trainers 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.760
 the question 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.500
 the question has repeated several times that 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.940
 has perhaps missed experience in those 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.320
 last four minutes we have seen 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.940
 when the goal has been scored 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.419
 it could have been the victory that 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.460
 2 to 1 you and helping also for 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:39.139
 acquiring the help of the grandstand perhaps 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.060
 you are not going to miss that experience of 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.060
 his players are missing a bit 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.050
 kick goal we the ball route there 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.530
 a few details that you have to 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.530
 know how to handle 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.110
 I'm sure it will happen again 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.120
 and we're going to know how to handle that kind of 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.860
 actions because that's what I was saying 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.170
 they had put all the potential 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.360
 offensive were they were aware that 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.980
 they had to win they had to win because 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.020
 they play a lot here we have 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:09.260
 to play with that anxiety and we 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.780
 well that having handling situations 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.970
 kick-off so that goal plays 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.370
 in the rejection area where we have to go 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.320
 et cetera etcetera and that has 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.190
 missed not because the rest we have 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:24.090
 fact 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:26.390
 all good - that's a lot very well 

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.390
 thank you very much
