00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.910 
pretty hard I'm actually surprised to
see<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.540> than<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.810> me<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.500> game<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.890> be

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
see more than just me in this game to be

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.180 
see more than just me in this game to be
honest<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.490> maybe<00:02:09.440> maybe<00:02:10.440> people<00:02:10.830> trying<00:02:11.070> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
honest but maybe maybe people trying it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.770 
honest but maybe maybe people trying it
out<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> try<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.670> out<00:02:11.790> maybe<00:02:12.300> they<00:02:12.480> actually<00:02:12.690> do

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
out to try it out maybe they actually do

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.900 
out to try it out maybe they actually do
like<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.050> game<00:02:13.290> it's<00:02:14.070> plausible<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.670> mean

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
like this game it's plausible I mean

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.050 
like this game it's plausible I mean
it's<00:02:15.090> not<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:16.709> hmm<00:02:17.459> that's<00:02:17.670> hard<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.910> say

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
it's not like the hmm that's hard to say

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.030 
it's not like the hmm that's hard to say
can't<00:02:18.990> say<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.350> worst<00:02:19.590> game<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
can't say it's the worst game in the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.220 
can't say it's the worst game in the
world<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:20.780> itself<00:02:21.780> in<00:02:21.900> an<00:02:21.990> interactive

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
world but itself in an interactive

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.180 
world but itself in an interactive
that's<00:02:22.770> for<00:02:22.950> sure<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:25.050> really<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.500> you

she's<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.790> an<00:02:38.910> MPC<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.450> got<00:02:39.630> her<00:02:39.780> from<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.470> quest

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
she's just an MPC I got her from a quest

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.020 
she's just an MPC I got her from a quest
really<00:02:41.100> early<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.810> so<00:02:43.459> yeah<00:02:44.459> I<00:02:44.489> get<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> get

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
really early on so yeah I get to get

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.900 
really early on so yeah I get to get
followers<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.900> game<00:02:46.110> which<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.910> guess

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
followers in this game which I guess

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.380 
followers in this game which I guess
adds<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.269> little<00:02:48.390> variety<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.220> sense<00:02:50.459> because

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
adds a little variety in a sense because

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.850 
adds a little variety in a sense because
the<00:02:51.480> character<00:02:51.780> customization<00:02:52.110> was<00:02:52.560> actually

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the character customization was actually

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.229 
the character customization was actually
pretty<00:02:53.010> in-depth<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.850> you<00:02:53.940> had<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.120> do

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
pretty in-depth on what you had to do

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.120 
pretty in-depth on what you had to do
was<00:02:54.269> you<00:02:54.630> either<00:02:54.750> choose<00:02:55.019> male<00:02:55.350> or<00:02:55.530> female<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
was you either choose male or female and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.110 
was you either choose male or female and
then<00:02:57.060> um<00:02:57.380> that's<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.560> choose<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> name<00:02:59.120> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
then um that's it you choose a name and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.979 
then um that's it you choose a name and
that's<00:03:00.269> about<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.510> most<00:03:00.630> in-depth

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
that's about the most in-depth

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.380 
that's about the most in-depth
customization<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.709> ever<00:03:01.860> seen<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.070> my<00:03:02.100> life<00:03:02.390> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
customization of ever seen in my life so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.610 
customization of ever seen in my life so
I<00:03:03.420> guess<00:03:03.600> I've<00:03:03.780> already<00:03:03.930> in<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.200> game<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.590> to

minutes and I'm already level 24 I

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.090 
minutes and I'm already level 24 I
didn't<00:03:15.810> even<00:03:15.900> realize<00:03:16.170> how<00:03:16.650> much<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.980> was

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
didn't even realize how much I was

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.560 
didn't even realize how much I was
leveling<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.519> until<00:03:17.850> later<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.209> in<00:03:18.450> my<00:03:18.540> life

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
leveling up until later on in my life

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.830 
leveling up until later on in my life
when<00:03:19.080> I<00:03:19.320> just<00:03:19.560> was<00:03:19.799> shooting<00:03:20.459> up<00:03:20.519> levels<00:03:20.880> so

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.060 
when I just was shooting up levels so
that<00:03:21.870> was<00:03:22.140> actually<00:03:22.320> probably<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.860> coolest

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
that was actually probably the coolest

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.830 
that was actually probably the coolest
thing<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.519> his<00:03:23.640> game<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:23.970> far<00:03:24.239> as<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:24.450> shake<00:03:24.660> jump

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
thing of his game so far as I shake jump

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.280 
thing of his game so far as I shake jump
up<00:03:25.019> here<00:03:25.580> but<00:03:26.580> anyways<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.810> can<00:03:27.900> see<00:03:28.080> I'm

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
up here but anyways as you can see I'm

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.690 
up here but anyways as you can see I'm
doing<00:03:28.470> absolutely<00:03:28.799> nothing<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:29.400> I'm<00:03:29.489> so

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
doing absolutely nothing and I'm so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.580 
doing absolutely nothing and I'm so
progressing<00:03:30.269> with<00:03:30.330> my<00:03:30.480> life<00:03:30.660> um<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.290> hit

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
progressing with my life um I just hit

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.670 
progressing with my life um I just hit
24<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:33.360> that's<00:03:33.510> good<00:03:33.600> um<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.200> think<00:03:34.440> you<00:03:34.530> can

only have one active skill you know it's

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.620 
only have one active skill you know it's

not like skills family anything so

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.900 
not like skills family anything so
that's<00:03:39.630> kind<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.370> interesting<00:03:41.370> I've<00:03:41.730> never

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
that's kind of interesting I've never

that's kind of interesting I've never
seen<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.150> kind<00:03:42.330> of<00:03:42.690> system<00:03:42.840> in<00:03:43.080> a<00:03:43.140> game

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290
