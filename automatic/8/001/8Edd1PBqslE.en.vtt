00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.490
 d 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.249
 w 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.439
 we have 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.599
 Arnesen still next to hundreds yes I refuse 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:21.960
 Dr 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 r 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.310
 century 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.820
 so Munk fateful in the thirteenth day of this match 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.290
 football World Cup 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.650
 But I hope that they are ready to bring us happiness 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.840
 because tonight is 11:30 pm 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.000
 our sample Germany how to go 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.990
 Garner 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.990
 but then on the twelfth day 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.890
 the French are not much improved and Proto Rehhagel is Ariel 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.640
 but it is not ready 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.380
 lost to Argentina 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.930
 what else did you expect, yes 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.420
 Interest expired on Tuesday with the target group 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.259
 according to first knockout round they are also clearly s4m similar on Saturday against 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.490
 26 Ston sixth 16 clock 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.380
 Uruguay against South Korea 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380
 and the next day at 8:30 pm 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.510
 those who own theirs 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.850
 Mexico is a very exciting game it will be difficult as in the case one 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.750
 Woman is leaving 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.550
 Round of 16 Berlin 1 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:50.999
 watch all games 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.300
 just as she is one no longer have the most players he can 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.760
 behind us 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.730
 OK so 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.180
 the first Indian karun the second league everyday 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.510
 and it's our turn 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.440
 there and complex to my tips for today apply a tenth day of play 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:15.559
 SID and comedy that prevent the decisions on the first and 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:16.219
 -second 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.219
 and banks towards them towards the end also against each other 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:27.730
 to undergo the contrast is to weigh four points with 4 Enders and 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.499
 Eberstadt with each 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:35.409
 2 and Algeria once had both England and England 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:35.990
 lost 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.229
 also the again 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.099
 KÃ¼nzelsau 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.339
 we 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:43.199
 In mid-September starting game today against Slovenia against their worst 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.229
 group 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:49.140
 as in Japan, being a tie is enough to get ahead 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.449
 depends of course the US plays against Algeria 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:56.499
 and 4 may will be 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.010
 I'm counting on a 2 to 0 England against Slovenia 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.030
 before the game the USA against Algeria 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.739
 Zurich also 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.769
 1 both 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.769
 LÃ¼nen the USA 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:21.010
 now to ours about the group 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.600
 Year Guaranteed Points 4 and Smith Parts Series operates 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:32.519
 clearly you could draw if you draw in the second 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.369
 That could be enough for Germany against Australia, of course 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.749
 Play victory 

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:41.749
 and those in the immediate vicinity do not find them losing 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.029
 she race wins what you probably do against Australia 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:49.119
 not out Oh that's going to be extreme today 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:50.329
 you write 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.079
 Take Malteser for ten items 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:58.349
 2 to 1 for our team against Canada bets 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:06.109
 and therapies against Australia 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.999
 Susan Boyle also drew everything to 1 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.409
 Jana this constellation would be Germany number one in the group d 

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.040
 and I hope so 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.079
 also at from 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.840
 in the final the Gant 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.330
 England is when the legal action as in which they are on number 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.639
 one and how many of these things here too 

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.319
 but against England that would of course be in the last sixteen 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.939
 Yes 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:37.750
 recently 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.970
 the players will be broadcast in the arena idea today 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:43.889
 SchÃ¶ntal 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.139
 so that was my results 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.960
 By the way, there are 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.819
 I did not want to specify at the time 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.460
 because so the ranking of the best 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.930
 the bank leads 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.629
 Onyx, all of Wacker are in first place 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:58.599
 I think so 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.059
 one day all 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.779
 with 19 points 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.330
 7 Charles 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.290
 4 line Euro Wallau yes sometimes 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.719
 only two victories 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.029
 10 are looking cheap 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.999
 with 17 points 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:18.769
 and 3, each with 14 points in Flensburg count de guerre board 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:21.069
 previously in the park 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.979
 so feasible 16 clock it starts 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.569
 send us your dear percent I firmly believe that today's after 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:30.629
 with the beautiful car parade 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.029
 Drive through the city center here 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:36.229
 and Jenny, he also comes to see how they talk 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.400
 we only assume that 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.509
 fal as well 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.270
 Fingers crossed 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.099
 already closing time 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:45.599
 us
