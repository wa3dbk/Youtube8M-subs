00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.080
 all friends welcome 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.940
 I just purchased this product for 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:14.809
 call comcast has recommended a lot 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:18.320
 today we went through a store and it's 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:22.009
 this gem chrome cast I hope you see it 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.989
 well it 's from the google company and well what 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.460
 they have recommended a lot we will see 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.789
 to open let's see what it is that 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.789
 we find 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.020
 comcast 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.020
 is this 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.230
 the throne was only with his 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.940
 chrome cast 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.830
 here we leave 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 there is also a charger and a cable 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.340
 hdmi 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.330
 in extension of HDMI cable I imagine 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.250
 when your TV does not have the input 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.510
 then this stops to be able to connect it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.570
 best 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.150
 that is our data cable 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.090
 with usb input and it's all there 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.900
 is this that is the big guarantee the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.040
 platea limited 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.950
 he guarantees that with two fights he meets 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.840
 with all the quality standards and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.229
 bla bla bla 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.420
 well let's see this is options 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.119
 quick start connect the socket 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.359
 current or is that the chrome is connected 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.960
 cast is connected to the television this is 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.180
 connect to light 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.700
 good and you can also connect to 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.990
 USB port if your TV has 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.970
 connects directly with this one 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.480
 what happens to me gives the outlet 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.590
 of access to television 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.810
 good also on hdmi television 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.179
 and well you can synchronize everything to 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.460
 everything everything you have in the house of 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:05.200
 uruguay font uruguay 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.359
 by or stone with whatever is operating it 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.819
 you can not synchronize and good 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:13.870
 Serve with your laptop with your iPad with your 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.750

 laptop my iphone and an ipad that we have 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.019
 over here to watch on our television 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.330
 let's hope that they improve our quality 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.990
 let's see on this TV 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.300
 and I'm going to make the cut let's go to 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.420
 prove this is an installation that 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.180
 download an application you have to wait 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.110
 The application manages to do this by 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.110
 what I'm going to do right now 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.960
 good friends I will cut to record 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.210
 this good I'm not going to record the 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.560
 installation because passwords and things 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.560
 well only 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.600
 we continue announcements as is 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.940
 good friends after doing the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.400
 installation we look for in the part 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.830
 later the hdmi entries here 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.280
 I have using one here we have a 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.690
 free that's where we're going to put it 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.440
 we just put it on broadcast 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.440
 people 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.060
 there we have the cable that is this 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.220
 this we are going to connect it in some 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.920
 usb entry that we have in our 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.200
 team if you do not have it if you do not have this 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.840
 you put it to the student body that came and what 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.069
 you put to the current of your house I have 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.590
 a usb here our part 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.870
 to place connect and observe cables 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.909
 also not 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.819
 good is already in theory is the 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.740
 installation and you already learned if you see it there 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.160
 is 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.200
 there is already connected, well I will do 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.500
 the installation already configures because I 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.540
 make an application it will lower the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.060
 application on the phone in everything that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.640
 have synchronized and I'm going to 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.730
 download in a laptop that I have for 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.370
 there and live this is the way it is 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.740
 until very easy it connects 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.380
 connects to these and this connects to 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.690
 the wifi network of your home and through the 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.510
 wifi because we will control what 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.670
 that you have on your team in your in these 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.130
 you will be able to see it at the same time 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.640
 with television that's the idea of ​​this 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.340
 is a repeater interests this is a 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.040
 repeater we're going to see in a mirror what 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.560
 that we have in all our equipment 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.230
 on the laptop it's like a little better 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.940
 because there are many applications and good 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.490
 is what I've been reading that many 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.610
 applications for google chrome 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.010
 chrome you must download google commented 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.810
 two teams in that is not necessary the 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.730
 ios is already going to download the 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.100
 application and from there they transmit it or 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.740
 youtube netflix or whatever you have 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.349
 in in this and you can see it 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.210
 on television and I think what 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.599
 interesting about this is that you can have 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.759
 working say this youtube and 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.440
 You can keep watching facebook or any 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.270
 thing and while you are watching here as 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.280
 a television looks like a control 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.099
 remote that's pretty much what it would be 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.020
 this is not good I'm going to configure and 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:19.810
 I'll show you how it looks 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.060
 very good gentlemen then I already configure 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.490
 do this it's good to put the application 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.449
 appeared a box above 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.669
 very well 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.809
 to see if they can see it here where 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.419
 says plaza camacho right now there is a 

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:35.689
 small square as a television and a signal 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.360
 as antenna is the application already 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:41.029
 it was downloaded to my phone and everything 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.940
 what I have not ipad and on the laptop 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:46.480
 he also appeared 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.969
 well I will try this I will put no 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.949
 I know a video that is 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.180
 because they see this they others the 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.110
 TV 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.940

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.540

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.560
 phone appeared configuration 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.290

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.680
 You put the name and you do this and you know 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.720
 configured but they watch the video that I 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.060
 I have here I will transmit it to the 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.710
 television without wires or anything that's the 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.710
 idea of ​​the stand 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.349
 and I hope you sell it 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.419
