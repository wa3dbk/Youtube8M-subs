00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.749
 well friends of tdn well we are here in 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.419
 the goals of the classic kikin fonseca 

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:09.090
 chaco giménez two figures that a while ago 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.740
 as we saw here who interviewed you 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.720
 my friend from Chaco then I think 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.060
 that is going to be a success this section 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.049
 of kikin fonseca and in the goals of 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.269
 classic good because I 'm going to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 ask something very fast I stay chaco 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.279
 when you played in america you fell 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.259
 evil of the blue cross who did not like me or who 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.259
 you did not like the equipment that you liked 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.750
 is the step that we had to follow 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.750
 after the game 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.190
 95 I counted 95 steps I count it now 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 that kept me quiet 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.320
 that you liked when you played cross 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.140
 Blue america of america 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.149
 suddenly they thought themselves invincible and 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.649
 suddenly that pomegranates and suddenly 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.589
 they enlarged and they would be going to win 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.960
 only with the T - shirt she is now no 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.960
 blue cross that falls ill of the america 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.470
 of the america 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:22.480
 I believe that 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.640
 that I do not like 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.970
 no no no I do not have something special 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.380
 because you did you feel any sport 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.380
 ever against the america 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.120
 the passion 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:42.030
 You changed some beach in the classic 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.030
 South America with whom yes with sangüesa 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.659
 You changed some tallera in the classic 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.159
 If your child is very far away to the track more 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.020
 hard 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.380
 because she was a long time ago I do not remember 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.659
 with whom but changed several today 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.100
 Chaco and I guess today with everything 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.289
 has won america in the championships and 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.039
 everything you have sports envy to 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.039
 america nothing 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.600
 because they have won championships like 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.510

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.310
 no not really 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.150
 it seems very good to me like any team 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.720
 we all win perfect championship 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.940
 sometime as a player 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.480
 I admired come out of america you kissing a 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.120
 heart and how not good and from before I 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.120
 from from laxague child for example 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:46.410

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.680
 I did not see it playing or on video you've 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.680

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.860

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.830
 good what was 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.640
 older word but after 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.880
 I like watching something happened to me 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.210
 something significant there were three players 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.980
 that I admired so much 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.280
 but to see it in the selection 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.760
 1st cuauhtemoc while being in
