00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
realized that now 94 is not that strong

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690 
realized that now 94 is not that strong
I<00:01:27.240> know<00:01:27.299> maybe<00:01:27.600> Roxy<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.170> better<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.700> well

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I know maybe Roxy one is better but well

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
I know maybe Roxy one is better but well
I<00:01:29.970> don't<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.659> ok<00:01:30.900> quindi<00:01:31.079> two<00:01:31.290> seemed

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
I don't know but ok quindi two seemed

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
I don't know but ok quindi two seemed
natural<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.130> ok<00:01:32.460> after<00:01:32.579> 94<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> didn't<00:01:33.630> think

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
natural and ok after 94 I didn't think

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.749 
natural and ok after 94 I didn't think
that<00:01:34.020> you'll<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.560> for<00:01:34.680> 94<00:01:35.100> bit<00:01:35.250> 94<00:01:35.640> because

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that you'll go for 94 bit 94 because

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.730 
that you'll go for 94 bit 94 because
there<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.570> some<00:01:36.720> position<00:01:37.079> point<00:01:37.259> XD<00:01:37.560> five

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
there is some position point XD five

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.460 
there is some position point XD five
when<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.070> xt<00:01:38.340> 595<00:01:38.970> Bishop<00:01:39.240> takes<00:01:39.390> be<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> 97th

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
when the xt 595 Bishop takes be to 97th

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.350 
when the xt 595 Bishop takes be to 97th
and<00:01:40.590> every<00:01:40.799> situation<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.310> two<00:01:41.909> points<00:01:42.210> for

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
and every situation with two points for

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.819 
and every situation with two points for
the<00:01:42.479> exchange<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:42.930> probably<00:01:43.259> black<00:01:43.680> has

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
the exchange but probably black has

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.319

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
I mean it was like boring game okay he

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.780 
I mean it was like boring game okay he
played<00:02:05.320> this<00:02:05.860> slide<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:07.390> didn't<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.830> didn't

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
played this slide I didn't I didn't

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.850 
played this slide I didn't I didn't
consider<00:02:10.210> it<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.540> serious<00:02:11.080> this<00:02:11.380> language

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
consider it like serious this language

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.430 
consider it like serious this language
bit<00:02:12.100> too<00:02:12.310> because<00:02:13.210> somehow<00:02:13.450> there<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.260> do

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
bit too because somehow there is to do

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.680 
bit too because somehow there is to do
it<00:02:14.650> couldn't<00:02:15.100> see<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.520> same<00:02:16.270> position<00:02:16.660> i

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
it couldn't see to the same position i

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.670 
it couldn't see to the same position i
think<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.970> locate<00:02:18.970> i<00:02:19.480> think<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.940> quality<00:02:21.940> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
think but locate i think a quality and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.760 
think but locate i think a quality and
create<00:02:23.680> equal<00:02:24.610> position<00:02:25.030> ID<00:02:25.150> I<00:02:25.560> think<00:02:26.560> there

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
create equal position ID I think there

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.400 
create equal position ID I think there
may<00:02:26.890> be<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.040> bishop<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.760> faith<00:02:28.000> was<00:02:28.210> strong<00:02:28.540> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
may be a bishop of faith was strong and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:39.600 
may be a bishop of faith was strong and
after<00:02:30.220> that<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:30.790> drawing<00:02:38.130> no<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> think

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
after that it's just drawing no I think

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.780 
after that it's just drawing no I think
no<00:02:40.300> I<00:02:40.330> expected<00:02:41.110> because<00:02:41.230> kinetic<00:02:42.130> force<00:02:42.370> was

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
no I expected because kinetic force was

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.050 
no I expected because kinetic force was
nothing<00:02:43.180> and<00:02:43.660> just<00:02:43.690> take<00:02:44.350> English<00:02:44.770> before<00:02:45.060> so

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
nothing and just take English before so

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.080 
nothing and just take English before so
it's<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.630> think<00:02:46.750> after<00:02:47.080> which<00:02:47.440> by<00:02:47.590> five<00:02:47.830> it's

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
it's I think after which by five it's

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.140 
it's I think after which by five it's
more<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.240> less<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.660> draw<00:02:49.870> position<00:02:50.910> if<00:02:51.990> nobody

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
more or less the draw position if nobody

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.310 
more or less the draw position if nobody
doing<00:02:55.150> some<00:02:55.480> stupid<00:02:56.170> moves<00:02:56.680> need<00:02:57.160> strong

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
doing some stupid moves need strong

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.230 
doing some stupid moves need strong
normally<00:02:59.320> should<00:02:59.560> be<00:02:59.709> no<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.920> were<00:03:03.240> probably

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
normally should be no you were probably

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.470 
normally should be no you were probably
the<00:03:04.600> last<00:03:04.750> very<00:03:05.530> long<00:03:05.590> series<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.070> fun

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.119 

yeah<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.510> think<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.050> will<00:03:13.110> have<00:03:13.200> some<00:03:13.500> two<00:03:14.010> months

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
well okay in general of course it's very

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.420 
well okay in general of course it's very
unpleasant<00:03:49.440> to<00:03:49.500> be<00:03:49.620> exhausted<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.190> when<00:03:50.370> you

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
unpleasant to be exhausted and when you

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.370
