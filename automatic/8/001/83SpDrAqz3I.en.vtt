so<00:03:31.830> since<00:03:32.610> Jigglypuff<00:03:33.240> became<00:03:33.540> a<00:03:33.570> fairy<00:03:33.840> type

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
so since Jigglypuff became a fairy type

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.930 
so since Jigglypuff became a fairy type
I<00:03:34.290> figured<00:03:34.590> cool<00:03:34.860> fairy<00:03:35.220> probably<00:03:35.670> will<00:03:35.820> as

I figured cool fairy probably will as

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.450 
I figured cool fairy probably will as
well<00:03:36.260> also<00:03:37.260> I<00:03:37.470> could<00:03:37.590> see<00:03:37.830> a<00:03:37.860> good<00:03:38.040> chance<00:03:38.250> that

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
well also I could see a good chance that

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.350 
well also I could see a good chance that
Chauncey<00:03:39.000> becomes<00:03:39.330> a<00:03:39.420> fairy<00:03:39.660> type<00:03:39.900> perhaps

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
Chauncey becomes a fairy type perhaps

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.730

kind of similar you know they're pink so

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.270 
kind of similar you know they're pink so
