so<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.240> wind<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.540> traveling<00:01:32.020> up<00:01:32.170> my<00:01:32.350> arm<00:01:32.560> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
so the wind is traveling up my arm a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
so the wind is traveling up my arm a
little<00:01:33.100> bit<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.580> gets<00:01:33.729> to<00:01:33.880> about<00:01:33.970> my<00:01:34.150> shoulder

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.820 
until it kind of stopped another thing
I've<00:01:37.330> learned<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.750> if<00:01:37.869> it's<00:01:38.020> really<00:01:38.350> hot<00:01:38.560> I

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
you can see it in the in the mirror here

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.289 
you can see it in the in the mirror here
but<00:01:45.130> I'm<00:01:45.220> opening<00:01:45.549> my<00:01:45.640> jacket<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.210> I

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
straighten my back and that allows air

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.180 
straighten my back and that allows air
to<00:01:48.220> go<00:01:48.840> around<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.050> around<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.530> jacket<00:01:51.009> and
