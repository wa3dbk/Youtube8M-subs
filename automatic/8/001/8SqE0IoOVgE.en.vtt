kind of what makes it unique its its
selling<00:01:54.060> point<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> improves<00:01:55.649> Wi-Fi

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219

however<00:02:48.960> if<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.590> bring<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.250> EMW<00:02:50.790> unit<00:02:51.420> up<00:02:51.570> out

however if you bring the EMW unit up out
of<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.410> case<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.920> just<00:02:53.100> kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.430> look<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.700> a

little bit like an idiot trying to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.740 
little bit like an idiot trying to
