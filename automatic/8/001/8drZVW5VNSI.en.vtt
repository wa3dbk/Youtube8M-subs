00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:12.780
 we tied up the row and now look I here 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.990
 I measure the diameter of our bottom at me 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.240
 now he is 11 centimeters 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.270
 checking the table you now too 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.000
 can you check i must be 17 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.869
 half a centimeter means next we 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:35.809
 continue to also knit and increase 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.809
 our diameter blossomed by chance 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:51.310
 here we knit a new series for this again we 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:54.260
 translate the hook under the air loop 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.239
 We will add in places where we have 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.210
 connected our 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.699
 embossed column oh and the columns between 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.680
 we will knit with embossed columns 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:13.280
 column with one aerial loop sc 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:17.810
 double crochet and here we are just 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:23.380
 knitting also does not add and so 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.320
 knit 3 air loops for lifting 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.619
 double crochet 1 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.210
 2 double crochets as you see here 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:38.210
 we change nothing further knit 1 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:45.229
 embossed column also we see it 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.509
 grab in front further between 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:53.509
 embossed columns here we knit 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:57.190
 double crochet 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:03.910
 another double crochet 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:09.259
 then we knit a 2 embossed column 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:11.260
 dopevyazyvat it here and also continue 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.690
 knit two single crochet poles 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.740
 air drink air loop 2 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.740
 single crochet 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.520
 So 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:34.080
 Now look how it turns out so we 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.840
 knit our new series again we came to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.260
 the spirit of our embossed pillars first 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.560
 the column we knit between the columns 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.470
 we knit a single crochet 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.950
 single-column air loop 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:59.540
 and then we knit 2 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:59.540
 embossed column here 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.700
 well and then knit also two columns with 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.700
 one nakida air loop 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.390
 and two single crochets 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:30.520
 knit again 1 relief column between 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.460
 we knit a column with one double crochet 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:41.610
 single-column air loop 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:49.420
 and further 2 relief column 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:54.180
 so knit our row to the end of this row 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:57.700
 us was the final since we 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:02.830
 got the right diameter 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:08.610
 bottom further the following rows we knit 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:13.320
 just like the previous one and in the end we 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.320
 get a hat 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:23.700
 we knit without additions just like 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:26.050
 previous row and knit on the height of the cap 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.040
 sixteen and a half centimeters 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.270
 because the next rows we will 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.030
 to tie up 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.640
 why 16 half centimeters because 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.730
 what is my table 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:43.050
 hat on the age that I see 18 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:45.520
 centimeters height 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.710
 one and a half centimeters we leave for 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:53.560
 strapping if your hat needs more 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.460
 one row to get the right diameter 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.110
 bottom 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:03.669
 then as an addition we knit so 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.919
 have a look between the relief columns we 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.080
 knitting 2 single crochet poles 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:13.960
 air loop 2 double crochet 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.390
 further after the relief column we 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.160
 knitted 1 double crochet 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.710
 double crochet 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.530
 this was our final row in the data 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:28.890
 cop if you need another row then 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.600
 between embossed poles everywhere 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.740
 tie two double crochets 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.910
 air loop 2 double crochet 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:43.380
 this number you can increase the diameter 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.380
 bottom to the right size 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.660
 to tie the edge and we will be the same 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.770
 thread but because we 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:01.930
 print avaya yarn I rewind 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:05.860
 that site in we have no bill but of course 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:10.150
 you can just find the same white yarn 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:14.500
 colors and tie up do the first working 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:20.550
 hook and tie 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:27.520
 our hat in every loop of posts 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:31.720
 nakida places where associated with relief 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:38.430
 bars i miss because edge 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.430
 the strapping will be more dense 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.980
 so knit without crochets for both 

00:06:52.940 --> 00:07:04.070
 walls around the perimeter of our 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:08.150
 our hats and knit five or six 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:18.050
 rows it all depends on what edge you are 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:22.310
 want to remind again that we knit in 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:26.330
 every loop but at the same time skip 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:37.280
 embossed poles embossed poles we 

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:42.710
 do not knit here our hat is ready for 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:44.720
 I added a hat like a rose 

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:48.260
 I already showed you a rose 

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.020
 previous video this rose 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:54.530
 slightly larger in size to tie 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:57.970
 a bigger rose just dial at the beginning 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:08:03.520
 more air loops 

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:07.520
 then your rosette will be bigger 

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.160
 well that's all I hope you enjoyed
