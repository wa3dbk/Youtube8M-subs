00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 so we're going to make an eggplant recipe 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.940
 stuffed 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.560
 so it's not really an eggplant 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.099
 rather it is the shepherd rolls 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:16.970
 about the two shepherds so I cut 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:20.010
 my aubergines like that the pieces 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.470
 I coated some olive oil a little 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.840
 with the brush I warm up and my oven 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.099
 400 haiti favor and then I'll go 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.680
 put a little time she 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.630
 soften a little bit just so I 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.399
 can not bend them too much because after 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.370
 we will continue cooking with our 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.149
 phase then there I need beef 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.660
 chopped me I take the extra lean like 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.360
 always 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.040
 sometimes the price is more expensive extra 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.239
 lean but when you remove the fat without 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.610
 link to a thing like aig redon 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.410
 understand to take it to the extranet of the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.399
 parmesan it's optional we are not 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.059
 obliged that you have another cheese 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.690
 very good also kalamata olives at 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.030
 black if possible and then for the herbs 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.680
 I'm gonna have no cool ladies 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.559
 so I'm going to use sort it's a 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.930
 mixture of stahl herbs and so that these 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.450
 mans zones like that if I have a paw of 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.490
 coriander like that it does not taste 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.869
 exactly the same as your coriande 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.200
 understand I do not know why yet 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.509
 and coriander ground but except that ben 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.530
 it gives taste is very good too 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.810
 olive oil so we already have it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.040
 used to brush our energies 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.259
 after we will use to bring back 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.930
 our minced meat and bequeath to them their 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.770
 I have tomatoes still firm 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.540
 like that then else we can use some 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 fresh tomatoes time wants to cut in b 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 it's even better then the quantity 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.400
 it is 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.440
 it's more important than stuffing it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.510
 our shepherds and the rest with a 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.920
 lucky we put on top so even if 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.210
 you have a lot it does not matter 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 and little used also to accompany 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.619
 pasta or rice 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.869
 a tomato paste a paste of 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:56.610
 tomato is not optional increase 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.430
 and then mushrooms so I'm going 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 use onions and garlic 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.280
 you can buy red peppers 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.780
 green or where else then 20 then friends 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.509
 are going to be woven optional but it's 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.640
 very good with the mixture we want 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.170
 to do so I put my eggplants in 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.030
 wrong I leave a little bit just 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.310
 to soften so that I can feet 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.560
 and we will start our stuffing width 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.989
 and heats two spoons of oil 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.580
 of olive we add the mushrooms and 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.320
 then we'll try a few minutes 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.239
 justin can not really as they 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.980
 be cooked there have bought net returns 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:44.170
 add my hamburger you pay is m 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.170
 then there hat 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.830
 we add our cut radius is in 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.470
 form which m onion early my name 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.120

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.330
 even long enough even though I was coming 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.060
 now and then 2 cloves of chopped garlic 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.090
 for me speak let's redeem the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.460
 grounds 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:24.160
 I will see what is it 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:26.410

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.290
 tomato 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.080
 so here I'm going to add I finish 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.330

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.280
 rest of my box i love you a good i 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.170
 go add a game to a judgment there 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.790
 I will add the rest of my voice 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.580
 tomatoes finally have I put a 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.540
 box of tomato proved that we had placed 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.170
 to buy two spoons of damage 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.840
 salt pepper 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.760
 we put a spoon of fata corientes 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.340
 for me if I had coriander 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.340
 cool we were sure or a spoon 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:04.209
 of salty air and then in the meantime I 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:06.390
 took out my eggplant and then I go 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.220
 remember the world had preceded by 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.080
 add but arrive and but installed 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.480
 then I will taste after except it 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.620
 will redeem or sex or broth 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.980
 bouillon cube play or two if you 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:26.919
 have beef level so that's it 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:31.320
 add the Parmesan and friends 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.320
 December added the maximum five minutes 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:44.240
 so I'm going to take a slice of 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:46.750
 bergie I will stuff so I 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:54.320
 go on the widest end 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:56.390
 and then we roll, I do the same thing 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.710
 for others and put that in a 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.050
 dish that goes deep I had all my 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.580
 eggplant like that 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.770
 then I have the rest of the cement sauce 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.450
 stay good I think I'm just going to 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.210
 put over rap is a little bit of 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.610
 parmesan and we put in the oven almost everything 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.750
 is cooked so if you do not want the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.430
 eat right away you can the 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.120
 keep or let it cool keep it 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.910
 in the refrigerator 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.020
 then just to make some gratin a little 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.430
 oven before serving 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.350
 then it's good to eat right away 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.890
 but immediately but not in the oven 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:31.040
 have scratched and so badly so here it's back and 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.570
 my plan is ready to go to the bottom of the 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.870
 swimming pool 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:38.300
 well here it is ready and then but as 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.920
 I said we can keep one or the 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.490
 eat right now and it's very good 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.490
 for lunch
