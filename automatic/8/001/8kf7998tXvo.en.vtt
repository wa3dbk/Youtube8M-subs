00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.010 
I just don't see finding a simple medkit
or<00:01:53.860> how<00:01:53.979> that's<00:01:54.220> gonna<00:01:54.400> help<00:01:54.670> but<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:55.900> know

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
or how that's gonna help but you know

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.280 
or how that's gonna help but you know
for<00:01:56.440> Taylor's<00:01:56.770> sake<00:01:57.010> hopefully<00:01:57.940> he<00:01:58.210> can<00:01:58.450> find

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
for Taylor's sake hopefully he can find

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.250 
for Taylor's sake hopefully he can find
a<00:01:59.380> medkit<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.010> get<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.270> captain<00:02:01.690> stabilized

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
a medkit and get the captain stabilized

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.440 
a medkit and get the captain stabilized
but<00:02:02.650> this<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:03.400> was<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.610> little<00:02:03.880> short<00:02:04.180> we're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.910 
but this one was a little short we're
going<00:02:04.720> on<00:02:04.810> a<00:02:04.840> little<00:02:05.110> over<00:02:05.380> two<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> half

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
going on a little over two and a half

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.950 
going on a little over two and a half
minutes<00:02:06.310> here<00:02:06.520> but<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:07.119> know<00:02:07.270> it<00:02:07.479> is<00:02:07.720> what<00:02:07.930> it

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960

hopefully<00:02:09.429> Taylor<00:02:09.820> can<00:02:10.119> get<00:02:10.570> her<00:02:10.720> stabilized

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
hopefully Taylor can get her stabilized

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.990 
hopefully Taylor can get her stabilized
I<00:02:11.500> just<00:02:11.709> hope<00:02:11.860> he<00:02:12.010> doesn't<00:02:12.160> work<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.850> too

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
