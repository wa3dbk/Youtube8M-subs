ability to add such a radiance to the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.929 
ability to add such a radiance to the
skin<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.920> actually<00:01:29.220> ashamed<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.729> powder

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
skin but it's actually ashamed to powder

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
skin but it's actually ashamed to powder
the<00:01:30.060> whole<00:01:30.299> face<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:30.990> away<00:01:31.140> some<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650

where you really need to which would be

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450
