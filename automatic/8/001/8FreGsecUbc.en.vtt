00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 how friends are my name giancarlo 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.870
 today I'm going to draw the mister gus de tÃ­o 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.090
 grampa 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.130
 so how did we do the first thing 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.640
 let's start drawing is going to be your 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.220
 nose 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.220
 today we are going to do first like this 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.029
 do you have 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.640
 to some gaps and already in cimac we will begin 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.080
 to draw his eyes 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.080
 let's do it this way 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 and then we go with the other 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.379
 it does not stick 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.750
 but here we go with the head 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 let's see each other on this side 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 and we will go down here 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.250
 come on now here is a jar your lips 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.250
 let's do like this 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.100
 your lips in this way 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.310
 the face is how we can see it's like 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.170
 very in expressive is common so 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.490
 I was reading from what I've seen is like very 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.490
 relaxed this character 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.490
 to make some scales that have 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.540
 over here we will continue to go down 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.950
 and we are going to make his dad here 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.920
 say it increase 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.740
 and let's go here to do let's put these 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.810
 two lines in this way each round 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.079
 because it is always used as a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.079
 skeleton 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.930
 let's go here with your arm we'll draw from 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.920
 this form 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.920
 we will do here 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.810
 your claws or your fingers 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.790
 and this character is a dinosaur 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.729
 so then I do not know well 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.170
 what would it be and here it is and we are going to do 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.170
 other small 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.630
 i 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.730
 some marks here let's draw your 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.760
 skeleton now here we're going to go over or 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:30.020
 less and we will go arm up here 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.569
 we close draw another arm and this one does not 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.190
 is going to see the fingers good since that is the 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.950
 hand back 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.000
 here we will continue drawing 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.000
 thus 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.370
 down here and let's start to follow 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.890
 your feet then first I'm going to start 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.380
 to do the foot in front 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.090
 the same as in the hand we will draw 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.090
 like three claws that you have 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.580
 in this way and then we're going to go with 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.580
 with the back foot 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.350
 to this foot by the angle at which soon 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.830
 there is the image because here what 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.700
 what I see has 2 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.700
 22 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:28.300
 well here we are going to draw and the tail in 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:31.300
 our dinosaur or extinct animal 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.300
 point 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.510
 so for what more or less 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.880
 it's sad is the younger brother of 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.880
 godzilla 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.930
 and let's play 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.280
 his look 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.280
 quite particular 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.439
 then let's do this 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.439
 with about 5 times 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.730
 you already with the neck 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.800
 and then here in the tail we are going to draw it 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.660
 show 2 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.970
 it is something very characteristic of our 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.040
 character 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:16.469
 we take again 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.469
 it's like a matica or something like that 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.039
 here we are going to continue drawing some 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.039
 sores 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.290
 and already here what I'm missing 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.290
 miss you get here 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.740
 so I see we're going to do others for 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.740
 here 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.680
 oh I forgot something characteristic time 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.710
 have teeth as the sponge 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.190
 let's draw two this way 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.460
 and here we have our lord gus 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.150
 good friends also came back here that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.280
 he is marked this part of the skeleton 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.910
 then here we are going to do in this 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.780
 shape 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.690
 and here now 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.160
 let's continue 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.670
 I do not read more details to our 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.250
 character to our lord gus friends 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.990
