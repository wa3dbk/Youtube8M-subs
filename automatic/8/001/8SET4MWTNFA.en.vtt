you you you and are you and stuff like
that<00:01:09.210> arm<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:11.130> course<00:01:12.260> showdown<00:01:13.260> because<00:01:13.680> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
that arm on of course showdown because I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
that arm on of course showdown because I
show<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.240> Wi-Fi<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.229> I

can run mixed and then i have uber 'he's
um<00:01:40.579> so<00:01:41.579> yeah<00:01:41.759> i<00:01:41.939> also<00:01:42.119> need<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.450> work<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
um so yeah i also need to work that out

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.359 
um so yeah i also need to work that out
because<00:01:43.200> i<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.649> lot<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.890> people<00:01:43.979> don't

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
because i know a lot of people don't

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.889 
because i know a lot of people don't
necessarily<00:01:44.520> like<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> random<00:01:45.450> battles<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
necessarily like the random battles I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.899 
necessarily like the random battles I
think<00:01:46.409> they're<00:01:46.590> fun<00:01:46.860> because<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.250> just<00:01:47.520> start

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
think they're fun because you just start

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.460 
think they're fun because you just start
off<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.299> pokemon<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.409> even

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
off with pokemon that you don't even

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.620 
off with pokemon that you don't even
know<00:01:49.710> what<00:01:49.829> you're<00:01:49.979> getting<00:01:50.280> random<00:01:51.090> levels

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
know what you're getting random levels

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.600 
know what you're getting random levels
random<00:01:52.049> move<00:01:52.259> stuff<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.310> it's

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
random move stuff like that and it's

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.600 
random move stuff like that and it's
like<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:55.049> based<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:56.040> team<00:01:56.340> building

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
like you know not based on team building

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.490 
like you know not based on team building
all<00:01:56.790> it's<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.509> based<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:57.930> pure<00:01:58.229> skill

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
all it's really just based on pure skill

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.179 
all it's really just based on pure skill
so<00:01:58.860> um<00:02:00.590> depending<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.710> how<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:02.009> your

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
so um depending on how good your

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.770 
so um depending on how good your
opponent<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.880> anyways<00:02:03.689> um<00:02:04.399> yeah<00:02:05.780> basically

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
opponent is so anyways um yeah basically

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.260 
opponent is so anyways um yeah basically

up doing is he goes for an earthquake

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.280 
up doing is he goes for an earthquake
and<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:20.240> would've<00:02:20.570> been<00:02:20.630> able<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.930> take<00:02:21.110> you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
know more of these moves except he gets

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.970 
know more of these moves except he gets
a<00:02:22.970> crit<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.420> then<00:02:23.990> his<00:02:24.200> iron<00:02:24.440> head<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.920> i'm

a crit and then his iron head and i'm
pretty<00:02:25.130> sure<00:02:25.370> i<00:02:25.400> could<00:02:25.580> have<00:02:25.670> taken<00:02:25.790> iron<00:02:26.150> head

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
pretty sure i could have taken iron head

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.820 
pretty sure i could have taken iron head
and<00:02:26.480> in<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.600> earthquake<00:02:26.840> if<00:02:27.230> he<00:02:27.440> didn't<00:02:27.710> get<00:02:27.770> a

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
and in the earthquake if he didn't get a

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.170 
and in the earthquake if he didn't get a
crit<00:02:28.180> whatever<00:02:29.800> but<00:02:30.800> yeah<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:31.910> and

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
like the first two pieces of hacks and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.640 
like the first two pieces of hacks and
the<00:02:33.980> battle<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.430> ridiculous<00:02:34.610> um<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:36.560> I

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650

the<00:02:38.900> song<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.230> thought<00:02:39.380> it'd<00:02:39.560> do<00:02:39.680> more<00:02:39.940> okay<00:02:40.940> but

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
the song I thought it'd do more okay but

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.940 
the song I thought it'd do more okay but
getting<00:02:41.420> back<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.570> like<00:02:41.840> some<00:02:42.470> other<00:02:42.620> stuff<00:02:42.830> I

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
like on the East Coast I guess they

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:55.640 
like on the East Coast I guess they
start<00:05:54.210> late<00:05:54.360> like<00:05:54.660> they<00:05:54.840> startled<00:05:55.229> September

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650

December's great month but I'm talking

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.620 
December's great month but I'm talking
about<00:06:14.340> like<00:06:14.580> July<00:06:14.850> when<00:06:15.030> a<00:06:15.090> lot<00:06:15.240> of<00:06:15.270> people<00:06:15.390> are

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:15.630 
about like July when a lot of people are

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.300 
about like July when a lot of people are
