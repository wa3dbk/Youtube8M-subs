 in the demo available to you 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.510
 all consoles 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.490
 unfortunately the playstation came with 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.350
 one day and delayed not for 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.600
 blame ema well sony fault 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.150
 those guys see the teams that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 we can use in the demo are 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.790
 very interesting teams teams of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.860
 very high level but me guys there 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.329
 I recommend the lieb viali gun team 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.479
 barker the flaneur league because in 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.579
 ibra attack and put that are the two 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.240
 strongest attackers available in the 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.159
 demo 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.939
 Meanwhile, guys, we look at the new one 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.159
 team management on fifa 15 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.819
 version really copied from why 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.829
 that is, however, admit it to me this 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:27.810
 management really drives me crazy 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:30.210
 a mess guys 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.549
 you can see very well that i am well 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.990
 demo still five stars skill because i 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.990
 players haven't been yet 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.679
 all updated, in fact, put again 94 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.210
 of Euro 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.429
 then the first and first boys 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.270
 impressions I had in the demo of 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.219
 fifa 15 then to me this demo is me 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.560
 loved a casino you guys got me 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.869
 very much enjoyed playing for the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 innovations introduced for improvements 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.139
 that have been made both at the level of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.310
 goalkeepers both at the graphics level 

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:00.959
 goalkeepers because I say neighborhoods in many 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.490
 complained that i 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.039
 goalkeepers made some shit 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.969
 we say but I have not seen all these 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.799
 great authors 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.170
 I have only seen great rescues 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.480
 by the goalkeepers boys because a 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.260
 me because they repaired everything and even i 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.390
 shoots from research to come back together 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.340
 up close there is no kind of 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
 problem then i do n't know why some yes 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.079
 complained of the doormen 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.390
 then guys , let's start with the novelty 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.099
 which is the field the field deteriorates 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.930
 how do you make a slip and take one 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.090
 clod on the ground created but you can have one 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.940
 clod and find the hole on the ground in the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.650
 camp is something extraordinary 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.480
 guys something never seen before has 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 never thought of previous years 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 meanwhile here we see the goal super goal of 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.019
 ibra and the new substance that one there 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.629
 do you going towards the flag e 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.359
 pressing l 1x kicking the 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.099
 flag but something extraordinary 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.560
 guys to me any room I think that 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.239
 the consumer or at most this year 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.560
 beautiful result 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.650
 Meanwhile, here we see the Eurogol of 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.690
 neymar I always played against the 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.099
 computers are not difficulties because they do not 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.079
 I did not even have to choose 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.049
 changed 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.659
 so guys what is very important about 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.609
 so the physique will be the force 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.280
 physical we say the physical will be 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.290
 fundamental on which it is in fact 15 is 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.900
 the statistic on was also replaced 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.849
 fruit instead of the header 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.379
 physical that I think will be 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.449
 very important this year is determined 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.489
 in part also the value the price of 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.590
 however players will not be essential 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.109
 guys because at least in this demo I have 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.269
 seen a clear difference with respect to 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.340
 fruit 13 on speed 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.650
 in what sense and why speed 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.260
 both boys and a player is fast 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.870
 the forest is needed in the open field 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.910
 defender can also have 95 of physique 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.949
 but don't take it guys don't take it 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.099
 at least he doesn't tug on him 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:54.090
 the shirt and do it and that case 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.829
 so speed matters a lot though 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.169
 in the one against one if the goes on him 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.180
 physical matters more than speed what 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.799
 which for me is absolutely right with the previous one 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.470
 corner kick we saw how it was 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.699
 can also command the player who is 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:08.290
 in the middle of the penalty 

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:10.540
 besides that now he will have to beat then 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.329
 guys have also introduced a mess 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.010
 of animations in addition to the 50 animations 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.329
 for the goalkeepers and meanwhile we see more 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.190
 what I said before as the 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.500
 speed in open field is more 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.240
 important compared to thread 14 I said 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.039
 in addition to the 50 animations he introduced 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.580
 for the doormen there are three in all 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.349
 animations also for players or 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.210
 animations on the jerk of the 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.760
 knit in what sense guys if a 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.830
 striker leaves and you want to square 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.719
 to tug it it will no longer be like him 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.000
 past years that the jerk will be 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:42.250
 invisible you will see just the shirt 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.529
 of the player who gets longer because you 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.389
 you pull it with your hand and this guys is 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:48.279
 an extraordinary animation unfortunately 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.570
 I don't have the clip of this animation though 

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:52.180
 I guarantee you something 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:55.120
 amazing and then the goalkeepers guys 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.820
 make unrealistic parades but of 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.610
 plus something wow an eye hit 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.710
 not indifferent guys though one thing 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.830
 which I regret is that these things 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.200
 are only on next gen to the poor 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.080
 that have gene currently cannot 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.570
 buy it the next dian must stay 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.789
 with a game you improved but nothing a 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.360
 do with the product next gen 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.150
 is 10 20 30 spans above ie nothing a 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.860
 than to see just another planet 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.370
 for me this guys is the first real one 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.930
 fifa made for programmed next gen 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.610
 entirely for next gen 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.159
 because the previous fifa was a 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.469
 porting therefore the boys of themes in the 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:37.150
 comments what do you think about this 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.190
 demo that was released by sports 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.229
 left a nice like below if you want 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.150
