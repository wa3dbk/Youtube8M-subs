okay this video is a continuation on my

okay this video is a continuation on my
landing<00:00:03.060> video<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.870> video<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.230> gonna<00:00:04.350> go

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
landing video this video is gonna go

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.769 
landing video this video is gonna go
over<00:00:04.799> basically<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.609> little<00:00:06.240> bit<00:00:06.359> more<00:00:06.569> in

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
over basically a little bit more in

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.740 
over basically a little bit more in
depth<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.259> landings<00:00:07.919> now<00:00:08.580> landings<00:00:09.240> with<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
depth on landings now landings with the

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.720 
depth on landings now landings with the
trainer<00:00:10.050> are<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> lot<00:00:10.769> different<00:00:10.800> than<00:00:11.340> landing

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
trainer are a lot different than landing

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.509 
trainer are a lot different than landing
something<00:00:12.150> like<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.480> p-47<00:00:13.469> when<00:00:14.340> you're

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
something like this p-47 when you're

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.720 
something like this p-47 when you're
landing<00:00:15.089> an<00:00:15.240> airplane<00:00:15.560> that<00:00:16.560> flies<00:00:16.890> good<00:00:17.340> it's

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
landing an airplane that flies good it's

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.310 
landing an airplane that flies good it's
the<00:00:17.910> same<00:00:18.150> as<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> trainer<00:00:18.720> something<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.289> a

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
the same as a trainer something like a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.859 
the same as a trainer something like a
light<00:00:19.590> weight<00:00:19.800> extra<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.699> an<00:00:20.910> edge<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> yak

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
light weight extra or an edge or a yak

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.590 
light weight extra or an edge or a yak
something<00:00:22.410> like<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:23.220> fly<00:00:23.519> well<00:00:23.880> you

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
something like that they fly well you

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.939 
something like that they fly well you
know<00:00:24.720> they're<00:00:24.900> light<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.380> they<00:00:25.590> come<00:00:25.920> down

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
know they're light and they come down

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.640 
know they're light and they come down
easily<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.910> glide<00:00:27.539> them<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.840> long<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:28.349> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
easily you can glide them a long way and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.560 
easily you can glide them a long way and
they're<00:00:28.980> pretty<00:00:29.189> forgiving<00:00:29.730> when<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.330> fly

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
they're pretty forgiving when you fly

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.280 
they're pretty forgiving when you fly
something<00:00:31.050> like<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> p-47<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.579> dc-3<00:00:33.059> any<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
something like a p-47 a dc-3 any of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.650 
something like a p-47 a dc-3 any of
these<00:00:34.440> scale<00:00:34.920> airplanes<00:00:35.550> oftentimes<00:00:36.210> scale

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
these scale airplanes oftentimes scale

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.869 
these scale airplanes oftentimes scale
means<00:00:36.989> pretty<00:00:37.380> heavy<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> you'll<00:00:38.460> find<00:00:38.760> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
means pretty heavy and you'll find that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
means pretty heavy and you'll find that
the<00:00:39.059> airplanes<00:00:39.510> are<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.690> lot<00:00:39.930> trickier<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.649> land

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the airplanes are a lot trickier to land

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
the airplanes are a lot trickier to land
simply<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:41.820> I'll<00:00:42.420> demonstrate<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:43.140> if

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
simply because I'll demonstrate here if

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
simply because I'll demonstrate here if
I<00:00:43.410> cut<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> power<00:00:43.950> back<00:00:44.309> they<00:00:44.760> sink<00:00:45.180> like<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
I cut the power back they sink like a

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
I cut the power back they sink like a
stone<00:00:45.570> they<00:00:46.289> really<00:00:47.100> fall<00:00:47.610> quickly<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
stone they really fall quickly you see I

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.970 
stone they really fall quickly you see I
had<00:00:48.539> elevator<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.379> still<00:00:49.620> descending

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
had elevator and it's still descending

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.610 
had elevator and it's still descending
so<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:52.020> careful<00:00:52.260> when

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so you have to be really careful when

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.900 
so you have to be really careful when
you<00:00:52.739> land<00:00:52.980> these<00:00:53.160> things<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.730> they're

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you land these things because they're

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.060 
you land these things because they're
heavy<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:54.629> gonna<00:00:54.750> stall<00:00:55.140> easily<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
heavy they're gonna stall easily on you

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
heavy they're gonna stall easily on you
and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.149> think<00:00:57.270> ahead<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and you have to really think ahead and

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.770 
and you have to really think ahead and
manage<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.920> power<00:00:59.160> wisely<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.420> you're

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
manage your power wisely so you're

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.360 
manage your power wisely so you're
flying<00:01:00.960> around<00:01:01.410> with<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> warbird<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
flying around with a warbird and it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.789 
flying around with a warbird and it's
time<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.730> come<00:01:02.910> land<00:01:03.210> ok<00:01:03.840> first<00:01:04.439> thing<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
time to come land ok first thing you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.530 
time to come land ok first thing you
want<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.820> power<00:01:06.060> back<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
want to do is get your power back to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.480 
want to do is get your power back to
about<00:01:06.720> half<00:01:06.930> throttle<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:07.590> take<00:01:07.979> away<00:01:08.130> some

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
about half throttle let's take away some

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.219 
about half throttle let's take away some
airspeed<00:01:09.030> but<00:01:09.420> still<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.840> plenty<00:01:10.110> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
airspeed but still have plenty of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
airspeed but still have plenty of
airspeed<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.280> fly<00:01:11.520> around<00:01:11.850> with

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
airspeed that you can fly around with

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.750 
airspeed that you can fly around with
but<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.200> silly<00:01:13.560> fast<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.549> next

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
but not you know silly fast the next

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.490 
but not you know silly fast the next
thing<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> roll<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.049> about<00:01:16.259> half

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
thing I like to do is roll in about half

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.920 
thing I like to do is roll in about half
flaps<00:01:16.920> flaps<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.909> gonna<00:01:18.000> help<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.390> land<00:01:18.659> give

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
flaps flaps are gonna help you land give

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.640 
flaps flaps are gonna help you land give
you<00:01:19.049> some<00:01:19.229> lift

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you some lift

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.130 
you some lift
I<00:01:19.740> wouldn't<00:01:20.490> recommend<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:21.090> most<00:01:21.390> models<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
I wouldn't recommend with most models to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.170 
I wouldn't recommend with most models to
do<00:01:22.259> full<00:01:22.530> flaps<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.100> find<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> full<00:01:23.670> flaps<00:01:23.939> can

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
do full flaps I find that full flaps can

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.030 
do full flaps I find that full flaps can
slow<00:01:24.450> them<00:01:24.659> down<00:01:24.689> too<00:01:25.049> much<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> make<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
slow them down too much and make the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.060 
slow them down too much and make the
stalls<00:01:26.310> pretty<00:01:26.640> violent<00:01:27.270> half<00:01:28.049> flaps<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.740> most

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
stalls pretty violent half flaps on most

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.890 
stalls pretty violent half flaps on most
models<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.670> more<00:01:30.000> than<00:01:30.210> enough<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
models is more than enough to get it

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.770 
models is more than enough to get it
down<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.259> another<00:01:31.560> field<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> small<00:01:33.299> field<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
down in another field in a small field a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.080 
down in another field in a small field a
big<00:01:33.960> field<00:01:34.229> half<00:01:35.040> collapse<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.610> fine<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.030> I'm

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
big field half collapse is fine so I'm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.090 
big field half collapse is fine so I'm
still<00:01:36.329> flying<00:01:36.630> around<00:01:36.869> with<00:01:37.140> plenty<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.860> power

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
still flying around with plenty of power

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.399 
still flying around with plenty of power
to<00:01:38.310> keep<00:01:38.460> flying<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.659> finally<00:01:40.200> last

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
to keep flying and then finally last

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.450 
to keep flying and then finally last
thing<00:01:40.650> you're<00:01:40.740> gonna<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.130> do<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.310> put

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
thing you're gonna want to do is put

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.700 
thing you're gonna want to do is put
that<00:01:41.610> landing<00:01:42.060> gear<00:01:42.090> down<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.320> we're<00:01:43.590> all

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that landing gear down so now we're all

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.130 
that landing gear down so now we're all
set<00:01:43.979> up<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> land<00:01:44.549> when<00:01:45.060> you're<00:01:45.210> landing<00:01:45.479> don't

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
set up to land when you're landing don't

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.810 
set up to land when you're landing don't
screw<00:01:46.439> around<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.920> flaps<00:01:47.189> put<00:01:47.579> them<00:01:47.700> in

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
screw around with the flaps put them in

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.060 
screw around with the flaps put them in
a<00:01:47.909> certain<00:01:48.450> position<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.110> leave<00:01:49.649> them<00:01:49.920> there

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
a certain position and leave them there

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
a certain position and leave them there
if<00:01:50.670> you're<00:01:50.850> focusing<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.630> where's<00:01:51.869> my<00:01:51.960> flaps

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
if you're focusing on where's my flaps

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
if you're focusing on where's my flaps
should<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.649> while<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:52.890> landing<00:01:53.180> you're

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
should be while you're landing you're

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.429 
should be while you're landing you're
already<00:01:54.479> got<00:01:54.600> enough<00:01:54.840> stuff<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> think<00:01:55.320> about

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
already got enough stuff to think about

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.709 
already got enough stuff to think about
landing<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> warbird<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.640> worry<00:01:56.880> about<00:01:57.030> your

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
landing a warbird don't worry about your

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
landing a warbird don't worry about your
flaps<00:01:58.049> set<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.530> somewhere<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:58.920> leave<00:01:59.310> them

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
flaps set them somewhere and leave them

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.450 
flaps set them somewhere and leave them
now<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.780> main<00:02:01.140> point<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.829> want<00:02:02.040> everyone<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
now the main point I want everyone to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.459 
now the main point I want everyone to
take<00:02:02.549> away<00:02:02.939> from<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.540> power<00:02:04.049> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
take away from this is that power is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.219 
take away from this is that power is
what<00:02:04.710> controls<00:02:05.100> your<00:02:05.250> descent<00:02:05.729> rate<00:02:05.939> not<00:02:06.540> your

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
what controls your descent rate not your

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.240 
what controls your descent rate not your
elevator

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
elevator

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.190 
elevator
if<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.820> think<00:02:09.210> that<00:02:09.360> your<00:02:09.479> elevator<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.050> what

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
if you think that your elevator is what

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.750 
if you think that your elevator is what
controls<00:02:10.560> how<00:02:10.710> fast<00:02:10.740> you<00:02:11.190> go<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> down

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
controls how fast you go up and down

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.970 
controls how fast you go up and down
you're<00:02:12.360> gonna<00:02:12.540> probably<00:02:12.810> stuff<00:02:13.410> your

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
you're gonna probably stuff your

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.670 
you're gonna probably stuff your
airplane<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.640> I'll<00:02:14.880> show<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.150> why<00:02:15.570> if<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.440> keep

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
airplane and I'll show you why if I keep

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.010 
airplane and I'll show you why if I keep
my<00:02:16.830> power<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.280> half<00:02:17.430> I'm<00:02:17.640> gonna<00:02:17.760> hold<00:02:18.060> pretty

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
my power in half I'm gonna hold pretty

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.390 
my power in half I'm gonna hold pretty
good<00:02:19.230> elevator<00:02:19.710> here<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.160> I'm<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
good elevator here and I'm going to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.140 
good elevator here and I'm going to
reduce<00:02:20.550> my<00:02:20.730> power<00:02:21.150> now<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.670> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
reduce my power now you can see that the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.990 
reduce my power now you can see that the
airplane<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.750> descending<00:02:25.440> at<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:26.310> nice<00:02:26.640> rate

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
airplane is descending at a nice rate

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.610 
airplane is descending at a nice rate
for<00:02:27.270> landing<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.230> not<00:02:28.380> really

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
for landing but it's not really

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.110 
for landing but it's not really
descending<00:02:29.040> all<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:29.280> much<00:02:29.460> if<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:29.790> back<00:02:29.940> my

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
descending all that much if I'm back my

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.700 
descending all that much if I'm back my
power<00:02:30.360> off<00:02:30.510> more<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:30.840> descends<00:02:31.230> more<00:02:31.440> if<00:02:31.590> I

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
power off more it descends more if I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.500 
power off more it descends more if I
increase<00:02:32.100> power<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:32.700> doesn't<00:02:32.880> descend<00:02:33.330> as

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
increase power it doesn't descend as

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.660 
increase power it doesn't descend as
much<00:02:33.690> I'm<00:02:34.110> not<00:02:34.320> controlling<00:02:34.740> my<00:02:35.010> elevator<00:02:35.490> at

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
much I'm not controlling my elevator at

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.490 
much I'm not controlling my elevator at
all<00:02:35.820> here<00:02:36.060> all<00:02:36.090> I'm<00:02:36.390> doing<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.810> managing<00:02:37.080> my

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
all here all I'm doing is managing my

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.440 
all here all I'm doing is managing my
power<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.610> can<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.270> how<00:02:39.420> I

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
power and you can see this is how I

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.330 
power and you can see this is how I
would<00:02:39.570> control<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.110> descent<00:02:40.620> rate<00:02:40.830> down<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
would control a descent rate down to the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.000 
would control a descent rate down to the
ground<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.600> when<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.900> are<00:02:43.110> landing<00:02:43.650> don't

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
ground so when you are landing don't

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.920 
ground so when you are landing don't
just<00:02:44.310> wait<00:02:44.820> like<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.180> would<00:02:45.360> do<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.750> with

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
just wait like you would do more with

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.960 
just wait like you would do more with
the<00:02:46.050> trainer<00:02:46.320> come<00:02:47.130> up<00:02:47.250> high<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.459> know<00:02:47.700> chop

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the trainer come up high you know chop

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.640 
the trainer come up high you know chop
your<00:02:48.180> power<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.690> push<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:49.020> nose<00:02:49.170> down<00:02:49.230> and

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
your power and push the nose down and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.620 
your power and push the nose down and
then<00:02:49.740> try<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:49.950> flare<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.400> you'll<00:02:50.730> see<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.300> if

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
then try to flare it you'll see here if

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.449 
then try to flare it you'll see here if
you<00:02:51.750> get<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:52.020> warbird<00:02:52.770> flying<00:02:53.100> too<00:02:53.250> slow<00:02:53.430> on

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
you get a warbird flying too slow on

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.850 
you get a warbird flying too slow on
full<00:02:53.820> up<00:02:53.970> elevator<00:02:54.240> right<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.590> comes

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
full up elevator right now and it comes

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.730 
full up elevator right now and it comes
down<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.430> hard<00:02:56.570> it's<00:02:57.570> not<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.810> scale<00:02:58.350> way<00:02:58.590> of

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
down really hard it's not a scale way of

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.710 
down really hard it's not a scale way of
landing<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.640> really<00:02:59.940> want<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.209> hold<00:03:00.360> about<00:03:00.570> a

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
landing you really want to hold about a

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.810 
landing you really want to hold about a
third<00:03:01.080> elevator<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.830> whole<00:03:02.070> way<00:03:02.310> down<00:03:02.550> and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
third elevator the whole way down and

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.760 
third elevator the whole way down and
use<00:03:03.150> your<00:03:03.360> power<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.810> control<00:03:04.350> when<00:03:04.620> it's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
use your power to control when it's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.850 
use your power to control when it's
gonna<00:03:04.950> come<00:03:05.220> down<00:03:05.250> so<00:03:06.209> get<00:03:07.110> lined<00:03:07.380> up<00:03:07.590> for<00:03:07.740> your

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
gonna come down so get lined up for your

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.640 
gonna come down so get lined up for your
approach<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:09.240> know<00:03:09.390> Welbeck<00:03:10.080> your<00:03:10.380> first

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
approach you know Welbeck your first

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.440 
approach you know Welbeck your first
time<00:03:10.890> till<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.459> get<00:03:11.700> comfortable<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.209> it

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
time till you get comfortable with it

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.600 
time till you get comfortable with it
back<00:03:13.080> your<00:03:13.290> power<00:03:13.470> off<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.890> start<00:03:14.160> feeding<00:03:14.370> in

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
back your power off and start feeding in

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.479 
back your power off and start feeding in
some<00:03:14.790> elevator<00:03:15.239> now<00:03:15.959> start<00:03:16.680> backing<00:03:16.950> off<00:03:17.220> your

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
some elevator now start backing off your

some elevator now start backing off your
power<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.290> adjusting<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.590> power<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.220> fly

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
power and adjusting that power to fly

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.280 
power and adjusting that power to fly
the<00:03:20.730> airplane<00:03:21.030> down<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.720> ground<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.200> then

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
the airplane down to the ground and then

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.100 
the airplane down to the ground and then
right<00:03:22.800> before<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.340> ground<00:03:23.750> flare<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.930> and

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
right before the ground flare it and

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.380 
right before the ground flare it and
pull<00:03:25.830> your<00:03:25.950> power<00:03:26.190> back<00:03:26.459> all<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.820> way<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:26.970> set

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
pull your power back all the way and set

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.240 
pull your power back all the way and set
it<00:03:27.510> down<00:03:27.540> in<00:03:27.870> front<00:03:28.050> of<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.560> this<00:03:29.070> is

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
it down in front of you and this is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.890 
it down in front of you and this is
gonna<00:03:29.400> make<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.970> those<00:03:30.150> nice<00:03:30.390> scale

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
gonna make you have those nice scale

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.840 
gonna make you have those nice scale
landings<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.739> can<00:03:31.890> really<00:03:32.190> drag<00:03:32.580> them

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
landings and you can really drag them

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.400 
landings and you can really drag them
out<00:03:32.940> especially<00:03:33.120> if<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.720> land<00:03:33.959> with<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.170> high

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
out especially if you land with a high

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.500 
out especially if you land with a high
idle<00:03:34.800> and<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.489> long<00:03:35.790> field<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.330> can

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
idle and you have a long field you can

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.650 
idle and you have a long field you can
really<00:03:36.959> make<00:03:37.110> a<00:03:37.170> landing<00:03:38.100> look<00:03:38.549> scale<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.600> I'll

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
really make a landing look scale so I'll

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.140 
really make a landing look scale so I'll
show<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.870> one<00:03:40.200> more<00:03:40.230> time<00:03:40.820> with<00:03:41.820> these

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
show you one more time with these

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.479 
show you one more time with these
landings<00:03:42.690> you're<00:03:42.840> gonna<00:03:42.959> want<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.350> go<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.830> fly

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
landings you're gonna want to go and fly

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.750 
landings you're gonna want to go and fly
around<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.239> get<00:03:46.140> up<00:03:46.290> high<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.830> practice<00:03:47.549> this

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
around and get up high and practice this

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.300 
around and get up high and practice this
from<00:03:48.030> far<00:03:48.330> away<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.440> we're<00:03:49.860> gonna<00:03:49.980> get

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
from far away so we're gonna get

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.750 
from far away so we're gonna get
ourselves<00:03:50.459> set<00:03:50.910> up<00:03:51.030> here<00:03:51.769> fly<00:03:52.769> our<00:03:52.950> turn<00:03:53.220> we're

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
ourselves set up here fly our turn we're

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.340 
ourselves set up here fly our turn we're
gonna<00:03:53.880> throttle<00:03:54.360> back<00:03:54.540> not<00:03:54.900> all<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.200> way

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
gonna throttle back not all the way

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.430 
gonna throttle back not all the way
about<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.280> third<00:03:56.760> throttle<00:03:57.299> maybe<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.959> bit<00:03:58.230> more

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
about a third throttle maybe a bit more

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.009 
about a third throttle maybe a bit more
and<00:03:58.980> then<00:03:59.010> start<00:03:59.910> controlling<00:04:00.450> our<00:04:00.600> descent

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
and then start controlling our descent

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.770 
and then start controlling our descent
rate<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.739> I've<00:04:01.890> got<00:04:02.100> in<00:04:02.250> some<00:04:02.459> up<00:04:02.580> elevator<00:04:02.880> I'm

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
rate so I've got in some up elevator I'm

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.110 
rate so I've got in some up elevator I'm
pretty<00:04:04.170> far<00:04:04.470> away<00:04:04.620> but<00:04:05.430> I'm<00:04:05.549> starting<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:05.880> back

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
pretty far away but I'm starting to back

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.789 
pretty far away but I'm starting to back
off<00:04:06.390> now<00:04:06.660> it's<00:04:06.900> starting<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.230> descend<00:04:07.650> a

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
off now it's starting to descend a

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.949 
off now it's starting to descend a
little<00:04:08.040> power<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.459> slow<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.850> down<00:04:08.880> back<00:04:09.660> off

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
little power to slow it down back off

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.470 
little power to slow it down back off
little<00:04:10.320> more<00:04:10.470> power<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:11.130> then<00:04:11.670> right<00:04:12.180> when<00:04:12.450> I

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
little more power and then right when I

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.400 
little more power and then right when I
need<00:04:12.720> it<00:04:12.870> to<00:04:13.019> flare<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.890> hold

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
need it to flare and hold

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.199 
need it to flare and hold
power<00:04:14.590> back<00:04:14.830> all<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.190> way<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:15.610> that's<00:04:16.030> how

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
power back all the way and that's how

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.699 
power back all the way and that's how
you<00:04:16.330> really<00:04:16.720> need<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:17.080> land<00:04:17.260> these<00:04:17.500> big

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
you really need to land these big

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.360 
you really need to land these big
warbirds<00:04:18.220> now<00:04:18.760> one<00:04:19.540> thing<00:04:19.989> final<00:04:20.769> thought<00:04:21.070> if

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
warbirds now one thing final thought if

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.600 
warbirds now one thing final thought if
you're<00:04:21.580> landing<00:04:21.880> on<00:04:22.120> a<00:04:22.180> grass<00:04:22.360> field<00:04:23.610> for

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
you're landing on a grass field for

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.400 
you're landing on a grass field for
example<00:04:25.000> if<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.150> land<00:04:25.390> out<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.600> this<00:04:25.840> side<00:04:26.080> here

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
example if I land out in this side here

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.280 
example if I land out in this side here
these<00:04:26.830> retracts<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.670> this<00:04:27.820> p-47<00:04:28.600> go<00:04:28.780> inwards

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
these retracts on this p-47 go inwards

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.260 
these retracts on this p-47 go inwards
you<00:04:29.530> can<00:04:29.770> see<00:04:29.980> how<00:04:30.160> they<00:04:30.310> when<00:04:30.520> they<00:04:30.670> go<00:04:30.940> in<00:04:31.120> and

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
you can see how they when they go in and

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.000 
you can see how they when they go in and
out<00:04:31.360> they<00:04:31.600> go<00:04:31.630> inwards<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.380> this<00:04:32.860> is

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
out they go inwards and this is

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.110 
out they go inwards and this is
something<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.460> think<00:04:33.490> about<00:04:33.730> when<00:04:34.000> you're

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
something to think about when you're

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.910 
something to think about when you're
landing<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.630> grass<00:04:34.870> field<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.560> I'll<00:04:35.710> show

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
landing on a grass field and I'll show

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.420 
landing on a grass field and I'll show
you<00:04:35.980> why<00:04:36.280> if<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:37.300> fly<00:04:37.690> your<00:04:38.440> landings<00:04:39.040> into<00:04:39.400> a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
you why if you fly your landings into a

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.860 
you why if you fly your landings into a
grass<00:04:39.700> field<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.210> need<00:04:40.390> to<00:04:40.510> keep<00:04:40.660> them

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
grass field you need to keep them

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.780 
grass field you need to keep them
straight<00:04:41.200> all<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.470> way<00:04:41.740> until<00:04:42.100> you've<00:04:42.520> landed

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
straight all the way until you've landed

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.450 
straight all the way until you've landed
because<00:04:43.780> if<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.110> land<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.860> grass<00:04:45.100> field

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
because if you land in a grass field

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.820 
because if you land in a grass field
something<00:04:45.910> that's<00:04:46.180> bumpy<00:04:46.600> or<00:04:46.750> bumpy<00:04:47.410> tarmac

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
something that's bumpy or bumpy tarmac

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.760 
something that's bumpy or bumpy tarmac
even<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:49.420> get<00:04:49.600> your<00:04:49.780> airplane<00:04:49.930> down<00:04:50.410> and

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
even and you get your airplane down and

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.340 
even and you get your airplane down and
then<00:04:51.670> you<00:04:51.880> know<00:04:51.910> oh<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.330> got<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:52.810> get<00:04:52.870> it<00:04:52.990> stopped

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
then you know oh I got to get it stopped

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.130 
then you know oh I got to get it stopped
and<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:53.890> turn<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.430> now<00:04:55.060> those<00:04:55.420> wheels<00:04:55.900> are

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
and you turn it now those wheels are

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.860 
and you turn it now those wheels are
sliding<00:04:56.620> sideways<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.580> that's<00:04:58.240> gonna<00:04:58.510> push

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
sliding sideways and that's gonna push

you play with that power setting more

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.050

one position and just kind of let the

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.159
