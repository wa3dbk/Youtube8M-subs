00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
areas of destructible and stuff there's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.570 
areas of destructible and stuff there's
been<00:01:18.960> bridges<00:01:19.410> which<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.679> been<00:01:19.770> collapsing

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
been bridges which have been collapsing

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490 
been bridges which have been collapsing
in<00:01:20.789> little<00:01:20.970> bits<00:01:21.149> like<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.840> yeah<00:01:22.440> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
it's been the little thing so far like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.249 
it's been the little thing so far like
that<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.180> tiny<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.479> tweaks<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
that just a tiny little tweaks there's a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
that just a tiny little tweaks there's a
few<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.799> I'm<00:01:35.159> mechanics<00:01:35.640> they're<00:01:35.850> very

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
few little I'm mechanics they're very

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.240 
few little I'm mechanics they're very
cool<00:01:36.240> when<00:01:36.450> he<00:01:36.570> jumps<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.680> little<00:01:37.799> spin<00:01:38.130> as

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
cool when he jumps up as little spin as

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.590 
cool when he jumps up as little spin as
he<00:01:38.369> gets<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.790> that's<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.119> nice<00:01:39.240> doll<00:01:39.420> dynamic

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
he gets up that's a nice doll dynamic

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.420 
he gets up that's a nice doll dynamic
theme<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.770> that's<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
theme to it and that's a really the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.770 
theme to it and that's a really the
