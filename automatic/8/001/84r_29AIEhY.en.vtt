00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the 3v three it's funny because when i

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.470 
the 3v three it's funny because when i
first<00:00:14.009> joined<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.460> park<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.940> very<00:00:15.179> first

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
first joined the park the very first

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.840 
first joined the park the very first
time<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:16.080> thought<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:17.070> wet<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:17.609> only

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
time I thought it was wet that they only

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.779 
time I thought it was wet that they only
had<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.180> 5<00:00:18.570> 85<00:00:19.020> court<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.650> I<00:00:20.250> still<00:00:20.520> think

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
had one 5 85 court and I still think

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.090 
had one 5 85 court and I still think
they<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.000> add<00:00:21.180> another<00:00:21.449> 5v5<00:00:21.869> court<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:23.070> I

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
they can add another 5v5 court but I

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.830 
they can add another 5v5 court but I
thought<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.400> 3v<00:00:23.789> three<00:00:24.000> full<00:00:24.269> court<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.660> so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
thought the 3v three full court was so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.259 
thought the 3v three full court was so
stupid<00:00:25.140> until<00:00:26.039> I<00:00:26.070> actually<00:00:26.340> played<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.910> 3v

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
stupid until I actually played the 3v

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
to play 55 but that Court is too small

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.470

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
too much going on too many people

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.540 
too much going on too many people
reaching<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.230> too<00:00:40.649> many<00:00:40.890> people<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
reaching at you too many people in the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.970 
reaching at you too many people in the
way<00:00:41.760> because<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> space<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.840> bed<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.920> so

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
way because the space in this bed is so

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.920 
way because the space in this bed is so
that's<00:00:44.280> why<00:00:44.399> i<00:00:44.430> like<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.670> 3v<00:00:44.969> three<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that's why i like the 3v three it's a

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.930 
that's why i like the 3v three it's a
smaller<00:00:46.200> court<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.219> less<00:00:47.340> people<00:00:47.730> on

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
smaller court but it's less people on

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.700 
smaller court but it's less people on
this<00:00:48.149> court<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.930> that's<00:00:49.140> less<00:00:49.320> people

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
this court so that's less people

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.770 
this court so that's less people
reaching<00:00:49.890> at<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.399> less<00:00:50.910> people<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.449> your<00:00:51.600> way

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
reaching at you less people in your way

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.439 
reaching at you less people in your way
you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.289> actually<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> crossover<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:54.030> maybe

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you can actually do a crossover or maybe

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
you can actually do a crossover or maybe
a<00:00:54.570> couple<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.170> motion<00:00:55.500> moves<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.129> want

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
a couple I so motion moves if you want

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
a couple I so motion moves if you want
to<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> space<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.140> ish<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.379> perfect

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
to because the space and ish is perfect

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.979 
to because the space and ish is perfect
for<00:00:58.890> me<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.280> definitely<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.420> three<00:01:00.960> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
for me I definitely like the three of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.319 
for me I definitely like the three of
you<00:01:01.140> play<00:01:01.320> more<00:01:01.530> than<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.710> 5v5<00:01:02.160> but<00:01:02.940> at<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> same

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you play more than a 5v5 but at the same

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.000 
you play more than a 5v5 but at the same
time<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.840> look<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> extra<00:01:04.500> pass<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> my

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
time and look at this extra pass to my

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
time and look at this extra pass to my
boy<00:01:05.159> style<00:01:05.460> Styles<00:01:05.939> coming<00:01:06.000> running<00:01:06.299> kick<00:01:06.570> it

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
boy style Styles coming running kick it

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.600 
boy style Styles coming running kick it
back<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> ball<00:01:07.409> movement<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
back out the ball movement I have to

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580 
back out the ball movement I have to
knock<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.939> down<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.510> few<00:01:09.960> people<00:01:10.229> want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> see

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
knock that down a few people want to see

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
knock that down a few people want to see
three<00:01:10.830> pointers<00:01:11.159> from<00:01:11.310> me<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.299> but

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
three pointers from me there you go but

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
three pointers from me there you go but
at<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> same<00:01:13.470> time<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> still<00:01:13.979> think<00:01:14.430> this<00:01:14.640> park

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
at the same time I still think this park

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.080 
at the same time I still think this park
mo<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.570> another<00:01:15.900> 5v5<00:01:16.350> court<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.159> think

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
mo can use another 5v5 court I think

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.520 
mo can use another 5v5 court I think
they<00:01:18.180> should<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.659> rid<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.049> true<00:01:19.229> v2

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
they should just get rid of the true v2

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.649 
they should just get rid of the true v2
to<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.770> honest<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.330> see<00:01:21.630> a

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
to be honest like I don't know I see a

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.910 
to be honest like I don't know I see a
lot<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.900> people<00:01:22.140> playing<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.590> haven't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
lot of people playing it I haven't

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
lot of people playing it I haven't
played<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.100> myself<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.759> maybe<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.210> fine

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
played that myself so maybe it's fine

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
played that myself so maybe it's fine
but<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.979> rid<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
but I think that you just get rid of the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.609 
but I think that you just get rid of the
to<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.759> too<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.990> how<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> 5v<00:01:28.500> five

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to be too and just how to 5v five
