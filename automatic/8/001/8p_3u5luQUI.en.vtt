00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.470 

a<00:00:10.250> great<00:00:11.250> piece<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.639> safety<00:00:11.820> equipment<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
a great piece of safety equipment and

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.789 
a great piece of safety equipment and
something<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.840> see<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> lot<00:00:13.320> more<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.530> on<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
something you see a lot more of on the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.609 
something you see a lot more of on the
mountain<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.370> an<00:00:14.610> airbag<00:00:15.059> rucksack<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:16.289> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
mountain is an airbag rucksack now the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.710 
mountain is an airbag rucksack now the
idea<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.310> I'm<00:00:17.550> skiing<00:00:17.820> down<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> slope<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.600> I

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
idea if I'm skiing down a slope and I

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.840 
idea if I'm skiing down a slope and I
feel<00:00:18.960> myself<00:00:19.109> being<00:00:19.470> taken<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.070> avalanche<00:00:20.490> I

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
feel myself being taken an avalanche I

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.450 
feel myself being taken an avalanche I
can<00:00:21.449> manually<00:00:22.020> pull<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.529> handle<00:00:22.920> here<00:00:23.340> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
can manually pull this handle here and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.140 
can manually pull this handle here and
that<00:00:23.970> will<00:00:24.060> inflate<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.750> large<00:00:25.230> bag<00:00:26.220> behind<00:00:26.910> me

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
that will inflate a large bag behind me

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.630 
that will inflate a large bag behind me
now<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> principle<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.039> keep<00:00:29.310> me<00:00:29.490> on<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
now the principle is to keep me on the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.240 
now the principle is to keep me on the
surface<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.420> avalanche<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.679> stop<00:00:32.070> me

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
surface of the avalanche to stop me

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.709 
surface of the avalanche to stop me
actually<00:00:32.520> being<00:00:32.700> pulled<00:00:32.969> underneath<00:00:33.450> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
actually being pulled underneath and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.990 
actually being pulled underneath and
buried<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.710> other<00:00:34.860> two<00:00:35.100> good<00:00:35.370> benefits<00:00:35.820> are

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
buried the other two good benefits are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.819 
buried the other two good benefits are
it<00:00:36.540> will<00:00:36.660> offer<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.960> small<00:00:37.410> amount<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it will offer a small amount of

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.760 
it will offer a small amount of
protection<00:00:37.980> for<00:00:38.910> my<00:00:39.059> neck<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.540> head<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.530> also

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
protection for my neck and head and also

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.010 
protection for my neck and head and also
make<00:00:41.070> me<00:00:41.190> much<00:00:41.340> more<00:00:41.550> visible<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.690> fact<00:00:42.870> if

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
make me much more visible so in fact if

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.450 
make me much more visible so in fact if
I<00:00:43.170> am<00:00:43.290> being<00:00:43.469> taken<00:00:43.860> down<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.129> avalanche

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
I am being taken down an avalanche

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
I am being taken down an avalanche
anybody<00:00:45.300> trying<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> spot<00:00:46.020> where<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.260> am<00:00:46.590> I'll

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
anybody trying to spot where I am I'll

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
anybody trying to spot where I am I'll
be<00:00:47.309> pretty<00:00:47.969> much<00:00:48.120> twice<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> size<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.140> would

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
be pretty much twice the size as I would

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.380 
be pretty much twice the size as I would
be<00:00:49.410> normally<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.070> few<00:00:50.789> things<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.120> make<00:00:51.270> this

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
be normally a few things that make this

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.970 
be normally a few things that make this
sort<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:51.719> rucksack<00:00:52.110> slightly<00:00:52.500> different<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
sort of rucksack slightly different to a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.979 
sort of rucksack slightly different to a
traditional<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.449> ways<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.840> it's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
traditional one the ways that it's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
traditional one the ways that it's
actually<00:00:55.260> held<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.680> my<00:00:55.800> body<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
actually held to my body so all of the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.290 
actually held to my body so all of the
clips<00:00:57.770> here<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.039> here<00:00:59.370> are<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.670> metal<00:01:00.059> not

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
clips here and here are in metal not

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.700 
clips here and here are in metal not
plastic<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:01.020> make<00:01:01.140> them<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.350> little<00:01:01.500> bit

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
plastic to make them a little bit

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.250 
plastic to make them a little bit
stronger<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.699> also<00:01:02.850> there's<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.660> strap<00:01:04.049> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
stronger and also there's a strap that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.630 
stronger and also there's a strap that
comes<00:01:04.439> from<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.799> back<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.220> rucksack

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
going on here so the air bag actually

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.590 
going on here so the air bag actually
sits<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> top<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.880> its<00:01:27.030> own<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.270> bag

canister<00:01:36.960> full<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> gases<00:01:38.570> pressured<00:01:39.570> so

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
canister full of the gases pressured so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.679 
canister full of the gases pressured so
when<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.229> pull<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.560> handle<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.329> the<00:01:42.329> gases

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
when I pull that handle all the gases

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.120 
when I pull that handle all the gases
from<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> canister<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.500> going<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> inflate

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
