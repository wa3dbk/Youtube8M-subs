00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
this is watching line at the submarines

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.310 
this is watching line at the submarines
to<00:00:08.189> do<00:00:08.340> here<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:08.880> Bushwick<00:00:09.210> Brooklyn<00:00:09.360> and

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
to do here in Bushwick Brooklyn and

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.209 
to do here in Bushwick Brooklyn and
today<00:00:10.920> we're<00:00:11.519> going<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.910> learn<00:00:12.300> how<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.960> eq<00:00:13.950> an

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
today we're going to learn how to eq an

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.150 
today we're going to learn how to eq an
electronic<00:00:15.179> snare<00:00:15.599> drum<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.619> today<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:17.010> using

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
electronic snare drum so today I'm using

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.820 
electronic snare drum so today I'm using
Logic<00:00:17.670> Pro<00:00:17.730> X<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.840> basically<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.320> click<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
Logic Pro X so basically I click on the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.189 
Logic Pro X so basically I click on the
channel<00:00:20.160> strip<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.789> snare<00:00:21.029> drum<00:00:21.300> down

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
channel strip of the snare drum down

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.080 
channel strip of the snare drum down
here<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> left<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:25.430> and<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.550> open<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:26.939> our

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
here to the left and and we open up our

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.519 
here to the left and and we open up our
parametric<00:00:27.720> EQ<00:00:28.609> which<00:00:29.609> comes<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.970> here

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
parametric EQ which comes up here

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.250 
parametric EQ which comes up here
basically<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.219> first<00:00:32.430> thing<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.790> should<00:00:32.820> do

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
basically the first thing you should do

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.440 
basically the first thing you should do
when<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.559> go<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.950> effect<00:00:35.430> any<00:00:35.670> track<00:00:36.030> one

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
when you go to effect any track one

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.959 
when you go to effect any track one
track<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:37.079> roll<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.800> bottom<00:00:38.129> end<00:00:38.309> because

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
track is roll off the bottom end because

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.840 
track is roll off the bottom end because
well<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.079> electronic<00:00:40.649> sounds<00:00:41.100> they're

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
well with electronic sounds they're

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.270 
well with electronic sounds they're
usually<00:00:42.000> pretty<00:00:42.300> clean<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.500> you'll<00:00:43.860> find

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
usually pretty clean but you'll find

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.049 
usually pretty clean but you'll find
it'll<00:00:45.149> help<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> mix<00:00:45.920> become<00:00:46.920> clearer<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.640> more

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
it'll help a mix become clearer and more

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
it'll help a mix become clearer and more
focused<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.930> roll<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.739> bottom<00:00:50.039> end<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
focused if you roll off bottom end of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.840 
focused if you roll off bottom end of
all<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.670> elements<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> basically<00:00:53.039> you'll

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
all the elements so basically you'll

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.290 
all the elements so basically you'll
play<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> snare<00:00:54.300> drum<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> you'll

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
play the snare drum and with a you'll

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
play the snare drum and with a you'll
put<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> sharp<00:01:00.840> slope<00:01:01.350> at<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> moment<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.039> 48

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
put a sharp slope at the moment it's 48

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.840 
put a sharp slope at the moment it's 48
DB<00:01:03.149> per<00:01:03.359> octave<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:04.379> you'll<00:01:05.189> run<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
DB per octave and you'll run the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.499 
DB per octave and you'll run the
high-pass<00:01:08.850> filter<00:01:09.360> until<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:11.189> start<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> hear

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:21.380 

the<00:01:15.509> snare<00:01:15.780> drum<00:01:16.049> become<00:01:16.350> effective<00:01:20.150> so<00:01:21.150> just

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the snare drum become effective so just

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
the snare drum become effective so just
there<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.409> hear<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> bottom<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.009> start

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
there you can hear the bottom and start

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.999 
there you can hear the bottom and start
rolling<00:01:23.460> off<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.799> basically<00:01:30.380> once<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.590> hear

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
rolling off so basically once you hear

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.240 
rolling off so basically once you hear
once<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> just<00:01:32.820> start<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.210> hear<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:36.420> changing

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
once you just start to hear it changing

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
once you just start to hear it changing
which<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.400> about<00:01:38.670> there<00:01:39.560> then<00:01:40.560> pull<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.829> back

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
which is about there then pull it back

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.539 
which is about there then pull it back
about<00:01:41.189> 15%<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.890> here<00:01:46.040> make<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> slope<00:01:47.430> a

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
about 15% so here make the slope a

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.280 
about 15% so here make the slope a
little<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.880> gentle<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> still<00:01:48.899> capture

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
little more gentle so I still capture

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.679 
little more gentle so I still capture
some<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> bottom<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> stuff<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:51.299> killing

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
some of the bottom and stuff not killing

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
some of the bottom and stuff not killing
the<00:01:51.780> sound<00:01:52.049> completely<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.820> low

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
the sound completely and that's your low

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300 
the sound completely and that's your low
cut<00:01:54.290> that's<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.439> first<00:01:55.710> thing<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.009> should<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
cut that's the first thing you should do

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.330 
cut that's the first thing you should do
okay<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.290> yeah<00:01:58.290> once<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> low<00:01:58.799> cut<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.130> done

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
okay so yeah once the low cut is done

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.609 
okay so yeah once the low cut is done
you<00:01:59.790> want<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> snare<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.570> pop<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> mix

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you want the snare to pop out in the mix

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.789 
you want the snare to pop out in the mix
a<00:02:01.829> little<00:02:02.040> harder<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.610> you'll<00:02:03.240> set<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.799> high

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
a little harder so you'll set this high

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.500 
a little harder so you'll set this high
band<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.250> here<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.579> 4k<00:02:08.989> 4000<00:02:09.989> haratz<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.640> then

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
band up here to 4k 4000 haratz and then

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.000 
band up here to 4k 4000 haratz and then
you<00:02:12.629> will<00:02:12.720> bump<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.050> up

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you will bump that up

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.890 
you will bump that up
until<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.790> starts<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.209> sound<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.840> little

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
until it starts to sound a little

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.170 
until it starts to sound a little
crisper<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:18.920> there<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.069> there<00:02:20.370> down<00:02:20.940> there

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
crisper and there it is there down there

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.960 
crisper and there it is there down there
it's<00:02:21.959> like<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.230> 5d<00:02:22.709> reversed<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:26.549> can<00:02:26.700> widen

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
it's like a 5d reversed you can widen

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.130 
it's like a 5d reversed you can widen
the<00:02:27.150> Cure<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:29.459> capture<00:02:29.879> some<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.450> other

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
the Cure to capture some of the other

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.190 
the Cure to capture some of the other
frequencies<00:02:31.650> either<00:02:31.950> side<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:33.690> fill<00:02:33.930> out<00:02:34.080> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
frequencies either side to fill out the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.809 
frequencies either side to fill out the
sound<00:02:34.379> if<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.620> feel<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.040> needs<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:37.819> once

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
sound if you feel it needs it so once

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.520 
sound if you feel it needs it so once
it's<00:02:39.000> got<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.269> shot<00:02:39.510> pop<00:02:39.780> then<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.140> go<00:02:40.290> down

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
it's got that shot pop then you go down

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.780 
it's got that shot pop then you go down
to<00:02:41.120> 200<00:02:42.379> which<00:02:43.379> is<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> low<00:02:43.799> band<00:02:44.069> frequency<00:02:46.790> and
