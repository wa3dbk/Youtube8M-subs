00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.450
 The Magdeburg Clinic is a clinic 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.430
 the maximum care and academic 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.000
 teaching hospital of the university hospital 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.720
 Magdeburg 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.650
 we have 735 beds and 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.960
 80 days inpatient and 16 medical 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.960
 Departments operational and conservative 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.610
 the role of the jenaer in such a big one 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:39.620
 central op is becoming increasingly important from 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.660
 various causes on the one hand is in the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.309
 Over the years, the number of patients is increasing 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.410
 increased considerably the everyday 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.930
 to be serviced those are to 50 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.570
 to 60 per day to another has the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.519
 number of patients increased the very 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.739
 Severe concomitant diseases have big ones 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.309
 get complex operations and to 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.379
 third 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.120
 the patient with multidrug- resistant germ 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.050
 from nursing homes meanwhile 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.339
 an agenda 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.470
 okay we sat down with 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.570
 the suppliers and also with ours 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.600
 materials management and mainly the 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.539
 care of anesthesia by location 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.840
 work out these processes for us 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.610
 avoiding infections of all real ones 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.869
 the basic idea was standardized 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.470
 processes for all employees too 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.970
 work out 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.460
 to dismiss in stereo faster ways 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.679
 to find devices to recycle naturally 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.600
 are also prepared so qualitatively that 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.280
 we have the hygienic rules in ours 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.110
 home match 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.060
 and another tip drives you 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.430
 standardized process for expansion 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.799
 anesthetic devices in which phase 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.030
 our employees like the devices 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.030
 have to prepare 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.350
 we have this in this frame 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.490
 Projectively step by step material 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.170
 can replace material by a way away 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.090
 on the one hand, for the benefit of the patient 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.440
 it is a hygienic purity for 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.560
 every patient there 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.080
 but also for the processes 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.330
 and processes of change from 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.330
 for example, reduce hoses 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.700
 the concept of the company drÃ¤ger has us 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.550
 helped a lot with it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.010
 professional competence and also superiority 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.540
 was shaped so that we quickly in the 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.540
 could also implement the area 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.420
 the project of anesthesia we also 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.180
 accompanied by the Jewish side 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.980
 Of course we think we have it 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.920
 euro environmental surveys 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.930
 made the very successful saying 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.209
 me and there it really makes sense 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.760
 from the work organization and from the 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.330
 Hygienic that you get a product there 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.330
 used 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.940
 the patient-related system change has 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.070
 brought great benefits after a year 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.390
 can do without additional rooms in the op 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.460
 for the treatment 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.230
 sterilization department no longer needs 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.880
 we can be supplied quickly 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.430
 safe and efficient our anesthesia 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.900
 upgrade your equipment 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.810
 in the past twelve months 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.329
 we have the experience that the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.750
 Use of the materials right true 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:30.890
 work inexpensively and are on the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.510
 hygienic safe side the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.819
 support and accompaniment of 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.609
 We have external suppliers in the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:39.170
 very happy to accept last years 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.480
 because we also have a different view 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.400
 have gotten to know things and that 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 also helped us processes here in 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.480
 to improve our area
