00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
treating this as a test and development

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859 
treating this as a test and development
year<00:01:07.140> i'm<00:01:07.850> signed<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.240> guys<00:01:09.420> now<00:01:09.659> for

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
racing with a car but we didn't do quite

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.380 
racing with a car but we didn't do quite
as<00:01:16.770> much<00:01:16.950> development<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.820> we've

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
as much development this time we've

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.070 
as much development this time we've
committed<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:20.040> race<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:21.479> see

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
committed to do this race will then see

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.950 
committed to do this race will then see
how<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.290> stand<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.920> then<00:01:23.040> we'll<00:01:23.189> go<00:01:23.340> away<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
how we stand and then we'll go away and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.149 
how we stand and then we'll go away and
do<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.140> development<00:01:25.560> work<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.009> come

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
do some development work and we come

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.300 
do some development work and we come
back<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> portimao<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.070> sort<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
back in portimao and see what sort of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.850 
back in portimao and see what sort of
progress<00:01:29.520> we've<00:01:29.880> made<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.299> then<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> say

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
progress we've made and then like I say

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.340 
progress we've made and then like I say
it's<00:01:32.070> really<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.820> build-up<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.350> 2013

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it's really about the build-up for 2013

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's really about the build-up for 2013
so<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.850> we're<00:01:35.970> trying<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.210> achieve

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
so that's what we're trying to achieve

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.030 
so that's what we're trying to achieve
but<00:01:37.049> it's<00:01:37.200> important<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.560> be<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
but it's important to be here and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.370 
but it's important to be here and
measure<00:01:38.159> ourselves<00:01:38.369> against<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> opposition

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
measure ourselves against the opposition

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.260 
measure ourselves against the opposition
testing<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.470> privates<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.189> thing<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.670> you

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
testing in privates one thing but you

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.819 
testing in privates one thing but you
need<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.630> exactly<00:01:42.780> where<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.320> stand<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
need to know exactly where you stand and

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.830 
need to know exactly where you stand and
as<00:01:44.700> difficult<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.540> carriers

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
as difficult to see because the carriers

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.899 
as difficult to see because the carriers
are<00:01:45.869> brand<00:01:46.470> new<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:46.920> what<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.790> your

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
are brand new but what are your

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.319 
are brand new but what are your
expectations<00:01:48.590> in<00:01:49.590> terms<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:50.329> resource

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
expectations in terms of resource

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.410 
expectations in terms of resource
performance<00:01:52.259> well<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.820> difficult<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.270> say

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
performance well it's difficult to say

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.910 
performance well it's difficult to say
you<00:01:54.570> know<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> don't<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.439> want<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> stick<00:01:55.890> my

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
you know I don't really want to stick my

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.109 
you know I don't really want to stick my
neck<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.490> an<00:01:56.549> achievement<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:57.000> itself

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
neck out it's an achievement in itself

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.020 
neck out it's an achievement in itself
to<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.869> which<00:01:58.500> person<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.100> most<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.640> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to be here which person for most and I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.640 
to be here which person for most and I
think<00:02:00.270> that

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
think that

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.310 
think that
let's<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.490> let's<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.330> how<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.600> weekend<00:02:04.080> pans

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
let's see let's see how the weekend pans

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
let's see let's see how the weekend pans
out<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:05.190> think<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.300> can<00:02:06.390> run<00:02:06.660> reliably

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
out I think that if we can run reliably

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.660 
out I think that if we can run reliably
all<00:02:07.260> weekend<00:02:07.650> and<00:02:07.710> we<00:02:07.830> can<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.280> basically

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
all weekend and we can just basically

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.730 
all weekend and we can just basically
step-by-step<00:02:09.600> improve<00:02:09.930> the<00:02:10.080> car<00:02:10.290> obviously

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
step-by-step improve the car obviously

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.290 
step-by-step improve the car obviously
how<00:02:11.160> we've<00:02:11.430> done<00:02:11.550> half<00:02:11.760> an<00:02:11.880> hour<00:02:12.030> running

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
how we've done half an hour running

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.240 
how we've done half an hour running
which<00:02:12.570> was<00:02:12.750> effectively<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:14.010> small

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
which was effectively a very small

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.520 
which was effectively a very small
shakedown<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.480> now<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.870> running<00:02:16.110> anger

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
shakedown and so now it's running anger

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.040 
shakedown and so now it's running anger
against<00:02:17.270> you<00:02:18.270> know<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.480> world<00:02:18.660> champion

down the pit lane is going to really see

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.820 
down the pit lane is going to really see
where<00:02:24.180> we<00:02:24.300> stand<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.050> i<00:02:25.470> don't<00:02:25.590> particularly

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
where we stand and i don't particularly

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.620 
where we stand and i don't particularly
on<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.100> stick<00:02:26.250> my<00:02:26.340> neck<00:02:26.400> out<00:02:26.670> on<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> line<00:02:27.150> so

on to stick my neck out on the line so

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.150 
on to stick my neck out on the line so
I've<00:02:27.690> been<00:02:27.810> bitten<00:02:28.020> before<00:02:28.170> by<00:02:28.530> doing<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:28.920> I

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
I've been bitten before by doing that I

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.240 
I've been bitten before by doing that I
think<00:02:29.490> I'm<00:02:30.180> quietly<00:02:30.540> optimistic<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.950> for

think I'm quietly optimistic but for

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.030 
think I'm quietly optimistic but for
sure<00:02:32.370> we've<00:02:33.240> got<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.390> lot<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.600> work<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.040> James
