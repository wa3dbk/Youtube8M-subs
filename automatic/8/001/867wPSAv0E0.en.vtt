have an Alfa Romeo dealership to buy
from<00:03:05.359> work<00:03:06.359> we're<00:03:07.319> going<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.470> be<00:03:07.590> let<00:03:08.069> me<00:03:08.310> deal

from work we're going to be let me deal

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.460 
from work we're going to be let me deal
with<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.879> most<00:03:09.060> contentious<00:03:09.510> part<00:03:10.139> of<00:03:10.319> what

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
with the most contentious part of what

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.259 
with the most contentious part of what
you<00:03:10.500> said<00:03:10.859> which<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.069> redesigned<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
you said which is redesigned of the

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.640 
you said which is redesigned of the
Wrangler<00:03:12.750> that's<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.079> term<00:03:13.349> that<00:03:13.379> I've

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
Wrangler that's a term that I've

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.170 
Wrangler that's a term that I've
forbidden<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:16.650> usage<00:03:17.250> inside<00:03:17.639> the<00:03:17.790> house<00:03:18.000> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
forbidden for usage inside the house I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.210 
forbidden for usage inside the house I
think<00:03:18.359> redesigned<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.530> Wrangler<00:03:19.889> is<00:03:19.920> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
think redesigned the Wrangler is the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.940 
think redesigned the Wrangler is the
riskiest<00:03:20.639> thing<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.150> could<00:03:21.299> do<00:03:21.680> so<00:03:22.680> if<00:03:22.829> you're

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
riskiest thing you could do so if you're

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.900 
riskiest thing you could do so if you're
talking<00:03:23.159> about<00:03:23.840> substantially<00:03:25.910> upgrading

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
talking about substantially upgrading

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.119 
talking about substantially upgrading
the<00:03:27.840> Wrangler<00:03:28.379> to<00:03:28.620> reflect<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.560> advancement

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
the Wrangler to reflect the advancement

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.470 
the Wrangler to reflect the advancement
in<00:03:32.190> technology<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.849> we've<00:03:32.970> had<00:03:33.090> since<00:03:33.150> it

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
in technology that we've had since it

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.629 
in technology that we've had since it
since<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.379> original<00:03:34.620> launch<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.250> answer<00:03:35.519> is

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
since the original launch the answer is

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.250 
since the original launch the answer is
yes<00:03:35.669> if<00:03:36.030> we<00:03:36.150> take<00:03:36.389> away<00:03:36.449> any<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.169> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
yes if we take away any of the

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.550 
yes if we take away any of the
capabilities<00:03:37.919> of<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:39.810> regular<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.319> think

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
capabilities of the regular I think

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.830 
capabilities of the regular I think
we'll<00:03:40.709> kill<00:03:40.949> their<00:03:41.129> product<00:03:41.549> we<00:03:42.480> got<00:03:42.629> to<00:03:42.750> be

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
we'll kill their product we got to be

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.030 
we'll kill their product we got to be
able<00:03:42.900> to<00:03:43.079> do<00:03:43.199> two<00:03:43.379> things<00:03:43.590> one<00:03:45.769> bring<00:03:46.769> about<00:03:46.980> a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
able to do two things one bring about a

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.770 
able to do two things one bring about a
substantial<00:03:47.699> waiting<00:03:48.209> of<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.359> vehicle

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
substantial waiting of the vehicle

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.530 
substantial waiting of the vehicle
because<00:03:49.049> we<00:03:49.169> got<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.349> take<00:03:49.500> some<00:03:49.560> way<00:03:49.859> down<00:03:50.540> and

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
because we got to take some way down and

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:52.819 
because we got to take some way down and
secondly<00:03:51.930> we're<00:03:52.139> getting<00:03:52.349> improve<00:03:52.650> its

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
secondly we're getting improve its

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.650 
secondly we're getting improve its
powertrain<00:03:53.099> capability<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.389> can<00:03:54.510> do

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
powertrain capability so that you can do

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.270 
powertrain capability so that you can do
a<00:03:54.690> variety<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:55.139> things<00:03:55.379> with<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> rest<00:03:55.919> of<00:03:56.129> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
a variety of things with the rest of the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.069 
a variety of things with the rest of the
powertrain<00:03:56.489> story<00:03:57.150> that<00:03:57.329> we<00:03:57.419> have<00:03:57.569> within<00:03:57.780> the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
powertrain story that we have within the

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.039 
powertrain story that we have within the
aircraft<00:03:58.560> or<00:03:58.709> world<00:03:58.919> and<00:03:59.760> in<00:04:00.269> the<00:04:00.389> process<00:04:00.569> I

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
aircraft or world and in the process I

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.860 
aircraft or world and in the process I
think<00:04:01.079> we'll<00:04:01.440> update<00:04:01.620> design<00:04:02.220> and<00:04:02.549> style<00:04:03.209> but

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
think we'll update design and style but

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.869 
think we'll update design and style but
without<00:04:04.049> touching<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.859> fundamental<00:04:05.549> element

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
without touching the fundamental element

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.460 
without touching the fundamental element
so<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.030> other<00:04:06.510> angular<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.139> got<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.349> be<00:04:07.440> very

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
so that other angular you got to be very

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.949 
so that other angular you got to be very
very<00:04:07.799> careful<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:09.060> can<00:04:09.209> update<00:04:09.389> it<00:04:09.629> but<00:04:09.870> you

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
very careful you can update it but you

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.479 
very careful you can update it but you
can't<00:04:10.230> change<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.650> if<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.859> take<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.159> nature

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
can't change it if you take the nature

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.699 
can't change it if you take the nature
