hey<00:00:00.960> youtube<00:00:01.350> today<00:00:01.680> I'm<00:00:01.920> going<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.220> show<00:00:02.429> you

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hey youtube today I'm going to show you

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.619 
hey youtube today I'm going to show you
how<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.939> solve<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.570> 2x2<00:00:04.410> or<00:00:04.830> AB<00:00:05.040> X<00:00:05.190> cube<00:00:05.629> so

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
how to solve a 2x2 or AB X cube so

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.480 
how to solve a 2x2 or AB X cube so
before<00:00:07.020> we<00:00:07.140> begin<00:00:07.440> I'm<00:00:07.740> going<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.160> teach<00:00:08.309> you

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
before we begin I'm going to teach you

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.299 
before we begin I'm going to teach you
the<00:00:08.519> Rubik's<00:00:08.940> Cube<00:00:09.620> notation<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.130> can

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
the Rubik's Cube notation and this can

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.720 
the Rubik's Cube notation and this can
work<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.580> any<00:00:11.880> type<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.120> cube<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:13.170> here<00:00:14.099> this

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
work on any type of cube but here this

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.140 
work on any type of cube but here this
side<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.509> side<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.260> faces<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.150> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
side the side that faces you is the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
side the side that faces you is the
front<00:00:18.420> side<00:00:18.630> we<00:00:18.660> call<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> side<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
front side we call that so side this is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.019 
front side we call that so side this is
the<00:00:23.070> left<00:00:23.250> side<00:00:23.930> this<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> right<00:00:25.380> side

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
the left side this is the right side

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.189 
the left side this is the right side
this<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.660> upside<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> down<00:00:29.340> side

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
this is the upside is with the down side

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.540 
this is the upside is with the down side
so<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.710> would<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
so this would be you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.459 
so this would be you
this<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:32.969> our<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.600> would<00:00:33.719> be<00:00:33.870> L<00:00:34.079> and

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
this would be our this would be L and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.380 
this would be our this would be L and
this<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.040> baby<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:37.140> if<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.920> always<00:00:38.250> say<00:00:38.550> up

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this is baby so if I always say up

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.319 
this is baby so if I always say up
inverted<00:00:40.320> you'll<00:00:41.190> either<00:00:41.340> pretend<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
inverted you'll either pretend that

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.450 
inverted you'll either pretend that
we're<00:00:42.480> facing<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> upside<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:44.219> we'd

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
we're facing the upside and then we'd

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.040 
we're facing the upside and then we'd
turn<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> counterclockwise<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
turn it counterclockwise that's it and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.170 
turn it counterclockwise that's it and
read<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.260> means<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:47.059> then<00:00:48.079> just<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.739> would<00:00:49.980> be

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
read it means and then just up would be

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.279 
read it means and then just up would be
except<00:00:51.180> opposite<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:53.870> left<00:00:54.870> inverted<00:00:55.199> would

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
except opposite so left inverted would

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.189 
except opposite so left inverted would
be<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:56.210> right<00:00:57.210> inverted<00:00:57.690> would<00:00:57.840> actually<00:00:58.109> be

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
be this right inverted would actually be

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.479 
be this right inverted would actually be
the<00:00:58.320> exact<00:00:58.559> opposite<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.250> they're<00:00:59.399> on

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the exact opposite because they're on

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
the exact opposite because they're on
opposite<00:00:59.850> sides<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.210> each<00:01:00.329> other<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
opposite sides of each other so you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.359 
opposite sides of each other so you
don't<00:01:01.350> want<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> get<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.710> confused<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:04.369> yeah

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
don't want to get that confused so yeah

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:24.460 
don't want to get that confused so yeah
so<00:01:06.030> let's<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.270> ahead<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.479> scrambler<00:01:06.869> cube

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.149 

okay<00:01:25.470> Lextran<00:01:25.950> blow<00:01:26.100> enough<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.869> i'm<00:01:28.290> actually

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
okay Lextran blow enough so i'm actually

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.380 
okay Lextran blow enough so i'm actually
tell<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> something<00:01:31.759> instead<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.880> orange

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
tell you something instead of orange

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.740 
tell you something instead of orange
pieces<00:01:33.689> i<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.950> purple<00:01:35.670> instead<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.240> white<00:01:36.720> I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
pieces i have purple instead of white I

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
pieces i have purple instead of white I
have<00:01:37.049> black<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.310> if<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.909> ever<00:01:38.970> hear<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.150> say

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
have black so if you ever hear me say

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420 
have black so if you ever hear me say
black<00:01:39.630> purple<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.530> mean<00:01:40.740> orange

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
black purple I really just mean orange

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.539 
black purple I really just mean orange
any<00:01:41.549> white<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.540> doesn't<00:01:42.840> matter

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
any white but it really doesn't matter

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.210 
any white but it really doesn't matter
so<00:01:45.020> well<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.110> first<00:01:46.560> need<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> do<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.130> need

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so well we first need to do is we need

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.950 
so well we first need to do is we need
to<00:01:47.280> get<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.670> black<00:01:48.329> layer<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.799> white<00:01:50.220> layer

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
to get a black layer or a white layer

00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:00.760 
to get a black layer or a white layer
now<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> black<00:01:52.829> side

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.820 

now<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.980> is<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.280> UM<00:02:02.610> black<00:02:03.480> side<00:02:03.750> see<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.650> has

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
now that is the UM black side see it has

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.150 
now that is the UM black side see it has
black<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.610> except<00:02:06.350> these<00:02:07.350> pieces<00:02:07.830> on<00:02:08.070> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
black on it except these pieces on the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.850 
black on it except these pieces on the
sides<00:02:08.430> do<00:02:08.850> not<00:02:08.880> match<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.380> well<00:02:10.380> now<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.710> does

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
sides do not match up well now it does

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.520 
sides do not match up well now it does
but<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.160> don't<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:11.550> match<00:02:11.730> up<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.380> need

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
but they don't all match up so we need

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.930 
but they don't all match up so we need
to<00:02:13.650> get<00:02:13.800> something<00:02:14.250> for<00:02:14.520> like<00:02:14.670> yes<00:02:19.730> see<00:02:20.730> like

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
to get something for like yes see like

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.450 
to get something for like yes see like
that<00:02:21.230> that's<00:02:22.230> one<00:02:22.830> whole<00:02:22.980> layer<00:02:23.130> fished<00:02:24.170> so

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
that that's one whole layer fished so

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.550 
that that's one whole layer fished so
you<00:02:26.460> should<00:02:27.090> be<00:02:27.780> able<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.050> come<00:02:28.200> up<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.410> first

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you should be able to come up the first

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.490 
you should be able to come up the first
layer<00:02:28.800> on<00:02:28.830> your<00:02:29.040> own<00:02:29.100> um<00:02:29.670> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.690> just<00:02:31.320> got

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
layer on your own um if you just got

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.620 
layer on your own um if you just got
your<00:02:31.620> abacus<00:02:31.770> cubed

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
your abacus cubed

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.340 
your abacus cubed
today<00:02:33.630> or<00:02:34.200> whether<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.040> got<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.480> um<00:02:36.480> maybe<00:02:37.230> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
today or whether you got it um maybe a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.440 
today or whether you got it um maybe a
month<00:02:37.530> ago<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.980> should<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.850> should<00:02:38.880> have

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
month ago you should you should have

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.090 
month ago you should you should have
always<00:02:39.720> when<00:02:40.380> you're<00:02:40.440> trying<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.770> solve<00:02:40.920> it

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
always when you're trying to solve it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.890 
always when you're trying to solve it
you<00:02:41.160> should<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.400> gotten<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.700> one<00:02:41.850> layer<00:02:42.060> but

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
you should have gotten to one layer but

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
you should have gotten to one layer but
you<00:02:42.930> probably<00:02:43.110> don't<00:02:43.290> know<00:02:43.440> how<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.890> know

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you probably don't know how to you know

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.030 
you probably don't know how to you know
get<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.370> rest<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.850> cube<00:02:45.320> so<00:02:46.320> once<00:02:46.830> you've

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
get the rest the cube so once you've

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.640 
get the rest the cube so once you've
finished<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.700> first<00:02:47.880> two<00:02:48.030> layers<00:02:48.180> I<00:02:48.600> mean<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
finished the first two layers I mean the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.640 
finished the first two layers I mean the
first<00:02:49.830> layer<00:02:50.010> sorry<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:51.480> need<00:02:51.660> to<00:02:51.900> line<00:02:52.620> up

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
first layer sorry you need to line up

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.410 
first layer sorry you need to line up
for<00:02:52.830> these<00:02:53.340> four<00:02:53.580> pieces<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.270> in<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
for these four pieces so it's in the

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.510 
for these four pieces so it's in the
correct<00:02:54.660> place<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> opposite<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.310> black

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
correct place so the opposite of black

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.610 
correct place so the opposite of black
or<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:56.910> should<00:02:57.120> say<00:02:57.270> white<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:58.530> be<00:02:58.680> yellow<00:02:59.040> so

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
or I should say white and be yellow so

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.740 
or I should say white and be yellow so
that<00:03:04.010> look<00:03:05.010> at<00:03:05.160> one<00:03:05.280> piece<00:03:05.459> that's<00:03:05.750> pointing

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
that look at one piece that's pointing

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.170 
that look at one piece that's pointing
up<00:03:06.900> yellow<00:03:07.590> if<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.280> don't<00:03:08.459> have<00:03:08.700> any<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.090> are

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
up yellow if you don't have any that are

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.510 
up yellow if you don't have any that are
pointing<00:03:09.600> up<00:03:09.830> yelling<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.100> perform<00:03:11.400> this

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
pointing up yelling you perform this

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:19.000 
pointing up yelling you perform this
algorithm<00:03:11.990> up<00:03:13.220> left<00:03:14.220> inverted<00:03:16.850> up<00:03:17.850> inverted

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
algorithm up left inverted up inverted

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.680 
algorithm up left inverted up inverted
back<00:03:20.010> down<00:03:20.989> do<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.840> um<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.590> should

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
back down do this so um that should

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.560 
back down do this so um that should
switch<00:03:27.690> another<00:03:28.110> one<00:03:28.880> up<00:03:29.880> here<00:03:30.270> into<00:03:30.450> the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
switch another one up here into the

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.840 
switch another one up here into the
correct<00:03:30.900> position<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.650> mean<00:03:32.160> so<00:03:32.370> that<00:03:32.400> one<00:03:32.820> is

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
correct position I mean so that one is

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.910 
correct position I mean so that one is
pointing<00:03:33.300> up<00:03:33.420> yellow<00:03:34.820> so<00:03:35.820> yeah<00:03:36.120> now<00:03:37.110> then<00:03:37.830> you

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
pointing up yellow so yeah now then you

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.110 
pointing up yellow so yeah now then you
what<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.370> want<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.520> do<00:03:38.610> is<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.760> want<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:38.940> line

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
what you want to do is you want to line

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.330 
what you want to do is you want to line
it<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.410> like<00:03:40.410> that<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.190> correct

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it up like that so it's in the correct

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.690 
it up like that so it's in the correct
place<00:03:42.170> and<00:03:43.170> then<00:03:43.470> you're<00:03:44.160> going<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.310> check<00:03:44.459> all

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
place and then you're going to check all

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.199 
place and then you're going to check all
these<00:03:44.910> other<00:03:45.150> pieces<00:03:46.010> for<00:03:47.010> instance<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.670> all

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
these other pieces for instance if all

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.550 
these other pieces for instance if all
of<00:03:48.420> your<00:03:48.540> pieces<00:03:48.690> are<00:03:48.930> in<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.080> correct<00:03:49.290> place

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
of your pieces are in the correct place

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.040 
of your pieces are in the correct place
now<00:03:50.400> yellow<00:03:50.880> does<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.270> have<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.630> pointing

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
now yellow does not have to be pointing

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.620 
now yellow does not have to be pointing
up<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:53.840> one<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:54.959> them<00:03:55.050> does<00:03:55.310> so<00:03:56.360> as<00:03:57.360> we

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
up it you just one of them does so as we

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.240 
up it you just one of them does so as we
can<00:03:57.750> see<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.260> piece<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.590> wrong<00:03:58.800> place

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
can see this piece is wrong place

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.930 
can see this piece is wrong place
because<00:03:59.610> it's<00:03:59.940> red<00:04:00.810> blue<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:01.739> yellow

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
because it's red blue and yellow

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.170 
because it's red blue and yellow
so<00:04:03.620> well<00:04:04.620> purple<00:04:05.340> blue<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.000> yellow<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:08.030> if<00:04:09.030> we

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
so well purple blue and yellow so if we

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.330 
so well purple blue and yellow so if we
go<00:04:09.299> back<00:04:09.329> to<00:04:09.600> this<00:04:09.720> piece<00:04:10.019> we<00:04:10.890> need<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.130> perform

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
go back to this piece we need to perform

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.309 
go back to this piece we need to perform
the<00:04:11.549> algorithm<00:04:11.970> up

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
the algorithm up

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:17.420 
the algorithm up
right<00:04:14.129> up<00:04:14.939> inverted<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:16.380> then<00:04:16.620> pull<00:04:17.160> up<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
right up inverted and then pull up the

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.789 
right up inverted and then pull up the
left<00:04:17.639> side<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.299> then<00:04:19.199> you<00:04:19.320> want<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.530> put<00:04:19.680> that

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
left side and then you want to put that

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.670 
left side and then you want to put that
piece<00:04:20.009> over<00:04:20.220> here<00:04:20.419> put<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.479> down<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:22.440> piece

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
piece over here put it down this piece

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.080 
piece over here put it down this piece
put<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:23.009> over<00:04:23.070> here<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.400> put<00:04:23.639> it<00:04:23.699> down<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:26.090> when

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
put it over here and put it down so when

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.270 
put it over here and put it down so when
I'm<00:04:27.180> not<00:04:27.330> finished<00:04:27.810> it<00:04:27.990> but<00:04:28.199> we<00:04:29.070> did

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
I'm not finished it but we did

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.210 
I'm not finished it but we did
definitely<00:04:29.880> move<00:04:30.479> the<00:04:30.840> pieces<00:04:31.020> around<00:04:31.220> see

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
definitely move the pieces around see

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
definitely move the pieces around see
when<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.430> keep<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.729> a<00:04:32.789> penis<00:04:33.300> until<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:34.710> get<00:04:34.889> two

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
when I keep on a penis until you get two

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:46.810 
when I keep on a penis until you get two
together<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:45.229> still<00:04:46.229> no<00:04:46.289> thanks<00:04:46.560> sometimes

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
together so still no thanks sometimes

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.879 
together so still no thanks sometimes
you<00:04:47.820> need<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.060> UM<00:04:48.210> try<00:04:49.080> doing<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.620> different

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
you need to UM try doing a different

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.879 
you need to UM try doing a different
piece

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
piece

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.550 
piece
so<00:04:52.889> actually<00:04:53.430> we<00:04:53.580> did<00:04:53.699> get<00:04:53.910> two<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.389> thought<00:04:54.870> now

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
so actually we did get two I thought now

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.070 
so actually we did get two I thought now
these<00:04:55.710> ones<00:04:55.949> aren't<00:04:56.250> much<00:04:56.539> bashed<00:04:57.539> up<00:04:57.840> but

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
these ones aren't much bashed up but

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.770 
these ones aren't much bashed up but
they<00:04:58.560> got<00:04:58.710> these<00:04:58.860> now<00:04:59.759> sometimes<00:05:00.300> when<00:05:00.539> you<00:05:00.630> do

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
they got these now sometimes when you do

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.570 
they got these now sometimes when you do
get<00:05:00.900> these<00:05:01.080> two<00:05:01.289> these<00:05:01.889> two<00:05:01.919> are<00:05:02.220> already<00:05:02.520> in

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
get these two these two are already in

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.400 
get these two these two are already in
the<00:05:02.639> correct<00:05:02.849> place<00:05:03.060> but<00:05:03.330> then<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.139> happen

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
the correct place but then it happen

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.219 
the correct place but then it happen
with<00:05:04.500> me<00:05:04.699> now<00:05:05.699> if<00:05:06.120> they<00:05:06.539> are<00:05:06.720> on<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:06.930> correct

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
with me now if they are on the correct

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.550 
with me now if they are on the correct
place<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.949> can<00:05:08.070> just<00:05:08.220> get<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.550> step<00:05:09.560> I'll

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
place you can just get this step I'll

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.659 
place you can just get this step I'll
say<00:05:10.800> just<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:12.360> don't<00:05:12.449> have<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.750> do<00:05:12.900> this<00:05:13.669> you

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
say just you don't have to do this you

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.580 
say just you don't have to do this you
need<00:05:14.820> to<00:05:14.880> make<00:05:15.030> sure<00:05:15.389> the<00:05:15.599> two<00:05:15.780> rushing<00:05:16.349> up<00:05:16.470> are

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
need to make sure the two rushing up are

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.200 
need to make sure the two rushing up are
in<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.710> back<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.220> then<00:05:17.430> perform<00:05:17.729> that<00:05:17.880> exact

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
in the back and then perform that exact

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.129 
in the back and then perform that exact
same<00:05:18.419> algorithm<00:05:22.099> like<00:05:23.099> that<00:05:23.340> and<00:05:23.659> then<00:05:24.659> do<00:05:24.930> one

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
same algorithm like that and then do one

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.700 
same algorithm like that and then do one
final<00:05:25.320> turn<00:05:25.650> and<00:05:26.120> if<00:05:27.120> I'm<00:05:27.270> correct<00:05:27.510> you<00:05:28.110> put<00:05:28.560> up

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
final turn and if I'm correct you put up

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.439 
final turn and if I'm correct you put up
every<00:05:29.010> single<00:05:29.340> one<00:05:29.460> it's<00:05:29.699> correct<00:05:29.940> place

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
every single one it's correct place

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.360 
every single one it's correct place
now<00:05:31.080> sometimes<00:05:31.650> you<00:05:31.770> have<00:05:31.860> to<00:05:31.919> repeat<00:05:32.190> this

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
now sometimes you have to repeat this

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.670 
now sometimes you have to repeat this
you<00:05:33.180> know<00:05:33.300> from<00:05:33.479> right<00:05:33.630> here<00:05:33.900> but<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.409> don't

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
you know from right here but I don't

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.920 
you know from right here but I don't
want<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.860> mess<00:05:34.979> this<00:05:35.010> up<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:35.659> once<00:05:36.659> you<00:05:36.780> have

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
want to mess this up so once you have

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.730 
want to mess this up so once you have
that<00:05:36.990> we're<00:05:37.680> gonna<00:05:37.770> flip<00:05:39.260> all<00:05:40.260> four<00:05:40.560> pieces

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
that we're gonna flip all four pieces

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.279 
that we're gonna flip all four pieces
I'm<00:05:41.159> going<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.580> flip<00:05:41.760> three<00:05:42.030> you<00:05:42.750> may<00:05:42.930> need<00:05:43.169> to

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
I'm going to flip three you may need to

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:55.839 
I'm going to flip three you may need to
flip<00:05:43.500> either<00:05:43.919> three<00:05:44.789> or<00:05:44.820> two<00:05:45.710> so<00:05:46.710> let's<00:05:46.949> go

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.119 

and<00:05:56.849> I'd<00:05:57.780> only<00:05:57.900> think<00:05:58.110> it<00:05:58.319> takes<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:58.530> genius<00:05:58.560> to

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
and I'd only think it takes a genius to

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.980 
and I'd only think it takes a genius to
figure<00:05:59.310> out<00:05:59.580> you<00:06:00.360> know<00:06:00.479> what<00:06:00.690> you<00:06:00.720> do<00:06:00.900> from

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
figure out you know what you do from

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.080 
figure out you know what you do from
here<00:06:01.289> if<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.740> really<00:06:02.099> can't<00:06:02.460> figure<00:06:02.639> this<00:06:02.849> out

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
here if you really can't figure this out

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.450 
here if you really can't figure this out
I<00:06:03.409> don't<00:06:04.409> I<00:06:04.470> have<00:06:04.560> no<00:06:04.710> idea<00:06:04.919> how<00:06:05.099> you<00:06:05.159> got<00:06:05.340> this

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
I don't I have no idea how you got this

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.189 
I don't I have no idea how you got this
far<00:06:05.699> and<00:06:06.830> they're<00:06:07.830> solved<00:06:08.720> now<00:06:09.720> if<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.020> mess

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
far and they're solved now if you mess

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.249 
far and they're solved now if you mess
up<00:06:10.229> just<00:06:10.650> try<00:06:11.190> again<00:06:11.509> don't<00:06:12.509> get<00:06:12.690> discouraged

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
up just try again don't get discouraged

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.219 
up just try again don't get discouraged
because<00:06:13.470> I<00:06:14.449> got<00:06:15.449> discouraged<00:06:15.750> a<00:06:15.930> lot<00:06:16.050> when<00:06:16.199> I

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
because I got discouraged a lot when I

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.670 
because I got discouraged a lot when I
try<00:06:16.470> to<00:06:16.530> solve<00:06:16.770> my<00:06:17.250> three<00:06:17.909> bicubic<00:06:18.530> and<00:06:19.530> I

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
try to solve my three bicubic and I

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:27.490 
try to solve my three bicubic and I
finally<00:06:20.129> know<00:06:20.190> how<00:06:20.340> to<00:06:24.620> solve<00:06:25.620> it<00:06:25.710> for<00:06:25.800> a<00:06:25.860> while

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
finally know how to solve it for a while

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.580 
finally know how to solve it for a while
yeah<00:06:28.500> so<00:06:29.210> this<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:31.020> just<00:06:31.139> keep<00:06:31.229> on<00:06:31.349> practicing

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590 
yeah so this you just keep on practicing

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.040 
yeah so this you just keep on practicing
this<00:06:32.340> method<00:06:32.490> until<00:06:33.270> you<00:06:33.389> get<00:06:33.509> really<00:06:33.659> fast<00:06:33.840> at

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
this method until you get really fast at

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.399 
this method until you get really fast at
it<00:06:34.080> takes<00:06:34.830> me<00:06:34.979> about<00:06:35.129> two<00:06:35.340> minutes<00:06:35.490> oh<00:06:36.379> yeah

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
it takes me about two minutes oh yeah

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.099 
it takes me about two minutes oh yeah
bye
