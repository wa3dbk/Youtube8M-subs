00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.720
Today, I speak you about the bike in general.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.480
Already, when you are little,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.660
it's a beautiful day to try the bike without the little wheels.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.660
Although you crash.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.740
Then you grow up and you use the bike well.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.160
You realize that you are a cador...

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.100
or not.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.040
Say hello to the camera!

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.557
Hellooo!

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.780
Let's go to do bike! Are you ready?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.540
You pedal! You pedal!

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.580
Left! Left pedaling!

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.420
Curb! Curb! Curb!

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
Oh no fuck!

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.000
What happened?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
There are three types of bicycle:

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:15.197
The mountain bike,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.000
the most mainly used and the most stylish,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.020
who is used in hill, trail, mountain.

00:01:23.325 --> 00:01:25.325
But especially the heavier in climbs.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.100
The bike rice, for circulate in the road and the most light.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.114
Do you farted?

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:01.914
No, I don't.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.900
Which is annoying, the Tour de France is 60 KPH average.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.300
Me, when i'm fast, it looks like this.

00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:18.198
Special press: "release due to a lack of money the bike you will see is not a bike rice  but a mountain bike."         Cordially                                                                                                          The direction of "Les Couz' Ju&amp;Max"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.800
Look I'm fast bro!!!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.215
Me I'm not ugly!

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:29.414
Are you serious? You aren't kind!

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.920
So, I not blame them when I see them at my home, it hurts...

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.320
And the BMX,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.180
it's for professionals.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.040
Ah, not me!

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.360
Otherwise, visit our channel Youtube.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.040
At the next!

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.540
And good school year.
