just about one atom of uranium but about
three<00:00:11.400> different<00:00:11.820> types<00:00:12.450> of<00:00:12.660> Adam<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.110> uranium

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
three different types of Adam of uranium

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.560 
three different types of Adam of uranium
the<00:00:14.160> three<00:00:14.490> isotopes<00:00:15.260> each<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.560> these<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:17.070> an

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
the three isotopes each of these is an

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.439 
the three isotopes each of these is an
isotope<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.930> an<00:00:19.650> isotope<00:00:20.250> has<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> same

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
isotope and an isotope has the same

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.800 
isotope and an isotope has the same
chemical<00:00:22.170> form<00:00:22.529> but<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.460> different<00:00:23.910> mass<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
chemical form but a different mass and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.410 
chemical form but a different mass and
you<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.830> see<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.369> each<00:00:27.000> case<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.660> have<00:00:28.470> the

the atom of uranium is described by

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.770 
the atom of uranium is described by
saying<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:07.979> 92<00:01:08.460> protons<00:01:09.090> in<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
saying there are 92 protons in the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.340 
saying there are 92 protons in the
nucleus<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:12.330> difference<00:01:12.780> between<00:01:13.170> these

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
nucleus the difference between these

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.980 
nucleus the difference between these
atoms<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.689> different

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
atoms is that they have different

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.270 
atoms is that they have different
numbers<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> neutrons<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:19.970> 141<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.210> this

numbers of neutrons in this 141 in this
143<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.619> 146<00:01:25.939> this<00:01:26.939> one's<00:01:27.210> called

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
143 and then this 146 this one's called

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.910 
143 and then this 146 this one's called
uranium-233<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.689> obviously<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.530> look<00:01:31.770> at

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
uranium-233 and obviously if you look at

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.280 
uranium-233 and obviously if you look at
these<00:01:32.070> numbers<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:33.270> add<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.950> 233<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.729> is

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
these numbers they add up to 233 that is

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.370 
these numbers they add up to 233 that is
233<00:01:37.700> particles<00:01:38.700> protons<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.840> neutrons<00:01:39.869> in

they<00:01:46.680> talk<00:01:46.860> about<00:01:47.509> u-235<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> number

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
they talk about u-235 it is the number

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.120 
they talk about u-235 it is the number
of<00:01:50.340> particles<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.960> nucleus<00:01:52.380> its

238 where there are 238 particles within
the<00:02:01.259> nucleus<00:02:01.969> now<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.030> interesting<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the nucleus now the interesting thing is

the nucleus now the interesting thing is
these<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:05.549> although<00:02:06.360> they're<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> same

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
these actually although they're the same

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.800 
these actually although they're the same
chemically<00:02:08.280> they<00:02:08.789> behave<00:02:09.179> different

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
chemically they behave different

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.880 
chemically they behave different
physically<00:02:10.670> Urania<00:02:11.670> 23<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.330> yer<00:02:12.599> Ain

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
physically Urania 23 and yer Ain

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.320 
physically Urania 23 and yer Ain
233<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:13.670> 235<00:02:14.390> are<00:02:14.870> similar<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:16.330> physical

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
233 and 235 are similar in physical

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.699 
233 and 235 are similar in physical
characteristics<00:02:18.260> they<00:02:19.040> produce<00:02:20.000> fishin<00:02:20.990> you

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
characteristics they produce fishin you

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.430 
characteristics they produce fishin you
get<00:02:21.950> fishin<00:02:22.520> with<00:02:22.970> both<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.300> these<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:24.080> is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
get fishin with both of these this is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.430 
get fishin with both of these this is
where<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.040> atom<00:02:25.730> will<00:02:26.330> actually<00:02:26.750> split<00:02:27.260> in

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
where the atom will actually split in

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.080 
where the atom will actually split in
half<00:02:27.650> if<00:02:28.100> hit<00:02:28.910> by<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> neutron<00:02:30.130> when<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.610> get<00:02:31.850> a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
half if hit by a neutron when you get a

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.530 
half if hit by a neutron when you get a
neutron<00:02:32.690> hitting<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.260> nucleus<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.790> just

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
neutron hitting this nucleus this just

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.170 
neutron hitting this nucleus this just
goes<00:02:35.840> through<00:02:36.170> a<00:02:36.200> reaction<00:02:37.070> which<00:02:37.550> turns<00:02:37.970> it

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
goes through a reaction which turns it

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.610 
goes through a reaction which turns it
into<00:02:38.390> plutonium<00:02:39.820> eventually<00:02:40.820> so<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.900> you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
into plutonium eventually so this you

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.970 
into plutonium eventually so this you
get<00:02:42.830> plutonium<00:02:43.760> when<00:02:44.690> you<00:02:44.840> add<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.080> neutron<00:02:45.770> and

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
get plutonium when you add a neutron and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.030 
get plutonium when you add a neutron and
here<00:02:46.880> when<00:02:47.420> you<00:02:47.540> add<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.810> neutron<00:02:48.410> you<00:02:48.800> get

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
here when you add a neutron you get

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.680 
here when you add a neutron you get
fishin<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.850> splits<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.540> half<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:52.220> briefly<00:02:52.910> that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
fishin it splits in half so briefly that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.560 
fishin it splits in half so briefly that
is<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.350> structure<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.700> atom<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.560> uranium
