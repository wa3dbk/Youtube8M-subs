little addition here is the fact that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.780 
little addition here is the fact that

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
that's cool i like that it reminds me of

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.520 
that's cool i like that it reminds me of
the<00:02:36.180> game<00:02:36.420> because<00:02:36.689> i<00:02:36.780> remember<00:02:36.930> playing<00:02:37.109> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the game because i remember playing a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.520 
the game because i remember playing a
halo<00:02:37.799> 2<00:02:37.980> multiplayer<00:02:38.599> lose<00:02:39.599> halo<00:02:39.900> 2<00:02:40.139> one<00:02:40.439> of

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
halo 2 multiplayer lose halo 2 one of

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.110 
halo 2 multiplayer lose halo 2 one of
the<00:02:40.590> halos<00:02:40.889> and<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.489> can<00:02:41.609> see<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.849> weapon

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
the halos and you can see the weapon

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.580 
the halos and you can see the weapon
just<00:02:42.329> like<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.599> on<00:02:42.870> their<00:02:43.109> back<00:02:43.260> when

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
just like that on their back when

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.289 
just like that on their back when
they're<00:02:43.739> not<00:02:43.859> using<00:02:43.889> it<00:02:44.219> so<00:02:44.909> it<00:02:44.969> kind<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> makes

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
they're not using it so it kind of makes

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.910 
they're not using it so it kind of makes
sense<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.689> if<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.260> can<00:02:46.379> be<00:02:46.500> holding<00:02:46.680> another

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
sense that if you can be holding another

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.559 
sense that if you can be holding another
weapon<00:02:47.129> then<00:02:47.639> have<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:47.909> one<00:02:48.030> on<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.209> back<00:02:48.389> it

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
weapon then have this one on the back it

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.179 
weapon then have this one on the back it
actually<00:02:48.750> looks<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.409> game<00:02:49.590> which<00:02:49.980> is

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
actually looks like the game which is

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.069 
actually looks like the game which is
nice<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.269> they<00:02:51.359> can<00:02:51.510> achieve<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:51.930> without

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
nice that they can achieve that without

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.809 
nice that they can achieve that without
making<00:02:52.349> it<00:02:52.560> look<00:02:52.620> too<00:02:52.829> goofy<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.370> think<00:02:53.760> it

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
making it look too goofy I think it

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.849 
making it look too goofy I think it
looks<00:02:53.970> alright<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:55.139> is<00:02:55.290> pretty<00:02:55.470> cool<00:02:55.560> this

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
looks alright this is pretty cool this

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.319
