00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.210
 the day after the victory over psv qua with 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.700
 gyro riedewald and leroy 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.380
 what first to get out of the dressing room and 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.150
 not long after , the largest followed 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.670
 part of the selection but not everyone 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.460
 cillessen moisander sinkgraves continued 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.109
 and token inside to train and also on 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.820
 rhythm was not there is the poll 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.930
 injured and appeared in the hospital 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.189
 today that his hamstring injury 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 not too bad 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 later in the week should be clear when 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.619
 he can play again 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 JoÃ«l Veltman walked cheerfully to the field 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.350
 where they are not merely positive about the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.180
 three a win over psv 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.219
 think a little double feelings must 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.829
 I say of course we win and that is 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.670
 that delicious had at 11 points that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.820
 reason in between 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.440
 reality is already second with us 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 though was not good and also discussed 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.920
 so then we can work on it again 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.690
 according to some media the latter 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 two victories mainly due to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.070
 the fact that fieldman is fit again 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.010
 yes it went a bit exaggerated i do 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.480
 I play in two matches and we 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.189
 so winning twice finds that why 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.119
 I think it is exaggerated and after two 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.130
 You ca n't say year stars right away 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.320
 it's because I like it not 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.510
 you are pretty light numbers 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.979
 well i just think certain trust 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.930
 also what is in the group 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.759
 it is of course related to it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.200
 win if you grab points with 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.880
 increased confidence that is now 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.470
 this moment going on here 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.210
 veltman plays so well was even 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.909
 but injured before that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 qatar all that he came to form 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.180
 I also very often indicate I felt 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.880
 really an energetic to that and arifi 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.909
 side to the vacation and he went full 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.680
 before and I felt really good but 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.090
 I got injured and the only one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.650
 difference now is that I also have energy 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.260
 just feel it 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.460
 yes no legia injury you still away 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.220
 I think it changed a little bit the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.230
 precautionary state was also there 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.800
 played 90 minutes yesterday you are back 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.510
 100% now yes I think it's divorce 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.030
 short time of course last 10 minutes 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.800
 i was like i really keogh 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.680
 and but is understandably one of course 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.230
 played long and then they in three days 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.030
 so normal and now a bit of rest and 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.950
 then I can full again but the rhythm 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.390
 shirley that fieldman is good at it again 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.560
 skin was visible, among other things, in this one 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.360
 goal attempt 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.370
 but despite the victory on PSV, he thinks 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.910
 not serious about the next title 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.040
 Ajax 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.500
 so long as they do not have the scale 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.790
 there is always the chance of course and you 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.440
 must also be realistic they have one 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.670
 good team and to go 11 points away 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.620
 I don't see that happening so quickly 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.660
 but it is nice that we have them too 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.680
 definitely just check it out with the place 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.959
 the eye on number number 2 that we world 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.000
 be a little closer in large lakes 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.370
 finally secure this field men 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.720
 Expiration of PSV Ajax know he just 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.030
 as his trainer next season too 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.440
 anyway on the pitch at ajax 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.110
 I am I think I still completely myself 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.750
 nothing and that step up and down 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.530
 this year after now start the after again 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.820
 The wheel 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.260
 after two games but this is what we want 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.210
 already this is what I want next year too 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.280
 show a whole year if I have that 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.020
 done then you can look further we still 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.030
 learn a lot with ajax song 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.190
 yes a lot you see this season i have 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.630
 learned many things again and again 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.780
 what I said next year I just hope 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.160
 therefore a stable factor and this it 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.870
 the last two games and 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.050
 then what i said there can be anything 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.050
 to happen
