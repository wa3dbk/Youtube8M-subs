who joined Toastmasters and ended up not

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.779 
who joined Toastmasters and ended up not
through<00:06:12.139> Toastmasters<00:06:13.009> directly<00:06:13.580> but

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
through Toastmasters directly but

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.189 
through Toastmasters directly but
through<00:06:14.680> helping<00:06:15.680> other<00:06:16.039> people<00:06:16.659> he<00:06:17.659> found<00:06:18.020> a

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 
through helping other people he found a

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.930 
through helping other people he found a
technique<00:06:18.650> that<00:06:18.680> made<00:06:19.039> him<00:06:19.190> to<00:06:19.400> finally<00:06:19.789> work
