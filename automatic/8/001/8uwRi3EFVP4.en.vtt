00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
ahead of time that I'm not forgetting I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.490 
ahead of time that I'm not forgetting I
do<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.969> her<00:00:15.120> ears<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.900> felt<00:00:16.199> for

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
her but I just spray painted those and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.820 
her but I just spray painted those and
the<00:00:18.390> fumes<00:00:18.690> are<00:00:18.779> pretty<00:00:18.990> terrible<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.590> I'm

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the fumes are pretty terrible so I'm

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.500 
the fumes are pretty terrible so I'm
avoiding<00:00:20.130> wearing<00:00:20.550> those<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.270> if<00:00:21.390> you're

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
avoiding wearing those so if you're

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.240 
avoiding wearing those so if you're
going<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.720> packs<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.199> can<00:00:22.260> probably<00:00:22.650> find<00:00:23.010> me

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
going to packs you can probably find me

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.890 
going to packs you can probably find me
I'll<00:00:23.580> probably<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.060> hit<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.689> one<00:00:24.810> of

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
I'll probably like hit you with one of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.439 
I'll probably like hit you with one of
my<00:00:24.960> tails<00:00:25.199> though<00:00:25.500> it's<00:00:26.220> really<00:00:26.460> hard<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.210> aim

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
my tails though it's really hard to aim

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.169 
my tails though it's really hard to aim
I<00:00:28.160> guess<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.250> should<00:00:29.400> probably<00:00:29.460> stand<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I guess I should probably stand up and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.630 
I guess I should probably stand up and
show<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> whole<00:00:30.570> thing<00:00:34.370> I'm<00:00:35.370> finally

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
kind of standing even though it looks

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.180 
kind of standing even though it looks
like<00:00:37.110> I'm<00:00:37.200> still<00:00:37.350> fitting<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:37.920> I'm

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
like I'm still fitting because I'm

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.010 
like I'm still fitting because I'm
crashing<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.059> fit<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.450> frame<00:00:39.690> light

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
crashing to fit in the frame light

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.920

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
actually putting a whole costume on so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.770 
actually putting a whole costume on so
it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.390> learning<00:00:51.510> experience<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:53.780> basically

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's a learning experience so basically

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
it's a learning experience so basically
the<00:00:55.020> reason<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.379> haven't<00:00:55.680> made<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.800> video<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the reason I haven't made a video in so

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
the reason I haven't made a video in so
long<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.820> because<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.329> left<00:00:57.750> school<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.289> had<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
long is because I left school and had to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.389 
long is because I left school and had to
move<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.980> myself
