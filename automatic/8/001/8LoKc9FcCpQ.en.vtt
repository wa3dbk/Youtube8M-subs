00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
something like this in Photoshop but it

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.130 
something like this in Photoshop but it
took<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.760> whole<00:03:26.970> bunch<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.300> time<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:27.959> is

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
took a whole bunch of time so this is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.199 
took a whole bunch of time so this is
actually<00:03:28.290> quite<00:03:28.680> amazing<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.880> guys<00:03:30.060> have

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
let's just hop back out and let's

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.280 
let's just hop back out and let's
continue<00:03:53.610> on<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.269> let's<00:03:54.540> look<00:03:54.840> at<00:03:55.080> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
continue on and let's look at the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.930 
continue on and let's look at the
accessories<00:03:55.860> package<00:03:56.280> go<00:03:56.580> ahead<00:03:56.700> and<00:03:56.820> set

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
accessories package go ahead and set

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.350 
accessories package go ahead and set
this<00:03:56.970> off<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.360> side<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:58.790> little<00:03:59.790> bit<00:04:00.150> more

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
this off to the side a little bit more

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.690 
this off to the side a little bit more
inside<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.780> box<00:04:00.959> here<00:04:01.230> go<00:04:02.130> ahead<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.340> open<00:04:02.459> it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
inside the box here go ahead and open it

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:13.910 
inside the box here go ahead and open it
up<00:04:05.989> we<00:04:06.989> have<00:04:07.200> our<00:04:07.410> micro<00:04:08.250> USB<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:09.150> USB<00:04:09.300> cable

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.610 

we<00:04:14.490> have<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:15.180> power<00:04:15.330> adapter<00:04:15.480> plug<00:04:16.169> adapter

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
we have the power adapter plug adapter

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.940 
we have the power adapter plug adapter
and<00:04:17.600> then<00:04:18.600> we<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.870> the<00:04:19.019> actual<00:04:19.169> plug<00:04:19.590> itself

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
and then we have the actual plug itself

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.250 
and then we have the actual plug itself
where<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.669> USB<00:04:20.880> goes<00:04:21.180> here<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.720> this<00:04:22.019> thing

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
where the USB goes here and this thing

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.409 
where the USB goes here and this thing
very<00:04:22.530> interestingly<00:04:22.919> plugs<00:04:23.580> into<00:04:23.790> here<00:04:24.090> so

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
very interestingly plugs into here so

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.210 
very interestingly plugs into here so
check<00:04:24.600> this<00:04:24.780> out<00:04:24.990> stick<00:04:25.530> this<00:04:25.650> into<00:04:25.830> here<00:04:26.070> and

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
check this out stick this into here and

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.270 
check this out stick this into here and
