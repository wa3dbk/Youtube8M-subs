00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.080
 hello everyone then I'm late well 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.750
 if I didn't think it was so late 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.910
 so let's get straight to the point then 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.269
 today I do the tutorial of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.150
 make up that you asked me why 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.040
 as history of the profile photo of the 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.510
 facebook of the vigorina page even if 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.940
 this one is a little bit more here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.410
 loaded with that and there is the addition of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.910
 details below that there was not 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.829
 so obviously I never can 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.690
 come the same things experiment like this 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.809
 I move however I did using it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.789
 the duochrome of sails cup along with i 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.590
 very elegant 1 are my two posts 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.390
 of the moment the beautiful elegant that mine 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.989
 moment from a moment all 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.570
 beginning I had to lower my mind there 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.660
 or a soccer field this seems to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.850
 stay inside the soccer field and there 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.129
 they are the types they find that they have 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.100
 said they disturb me but how they disturb 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.710
 in the sense of stop but he is because before 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.150
 they saw us put I was preparing 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.800
 they start making cackles 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.770
 before I launch myself for nothing 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.260
 on that I don't even know how bad 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.570
 who can make this cream could 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.820
 be a milan and an object 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.800
 head lowered the shutter anyway 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.090
 I wanted to show you outfits but people 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 too late so I don't want to do 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.970
 wait for people this too by going to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.340
 dinner then the outfit anyway you will see it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.690

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.240
 I always make this base this one here 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.520
 do it right with the weekend 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 when I have to get out of standing on all the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.340
 face then pass the divider to the corrector 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:09.000
 respect for benefits and spread it over all 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.950
 my dark circles trying to beat him 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.510
 only in the darker parts 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.570
 then switch to the liquid foundation of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.300
 collistar I was in the key number 4 mi 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.040
 like to spread it with kabuki of the line 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.170
 already cream of nepi make up and if wet 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:33.630
 the brush comes an application more 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:36.120
 light more natural seen all with 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.680
 the powder powder silk effect of 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.709
 collistar here you see even a little 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.120
 colorful use first of all the paf 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.989
 which is located inside the 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:54.170
 pack and pat and dab a little 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:54.170
 all over my face I talk to my mother 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.880
 and then dust it off with a 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.640
 brush in the powder we pass to the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.739
 eyes use as a basis from that of 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:11.310
 clio for pupa I really like this 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:13.880
 base to build an additional base 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.100
 I use this debora pencils first 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.739
 and this preparation washed people view 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.660
 another video anyway the same on 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.730
 mobile eyelid lightly then soften with 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.340
 a pencil of brown kiko this not 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.120
 make a mistake 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.650
 4 I believe this further ombres smoke 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.629
 always with your fingers then so too 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.160
 pretty coarse no need to 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.230
 be precise because the shadow is right 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.489
 yes it was the number 4 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.650
 you see they are only shadows therefore I take the 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.340
 your chrome rainbows not even i 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.670
 cup and I start from that light green not me there 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.080
 ask for the name because I don't remember 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.080
 the stand on the entire eyelid 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.880
 I therefore take the darker green of the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.980
 pallets and the sternum from the end of the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.410
 mobile eyelid and also going then 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.090
 towards the inside fading I take then 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.099
 this sort of sort of garden 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.879
 light green I tried to show the reflections 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.190
 greenish but the video camera does not have them 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.049
 welcomed and I do not spend as a light point 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.669
 in the inner corner of the eye I take 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.810
 then the very elegant example of the 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.169
 rainbows baby cup line 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.510
 I take that gray mouse with the sequest 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.190
 2 17 of max excellent this brush with 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.050
 the gradient brush and the smoke 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.789
 immediately above the 2 chrome eye shadows 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.070
 well then even dirty then 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.010
 I take that brown and spread it out 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:48.849
 immediately above the gray mouse and I take 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.740
 therefore a light beige color and not 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.560
 at that point eyeliner light 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.090
 I use the latest hit kiko pen 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.440
 I find it very good to make it 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.380
 also bought the other work 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.030
 unfortunately the framing is finished here 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.960
 He came a little cabbage then passes 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.090
 directly to the line made anyway 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.740
 a nice thick line of eyeliner with 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.410
 I always take a premium pen brush 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.780
 from the very elegant the black and I extend it 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.220
 in the outer corner of the eye I blur 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.130
 always with the same brush from 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.860
 shades and then concentrates a little 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.060
 to blend well both inside and out 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.060
 is upwards 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:34.820
 then I take a pencil of purple puca ha 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.380
 deserved is just a little bit like 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.660
 of Italian must be applied under the eye but 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.750
 you have seen and always fix it with the 2 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.160
 chrome with that purple eye shadow e 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.860
 this brush is the one of elsa 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.570
 say to one arm if I'm not mistaken then 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.250
 I take niners in with a brush 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.320
 black and I review it on the line of 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.270
 eyeliner I had made with that of 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.580
 kiko liquid because you like it more 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.560

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:02.030

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.919
 mix between the two that of light of the 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.760
 palettes the very elegant and faded 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.610
 in the inner corner of the eye of the 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:16.370
 lower rhyme type blush which is one 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:18.229
 base for blush faded blush the body 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.690
 shop with him social lately it goes well 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.370
 here it is speeded up because I don't know so much 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:32.479
 in short, how much there is to see 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:34.520
 then according the blush then apply the 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.780

 well his work so I add the 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:52.270

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.680
 pass of mascara into disc by applying 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.270
 a nude lipstick this was the one from 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.860
