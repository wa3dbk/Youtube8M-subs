00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello everyone is welcome to 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.790
 a new video on call of duty 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.770
 black ops 3 today we're going 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.960
 talk about a new accessory that would make 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.969
 his appearance at least who did his 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 appearance during the pre alpha to which 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.690
 some players have been invited to 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 treyarch and suddenly it would be really 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.750
 very interesting I think to see him 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.619
 arrive in the final version because 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.939
 I want to tell you what it is you 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.310
 go see it maybe you'll see a lot 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 please then haye caliber new 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.680
 accessory but what is it 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.119
 what does that mean 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.439
 big caliber at all a problem all 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.150
 I will also remind you 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.640
 that in black ops 3 you will be able 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.530
 put six up to six props if I 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.940
 do not cheat on your weapon what makes 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.410
 only to each additional accessory 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.450
 you will need a joker 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.920
 extra it'll start doing 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.590
 a lot so you can basically 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 used a weapon without any has everything 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.559
 without anything without equipment without anything you 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.930
 can just used a weapon with a 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.730
 max a max of accessories on what 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.930
 is rather nice in the end what 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.000
 can be put back for example 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 handle cross charges increase heading and 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.629
 it's mostly about tears at the same 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.829
 time but that's not why I'm 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.449
 come talk today it's for the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.460
 high caliber al-rai caliber the fat 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.040
 caliber that simply transforms 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.900
 your ammo down in ammo that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.630
 do more damage but only in 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.850
 the head then more damage only 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.710
 in the head I mean by that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.299
 example a gun that would be a bit of 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.500
 kind to five seven from what I have 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.759
 heard there would be a gun 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.110
 which is a bit like faith evans 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.420
 ie big precision but 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.979
 low damage could kill handball 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.630
 if you put a bullet in your head that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.009
 would really be something that 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.299
 would change everything then if you can 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.159
 put on the assault rifles on the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.479
 guns on the machine guns 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.710
 we can not put them on rifles 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.119
 machine gunners neither on the seedlings of rifle 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.040
 sniper it might be a little 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.329
 little abuse you will tell me from any 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.189
 way sniper rifles do not have 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.509
 need the most imitate year game that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.680
 would I think it would allow them 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.720
 you have a bullet in your head it will be a 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.399
 little bit abused because the problem 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.320
 with that I see me at least the man 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.590
 the big problem is that it will take 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.380
 that it is not random in the sense 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.030
 where someone who shoots or judged the spit and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.189
 who puts a headshot should not 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.259
 can kill in the head more 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.990
 quickly so certainly it breaks a 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.159
 little bit the myth of the accessory 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.390
 that is, the accessory that are 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.770
 these transform your balls to make 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.960
 more damage but hey already it is necessary that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.970
 more damage in a head but me this 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.470
 that I find what I would say is that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.209
 it's already very good because it's 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.900
 allows to reward people who are 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.920
 ready if the 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.689
 who holds in the head that they are close 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.579
 six months is rewarded are going to be less 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.689
 two bullets to kill in the head this 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.579
 which is not necessarily the case 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.920
 currently on call of duty call of 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.239
 duty there in general it is certainly kills 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.500
 faster in the head but it's 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.269
 really it depends on the doors and that 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.250
 depends on the damage it depends on the weapons that 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.590
 depends on a lot of things and I think 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 that in 80% of cases you shoot at the head 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.769
 does not serve anything 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.099
 pardon absolutely nothing in call of 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.030
 duty and if that could change 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.739
 precisely it could be rather not 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.530
 badly then the big inconvenience I you 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.970
 said earlier about those of this 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.859
 Cecile accessory works all the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.690
 time someone can very well shot at 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.459
 tried to put a headshot and killed 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.019
 instantly someone that's a 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.480
 big problem then from what I have 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.310
 seen at that would not transform any weapon 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.290
 in one shot and cat you are not going 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.620
 to be able to kill me in a bullet in the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.560
 head 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.480
 even with this accessory but you will 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.230
 able to kill for example in 2004 or two 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.150
 three balls 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.950
 a bit like we assure the mk 14 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.209
 recently and the PM3 serves as 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.230
 guys from the moment you put a 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.280
 bullet in the head 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.930
 just put one in the foot 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.700
 the enemy is dead let's say it 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.849
 accelerated enormously fight time 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.470
 to kill then me on the other hand I 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.599
 an idea precisely so that this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.489
 accessory is not to abuse for those who 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.959
 only draw judging for example 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.040
 and who are lucky with that and 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.449
 since it is to reward the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.400
 precision that says precision says he 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.079
 must aim aimed in the head me for 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.900
 me this accessory would be very very good 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:36.269
 if you will need it 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.620
 to aim for that to work 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.540
 only if this accessory works only 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.799
 when you aim for it would really be 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.870
 excellent since at that moment it's going 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.099
 reward people who shoot that aims 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.989
 well in the head that pulls well in the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.489
 head of course you do times 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.169
 shots in the head without doing it on purpose but 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.459
 for example for an enemy who 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.349
 lie down and all that would prevent 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.579
 also to have too much drop shock by 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.560
 example because if you have someone 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.000
 who has free access in front and that you 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.319
 reject if the guy who puts you two 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.099
 beings shot I think you're going all 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.629
 right away not understand 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.069
 so there are little things like that 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.030
 I think that would be one that would be 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.540
 really a good idea it would be a 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.190
 good thing 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.479
 so after that it's really to see what 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.769
 it'll give in the final game because 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.540
 it's true that will still be a 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.400
 little more hectic than black ops 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.989
 2 without going on advanced 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.090
 warfare or it jumps everywhere it moves 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.470
 from everywhere but on a black ops 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.669
 3 which is a little bit between the two 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.739
 think it could not hurt that 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.599
 could really be rewarded from there 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.560
 beyond precision but it's true 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.479
 than for example when we see on 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.520
 advanced warfare me I am very very 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.500
 pleased with the pm3 change because 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.910
 that I can kill very, very quickly 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.410
 people with the chat I think 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.270
 you saw it in the video that I 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.949
 did it on the patch or I was using the pm3 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.789
 as soon as I did a headshot at night 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.199
 fell very quickly 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.210
 but his reward is really the 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:41.069
 pressure here I hope it's okay 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.169
 really arrive in the final version 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.639
 of the game and I hope that 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.740
 blow it's not going to be available at trial 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.789
 or that the effect will only be available in 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.080
 aiming because if the facts 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.669
 available to the judge and I think we're going 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.229
 very quickly have lots of complaints 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.449
 of people who do not stop being 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.530
 beat by being shot by 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.789
 judge and precisely because there is a 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.630
 ball that goes to the nose in the head it's 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:59.639
 true it's really a little bit 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.630
 disturbing here on this I hope that 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.710
 this video will please you 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.030
 wish as usual a good 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.620
 day a good evening and we will 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.620
 find next time go ciao
