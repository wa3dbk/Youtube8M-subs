00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.169 
thing I'm going to do is I'm going to
use<00:00:09.840> my<00:00:10.170> packing<00:00:10.679> peanuts<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.340> drainage

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
use my packing peanuts as drainage

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.959 
use my packing peanuts as drainage
material<00:00:13.049> now<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.769> never<00:00:14.190> want<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> use<00:00:14.730> these

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
material now you never want to use these

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.540 
material now you never want to use these
if<00:00:15.269> you<00:00:15.719> are<00:00:15.839> planning<00:00:16.139> something<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:17.250> you

if you are planning something that you
plan<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:19.039> I'm<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.100> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> put<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> few

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
plan to you I'm just going to put a few

plan to you I'm just going to put a few
packing<00:00:22.410> peanuts<00:00:22.800> drainage<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.880> very

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
packing peanuts drainage is very

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269 
packing peanuts drainage is very
important<00:00:24.930> when<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.170> comes<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.740> cactus

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
important when it comes to cactus

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.570 
important when it comes to cactus
because<00:00:26.460> cactus<00:00:27.150> don't<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.720> width<00:00:28.369> or<00:00:29.369> in

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
because cactus don't like width or in

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.170 
because cactus don't like width or in
other<00:00:29.730> words<00:00:29.939> they<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.510> wet<00:00:30.779> ribs<00:00:32.180> so

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
other words they don't like wet ribs so

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
other words they don't like wet ribs so
I'm<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.480> put<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.780> down<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:35.309> next<00:00:35.640> step

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
I'm going to put this down the next step

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
I'm going to put this down the next step
in<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.120> process<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.780> I'm<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.440> make<00:00:37.620> my

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
in this process is I'm going to make my

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.900 
in this process is I'm going to make my
own<00:00:37.860> cactus<00:00:38.820> well<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.420> cactus<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
own cactus well the cactus is like a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.950 
own cactus well the cactus is like a
well-drained<00:00:41.910> soil<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> soil<00:00:42.899> that

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
well-drained soil or like a soil that

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
well-drained soil or like a soil that
drains<00:00:43.110> very<00:00:43.620> quickly<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.820> how<00:00:45.000> I'm<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.270> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
drains very quickly so how I'm going to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
drains very quickly so how I'm going to
do<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:48.110> place<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> put

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
do this place and you don't want to put

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.780 
do this place and you don't want to put
two<00:00:51.510> parts<00:00:52.670> play<00:00:53.670> fan<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:54.960> part<00:00:55.289> soil

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.110 

you<00:00:59.690> can<00:00:59.930> buy<00:01:01.030> commercial-type<00:01:02.140> potting<00:01:03.140> soil

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
you can buy commercial-type potting soil

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.330 
you can buy commercial-type potting soil
okay<00:01:05.120> but<00:01:05.630> I<00:01:05.660> find<00:01:06.020> it<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.230> easy<00:01:06.740> just<00:01:07.160> to

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
okay but I find it just easy just to

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
okay but I find it just easy just to
make<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.640> my<00:01:07.820> own

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
make it my own

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.390 
make it my own

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 
referred to as sharp fan for small

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.490 
referred to as sharp fan for small
projects<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.390> actually<00:01:14.630> just<00:01:15.020> use<00:01:15.260> whatever

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
projects I actually just use whatever

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:27.820 
projects I actually just use whatever
sand<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.100> have<00:01:16.340> available

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.830 

now<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.890> next<00:01:29.370> step<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.940> going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
now the next step I'm going to do a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.770 
now the next step I'm going to do a
trick<00:01:31.590> about<00:01:31.890> planting<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.520> cactus<00:01:33.060> I'm

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
strip cuts got it in the shape in the

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.490 
strip cuts got it in the shape in the
position<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.240> need<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.630> we're<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.320> put

some<00:02:13.680> slid<00:02:14.010> into<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.460> container<00:02:14.910> now

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
some slid into this container now

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.500 
some slid into this container now
typically<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.160> don't<00:02:17.280> want<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.580> go<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:18.000> as<00:02:18.240> big

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
typically you don't want to go up as big

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.050 
typically you don't want to go up as big
as<00:02:18.660> I<00:02:18.840> have<00:02:19.459> actually<00:02:20.459> going<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.730> quite<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
as I have actually going to quite a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.740 
as I have actually going to quite a
large<00:02:21.870> sized<00:02:22.320> container<00:02:23.160> for<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.150> cactus

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
large sized container for this cactus

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.440 
large sized container for this cactus
but<00:02:25.050> because<00:02:25.410> of<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.650> height<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.130> cactus

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
but because of the height of the cactus

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.500 
but because of the height of the cactus
it's<00:02:27.450> going<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> be<00:02:27.870> top-heavy<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:30.209> it's

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it's going to be top-heavy so it's

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.340 
it's going to be top-heavy so it's
actually<00:02:30.720> gone<00:02:32.660> bigger<00:02:33.660> than<00:02:34.170> what<00:02:34.320> I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
actually gone bigger than what I

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.800 
actually gone bigger than what I
normally<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.040> go<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:36.060> cactus<00:02:36.570> just

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
normally like to go the cactus just

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.250 
normally like to go the cactus just
typically<00:02:37.350> are<00:02:37.590> slow<00:02:37.920> growers<00:02:38.870> so<00:02:39.870> it's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
typically are slow growers so it's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.040 
typically are slow growers so it's
really<00:02:40.800> not<00:02:41.040> going<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.610> cause<00:02:42.030> any<00:02:42.330> problem

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050
