00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.690 

during<00:00:15.560> your<00:00:15.710> lane<00:00:15.890> phase<00:00:16.130> you<00:00:16.370> might<00:00:16.550> be

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:16.700 
during your lane phase you might be

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.000 
during your lane phase you might be
behind<00:00:16.910> your<00:00:17.270> enemy<00:00:17.630> some<00:00:17.930> way<00:00:18.080> or<00:00:18.320> another<00:00:18.560> if

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
behind your enemy some way or another if

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.800 
behind your enemy some way or another if
they<00:00:19.310> have<00:00:19.460> a<00:00:19.490> gold<00:00:19.790> advantage<00:00:20.180> or<00:00:20.480> have

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
they have a gold advantage or have

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.710 
they have a gold advantage or have
successfully<00:00:21.800> counter<00:00:22.160> picked<00:00:22.370> you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
successfully counter picked you

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.609 
successfully counter picked you
naturally<00:00:23.720> you're<00:00:23.930> unable<00:00:24.200> to<00:00:24.440> do<00:00:24.590> much

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
naturally you're unable to do much

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.040 
naturally you're unable to do much
against<00:00:25.190> them<00:00:25.369> but<00:00:26.119> no<00:00:26.240> matter<00:00:26.390> how<00:00:26.570> far<00:00:26.840> I<00:00:26.869> had

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
against them but no matter how far I had

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.109 
against them but no matter how far I had
your<00:00:27.140> enemy<00:00:27.529> is<00:00:27.710> most<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.340> the<00:00:28.430> time<00:00:28.640> we<00:00:28.910> can't

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
your enemy is most of the time we can't

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.640 
your enemy is most of the time we can't
really<00:00:29.240> take<00:00:29.540> the<00:00:29.720> turret<00:00:29.990> within<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.410> first

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
really take the turret within the first

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.040 
really take the turret within the first
ten<00:00:30.920> levels<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:31.940> try<00:00:32.150> to<00:00:32.210> fight<00:00:32.450> your<00:00:32.570> enemy<00:00:32.900> on

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
ten levels so try to fight your enemy on

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.390 
ten levels so try to fight your enemy on
a<00:00:33.080> vent<00:00:33.320> or<00:00:33.470> whenever<00:00:33.830> you<00:00:33.950> have<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.250> chance

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
a vent or whenever you have the chance

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.700 
a vent or whenever you have the chance
to<00:00:34.820> do<00:00:35.000> so<00:00:35.270> they<00:00:35.870> can't<00:00:36.110> really<00:00:36.170> hear<00:00:36.379> ask<00:00:36.590> you

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
to do so they can't really hear ask you

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.950 
to do so they can't really hear ask you
back<00:00:36.920> because<00:00:37.129> of<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.460> turret<00:00:37.670> if<00:00:37.879> and<00:00:38.570> if

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
back because of the turret if and if

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.540 
back because of the turret if and if
they<00:00:39.140> do<00:00:39.200> fight<00:00:39.680> you<00:00:39.770> back<00:00:39.980> under<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.400> turret

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
they do fight you back under the turret

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.130 
they do fight you back under the turret
then<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:40.910> have<00:00:41.120> an<00:00:41.239> advantage<00:00:41.600> in<00:00:41.840> terms<00:00:41.960> of

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
then you have an advantage in terms of

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.720 
then you have an advantage in terms of
damage<00:00:42.440> output

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
good the enemy is if you can do this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.240 
good the enemy is if you can do this
efficiently<00:01:31.610> then<00:01:32.299> they<00:01:32.479> have<00:01:32.630> no<00:01:32.810> choice<00:01:33.110> but

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
efficiently then they have no choice but

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.620 
efficiently then they have no choice but
to<00:01:34.250> decide<00:01:34.580> whether<00:01:34.820> or<00:01:34.909> not<00:01:35.060> they<00:01:35.360> want<00:01:35.390> to

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
disadvantage as you can see here I

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:58.960 
disadvantage as you can see here I
assume<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:57.860> my<00:01:57.950> teammates<00:01:58.340> would<00:01:58.549> disengage

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
assume that my teammates would disengage

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.880 
assume that my teammates would disengage
or<00:01:59.330> back<00:01:59.450> off<00:01:59.690> since<00:02:00.110> they<00:02:00.289> knew<00:02:00.440> that<00:02:00.649> I<00:02:00.679> was

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
or back off since they knew that I was

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.859 
or back off since they knew that I was
farming<00:02:01.190> top<00:02:01.429> instead<00:02:02.390> they<00:02:02.539> let<00:02:02.720> themselves

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
farming top instead they let themselves

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.270 
farming top instead they let themselves
fight<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.409> enemy<00:02:03.679> and<00:02:03.830> were<00:02:03.950> completely

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
fight the enemy and were completely

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.399 
fight the enemy and were completely
annihilated<00:02:05.060> had<00:02:05.690> I<00:02:05.720> grouped<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.140> with<00:02:06.289> my

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
annihilated had I grouped up with my
