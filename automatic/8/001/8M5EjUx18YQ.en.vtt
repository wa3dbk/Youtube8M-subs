00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
actual game comes out some of it I

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.220 
actual game comes out some of it I
already<00:00:16.800> know<00:00:17.130> will<00:00:17.609> not<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
already know will not be because it's a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.200 
already know will not be because it's a
programming<00:00:19.770> thing<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.520> takes<00:00:20.910> way<00:00:21.180> too

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
programming thing and it takes way too

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.980 
programming thing and it takes way too
long<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.689> fix<00:00:23.300> also<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.480> messing<00:00:24.960> with

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
long to fix also them messing with

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.200 
long to fix also them messing with
audible<00:00:25.619> system<00:00:26.130> that's<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.760> cause<00:00:26.910> big

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
audible system that's going to cause big

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.480 
audible system that's going to cause big
problems<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.800> see<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.010> already<00:00:29.189> has

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
problems and you can see it already has
