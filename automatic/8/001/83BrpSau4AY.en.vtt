00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.580
 I am to counter war against the fc 

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:07.560
 barcelona or extreme and I think that my 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.570
 virtues the speed and change of 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.810
 rhythm that if javi garcÃ­a del villarreal 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.700
 football club game of playmaker and 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.789
 I think that my virtues as a player 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.830
 they can be the last pass or 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.680
 combinations worth much amplitude 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.010
 to circulate the ball from one place to another 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.020
 let 's put balls between lines 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.410
 and that's very important because I think that 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.070
 do not 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.690
 to overcome the defense as it was 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.240
 Azerbaijan because it was a team that 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.400
 I was very very together and 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.010
 and play between playmaker and so that the 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.880
 midfielder open brava both I think that 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.250
 yes, I would highlight the depth 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.920
 I do not understand the good bands 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.270
 two goals were played by him that the 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.970
 second of mine I practically had to 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.130
 push her because I did everything he and the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.860
 first of equal well made a play 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.420
 well it was I do not know how many rivals and I know the 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.830
 gave to define what I think is 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.470
 a very good impression and it is a 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.229
 of the co is one of the things more 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.540
 magnificent by the maximum hoop what all 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.300
 our people want what we are 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.369
 chosen to be here and nothing else 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.490
 it will be the same as the physical we are something more 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.020
 tired is also normal that they were going 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.080
 losing them come on they have to go to 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.700
 for the match more than the first part 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.440
 but well I think we missed the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.200
 party control during 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.119
 a lot of time and went I am I think that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.180
 yes that is a plus not always play in 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.060
 house in your house with your people but I think 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.530
 that we will go for the game 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.390
 at the moment we have not seen any video 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.360
 from bulgaria but I guess he will tell us 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.370
 the keys to them and I guess 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.560
 and we won the game pretty much 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.090
 trust because you start as standing the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
 championship that's always important 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.710
 because if you start losing you 're going to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.180
 tow for more matches and so 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.310
 we depend on ourselves 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.630
 to continue winning that is very 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.920
 important that we transmit not only 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.880
 footballily if not you personally 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.500
 that it is not all all all together 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.780
 it is a goal between the field we are 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.640
 all friends like outside and every time we go 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.160
 knowing more each time we are coming 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.730
 more times together and that shows inside 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.730
 from the countryside too
