00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.320
 on the wave of success achieved by galant vr-4 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.520
 World Rally Championship 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.530
 in 1990, mitsubishi decide for 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.830
 further success will require new 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.260
 platform for this purpose engineers 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.979
 corporations took a proven transmission 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.200
 from galant 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.050
 and used her lightweight and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.460
 a shortened version of the highway lancer as well 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.460
 it appeared 1 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.660
 September 92 to December 93 was 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.660
 production of the first model started 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:01.170
 apple in this period was suggested 5000 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.170
 cars in two trim levels 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.290
 on and Valya did not stand liter 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.710
 turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.660
 transmission from galant vr-4 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.450
 with regard to a complete set of the rally 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.890
 sport or simply rs was trimmed 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.990
 rally car version 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.660
 so there was no electric 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.450
 windows Power Seat 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.490
 and without rear-window wiper 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.290
 but there were wheels on stamping that 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.100
 allowed to reduce weight by 70 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.110
 kilograms compared to the gsr version 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.360
 evolution in the gsr configuration was 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.550
 more civil cars as I had 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.240
 additional options for everyday 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.240
 city ​​ride 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:57.120
 as for the engine, the heart of the car 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.670
 there was 4 g 63 giving out 250 horsepower 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.680
 and 306 newton meters of torque 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.660
 that along with all-wheel drive 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:12.060
 turned into an indispensable attribute 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:15.920
 evolution to succeed lancer 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.940
 evolution one december 93 arrived ev2 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.690
 produced from now on 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.959
 January 1995 major difference 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.910
 which has become improved manageability 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.800
 although the highway and one applied in 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.870
 second and even third generation 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.900
 evolution 2 get the wheelbase 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.860
 grown by 10 millimeters also rose 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.000
 both necklaces 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.959
 The reason was the use of more wide 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.519
 aerodynamic tricks such as 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.620
 front spoiler with 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.239
 additional rear provided 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.840
 greater handling on high 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.850
 speeds 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.950
 mitsubishi and decided to increase power 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.610
 each subsequent lancer models 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.510
 evolution 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.310
 and this trend began with his second 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.019
 the pressure on the oak was also increased 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.140
 changes were made to reduce 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.530
 exhaust backpressure power 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.430
 engine 4g and 63 rose to 260 forces 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:13.250
 torque up to three 110 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:17.840
 also the weight of 1247 kilograms gsr and 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.840
 1179 kilogram rs version 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.370
 speed on asphalt steadily increased 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.530
 so the priorities are lancer evolution 3 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.060
 steel reducing aerodynamic 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.400
 lift power and great efficiency 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.259
 cooling 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.880
 enlarged te wing front overhang with 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.669
 vents for 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.210
 brake cooling and expansion thresholds 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.120
 auto 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.039
 here is a list of its improvements 3 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.830
 tradition motor power was also 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:51.000
 increased auto was granted in 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.400
 January 1995 and at the same moment 5000 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.330
 copies were sold out by lancer 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.250
 evolution 3 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.979
 looked serious thanks to the new 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.860
 new ones appeared on the nose mole 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.990
 side skirts and rear spoiler grew for 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.630
 even more drag lifting 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.180
 power under the hood was new 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.550
 new turbocharging system 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.970
 exhaust system and increased compression 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.930
 allowed to squeeze out 10 more horses 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.630
 cosmetic front of the car 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.330
 got more aggressive look was 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.169
 extended grille it gave 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.030
 better cooling intercooler and motor 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.789
 torque remained unchanged for 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.400
 except for high speeds rs and gsr 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.650
 still used a five-step 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.120
 mechanics 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.509
 interior innovations were limited 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:44.940
 new driving mom and cloth river hand gsr 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:47.370
 Versions from January 1995 to August 1996 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.819
 7 thousand copies sold out 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.009
 lancer evolution 3 thus its 3 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:56.099
 became the best-selling generation to 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:58.229
 By the time the first three put it 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.460
 the beginning of one of the most popular series 

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:03.919
 sports cars 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.919
 but the real popularity was still waiting
