00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.579
 hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.260
 this season 2 of poke and theories and 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.640
 yes you did not expect I had 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.360
 need to take a break regarding 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.280
 this series 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.750
 following many critics who 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.430
 had demoralized me but good to him 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750
 today it does not go over go 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.460
 today we meet to talk 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.050
 mecas evolution always in 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.940
 the world of pokemon video games 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.829
 we will therefore tackle today a 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.809
 theory that explains the origins of 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.129
 mails to evolution then we know 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.659
 all the operation of the mega 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.699
 evolution it is enough that the trainer his 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.379
 harmony with his pokemon and that they him 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.750
 post a mega I like own to 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.640
 some species of pokemon it does not take 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.289
 not to forget the mega bracelet that will remain 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.479
 permanently on the arm of the trainer 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.970
 for his pokemon then this mega evolved 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.890
 so the mega I like and megan or go 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.539
 allow certain types of pokemon to 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.580
 become even more balÃ¨ze is more 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:15.259
 imposing these new forms does not change 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.789
 not only the appearance of pokemon 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.140
 it allows them to become a lot 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.979
 more powerful especially at the level of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.720
 their statistics 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.670
 note that these evolutions are 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 temporary and can only be used 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.490
 in the middle of a fight 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.039
 several mega evolutions are 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.590
 available mega dracaufeu my 14 years 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.909
 mega jump kouamÃ© gallery rapeseed mega mega 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.340
 are not there in the film it's 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.170
 true it does not exist but then why 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.840
 only certain pokemon species 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.369
 can mega evolved why not 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.219
 able to make my guys evolve all 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.399
 pokemon is the question we ask ourselves 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.159
 all I will try during this episode 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.840
 to explain it to you 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.600
 early mega evolution with tears 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.509
 supreme this 3000 year old weapon that we 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.640
 was revealed with generation x and y 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.530
 this weapon was basically a machine 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.020
 to give life back or pokemon 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.090
 this machine was created by the king to z 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.189
 to revive his pokemon flow 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.190
 is that they were killed during the 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.579
 war to z managed to revive his 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.230
 pokemon and decided before gif louette in 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.750
 transforming the machine 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 weapon to end the war but to 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.989
 what price 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.319
 the weapon transformed many pokemon into 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.940
 stone and chrome stone loicq thanks 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.440
 to plane teachers we know that 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.510
 the mega genes come from this weapon 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.120
 since it is made of the same material 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.090
 and we also know that this weapon 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.910
 absorb the energy of pokemon and if that 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.680
 had to do with the fact that 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.590
 only certain pokemon species 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.959
 then this mega evolved and if these were the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.060
 pokemon in the energy honor was 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.390
 emptied because of tears that can 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.400
 now mega evolved for example if my 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.379
 guy at the carnage exists is because 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.000
 some to the carnage were killed during 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.290
 the war being absorbed by tears 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.540
 the same for the sluggish dracaufire tank 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.010
 etc. 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.859
 but that does not fully answer 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.030
 all our questions 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.200
 how is it that there are several 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.349
 kinds of my guys i like 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.690
 for example there I like to have there I like x 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.220
 well we know thanks to the genetics of 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.440
 humans that can also apply to 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.380
 that of pokemon that chromosomes x 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.829
 represents that of the girls and the one 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.690
 boys 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.209
 so we can assume that he had 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.400
 a lot of evil charizard who were 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.340
 absorbed then reduced to the state of my 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.010
 paychecks ny have dracs to females in 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.840
 the state of the mega gene x to finish 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.299
 when the machine ended the war 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760
 that took place by launching energy 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.859
 pure this scattered this energy a little 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.799
 everywhere that over the centuries is 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.049
 become a mega I love another mystery 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.639
 plane above a to z and apparently 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.319
 nobody talks about it 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:53.389
 this story happened 3,000 ago 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.220
 years how come it is 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.810
 still alive this ancient king well 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.389
 we can assume that with all the energy 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.400
 pokemon mistakenly absorbed when 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.769
 launched his machine his body mutated 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.239
 that's why it's so three meters 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.120
 from high and why they seem 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.099
 immortal to conclude when at z to 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.810
 use tears supreme and absorb 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.160
 the vital energy of some pokemons 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.810
 sometimes with different sex 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.700
 he created unintentionally energy 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.910
 pure which has subsequently transformed 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.830
 in mega I like mega gen represents 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.410
 the energy of the pokemon balls that have 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.830
 succumbed and x the energy of the pokemon 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.840
 females well when a mega pokemon 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.080
 evolves the colossal force that deploys 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.310
 actually comes from his ancestors 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.900
 that's all for this episode I you 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.370
