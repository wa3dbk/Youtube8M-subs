 "Dietary Treatment of COPD" 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.210
 One hundred and twenty patients with COPD were randomly divided into two groups. 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.170
 Half was said to increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.210
 the other half should remain with their previous meals. 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.510
 The intervention group was told to eat at least one portion 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.420
 fruits or vegetables more daily. 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.239
 The participants stayed there for three years. 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.189
 They ate more fruits and vegetables than the control group. 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.910
 Here's the control group. 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.119
 Slowly but surely their condition worsened. 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.310
 This is commonly the case with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema). 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.310
 The condition worsens and worsens when the disease kills you. 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.120
 The group that was supposed to eat at least one more fruit or vegetable per day 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.340
 it was the same at the beginning but there was no deterioration during the study. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.130
 One year, two years, three years. 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.830
 Rather, their lungs began to work a little better again. 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.440
 But it does not work, their condition should have deteriorated. 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.860
 The cause could be the antioxidant effects of fruits and vegetables. 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.060
 It could also be anti-inflammatory, but honestly, 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.899
 nor did it have to be fruits or vegetables. 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.569
 When you eat more, you usually also eat something else less. 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.030
 For example, when adding fruits and vegetables to the diet, there may be a reduction 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.429
 consumption of meat, which is known to promote oxidation. 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.429
 In any case, there is now hope. 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.149
 These findings suggest that switching to a diet with higher food intake 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.340
 antioxidant-rich may be associated with better lung function. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.209
 As a result, there may be adjustments 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.840
 considered to be a means of alleviating COPD. 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.950
 The tobacco industry has seen these remarkable findings somewhat differently. 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.789
 It would not be easier for a person who wants to treat his emphysema to smoke an added cigarette 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.439
 fruits than adding fruits and vegetables to your diet? 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.700
 And it goes, the addition of acai berries to cigarettes 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.509
 had a protective effect against emphysema - in smoking mice. 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.890
 Next time he tries to add the berries to the meat. 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.850
 I can always rely on the Meat Science magazine. 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.750
 However, the addition of fruit extracts to hamburgers was free of hitch. 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.070
 The blackberries hamburger slices were downright colored with their bright mauve color. 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.100
 However, soaking the lamb in the kiwi juice before the posthumous stiffness arrives 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.620
 it obviously improves its fragility. 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.860
 It is also possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankfurter sausages by simply adding a powder 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.590
 of pomegranate seeds. But someone is 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.870
 complained that seeds can be seen in the final product by eye. 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.750
 And if anything about hot dog consumers 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.980
 we know that they are picky about what's going to end up in their food (irony).
