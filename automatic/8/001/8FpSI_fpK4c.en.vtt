in<00:00:32.940> Massachusetts<00:00:33.630> were<00:00:33.750> founded<00:00:34.340> originally

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
in Massachusetts were founded originally

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.279 
in Massachusetts were founded originally
by<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.239> pilgrims<00:00:36.629> and<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.899> streets<00:00:37.199> were

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
by the the pilgrims and the streets were

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:38.840 
by the the pilgrims and the streets were
laid<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.590> like<00:00:37.860> cow<00:00:38.039> pots<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.610> they're<00:00:38.699> not

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
laid out like cow pots and they're not

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569 
laid out like cow pots and they're not
exactly<00:00:39.270> symmetrical<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.800> therefore<00:00:41.190> most<00:00:41.430> of

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
exactly symmetrical so therefore most of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the states that we have are really

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.710 
the states that we have are really
narrow<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.530> tight

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720

apparatus<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.120> stuck<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.570> historical

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.780 
apparatus so we're stuck with historical
regulations<00:00:52.680> they<00:00:53.220> don't<00:00:53.400> want<00:00:53.610> the

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
structures changed in any way so we have

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.190 
structures changed in any way so we have
a<00:00:56.520> big<00:00:56.760> issue<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.120> keeping<00:00:57.810> these<00:00:57.930> trucks

a big fan of the three section ladders

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.270 
a big fan of the three section ladders
that's<00:02:04.500> why<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:04.890> them<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.099> the<00:02:05.159> outside

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that's why we put them on the outside

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.010 
that's why we put them on the outside
there's<00:02:05.759> another<00:02:06.000> one<00:02:06.179> in<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> torque<00:02:06.630> box<00:02:06.840> as

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
there's another one in the torque box as

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.529 
there's another one in the torque box as
well<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.670> all<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.880> trucks<00:02:09.149> are<00:02:09.239> pretty<00:02:09.420> much

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.180 
they have over 2000 labs MIT alone this
particular<00:03:28.600> truck<00:03:28.960> is<00:03:29.020> a<00:03:29.590> different<00:03:30.010> style

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
particular truck is a different style

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.250 
particular truck is a different style
it's<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.490> puck<00:03:30.700> has<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.090> lot<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.360> compensation

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
it's a puck has a lot of compensation

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.630 
it's a puck has a lot of compensation
because<00:03:32.380> these<00:03:32.530> people<00:03:32.860> do<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> lot<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.190> hazmat

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
because these people do a lot of hazmat

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.910 
because these people do a lot of hazmat
so<00:03:33.820> therefore<00:03:34.150> they<00:03:34.270> carry<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.600> lot<00:03:34.840> of<00:03:34.990> extra

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
so therefore they carry a lot of extra

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.330 
so therefore they carry a lot of extra
equipment<00:03:36.130> that's<00:03:36.580> not<00:03:37.510> only<00:03:37.920> for<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.010> normal

along with the new ladder replacement
we're<00:04:25.360> trying<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.630> keep<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:26.050> fleet<00:04:26.740> in<00:04:26.770> good<00:04:27.460> age

we're trying to keep a fleet in good age

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.810 
we're trying to keep a fleet in good age
and<00:04:27.940> swap<00:04:28.330> them<00:04:28.510> out<00:04:28.660> in<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:29.800> reasonable<00:04:30.490> amount
