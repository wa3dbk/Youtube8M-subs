bit about how to paint you might have

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.980 
bit about how to paint you might have
noticed<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:17.060> sometimes<00:00:18.060> when<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.690> use<00:00:18.750> the

noticed that sometimes when you use the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.580 
noticed that sometimes when you use the
cold<00:00:19.230> room<00:00:20.270> some<00:00:21.270> liquid<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.960> spawn<00:00:22.410> on

cold room some liquid like this spawn on
top<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:24.260> goes<00:00:25.260> out<00:00:25.800> or<00:00:27.500> something<00:00:28.500> like

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
top of it and goes out or something like

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.310 
top of it and goes out or something like
this<00:00:29.269> but<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.390> goes<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.630> elastics<00:00:31.019> in<00:00:31.170> your

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
this but it goes up elastics in your

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.180 
this but it goes up elastics in your
roof<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.710> this<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> person<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.820> rely

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.280 

and<00:00:38.640> attaint<00:00:40.520> can<00:00:41.520> spread<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.150> world<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.630> if

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
and attaint can spread in world and if

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.600 
and attaint can spread in world and if
you<00:00:43.380> have<00:00:43.740> enough<00:00:44.130> of<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.610> volumes

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
you have enough of it you get volumes

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.910 
you have enough of it you get volumes
like<00:00:47.880> this<00:00:49.310> so<00:00:50.450> this<00:00:51.450> is<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.660> shape<00:00:51.870> he<00:00:52.800> will

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
like this so this is a shape he will

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.970 
like this so this is a shape he will
attack<00:00:53.130> me<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.840> chicken<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.290> the<00:00:55.620> pig<00:00:55.770> tube

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
attack me the chicken and the pig tube

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.540 
attack me the chicken and the pig tube
and<00:00:56.390> we<00:00:57.390> will<00:00:57.630> attack<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.230> room<00:00:58.350> ops<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:59.400> can

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and we will attack and room ops you can

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.500 
and we will attack and room ops you can
also<00:00:59.700> get<00:00:59.940> some<00:01:00.000> bits<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.570> things<00:01:00.750> like<00:01:00.960> that

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
also get some bits and things like that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.020 
also get some bits and things like that
nicely<00:01:03.710> chilly<00:01:04.710> little<00:01:04.920> past<00:01:05.520> one<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:08.030> it's

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
nicely chilly little past one and it's

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
nicely chilly little past one and it's
tries<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.140> morph<00:01:10.350> me<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.710> them<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
tries to morph me into them but it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.990 
tries to morph me into them but it
doesn't<00:01:11.970> work<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.390> good

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
doesn't work it's good

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.130 
doesn't work it's good
so<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.259> battle<00:01:16.369> taint<00:01:17.369> oh<00:01:17.690> I<00:01:18.690> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:18.990> try

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so to battle taint oh I want to try

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.340 
so to battle taint oh I want to try
something<00:01:19.350> oh<00:01:20.330> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.450> share<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.720> wall<00:01:22.050> from<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
something oh you can share a wall from a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
something oh you can share a wall from a
tainted<00:01:22.590> shape<00:01:22.950> that's<00:01:23.520> cool

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.070 

but<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.960> battle<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.920> need<00:01:32.100> ever<00:01:32.370> bloom<00:01:33.080> it

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
but to battle it you need ever bloom it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.080 
but to battle it you need ever bloom it
grows<00:01:34.410> up<00:01:34.440> like<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:37.610> Anglo's<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.990> will

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
grows up like this Anglo's and it will

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.640 
grows up like this Anglo's and it will
remove<00:01:42.090> taint<00:01:42.480> from<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.650> reactive<00:01:44.610> state<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.530> if

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
remove taint from a reactive state so if

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.860 
remove taint from a reactive state so if
I<00:01:49.740> place<00:01:50.070> down<00:01:50.370> some<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.910> these<00:01:51.150> here<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
I place down some of these here and the

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.429 
I place down some of these here and the
weight

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.359 

don't<00:01:57.979> see<00:01:58.250> what<00:01:58.400> happens<00:01:59.680> this<00:02:00.680> is<00:02:00.740> probably

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
don't see what happens this is probably

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.140 
don't see what happens this is probably
overkill<00:02:03.220> but<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.250> will<00:02:04.549> pause<00:02:04.759> for<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:05.090> while

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
overkill but I will pause for a while

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.680 
overkill but I will pause for a while
and<00:02:05.450> see<00:02:06.110> how<00:02:07.040> it<00:02:07.100> looks

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
and see how it looks

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.449 
and see how it looks
so<00:02:08.690> now<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:09.080> waited<00:02:09.880> like<00:02:10.959> two<00:02:11.959> minutes<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.459> all

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
so now I waited like two minutes and all

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.850 
so now I waited like two minutes and all
over<00:02:13.700> taint<00:02:14.030> here<00:02:14.540> is<00:02:14.690> gone<00:02:14.840> or<00:02:15.080> most<00:02:15.650> of<00:02:15.770> it

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
over taint here is gone or most of it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.080 
over taint here is gone or most of it
anyway<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.600> it's<00:02:17.600> quite<00:02:17.720> effective<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.090> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
anyway so it's quite effective and the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.290 
anyway so it's quite effective and the
range<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.080> works<00:02:21.319> on<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.910> light<00:02:26.090> you

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
range that it works on is the light you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.330 
range that it works on is the light you
see<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.860> all<00:02:28.040> way<00:02:28.760> out<00:02:28.970> here<00:02:29.410> it<00:02:30.410> will<00:02:30.800> work<00:02:31.100> and

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
see so all way out here it will work and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.410 
see so all way out here it will work and
that's<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.390> tentacle<00:02:33.380> thing<00:02:34.209> let's<00:02:35.209> sleep

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that's a tentacle thing let's sleep

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:45.759 
that's a tentacle thing let's sleep
created<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:44.060> when<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.870> walk<00:02:45.050> around<00:02:45.230> on<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
created so when you walk around on the

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.270 
created so when you walk around on the
tainted<00:02:46.100> round<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.930> will<00:02:48.050> get<00:02:48.280> attained

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
tainted round you will get attained

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.880 
tainted round you will get attained
effect<00:02:49.610> after<00:02:49.760> a<00:02:49.970> while<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.269> you<00:02:50.870> will<00:02:51.110> get

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
effect after a while and you will get

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.199 
effect after a while and you will get
hurt<00:02:53.140> by<00:02:54.140> flux<00:02:54.440> state<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:57.910> craft<00:02:58.910> these

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
hurt by flux state and to craft these

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:06.520 
hurt by flux state and to craft these
flowers<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:02.510> will<00:03:02.600> need<00:03:04.000> these<00:03:05.000> flowers<00:03:05.530> but

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
flowers you will need these flowers but

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.680 
flowers you will need these flowers but
if<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:07.010> hit<00:03:07.160> them<00:03:07.340> with<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> sword<00:03:08.329> or<00:03:08.510> anything

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
if you hit them with a sword or anything

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.660 
if you hit them with a sword or anything
else<00:03:09.380> or<00:03:10.630> almost<00:03:11.630> anything<00:03:11.900> else

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.990 

we<00:03:15.300> will<00:03:15.569> just<00:03:15.930> drop<00:03:16.260> Quicksilver<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.280> you

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
we will just drop Quicksilver and you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.990 
we will just drop Quicksilver and you
don't<00:03:18.180> want<00:03:18.330> Quicksilver<00:03:19.340> let's<00:03:20.340> don't

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
don't want Quicksilver let's don't

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.760
