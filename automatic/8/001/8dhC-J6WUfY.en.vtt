the<00:01:04.140> solution<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.710> about<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> minute<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.400> think

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the solution for about a minute I think

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.810 
the solution for about a minute I think
it<00:01:05.970> gets<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.540> bit<00:01:07.229> thicker<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:08.700> a

and blue bio putty solution doesn't get

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.389 
and blue bio putty solution doesn't get
used<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.390> simply<00:01:52.140> works<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> catalyst<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
used up it simply works as a catalyst to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:01.569 
used up it simply works as a catalyst to
turn<00:01:53.610> bio<00:01:53.850> color<00:01:54.210> paint<00:01:54.600> into<00:01:55.170> bio<00:01:55.350> putty<00:02:00.500> you
