I<00:02:17.640> mean<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.750> applications<00:02:19.439> are<00:02:19.590> endless<00:02:19.620> it's

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
I mean the applications are endless it's

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.339 
I mean the applications are endless it's
it's<00:02:20.400> quite<00:02:20.580> actually<00:02:21.090> just<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.930> spectacular
