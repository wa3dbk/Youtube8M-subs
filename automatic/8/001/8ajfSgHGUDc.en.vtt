00:00:39.840 --> 00:01:01.490 

Oh

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:31.040 

this<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.680> the<00:01:02.769> person<00:01:09.060> and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.940 

you<00:01:32.050> can<00:01:32.620> still<00:01:32.830> see<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.470> same<00:01:35.650> thing<00:01:35.830> you

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
you can still see the same thing you

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.460 
you can still see the same thing you
know<00:01:36.070> narcissism<00:01:36.760> and<00:01:37.120> here<00:01:37.390> not<00:01:37.570> so<00:01:38.050> if<00:01:38.230> you

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
know narcissism and here not so if you

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.070 
know narcissism and here not so if you
can<00:01:38.680> see<00:01:39.040> we<00:01:39.370> prove<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.690> other<00:01:40.840> one

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
can see we prove that the the other one

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.070 
can see we prove that the the other one
is<00:01:41.260> much<00:01:41.530> more<00:01:41.850> powerful<00:01:42.850> faster<00:01:43.420> and<00:01:43.930> then

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
is much more powerful faster and then

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.969 
is much more powerful faster and then
removes<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.830> polishing<00:01:45.520> polish<00:01:46.180> surface<00:01:47.080> to
