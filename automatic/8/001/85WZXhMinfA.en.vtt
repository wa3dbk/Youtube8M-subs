00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and before I did that my hair red my

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.960 
and before I did that my hair red my
hair<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.090> gold<00:00:28.130> golden<00:00:29.130> honey<00:00:29.310> color<00:00:29.730> right

hair was a gold golden honey color right

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.450 
hair was a gold golden honey color right
so<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.720> wasn't<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.529> dark<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> start

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
so it wasn't really that dark to start

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.209 
so it wasn't really that dark to start
off<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.600> wouldn't<00:00:33.809> know<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
off so I really wouldn't know if it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.100 
off so I really wouldn't know if it
would<00:00:35.630> do<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.870> justice<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.430> had<00:00:38.610> dark<00:00:38.910> hair

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
would do it justice if you had dark hair

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
would do it justice if you had dark hair
but<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.350> know<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.739> would<00:00:40.980> do<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.190> justice<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

your hair party this color but with a
more<00:00:49.110> pink<00:00:49.469> based<00:00:49.950> on<00:00:50.219> Emmett<00:00:50.670> because<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
more pink based on Emmett because this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
more pink based on Emmett because this
one<00:00:52.199> has<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.860> an<00:00:53.039> orange<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> really

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
one has more of an orange like a really

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.049 
one has more of an orange like a really
deep<00:00:54.390> orange<00:00:55.020> tone<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.559> right<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.820> I

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
deep orange tone to it right like I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.990 
deep orange tone to it right like I
really<00:00:57.390> take<00:00:57.660> pictures<00:00:58.289> with<00:00:59.280> flash<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.910> my

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
really take pictures with flash and my

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630 
really take pictures with flash and my
hair<00:01:00.180> would<00:01:00.329> come<00:01:00.539> out<00:01:00.570> with<00:01:01.289> orange<00:01:01.920> tones<00:01:02.309> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
hair would come out with orange tones it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
hair would come out with orange tones it
look<00:01:02.760> more<00:01:02.940> probably<00:01:03.539> more<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.930> Shred<00:01:04.379> than<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
look more probably more on Shred than it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
look more probably more on Shred than it
more<00:01:05.309> than<00:01:05.489> anything<00:01:05.700> that's<00:01:06.299> really

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
more than anything that's really

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.570 
more than anything that's really
something<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.409> don't<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> that's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
something that I don't like and that's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.100 
something that I don't like and that's
probably<00:01:08.880> why<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.210> reason<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.720> won't<00:01:09.900> be

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
probably why the reason I won't be

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
probably why the reason I won't be
wearing<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.680> buying<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.430> again<00:01:11.760> unless<00:01:12.270> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
wearing it buying it again unless it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.649 
wearing it buying it again unless it
really<00:01:12.990> does<00:01:13.200> keep<00:01:13.409> my<00:01:13.590> hair<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.580> losing<00:01:15.479> its

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
really does keep my hair from losing its

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.859 
really does keep my hair from losing its
color<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.740> month<00:01:16.979> like<00:01:17.509> like<00:01:18.509> after<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869

month my hair is still like a really
vibrant<00:01:20.400> red<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.299> obviously<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.869> will<00:01:22.110> be

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
vibrant red and obviously I will be

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.410 
vibrant red and obviously I will be
buying<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.650> again<00:01:22.740> because<00:01:23.310> most<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> time

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
buying it again because most the time

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
buying it again because most the time
when<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.930> red<00:01:25.140> hair<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> die

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
when you have red hair you have to die

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700 
when you have red hair you have to die
at<00:01:26.460> least<00:01:26.640> once<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.540> month<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.680> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
at least once a month you know what I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.590 
at least once a month you know what I
mean<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.030> awesome<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.479> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
mean so if it would be awesome if I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.120 
mean so if it would be awesome if I
could<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.869> dye<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.049> once<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.590> month<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.070> I

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
could just dye it once a month and I

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130 
could just dye it once a month and I
have<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.490> die<00:01:32.610> for<00:01:32.670> probably<00:01:33.570> like<00:01:33.659> two<00:01:33.869> months

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
