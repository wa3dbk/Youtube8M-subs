boiled and they're ready to be taken out
you<00:02:07.810> can<00:02:07.840> pour<00:02:08.170> it<00:02:08.200> into<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.560> strainer<00:02:08.950> or<00:02:09.280> you

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
you can pour it into a strainer or you

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.040 
you can pour it into a strainer or you
can<00:02:09.520> take<00:02:09.700> them<00:02:09.819> out<00:02:09.910> gently<00:02:10.360> with<00:02:10.569> some<00:02:10.720> songs

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
can take them out gently with some songs

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.500 
can take them out gently with some songs
the<00:02:11.950> reason<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.400> don't<00:02:12.520> pour<00:02:13.180> them<00:02:13.300> into<00:02:13.390> a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
the reason that I don't pour them into a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.910 
the reason that I don't pour them into a
strainer<00:02:13.840> is<00:02:14.110> because<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.349> potato<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.770> can

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
strainer is because the potato you can

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.979 
strainer is because the potato you can
crash<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.430> can<00:02:15.640> fall<00:02:15.790> apart<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.870> just

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
crash and can fall apart so you just

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.690 
crash and can fall apart so you just
want<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.290> gentle<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.010> take<00:02:18.220> them<00:02:18.370> out<00:02:18.550> and

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
want to be gentle and take them out and

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.360 
want to be gentle and take them out and
put<00:02:18.760> them<00:02:19.030> aside<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.390> cool<00:02:20.040> ok<00:02:21.040> now<00:02:21.220> your

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370
