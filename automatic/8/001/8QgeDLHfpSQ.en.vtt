00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Welcome to Jojo dear 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.390
 sports friend to a weapons guide 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.040
 I grew up with this ghost 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.650
 Let's look at what's on the eye 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.559
 has what your characteristics are and must be 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.120
 your strengths and your weaknesses are 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.550
 many love the eye from battlefield 3 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.500
 but battlefield 4 has a lot 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.900
 changed and the eye is no longer 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.519
 what it once was and why I 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.019
 personally will never use them again 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.060
 until she is brought, I'll tell you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.859
 in this video first we look 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.320
 to us briefly the characteristics on the 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.300
 viewpoint com at 700 shot the minutes 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.360
 she is in the bottom third 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 with regard to the rate of fire a supplement 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 that's why 25 seconds a year is okay 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.370
 or 3.1 if the weapon is completely empty 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.140
 shot 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.399
 and now we come to the conclusion 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.329
 and there we see the big one 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.309
 problem 0.35 to the left 025 to the right 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.710
 that means the weapon wobbles pretty much 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.500
 strong back and forth when you shoot and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.180
 a first multiplier of 2.4 that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.070
 means the travel right angry up 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 that's not all that great 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.809
 and now on top of that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.460
 the aok the typical bullet stranded from 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.320
 0.25 has 0 2 at the first shot 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.630
 And that 's the problem the eye is 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.189
 just not very accurate if you are so 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 shoot then you will notice like that 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.680
 weapon wobbles sideways and on larger ones 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.369
 Distances you will notice that they are the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.549
 tig is inaccurate as a normal assault rifle 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.920
 for comparison, the cz 08 15 also 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.140
 with 700 shot the minute shoots 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.780
 much better accuracy values ​​like 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.210
 less lateral wobble and the first 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.250
 shot is always more accurate where is there 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.299
 Justice 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.549
 Okay, let's have a look 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.409
 single benefits to those too 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.079
 has against a normal assault rifle 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.899
 sprinkle the first to the better ball 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.520
 when shooting from the hip you are called 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.070
 can opponents on longer distances 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.329
 effectively switch off while you're out of the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.740
 hip shoots with normal 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.189
 storm rifles not necessarily possible 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.860
 is 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.170
 The second advantage is that you are 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 laterally 50 percent so one and a half times 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.560
 moves faster when over and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.490
 grain goal than with a normal one 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.770
 assault rifle 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.020
 why is that an advantage quite simple 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.750
 if you move sideways 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.370
 you your opponent to meet you and the 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.069
 Probability that you are the pre-fight 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 wins but do not forget that 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.860
 that only with the once zoom optics 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.000
 that means we are 3 4 times 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.380
 zoom as she has then he loses this 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.760
 so to the weaken and strengthen times short 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.890
 So we have one 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.260
 relatively low rate of fire and one 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.670
 relatively inaccurate weapon but one 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.069
 very good ball scattering from the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.530
 shoot from the hip and of course the 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.420
 agility bonus that's what we look like 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.580
 let's take a look at which of the touch menzes we use 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.680
 the advantages of the court 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.480
 can bring and with what etta 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.130
 Reduce james for the disadvantages 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.299
 can 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.519
 we will be with the audi fell 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.330
 move sideways 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.049
 otherwise we would not 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.910
 I would say play or attack 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.319
 Hard run always have to be on it 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.989
 one of the two because both 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.540
 improve your accuracy while you 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.870
 goes sideways and that's what she's aiming for 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.340
 that's very important that's what she means 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 for example, a combination of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.510
 heavy running and angled handle 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.769
 will the heavy run yours 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.140
 accuracy 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.030
 when standing around and the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.070
 Angled grip for the first shot 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.510
 to criticize multiple card and to 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.870
 prevent the weapon from getting really angry 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.250
 pulls up after the first shot 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.780
 if you do not like the heavy run 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.959
 and he will not give you too much 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.670
 Conclusion to top you can do something 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.290
 others take for example the 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.530
 muzzle fire damper or even the 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:44.280
 muzzle brake and vertical handle 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.959
 thanks to another green reader around 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.420
 your accuracy from half to 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.519
 To further improve and make a look 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.650
 your choice so with the setup you can 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.660
 actually something tear especially 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.130
 At medium distances I would say 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.560
 the augurs also about 30 meters and 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.120
 why because you can opponents 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.230
 Shoot while being moved sideways 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.540
 you can still meet her 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.520
 you know if you are sideways 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.120
 then moves your accuracy flutes 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.620
 so it's not that great anymore but at 30 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.180
 meter you meet her for 7 more 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.810
 problems to meet you here wins 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.060
 But that's real 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.060
 the only distance to the never really 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.880
 is good and there is also not so 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.590
 great because of the low fire rate and 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.500
 there is the added that if her 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.090
 she uses her very large one 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.370
 disadvantage has against everything faster 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.780
 freedom as the eyes and of course 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.850
 also found against dirt and so on 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.530
 and so on 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.750
 There are simply better options 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.130
 with the farmers with the f2000 with the l 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.870
 85 a 2 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.810
 these are also all bull hobbes 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.510
 and all of them much better in the monastery 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.010
 on long distances you have too 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.900
 a problem because you can not 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.040
 more so fast back and forth so he can 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.020
 of course moving 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.480
 but because the accuracy is worse 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.830
 will not you meet anything more yes 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.660
 40 50 meters could forget it 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.730
 there are all the other storm rifles 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.860
 and partly also machine guns 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.280
 advantage for example the ak 12 a 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:19.050
 absolute laser the cow bz 95 also one 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:22.070
 laser the sgm 416 m 16 4 all weapons 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.140
 are on distance better than the eye 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.930
 because the eye is as said not very 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.030
 Exactly even if you stand so you see 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.310
 what the problem is is the eye 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.650
 actually only good on very specific 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:39.390
 distances between 25 and 30 40 meters 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.940
 underneath it does not have the unnecessary 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.730
 fire rate to fight against other weapons like the 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.650
 from 2000 or the aek to exist and 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.020
 above or beyond from behind 40 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.810
 Meters have the problem that others 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.250
 weapons are just a lot and that's 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.780
 my personal reason why i use the 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.270
 eyes will not play anymore 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.940
 because these firefights around 30 m 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.620
 you have to either play in it 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.480
 one flanks the opponents carefully 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.380
 and certain consequences avoid right 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.390
 or by chance but often you have it 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.080
 also opponents to do at ten meters 20 m 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.350
 40 50 meters and so on and so forth 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.540
 that is 30 meters is rather the exception 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.820
 and most of the time struggled with opponents 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.100
 On distances that are not ideal for the 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.980
 eyes are and then you have the problem 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.740
 this is the problem with what you are 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.240
 I did not tell other assault rifles 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.820
 you do not mind the eye is shit 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.650
 but she just has this problem and 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.590
 that's a big problem for me 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.300
 important problem and that's why I would 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.800
 I wish that there is an eye 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.080
 the number of a weapon is the number 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.260
 I want to fire 700 shots a minute 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.400
 wish they were much more accurate 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.169
 because then she would not have one more 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.390
 small niche but would also whether 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:55.910
 medium to long distances effectively 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.590
 here could move through the side and 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.630
 fight against for longer distances 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.200
 while having a problem you too 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.600
 to meet 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.510
 I think that would be a suitable balance 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.210
 for a vulva poppe 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.890
 with 700 shot the sports friends me 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.120
 I hope you enjoyed the review 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.930
 have a bit of my opinion here 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.150
 given to it 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.310
 but I would be interested too 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:18.040
 what you think of it, if we have the orgy 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.720
 ever plays and we find that 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.820
 now how do you say so no longer so great 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.690
 is like in battlefield 3 he writes 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.130
 but in the comments 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.490
 Thank you for watching until the 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.490
 next time
