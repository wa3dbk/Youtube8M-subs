00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 as I told you this book is about 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.160
 Intelligence of couples understood 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.619
 by couples who have made a commitment 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.950
 to live together is at home or you live in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.910
 houses 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.150
 is the commitment is the project of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.990
 live in a loving relationship 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.829
 Erotically founded and with or without children 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.329
 but we had to use the idea 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.890
 of intelligence that we handle in all 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.660
 our rivers 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.930
 we have a part of the intelligence that 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.690
 is what generates our occurrences 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.070
 our feelings our desires and 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.629
 we have a second part that is the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 executive part that is the one in charge 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.239
 to do projects 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.449
 in this chapter he has a very clear motto 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.390
 the generating intelligence falls in love 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.550
 that we can not do anything but it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.129
 house executive intelligence because 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.290
 to marry or maintain relationships or 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.020
 living together is no longer an occurrence 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.409
 but it is a project and in this 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.830
 chapter what he explained is that it is a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.130
 draft 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.740
 because the project is not the same as a 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.000
 wish 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.460
 and it is the same as a daydream 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.900
 I remember a friend of mine who spent all 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.120
 his life protesting because there was no 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.830
 could have a sailing ship 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.380
 and since I knew I had money to 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.970
 bought I asked him and why not until 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 the good start is not that actually 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.540
 I thought it was going to be very 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.060
 complicated to keep what will not have 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 time to navigate had stayed with 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 the idea of ​​a desire that had never 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.730
 tried to put into practice and that without 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.100
 But he had left him a species like 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.660
 of disappointment but how are you going to 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.560
 be disappointed in a desire that a 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.409
 you try to put into practice 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.450
 daydreams daydreams are 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.670
 a kind of anticipation of a future 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.220
 what is done but eliminating all 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.140
 real difficulties one can dream that 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.860
 he is president of the government 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:12.190
 famous bullfighter month and no that's a teaches 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.390
 but you train yourself not the association 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.090
 is that he is a great doctor sheen after 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.030
 he studies medicine, there is no need to distinguish 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.420
 that a project is when I anticipate 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.940
 of the future but decided to do what 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.530
 possible for that future to be realized 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.780
 while the wishes and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.180
 daydreams are a state of 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.690
 diffuse anticipation that will not lead 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.530
 never to action 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.030
 that is not worth us who try 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.240
 maintain relationships based on 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.630
 a reverie is going to be wrong and who 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.790
 try to found them only in a vague 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.180
 I wish it was also received that the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.020
 project is a way to deliver the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.310
 control of my action 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.220
 to a goal that is anticipated and that is going 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.210
 to demand that I put myself in good shape 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:08.710
 to realize that goal when 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:11.260
 when a painter wants to paint first 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.770
 is trained to paint because if not 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.250
 is going to be a good painter when an athlete 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.980
 wants to run well a dancer wants 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.100
 dance well that's your project and 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.200
 that project requires that you train or in 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.700
 the case of the dancer who exercises 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.250
 of bars to acquire lightness 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.700
 good whenever we want to make a 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
 draft 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.250
 that project pulls us seduces us 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.710
 to ourselves from afar and 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.720
 awakens enough energies 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.710
 to get in good shape and this 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.710
 project changes
