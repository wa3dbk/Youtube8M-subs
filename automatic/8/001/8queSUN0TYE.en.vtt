 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 observer and today we will touch very 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 interesting topic in the world of peaks namely 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 Resident Evil Series 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.220
 cult game developed by the company 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.110
 capcom in 1996 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 turned the idea of ​​games in 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.430
 the horror genre at the moment number 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
 sold copies worldwide has passed 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.390
 as much as 46 million for me as a fan 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 series of films is very interesting topic 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.649
 viruses in the universe of the monastery a lot 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.000
 modifications and varieties of t-virus and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.960
 about this i wish you today 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.550
 tell so arrange yourself 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.550
 more comfortable and enjoyable 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.050
 originates from the virus of west africa 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.710
 and called virus ancestor discovered it was 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.660
 December 4, 1966 the lord of the whole 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.490
 Spencer This virus is contained in 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.890
 flowers called ladder to the sun 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.330
 and used in the rites of the depot tribe I 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.950
 by using this flower 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.560
 increases physical and mental 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.520
 indicators there are two types of virus 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.650
 ancestor and 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.600
 and ancestor b the first type of virus cannot 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.340
 connect with human dna and so 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.620
 a few days later a man dies a 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.420
 virus b can connect to genotype 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.440
 man but he is very strong 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.750
 affects mental activity 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.640
 turning carrier into useless vegetables 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.050
 next and most famous virus 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.300
 is you come 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.810
 also known as tyrant 2 rus was 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.729
 created by umbrella corporation in january 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.100
 1987 by James Markus as a result 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.020
 ancestor virus crossing and leech 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.520
 used corporation to create 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.860
 various forms of biological weapons 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.570
 The advantage of this virus is increased 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.700
 regeneration in the tissues of the body but 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.410
 a side effect was a lowering 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.540
 brain activity and most importantly 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.730
 cannibalism first appearance viruses 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.929
 held in the first part of the game on the plot 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.760
 games special squad special 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.290
 Destinations go to the mountains 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.880
 archway to investigate the strange 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.500
 disappearances another one 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.600
 invention corporation are 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.560
 modification of that virus jay virus 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.360
 which was created 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.519
 William Birkin is their main difference from 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.860
 its predecessor is that 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:26.480
 the virus had a short incubation period 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.310
 as well as the ability to be transmitted through 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.959
 saliva when bitten by virus carriers 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.790
 turns into huge scary 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.380
 monsters that exist with one 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.989
 aim to infect as many people as possible 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.310
 which similarity to his dna except games virus 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.709
 also appeared in the animated film 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.380
 Resident Evil in the birth of the next we 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.269
 listed and such a virus was created 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.950
 company not oombrella name 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.959
 comes from the word pupa as 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.940
 before the final mutation faith concludes 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.070
 carriers into a cocoon kai virus turns 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.260
 people in monsters java causing while 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.760
 huge mutation in the human body it 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.680
 used as the most dangerous 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.480
 biological weapons first he started 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.430
 used in eastern europe its 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.380
 gave the soldiers mercenaries as 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.390
 means of improving the immune system 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.459
 Further, this virus was improved and named 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.019
 his enhanced kai virus he was created 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.970
 Carla copies of hell wong 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.769
 virus improved with blood jack 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.840
 miller since his blood possessed 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.980
 antibodies to the virus under its turn 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.170
 is son 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.760
 albert vesker in contrast to the usual to 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.860
 virus improved virus not only 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.629
 improves physical performance he also 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.459
 eliminates the cop stage she is thereby 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.870
 the person mutates without disturbing 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.640
 holistic cell structure 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.319
 it is a very rare kind of viruses and its 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.090
 production technology owns only 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.580
 Carla d plus j herself 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.260
 This modification was created by European 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.180
 by the corporation department umbrella it 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.269
 appearance took place thanks to the merger 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.370
 antibodies that viruses and g virus sample 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.129
 William Birkin properties of this virus 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.090
 is his ability to amplify 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.340
 electromagnetic field and save 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.079
 intelligence due to this ability 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.379
 generate high voltage was 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:57.140
 2 virus stamps created this in 091 

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.269
 and in 092 the last one just showed 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.549
 all their properties on morpheus diwali 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.829
 based on t-virus alexander and spur 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.569
 seventies of the 20th century was created 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.730
 virus then veronica and then he was 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.739
 modified by his daughter Alexey Ashworth 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.810
 this virus is completely different from that 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.489
 viruses and their properties are very similar 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.500
 j virus virus affects people 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.269
 purely individual and gives everyone 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.130
 carrier its characteristic properties 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.720
 but if you enter it into the body without 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.310
 preliminary experiences then sacrifices 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.780
 mutates and turns into monsters 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.910
 like a virus victim 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.099
 but alexey finalized it and found out that 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.930
 in order to control his virus 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.729
 must stay in the body of its carriers 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.340
 more than 15 years at low temperature 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.750
 by incubation and only after that 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.610
 man does not lose his mind and 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.289
 controls their actions and probably 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.810
 the most dangerous parasite in the universe 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.910
 resident evil is a parasite las plagas in 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.950
 unlike the virus this parasite gives 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.870
 the wearer superhuman strength and 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.639
 also less pain sensitivity when 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.320
 this over time, the carrier loses 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.240
 ability to think and reason and 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.340
 fully obeys the parasite which 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.200
 settles down the spinal cord captured all 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.180
 nervous system virus infection 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.310
 happens in two ways the first is 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.450
 introduction to human 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.370
 microscopic eggs and the second is if 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.020
 a person will stay close to 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.000
 dead parasite as controversy 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.919
 airborne droplets can get into 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.780
 his body where later he will 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.130
 develop from the fifth part of the game to us 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.229
 represents another virus 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.510
 virus based uroboros 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.250
 ancestor and antibodies jill valentine 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.020
 with his help albert wesker wanted 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.479
 clear the world of people infected 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.340
 dna virus virus is trying to merge with 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.320
 dna carrier and if everything happens 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.169
 well then give the carrier 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.310
 superhuman abilities 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.199
 and if not, something happens 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.999
 uncontrolled mutation as black 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:36.159
 tentacles which can only be destroyed 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:38.800
 in it this and the last virus in our 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:40.749
 video is a virus prototype used 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.729
 albert vesker main effect 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.439
 this virus is what the virus gives 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.999
 his master superhuman 

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:48.009
 abilities such as speed 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:49.629
 regeneration strength and endurance 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.270
 the only side effect is 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:53.740
 the instability of the virus and therefore alberta 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.870
 it is necessary to introduce a special serum 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.669
 which holds back the virus well and on this 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.039
 all if you were interested to put 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:04.319
 thumb up and subscribe to channel a 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.319
 with you was an observer see you soon
