00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:14.580
Mieles combi steam cooker in XL for the first time and now with all the operating modes of a regular oven and of course 
incorporating Miele's tried and tested vita steam technology . 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:24.440
The extra large interior allows menu cooking for 8 to 10 persons and all thanks to Miele's gift for thinking outside the box. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.400
The water tank and condensate container are located behind the fascia panel this creates additional space. 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:59.340
Operation is extremely simple first select the operating mode then 
temperature and the time and off you go 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.300
During steam cooking water is gradually pumped to the powerful steam generator this Shortens heat up times 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.500
because small quantities of water evaporate faster.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:39.553
The hot steam enters the cabinet through two openings and spreads out fast and evenly 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:49.060
it displaces air and more importantly the oxygen, which is otherwise so aggressive to aromas vitamins and colours 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.820
cooking begins once the selected temperature has been reached

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.900
food is enveloped in steam and 
heated from all sides. 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.800
Temperature conditions remain constant throughout cooking monitored by a temperature sensor 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.200
fresh 
steam is continuously piped in 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.720
and surplus steam steam evacuated. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.640
. Expelled steam enters the condenser 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.300
comes into contact 
with cool surfaces 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:41.980
and condenses to water 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.880
which runs into the condensate pump 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.100
this reduces the amount of steam released by
 the machine guaranteeing a pleasant micro climate in the kitchen

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.820
Steam also condenses in side the steam cooker and drains 
off to the condensate pump 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.680
once a certain level has been reached the water is pumped into the condensate container

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.560
At the end of cooking the steam reduction cycle starts automatically 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.540
this involves allowing fresh air in to blend with the steam 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.240
the steam this air also passes through the steam condenser
