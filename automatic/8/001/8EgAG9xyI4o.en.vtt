properly for myself and how much I apply

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.810 
properly for myself and how much I apply

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.710 
that so I actually really really like
the<00:02:45.840> Bobbi<00:02:46.200> Brown<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.650> as<00:02:46.740> well<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.510> one

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
the Bobbi Brown one as well but this one

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.370 
the Bobbi Brown one as well but this one
is<00:02:48.900> just<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:49.290> lot<00:02:49.560> more<00:02:49.830> easier<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> use<00:02:51.380> from

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
is just a lot more easier to use from

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.580 
is just a lot more easier to use from
the<00:02:52.500> beginning<00:02:53.720> whereas<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.989> doesn't<00:02:55.440> feel

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
the beginning whereas it doesn't feel

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.560 
the beginning whereas it doesn't feel
heavy<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.550> creamy<00:02:57.120> or<00:02:57.239> anything<00:02:57.390> like

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
heavy it's not creamy or anything like

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.030 
heavy it's not creamy or anything like
that<00:02:57.660> with<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.989> Bobbi<00:02:58.200> Brown<00:02:58.320> one<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> know

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that with the Bobbi Brown one I know

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.300 
that with the Bobbi Brown one I know
some<00:02:59.489> people<00:03:00.230> find<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.530> too<00:03:02.010> creamy

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
some people find it really too creamy

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.660 
some people find it really too creamy
really<00:03:02.700> oily<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.300> heavy<00:03:04.070> this<00:03:05.070> one<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.489> would

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
really oily and heavy this one I would

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.740 
really oily and heavy this one I would
say<00:03:05.700> pro<00:03:06.209> would<00:03:06.450> suit<00:03:06.750> absolutely<00:03:07.430> everyone

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
say pro would suit absolutely everyone

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.580 
say pro would suit absolutely everyone
in<00:03:09.750> in<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.320> sense<00:03:11.239> skin<00:03:12.239> types<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:15.570> not<00:03:15.930> drying

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
in in a sense skin types it's not drying

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.740 
in in a sense skin types it's not drying
I<00:03:17.100> don't<00:03:17.430> feel<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:17.910> drying<00:03:18.270> for<00:03:18.510> under

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
I don't feel that it's drying for under

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.000 
I don't feel that it's drying for under
my<00:03:18.870> eyes<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:20.310> don't<00:03:21.030> feel<00:03:21.299> that<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.630> it's<00:03:22.380> oily

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
my eyes I don't feel that it it's oily

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.720 
my eyes I don't feel that it it's oily
or<00:03:23.190> heavy<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.390> I<00:03:25.110> do<00:03:25.380> think<00:03:25.860> it's<00:03:26.100> if<00:03:26.400> this<00:03:26.580> is

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
or heavy so I do think it's if this is

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.259 
or heavy so I do think it's if this is
suitable<00:03:27.180> for<00:03:27.600> all<00:03:27.959> skin<00:03:28.620> types

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
suitable for all skin types

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.880 
suitable for all skin types
I<00:03:30.299> really<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:31.080> do<00:03:31.260> number<00:03:31.560> one<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:33.890> cut

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
I really do do number one in cut

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.470 
I really do do number one in cut
remember<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.190> name<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.580> shade<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.299> it's

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
remember the name of the shade but it's

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.550 
remember the name of the shade but it's
a<00:03:36.630> more<00:03:36.870> pink<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.739> which<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:39.230> think<00:03:40.230> they<00:03:40.350> use

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
a more pink one which I think they use

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.860 
a more pink one which I think they use
for<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.799> different<00:03:41.100> kind<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.870> discoloration

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
for a different kind of discoloration

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.890 
for a different kind of discoloration
but<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:44.160> think<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.580> Georgia<00:03:44.790> people<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:45.540> think

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
but I think the Georgia people I think

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.069 
but I think the Georgia people I think
point<00:03:46.230> has<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.500> number<00:03:46.860> two<00:03:47.190> anyway<00:03:47.820> but<00:03:48.720> like

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
point has the number two anyway but like

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.259 
point has the number two anyway but like
