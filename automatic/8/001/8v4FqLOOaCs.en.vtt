00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.720 
because i have started planning up for
the<00:03:20.870> first<00:03:21.049> project<00:03:21.500> language<00:03:21.829> game<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.639> to

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
the first project language game going to

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.270 
the first project language game going to
do<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:23.030> town<00:03:23.389> of<00:03:23.630> Balaam<00:03:24.079> which<00:03:24.799> isn't<00:03:25.250> really

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
do the town of Balaam which isn't really

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.729 
do the town of Balaam which isn't really
big<00:03:25.639> but<00:03:26.209> i<00:03:26.510> think<00:03:26.720> would<00:03:26.840> make<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:27.049> little<00:03:27.620> bit

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
big but i think would make a little bit

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.440 
big but i think would make a little bit
bigger<00:03:27.919> than<00:03:28.220> what<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.579> actually<00:03:28.700> was<00:03:28.970> in<00:03:29.239> game

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
bigger than what it actually was in game

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.319 
bigger than what it actually was in game
just<00:03:30.049> so<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.290> people<00:03:30.530> can<00:03:30.560> get<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:30.829> more<00:03:31.329> nice

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
just so the people can get it more nice

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.030 
just so the people can get it more nice
in-depth<00:03:33.049> feel<00:03:33.349> of<00:03:33.590> what<00:03:33.769> they're<00:03:33.919> walking

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
in-depth feel of what they're walking

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.710 
in-depth feel of what they're walking
through<00:03:34.489> whenever<00:03:35.000> they're<00:03:35.299> going<00:03:35.540> through

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
through whenever they're going through

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.870 
through whenever they're going through
stuff<00:03:35.989> and<00:03:36.260> i<00:03:36.739> should<00:03:36.919> mention<00:03:37.010> all<00:03:37.609> these
