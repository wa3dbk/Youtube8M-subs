00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
eurasian but actually this day adds up

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.130 
eurasian but actually this day adds up
to<00:01:09.119> number<00:01:09.570> 11<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:11.119> if<00:01:12.119> you're<00:01:12.479> familiar<00:01:12.689> with

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
to number 11 and if you're familiar with

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.780 
to number 11 and if you're familiar with
the<00:01:14.010> Illuminati<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.650> their<00:01:16.790> numerology

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the Illuminati and their numerology

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.020 
the Illuminati and their numerology
stuff<00:01:18.540> well<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.710> number<00:01:20.009> 11<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> power

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
stuff well the number 11 is a power

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.050 
stuff well the number 11 is a power
number<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.619> quite<00:01:22.979> possible<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.580> if

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
number so it's quite possible that if

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.800 
number so it's quite possible that if
something<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> happen<00:01:25.640> around

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
something is going to happen around

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.660 

analytically<00:01:57.610> my<00:01:57.790> at<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.120> map<00:01:58.300> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
analytically my at the map and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.210 
analytically my at the map and
analytical<00:02:00.670> stay<00:02:01.510> which<00:02:01.720> I<00:02:01.870> thought<00:02:02.190> some<00:02:03.190> of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
analytical stay which I thought some of

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
analytical stay which I thought some of
the<00:02:03.430> places<00:02:03.850> that<00:02:04.120> wrote<00:02:04.510> on<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.780> map<00:02:06.240> like

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
the places that wrote on that map like

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.999 
the places that wrote on that map like
they<00:02:07.540> were<00:02:07.659> like<00:02:07.840> hidden<00:02:08.259> codes<00:02:08.590> there

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
they were like hidden codes there

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.090 
they were like hidden codes there
without<00:02:09.940> one<00:02:10.420> Matt<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:13.180> had<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.980> China<00:02:14.980> basin

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
without one Matt to had the China basin

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.340 
without one Matt to had the China basin
in<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:19.030> one<00:02:19.209> China<00:02:19.450> basin<00:02:19.780> that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
in it and and the one China basin that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.979 
in it and and the one China basin that
was<00:02:20.620> found<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.070> was<00:02:21.100> in<00:02:21.220> San<00:02:21.610> Francisco<00:02:21.989> okay

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
was found it was in San Francisco okay

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:31.440 
was found it was in San Francisco okay
clue<00:02:23.260> here<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:26.370> going<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.790> movie<00:02:29.940> okay<00:02:30.940> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
clue here so going to the movie okay to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.290 
clue here so going to the movie okay to
the<00:02:31.600> movie<00:02:31.900> here<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.470> look<00:02:32.950> up<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:34.270> a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
the movie here that I look up like a

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.259 
the movie here that I look up like a
flying<00:02:34.570> saucer<00:02:34.810> something's<00:02:35.500> really<00:02:35.739> weird

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
flying saucer something's really weird

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.229 
flying saucer something's really weird
because<00:02:37.269> that's<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.550> Super<00:02:39.550> Bowl<00:02:39.580> there<00:02:40.060> they

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
because that's the Super Bowl there they

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.170 
because that's the Super Bowl there they
in<00:02:40.420> New<00:02:40.690> Orleans<00:02:41.260> that's<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.459> New<00:02:42.640> Orleans

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
in New Orleans that's the New Orleans

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.880 
in New Orleans that's the New Orleans
some<00:02:44.760> dome<00:02:45.760> there<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:50.440> called<00:02:50.739> the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
some dome there and it's called the

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.520 
some dome there and it's called the
mercedes-benz<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.780> their<00:02:53.140> single

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
mercedes-benz so this is their single

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.759 
mercedes-benz so this is their single
mercedes-benz<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:55.320> actually<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.739> a

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
mercedes-benz and actually this is a

satanic level also and if you notice one

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.949 
satanic level also and if you notice one
back<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:02.200> again<00:03:02.500> out<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:03.910> letter<00:03:04.209> X<00:03:04.600> in

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
back here again out of that letter X in

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.150 
back here again out of that letter X in
the<00:03:05.260> front<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:07.030> which<00:03:07.959> is<00:03:08.140> which<00:03:08.920> this

so if you go and look at this video

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.150 
so if you go and look at this video
about<00:03:18.760> all<00:03:19.209> the<00:03:19.600> numerologist<00:03:20.320> going<00:03:20.739> with<00:03:20.920> it

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
about all the numerologist going with it

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.400 
about all the numerologist going with it
that<00:03:21.549> this<00:03:22.000> person<00:03:22.930> had<00:03:23.220> figured<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:25.410> about

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
that this person had figured out about

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.569 
that this person had figured out about
the<00:03:26.680> numbers<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.459> all<00:03:27.549> that<00:03:27.790> stuff<00:03:27.940> and

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
the numbers and all that stuff and

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.970 
the numbers and all that stuff and
basically<00:03:30.579> what<00:03:30.880> what<00:03:31.480> it<00:03:31.600> boiled<00:03:32.019> down<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.230> is

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
basically what what it boiled down to is

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.640 
basically what what it boiled down to is
that<00:03:33.040> this<00:03:34.000> may<00:03:34.480> be<00:03:34.540> another<00:03:35.170> false<00:03:35.530> flag

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
that this may be another false flag

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.460 
that this may be another false flag
event<00:03:36.459> like<00:03:37.180> setting<00:03:37.660> off<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.870> New<00:03:38.230> Madrid
