I think utility knife help me cut this
29<00:00:11.370> th<00:00:11.550> gavel<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> metal<00:00:12.540> roof<00:00:12.719> panel<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:13.530> a

29 th gavel in a metal roof panel it's a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.499 
29 th gavel in a metal roof panel it's a
technique<00:00:14.009> called<00:00:14.219> scoring<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.330> been

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
technique called scoring it's been

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.630 
technique called scoring it's been
around<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.839> long<00:00:15.990> time<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.920> gonna<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.430> real

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
around a long time I'm gonna do it real

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.340 
around a long time I'm gonna do it real

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
from one of my videos that shows this

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.560 
from one of my videos that shows this
technique<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.130> field<00:00:23.430> being<00:00:23.730> used<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.420> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
technique in the field being used in a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.790 
technique in the field being used in a
practical<00:00:25.109> application<00:00:27.380> we<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.619> cut<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
practical application we want to cut a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.130 
practical application we want to cut a
square<00:00:28.980> out<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.490> panel<00:00:29.929> it's<00:00:30.929> easy

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
square out of this panel it's easy

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.090 
square out of this panel it's easy
enough<00:00:31.610> cut<00:00:32.610> these<00:00:32.880> long<00:00:33.149> hair<00:00:33.800> with<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> tin

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
enough cut these long hair with the tin

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.240 
enough cut these long hair with the tin
snips<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:36.200> if<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> make<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> cut<00:00:38.100> up

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
snips but if you want to make the cut up

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
snips but if you want to make the cut up
here<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.000> lot<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.329> difficult<00:00:39.620> even

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
here it's a lot more difficult even

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.470 
here it's a lot more difficult even
after<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.070> cut<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> section<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.270> very

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
after you cut the section out it's very

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.619 
after you cut the section out it's very
hard<00:00:42.920> we're<00:00:43.920> gonna<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.250> instead<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.149> score<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
hard we're gonna do instead you score it

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:55.160 
hard we're gonna do instead you score it
with<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.809> utility<00:00:46.230> knife<00:00:53.660> we're<00:00:54.660> gonna<00:00:54.750> press

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
with the utility knife we're gonna press

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.250 
with the utility knife we're gonna press
in<00:00:55.440> nice<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.430> firm<00:00:56.730> try<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> make<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.989> one

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
in nice and firm try to make just one

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.050 
in nice and firm try to make just one
pass<00:01:03.799> then<00:01:04.799> we're<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.280> gonna<00:01:05.489> cut<00:01:05.850> these

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
pass then we're just gonna cut these

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:21.520 
pass then we're just gonna cut these
lines<00:01:06.650> like<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.799> would<00:01:08.010> normally

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.670 

we'll<00:01:22.530> turn<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> over<00:01:23.010> and<00:01:25.730> bend<00:01:26.730> it<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:28.350> metal

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
we'll turn it over and bend it the metal

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.710 
we'll turn it over and bend it the metal
fatigue<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.310> what's<00:01:29.580> gonna<00:01:29.790> make<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.240> break

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.120 

by<00:01:33.720> scoring<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.950> basically<00:01:35.160> made<00:01:35.730> this<00:01:35.910> a

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
by scoring it we basically made this a

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.620 
by scoring it we basically made this a
more<00:01:38.130> narrow<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:39.000> channel<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.480> we've

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
more narrow in the channel that we've

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.110 
more narrow in the channel that we've
scored<00:01:40.190> which<00:01:41.190> is<00:01:41.340> gonna<00:01:41.490> make<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.880> metal

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
scored which is gonna make the metal

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.850 
scored which is gonna make the metal
fatigue<00:01:42.270> concentrate<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.230> that<00:01:43.350> score<00:01:43.650> mark

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
fatigue concentrate on that score mark

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.090 
fatigue concentrate on that score mark
this<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.640> an<00:01:44.730> easy<00:01:45.000> way<00:01:45.300> to<00:01:45.680> make<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.830> up<00:01:46.890> these

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
this is an easy way to make it up these

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
this is an easy way to make it up these
cuts<00:01:47.430> when<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.760> have<00:01:47.940> limited<00:01:48.390> access<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.080> get

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
cuts when you have limited access to get

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.990 
cuts when you have limited access to get
in<00:01:49.470> there

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
in there

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.060 
in there
Lauren<00:01:51.000> works<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:51.510> for<00:01:51.540> rip<00:01:51.900> cuts<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
Lauren works well for rip cuts if you

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
Lauren works well for rip cuts if you
have<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> real<00:01:53.520> long<00:01:53.700> when<00:01:53.910> it<00:01:53.940> can<00:01:54.120> still<00:01:54.360> be

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have it real long when it can still be

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.300 
have it real long when it can still be
done<00:01:54.630> but<00:01:54.900> it's<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.050> lot<00:01:55.170> easier<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.800> use<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
done but it's a lot easier just to use a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:08.300 
done but it's a lot easier just to use a
set<00:01:56.730> of<00:01:56.820> pneumatic<00:01:57.210> shears<00:02:06.950> don't<00:02:07.950> keep<00:02:08.130> one

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
set of pneumatic shears don't keep one

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.830 
set of pneumatic shears don't keep one
over<00:02:09.500> nice<00:02:10.500> indeed
