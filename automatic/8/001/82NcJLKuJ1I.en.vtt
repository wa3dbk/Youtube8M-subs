wondering<00:00:22.039> if<00:00:22.099> these<00:00:22.279> are<00:00:22.429> the<00:00:22.460> actual<00:00:22.910> bolts

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
wondering if these are the actual bolts

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.470 
wondering if these are the actual bolts
no<00:00:23.779> they're<00:00:24.199> not<00:00:24.349> do<00:00:25.070> not<00:00:25.220> throw<00:00:26.210> them<00:00:26.329> out

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
no they're not do not throw them out

one<00:00:32.119> we<00:00:32.270> actually<00:00:32.390> have<00:00:32.809> okay<00:00:33.559> or<00:00:33.860> we'll<00:00:34.010> just

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
one we actually have okay or we'll just

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.110 
one we actually have okay or we'll just
do<00:00:34.280> this<00:00:35.140> Ram<00:00:36.140> I<00:00:36.530> flat<00:00:36.860> it<00:00:37.010> in<00:00:37.129> there<00:00:37.370> and<00:00:37.789> pry

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120
