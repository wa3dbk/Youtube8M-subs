00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
second driving stage if we count first

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.160

stages<00:00:09.030> but<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.450> rail<00:00:09.570> shooter'<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.080> a

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
stages but the rail shooter' and a

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.700 
stages but the rail shooter' and a

driver with enemies vanquished and this

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.430 
driver with enemies vanquished and this
one's<00:00:13.950> far<00:00:14.670> less<00:00:15.030> chaotic<00:00:15.690> than<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.230> first

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
one's far less chaotic than the first

one's far less chaotic than the first
driving<00:00:16.800> stage<00:00:17.190> so<00:00:17.580> I<00:00:17.850> should<00:00:18.420> be<00:00:18.449> less

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
driving stage so I should be less

driving stage so I should be less
terrible<00:00:20.150> hopefully<00:00:28.369> perhaps<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.179> look

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809

missiles<00:01:18.759> every<00:01:19.180> single<00:01:19.479> time<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:19.689> shoot<00:01:20.140> the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
missiles every single time I shoot the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.469 
missiles every single time I shoot the
missiles<00:01:20.649> that<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.670> actually<00:01:21.939> because<00:01:22.210> I

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
missiles that is actually because I

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.840 
missiles that is actually because I
managed<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.229> get<00:01:23.439> one<00:01:23.619> of<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.860> gold<00:01:24.250> unlocks

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
managed to get one of the gold unlocks

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.149 
managed to get one of the gold unlocks
which<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.360> firing<00:01:25.689> four<00:01:26.020> missiles<00:01:26.409> instead<00:01:26.920> of

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
which is firing four missiles instead of

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.819 
which is firing four missiles instead of
simply<00:01:27.700> two<00:01:28.390> missiles<00:01:28.780> this<00:01:29.619> is<00:01:29.799> a

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
simply two missiles this is a

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.330 
simply two missiles this is a
double-edged<00:01:30.340> sword<00:01:31.740> yeah<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.950> mandatory

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
double-edged sword yeah that mandatory

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.649 
double-edged sword yeah that mandatory
think<00:01:33.759> there<00:01:33.880> was<00:01:34.000> bonding<00:01:34.390> over<00:01:34.479> ah<00:01:36.659> that's

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
think there was bonding over ah that's

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.210 
think there was bonding over ah that's
why<00:01:37.810> I<00:01:37.840> recommend<00:01:38.110> using<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.619> machine<00:01:38.950> guns

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
why I recommend using the machine guns

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.069 
why I recommend using the machine guns
quite<00:01:39.759> a<00:01:39.789> bit<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.119> this<00:01:40.210> stage<00:01:40.509> if<00:01:41.049> you<00:01:41.500> have

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
quite a bit in this stage if you have

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.240 
quite a bit in this stage if you have
gonna<00:01:44.079> be<00:01:44.140> careful<00:01:44.470> of<00:01:44.560> civilians<00:01:44.979> got<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.189> be

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
gonna be careful of civilians got to be

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.010 
gonna be careful of civilians got to be
really<00:01:45.490> careful<00:01:45.880> of<00:01:45.939> civilians<00:01:46.509> when<00:01:46.720> doing

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
really careful of civilians when doing

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.260 
really careful of civilians when doing
it<00:01:47.140> but<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.740> do<00:01:48.159> recommend<00:01:48.520> use<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.940> machine

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
it but I do recommend use the machine

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.880 
it but I do recommend use the machine

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.229 
smokescreen a lot the good thing about
the<00:02:08.080> machine<00:02:08.380> guns<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:08.950> they<00:02:09.399> can<00:02:09.580> easily<00:02:10.000> pop

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
the machine guns is they can easily pop

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
it's pretty much guaranteed you can

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:25.420 
it's pretty much guaranteed you can
outrun<00:02:16.360> them

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.100 

okay<00:02:25.939> don't<00:02:26.120> know<00:02:26.269> if<00:02:26.360> we're<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:26.599> have<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:27.079> a

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.640 

now<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:33.090> we're<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.209> ice<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:34.140> very<00:02:34.380> hard<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
now that we're on ice it's very hard to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.260 
now that we're on ice it's very hard to
turn<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:35.220> which<00:02:35.340> means<00:02:35.550> it's<00:02:35.700> hard<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.970> arrange

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
turn it which means it's hard to arrange

that's not bad

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.450

I<00:04:49.960> think<00:04:50.590> they're<00:04:50.770> two<00:04:50.920> of<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.070> ones<00:04:51.220> that<00:04:51.310> I

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
I think they're two of the ones that I

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.310 
I think they're two of the ones that I
drove<00:04:51.640> past<00:04:51.790> after<00:04:52.150> popping<00:04:52.630> their<00:04:52.750> tires<00:04:52.960> I

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
drove past after popping their tires I

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.000 
drove past after popping their tires I
don't<00:04:53.500> think<00:04:53.650> they<00:04:53.710> counted<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:55.570> I<00:04:56.110> almost

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
don't think they counted and I almost

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.460 
don't think they counted and I almost
got<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.340> target<00:04:57.670> time<00:04:57.900> so<00:04:58.900> if<00:04:59.020> I<00:04:59.110> were<00:04:59.260> to<00:04:59.290> have

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
got the target time so if I were to have

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.050 
got the target time so if I were to have
gotten<00:04:59.650> all<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.920> double-oh-seven<00:05:00.310> moves<00:05:00.850> I

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
gotten all the double-oh-seven moves I

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.060 
gotten all the double-oh-seven moves I
probably<00:05:01.360> am<00:05:01.810> Harold<00:05:02.380> the<00:05:02.500> double<00:05:02.740> of<00:05:02.830> seven

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
probably am Harold the double of seven

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.710 
probably am Harold the double of seven
bonuses<00:05:03.520> then<00:05:03.790> I<00:05:03.820> probably<00:05:04.270> would<00:05:04.690> have
