00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
things that I really really really

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.920 
things that I really really really
wanted<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:44.229> do<00:00:44.440> with<00:00:44.680> these<00:00:45.010> colors<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:45.930> but

wanted to do with these colors and but
obviously<00:00:47.290> I<00:00:47.680> thought<00:00:48.489> this<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.330> you<00:00:50.170> know

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290

obviously I thought this is you know
something<00:00:50.589> that<00:00:50.949> I<00:00:51.479> kinda<00:00:52.479> guess<00:00:52.659> that<00:00:52.809> they

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
something that I kinda guess that they

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.600 
something that I kinda guess that they
wanted<00:00:53.259> to<00:00:53.350> see<00:00:53.559> I'm<00:00:53.979> good<00:00:54.250> they<00:00:54.339> said<00:00:54.460> that

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
wanted to see I'm good they said that

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.530 
wanted to see I'm good they said that
they<00:00:54.699> wanted<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.000> see<00:00:55.119> with<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.360> bright

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
they wanted to see with the bright

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.689 
they wanted to see with the bright
colors<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.680> I<00:00:56.710> wanted<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.159> do<00:00:57.250> like<00:00:57.369> a<00:00:57.430> rainbow

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
colors so I wanted to do like a rainbow

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.869 
colors so I wanted to do like a rainbow
look<00:00:58.030> but<00:00:58.239> I<00:00:58.269> really<00:00:58.629> have<00:00:59.549> some<00:01:00.549> thoughts<00:01:00.759> in

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
look but I really have some thoughts in

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.609 
look but I really have some thoughts in
my<00:01:01.000> head<00:01:01.150> of<00:01:01.360> like<00:01:01.540> a<00:01:01.750> bright<00:01:02.199> color<00:01:02.409> but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:02.619 
my head of like a bright color but

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:04.890 
my head of like a bright color but
really<00:01:03.100> really<00:01:03.220> like<00:01:03.489> with<00:01:03.759> a<00:01:03.790> really<00:01:04.150> smoky

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
really really like with a really smoky

really really like with a really smoky
look<00:01:05.079> and<00:01:05.409> I<00:01:06.040> think<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.310> would<00:01:06.430> look<00:01:06.490> really

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
look and I think it would look really

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.819 
look and I think it would look really
really<00:01:07.119> really<00:01:07.150> pretty<00:01:07.720> so<00:01:08.409> if<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:08.619> want<00:01:08.770> to

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330

a space with the green we don't want to
take<00:02:34.310> it<00:02:34.370> over<00:02:34.730> too<00:02:34.970> far<00:02:35.240> so<00:02:35.540> we<00:02:35.630> can<00:02:35.780> put<00:02:35.930> the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
take it over too far so we can put the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.410 
take it over too far so we can put the
other<00:02:36.050> colors<00:02:36.530> there<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.920> well<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:38.030> then

other colors there as well and then

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.450 
other colors there as well and then
after<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.080> put<00:02:39.440> an<00:02:39.560> F<00:02:39.710> on<00:02:39.860> there<00:02:40.010> for<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.340> to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
after you put an F on there for it to

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.910 
after you put an F on there for it to
really<00:02:40.820> be<00:02:41.270> really<00:02:41.840> bright<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.410> just<00:02:42.650> want<00:02:42.830> to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
really be really bright you just want to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.160 
really be really bright you just want to
get<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.700> orange<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.300> put<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.630> right<00:02:44.900> next

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
get the orange and put that right next

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.230 
get the orange and put that right next
to<00:02:45.230> it<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:45.350> also<00:02:45.710> overlap<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.760> little<00:02:47.000> bit

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
to it but also overlap it a little bit

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.270 
to it but also overlap it a little bit
just<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:47.990> it<00:02:48.170> blends<00:02:48.590> in<00:02:48.830> with<00:02:48.950> each<00:02:49.100> other

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
just so it blends in with each other

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
just so it blends in with each other
just<00:02:49.460> because<00:02:49.640> it<00:02:49.760> makes<00:02:49.940> it<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.120> lot<00:02:50.240> easier

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
just because it makes it a lot easier

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.640 
just because it makes it a lot easier
for<00:02:50.600> him<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> blend<00:02:51.140> when<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.350> do<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.620> like

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
for him to blend when you do it like

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.580 
for him to blend when you do it like
this<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.430> then<00:02:53.300> after<00:02:53.870> you've<00:02:54.050> done<00:02:54.080> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590

as<00:03:23.690> well<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:23.990> they're<00:03:24.140> all<00:03:24.290> really<00:03:24.650> blended<00:03:25.190> or

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
as well so they're all really blended or

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.089 
as well so they're all really blended or
not<00:03:25.430> really<00:03:25.640> nice<00:03:25.850> together

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.039 

now<00:03:32.849> I'm<00:03:32.939> going<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.120> take<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.390> matte<00:03:33.569> black<00:03:33.599> in

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
now I'm going to take the matte black in

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.039 
now I'm going to take the matte black in
the<00:03:34.170> palette<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:35.069> like<00:03:35.909> a<00:03:36.090> really<00:03:36.659> really

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
the palette but like a really really

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.720 
the palette but like a really really
really<00:03:37.409> small<00:03:37.680> amount<00:03:37.950> you<00:03:38.129> can<00:03:38.280> see<00:03:38.459> here<00:03:38.700> I

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
really small amount you can see here I

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.849 
really small amount you can see here I
tapped<00:03:39.030> off<00:03:39.180> loads<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.569> excess<00:03:40.019> but<00:03:40.620> I'm<00:03:40.709> just

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
tapped off loads of excess but I'm just

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:41.929 
tapped off loads of excess but I'm just
putting<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.189> little<00:03:41.400> bit<00:03:41.519> in<00:03:41.609> the<00:03:41.700> crease<00:03:41.909> just

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939 
putting a little bit in the crease just

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.849 
putting a little bit in the crease just
to<00:03:42.239> give<00:03:42.420> it<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.689> tiniest<00:03:43.319> bit<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.680> dimension

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
to give it the tiniest bit of dimension

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.039 
to give it the tiniest bit of dimension
I<00:03:44.519> don't<00:03:44.969> want<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.239> be<00:03:45.329> super<00:03:45.540> smoky

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
I don't want it to be super smoky

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:46.970 
I don't want it to be super smoky
because<00:03:46.109> I<00:03:46.260> want<00:03:46.409> it<00:03:46.439> to<00:03:46.560> be<00:03:46.620> really<00:03:46.799> really

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
because I want it to be really really

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.699 
because I want it to be really really
black<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.459> bright<00:03:47.879> but<00:03:48.719> I<00:03:48.959> just<00:03:49.379> wanted<00:03:49.620> to

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
black and bright but I just wanted to

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.080 
black and bright but I just wanted to
give<00:03:49.829> my<00:03:49.980> eyes<00:03:50.159> just<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.519> tiny<00:03:50.819> bit<00:03:51.060> more

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
give my eyes just a tiny bit more

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.580 
give my eyes just a tiny bit more
dimension<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:51.959> that's<00:03:52.079> why<00:03:52.230> I'm<00:03:52.319> doing<00:03:52.379> that

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
dimension so that's why I'm doing that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.640 
dimension so that's why I'm doing that
here<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.430> then<00:03:54.120> after<00:03:54.719> you've<00:03:54.870> done<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.139> you

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
here and then after you've done that you

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.709 
here and then after you've done that you
want<00:03:55.889> to<00:03:55.980> get<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.430> pink<00:03:56.790> again<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.359> just<00:03:57.540> put

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:57.719 
want to get the pink again and just put

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:59.209 
want to get the pink again and just put
that<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.109> crease<00:03:58.290> as<00:03:58.439> well<00:03:58.469> so<00:03:58.829> it<00:03:58.919> helps

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
that in the crease as well so it helps

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:02.089 
that in the crease as well so it helps
all<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.669> the<00:03:59.819> colors<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.450> it<00:04:00.900> seamlessly<00:04:01.409> just

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
all of the colors and it seamlessly just

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.440 
all of the colors and it seamlessly just
blend<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.700> with<00:04:02.849> each<00:04:02.969> other

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
blend in with each other

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.509 
blend in with each other
I<00:04:03.480> find<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.260> when<00:04:04.469> you<00:04:04.560> just<00:04:04.829> put<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.219> bit<00:04:05.489> of

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
I find that when you just put a bit of

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.909 
I find that when you just put a bit of
the<00:04:05.909> last<00:04:06.180> color<00:04:06.450> on<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.959> all<00:04:07.379> over<00:04:07.829> the

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
the last color on you all over the

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.580 
the last color on you all over the
crease<00:04:08.129> it<00:04:08.280> blends<00:04:08.879> in<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.180> lot<00:04:09.329> nicer<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:10.199> then

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
crease it blends in a lot nicer and then

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.559 
crease it blends in a lot nicer and then
after<00:04:10.980> you've<00:04:11.129> done<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.459> as<00:04:11.760> well<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.299> just

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
after you've done that as well you just

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.439 
after you've done that as well you just
want<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.870> actually<00:04:14.090> write<00:04:15.090> in<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.419> other

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
want to actually write in the other

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.449 
want to actually write in the other
colors<00:04:15.900> up<00:04:16.019> again<00:04:16.259> because<00:04:16.440> blending<00:04:17.190> can

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
colors up again because blending can

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.580 
colors up again because blending can
make<00:04:17.669> and<00:04:18.030> make<00:04:18.150> them<00:04:18.329> not<00:04:18.840> be<00:04:19.049> as<00:04:19.259> bright<00:04:19.440> as

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
make and make them not be as bright as

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.719 
make and make them not be as bright as
they<00:04:19.709> were<00:04:19.829> really<00:04:20.009> first<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.370> put<00:04:20.519> them<00:04:20.639> on

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
they were really first to put them on

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.520 
they were really first to put them on
there<00:04:20.940> so<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.449> just<00:04:21.630> like<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> get<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.079> little<00:04:22.259> bit

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
there so I just like to get a little bit

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.499 
there so I just like to get a little bit
of<00:04:22.620> each<00:04:22.710> color<00:04:23.009> on<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.639> brush<00:04:23.759> and<00:04:24.030> just<00:04:24.150> put

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:24.509 
of each color on the brush and just put

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.939 
of each color on the brush and just put
a<00:04:24.630> little<00:04:24.870> bit<00:04:25.080> more<00:04:25.289> on<00:04:25.380> just<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.680> make<00:04:25.800> them

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
a little bit more on just to make them

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.820 
a little bit more on just to make them
really<00:04:26.250> pop

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.129 

now<00:04:29.759> as<00:04:29.909> you<00:04:30.030> can<00:04:30.120> see<00:04:30.330> here<00:04:30.569> I'm<00:04:30.690> just<00:04:30.840> putting

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
now as you can see here I'm just putting

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.920 
now as you can see here I'm just putting
the<00:04:31.229> colors<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:32.310> under<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.120> lash<00:04:33.300> line<00:04:33.330> the

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
the colors and under the lash line the

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.689 
the colors and under the lash line the
bottom<00:04:34.169> lash<00:04:34.349> line<00:04:34.379> but<00:04:35.159> I'm<00:04:35.280> only<00:04:35.400> putting

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
bottom lash line but I'm only putting

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.399 
bottom lash line but I'm only putting
the<00:04:35.819> tiniest<00:04:36.210> amount<00:04:36.539> because<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.810> don't<00:04:37.229> want

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
the tiniest amount because I don't want

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.080 
the tiniest amount because I don't want
that<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.680> be<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:38.009> bright<00:04:38.280> as<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.580> top<00:04:38.789> but<00:04:39.030> I

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
that to be as bright as the top but I

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.670 
that to be as bright as the top but I
don't<00:04:39.360> want<00:04:39.599> it<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.990> not<00:04:40.199> have<00:04:40.229> any<00:04:40.530> color

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
don't want it to not have any color

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.230 
don't want it to not have any color
underneath<00:04:41.039> so<00:04:41.729> I'm<00:04:41.789> just<00:04:41.970> putting<00:04:42.120> the

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
underneath so I'm just putting the

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.430 
underneath so I'm just putting the
tiniest<00:04:42.569> amount<00:04:42.840> but<00:04:42.930> when<00:04:43.020> you<00:04:43.110> get<00:04:43.259> to<00:04:43.349> the

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
tiniest amount but when you get to the

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.230 
tiniest amount but when you get to the
pink<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.099> want<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.400> blend<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.789> up<00:04:44.849> to

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
pink and you want to blend that up to

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.600 
pink and you want to blend that up to
the<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.409> top<00:04:46.710> lid<00:04:46.949> as<00:04:47.069> well<00:04:47.099> just<00:04:47.460> so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
the to the and top lid as well just so

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.629 
the to the and top lid as well just so
it<00:04:47.759> gives<00:04:48.330> a<00:04:48.419> nice<00:04:48.539> seamless<00:04:48.870> effect<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:49.830> and

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
it gives a nice seamless effect and and

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.969 
it gives a nice seamless effect and and
like<00:04:50.879> I<00:04:50.909> showed<00:04:51.210> in<00:04:51.539> my<00:04:51.629> haul<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.289> white<00:04:52.530> isn't

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
like I showed in my haul the white isn't

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.230 
like I showed in my haul the white isn't
that<00:04:53.129> pigmented<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:53.819> it's<00:04:53.940> actually<00:04:54.210> a

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
that pigmented but it's actually a

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.059

I've done that I'm just going to take a

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.730 
I've done that I'm just going to take a
bit<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.879> elf<00:06:00.120> cool<00:06:00.509> bronzer<00:06:01.199> and<00:06:01.590> I'm

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
bit of the elf cool bronzer and I'm

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.740 
bit of the elf cool bronzer and I'm
actually<00:06:01.919> using<00:06:02.129> the<00:06:02.580> elf<00:06:02.819> blush<00:06:03.240> brush<00:06:03.539> with

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
actually using the elf blush brush with

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.149 
actually using the elf blush brush with
this<00:06:03.930> because<00:06:04.349> it's<00:06:04.560> got<00:06:04.680> a<00:06:04.740> really<00:06:04.949> nice

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
this because it's got a really nice

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.649 
this because it's got a really nice
point<00:06:05.490> so<00:06:05.759> I<00:06:05.789> think<00:06:05.879> it's<00:06:06.090> actually<00:06:06.300> quite

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
point so I think it's actually quite

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.510 
point so I think it's actually quite
good<00:06:06.690> for<00:06:06.990> contouring<00:06:07.469> and<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.830> really<00:06:08.099> like<00:06:08.279> it

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
good for contouring and I really like it

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.969 
good for contouring and I really like it
and<00:06:08.819> it<00:06:09.569> doesn't<00:06:09.870> make<00:06:09.960> it<00:06:10.139> too<00:06:10.349> pigmented<00:06:10.860> and

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
and it doesn't make it too pigmented and

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.350 
and it doesn't make it too pigmented and
tool<00:06:11.219> for<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.520> top<00:06:11.699> with<00:06:11.879> the<00:06:11.969> Brooke<00:06:12.180> with

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
tool for the top with the Brooke with

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.480 
tool for the top with the Brooke with
the<00:06:12.509> the<00:06:13.199> contour<00:06:13.620> so<00:06:13.770> I<00:06:13.800> really<00:06:14.099> really<00:06:14.219> like

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
the the contour so I really really like

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.490 
the the contour so I really really like
it<00:06:14.759> and<00:06:15.150> then<00:06:15.629> after<00:06:15.900> that<00:06:16.020> I'm<00:06:16.169> using<00:06:16.349> a

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
it and then after that I'm using a

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.619 
it and then after that I'm using a
makeup<00:06:16.740> revolution<00:06:16.889> blusher<00:06:17.729> and<00:06:18.120> this<00:06:18.240> is<00:06:18.389> in

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629 
makeup revolution blusher and this is in

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.080 
makeup revolution blusher and this is in
now<00:06:19.050> and<00:06:19.560> these<00:06:20.099> are<00:06:20.340> really<00:06:20.819> pigmented

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
now and these are really pigmented

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.969 
now and these are really pigmented
there's<00:06:21.419> only<00:06:21.539> a<00:06:21.629> one<00:06:21.870> pound<00:06:22.080> each<00:06:22.379> with<00:06:22.949> a

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
there's only a one pound each with a

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.559 
there's only a one pound each with a
super<00:06:23.250> pigmented<00:06:23.520> and<00:06:23.759> I<00:06:23.849> find<00:06:24.090> that<00:06:24.180> she'd<00:06:24.509> go

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:24.569 
super pigmented and I find that she'd go

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:25.580 
super pigmented and I find that she'd go
a<00:06:24.599> little<00:06:24.840> bit<00:06:24.960> over<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.199> top<00:06:25.379> with<00:06:25.500> his

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:25.590 
a little bit over the top with his

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.159 
a little bit over the top with his
blushes<00:06:26.069> and<00:06:26.340> so<00:06:27.300> I<00:06:27.330> just<00:06:27.629> used<00:06:27.840> a<00:06:27.960> stippling

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
blushes and so I just used a stippling
