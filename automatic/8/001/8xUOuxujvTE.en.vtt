interesting<00:00:14.759> lock<00:00:15.420> from<00:00:15.839> Robert<00:00:16.350> G<00:00:16.560> 595<00:00:17.400> and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
interesting lock from Robert G 595 and

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.580 
interesting lock from Robert G 595 and
he<00:00:17.640> lives<00:00:17.850> in<00:00:18.000> Hungary<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.720> indeed<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
he lives in Hungary and indeed this is a

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.269 
he lives in Hungary and indeed this is a
Hungarian<00:00:20.070> lock<00:00:20.539> brand-new<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> lz2

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
Hungarian lock brand-new it is a lz2

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.939 
Hungarian lock brand-new it is a lz2
Dias<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.630> believe<00:00:24.930> based<00:00:25.410> on<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.650> name

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
Dias and I believe based on the name

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.429 
Dias and I believe based on the name
here<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.490> probably<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.660> LZ<00:00:28.019> companies

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
here that is probably the LZ companies

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.589 
here that is probably the LZ companies
probably<00:00:28.680> owned<00:00:29.130> by<00:00:29.310> Kaabah<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.510> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
probably owned by Kaabah so the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.380 
probably owned by Kaabah so the
combination<00:00:30.840> company<00:00:32.030> anyway<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.180> take<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
combination company anyway just take a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.410 
combination company anyway just take a
look<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> lock<00:00:34.399> kind<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> well<00:00:35.850> done<00:00:36.149> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
look at the lock kind of well done and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.479 
look at the lock kind of well done and
it<00:00:36.570> has<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> really<00:00:37.110> unique<00:00:37.530> shape<00:00:38.100> when<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it has a really unique shape when you

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
it has a really unique shape when you
look<00:00:38.670> at<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.969> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.450> double<00:00:40.200> oval<00:00:40.649> or

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
look at it kind of a double oval or

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.100 
look at it kind of a double oval or
figure<00:00:41.190> eight<00:00:41.510> pretty<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.750> pretty<00:00:42.930> cool

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
figure eight pretty it's pretty cool

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.190 
figure eight pretty it's pretty cool
well<00:00:43.410> done<00:00:43.680> well<00:00:43.890> executed<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> 5

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
well done well executed and it is a 5

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
well done well executed and it is a 5
pin<00:00:46.469> lock<00:00:46.739> here's<00:00:47.039> what<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.370> bidding<00:00:48.210> will

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
pin lock here's what the bidding will

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.450 
pin lock here's what the bidding will
look<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.860> got<00:00:50.039> some<00:00:50.070> pretty<00:00:50.370> good

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
look like so it's got some pretty good

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.889 
look like so it's got some pretty good
bidding<00:00:51.199> not<00:00:52.199> super<00:00:52.860> super<00:00:53.370> radical<00:00:53.820> but<00:00:54.780> it

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
bidding not super super radical but it

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
bidding not super super radical but it
is<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> key<00:00:55.320> retaining<00:00:55.800> lock<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.730> have

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
is a key retaining lock that much I have

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.209 
is a key retaining lock that much I have
played<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:57.440> if<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> key<00:00:59.070> in

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
played with if I can get the key in

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.439 
played with if I can get the key in
there<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.710> when<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.920> open<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:03.059> look<00:01:03.300> at

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
there and when you open it you look at

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
there and when you open it you look at
the<00:01:03.629> shackle<00:01:04.530> you'll<00:01:04.860> notice<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.400> there's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the shackle you'll notice that there's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.440 
the shackle you'll notice that there's
only<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.450> cut<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.909> only<00:01:09.119> one

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
only one cut out so we have only one

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.500 
only one cut out so we have only one
square<00:01:09.840> cut<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
square cut out here not one here so you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
square cut out here not one here so you
think<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.869> cheap<00:01:13.200> block<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:14.400> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
think I cheap block and then when you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.859 
think I cheap block and then when you
look<00:01:14.610> at<00:01:14.729> Esau<00:01:14.939> there's<00:01:15.299> plenty<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> room<00:01:15.720> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
look at Esau there's plenty of room we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
look at Esau there's plenty of room we
can<00:01:16.020> shim<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.830> that's<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.640> my

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
can shim that and that's that was my

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.410 
can shim that and that's that was my
impression<00:01:18.500> however<00:01:19.939> when<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> look<00:01:21.210> inside

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
impression however when you look inside

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.870 
impression however when you look inside
you<00:01:22.259> don't<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.710> spring-loaded<00:01:23.220> pawl<00:01:23.520> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
you don't see the spring-loaded pawl so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.280 
you don't see the spring-loaded pawl so
let<00:01:24.000> me<00:01:24.060> turn<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> key<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.810> hope<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
let me turn the key and I hope it

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.830 
let me turn the key and I hope it
focuses<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.330> close<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
focuses up with that just as close as I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.569 
focuses up with that just as close as I
can<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> camera<00:01:28.710> you'll<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.340> there's<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
can to the camera you'll see there's a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.410 
can to the camera you'll see there's a
little<00:01:30.290> there's<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> core<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:32.130> locking<00:01:32.670> Paul<00:01:33.060> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
little there's a core a locking Paul in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.940 
little there's a core a locking Paul in
there<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:33.990> does<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.259> spring<00:01:34.619> loaders

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
there but it does not spring loaders

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.789 
there but it does not spring loaders
actuated<00:01:35.520> by<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> key<00:01:36.150> itself<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.619> don't

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
actuated by the key itself so we don't

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.280 
actuated by the key itself so we don't
need<00:01:38.009> two<00:01:38.369> locking<00:01:38.939> notches<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.960> one

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
need two locking notches that one

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.170 
need two locking notches that one
rotates<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.189> notch<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.759> we<00:01:42.000> will

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
rotates into that notch and we will

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
rotates into that notch and we will
never<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.810> able<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.979> shim<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
never be able to to shim that out of

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.880 
never be able to to shim that out of
there<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.299> pretty<00:01:45.869> good<00:01:45.990> locking<00:01:46.290> mechanism

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
there so pretty good locking mechanism

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.639 
there so pretty good locking mechanism
very<00:01:47.100> simple<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> let's<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
very simple so let's see what the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.249 
very simple so let's see what the
locking<00:01:50.009> mechanism<00:01:50.549> itself<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
locking mechanism itself is like it is a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.270 
locking mechanism itself is like it is a
y-shaped<00:01:52.759> key<00:01:53.759> way<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.350> for<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.860> usually

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
y-shaped key way and for that I usually

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.160 
y-shaped key way and for that I usually
use<00:01:56.729> bottom<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.450> key<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:57.780> we'll<00:01:57.960> try<00:01:58.140> that

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
use bottom of the key way we'll try that

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.999 
use bottom of the key way we'll try that
first<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.700> picked<00:01:59.969> this<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:01.009> we'll

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
first I have not picked this but we'll

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.010 
first I have not picked this but we'll
see<00:02:02.399> if<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.729> knock<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.659> not

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
see if we can knock it out here and not

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.580 
see if we can knock it out here and not
too<00:02:04.290> much<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:06.200> think<00:02:07.200> that's<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.500> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
too much time I think that's going to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.839 
too much time I think that's going to
work<00:02:07.770> ok

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
work ok

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.850 
work ok

into<00:02:37.269> place<00:02:38.069> might<00:02:39.069> have<00:02:39.459> too<00:02:39.760> much<00:02:39.970> tension

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
into place might have too much tension

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.449 
into place might have too much tension
but<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.430> learning<00:02:42.730> curve<00:02:47.250> okay<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.280> have<00:02:48.430> a

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
but it's a learning curve okay I have a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
fault set it was pin number 2 so all the

fault set it was pin number 2 so all the
way<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.500> rear<00:02:54.420> start<00:02:55.420> feeling<00:02:55.780> around

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
way to the rear start feeling around

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:02.759 
way to the rear start feeling around
within<00:02:56.410> 5<00:03:00.450> get<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.480> little<00:03:01.750> bit<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.930> feedback<00:03:02.140> if

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 
within 5 get a little bit of feedback if

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.860 
within 5 get a little bit of feedback if
you<00:03:02.890> notice<00:03:03.160> my<00:03:03.310> tension<00:03:03.790> wrench<00:03:03.970> there<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:04.510> we

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
you notice my tension wrench there so we

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.690 
you notice my tension wrench there so we
have<00:03:04.989> one<00:03:05.170> security<00:03:05.590> pin<00:03:05.860> looks<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.280> on<00:03:06.459> pin

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
have one security pin looks like on pin

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.539 
have one security pin looks like on pin
5<00:03:07.200> let's<00:03:08.200> see<00:03:08.319> if<00:03:08.380> we<00:03:08.500> can't<00:03:08.739> set<00:03:09.099> hand<00:03:09.400> a

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
5 let's see if we can't set hand a

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.660 
5 let's see if we can't set hand a
little<00:03:09.730> bit<00:03:09.819> of<00:03:09.910> tension<00:03:11.280> pressure<00:03:12.280> on<00:03:12.579> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
little bit of tension pressure on the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.180 
little bit of tension pressure on the
pin<00:03:12.910> release<00:03:13.299> tension<00:03:13.750> and<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.560> think<00:03:15.040> he

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
pin release tension and I think he

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.380 
pin release tension and I think he
locked<00:03:15.670> in<00:03:15.880> place

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
locked in place

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.629 
locked in place
just<00:03:17.079> keep<00:03:17.349> looking<00:03:17.709> here<00:03:17.980> see<00:03:18.250> what<00:03:18.370> else<00:03:18.519> we

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
just keep looking here see what else we

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.370 
just keep looking here see what else we
can<00:03:18.790> find<00:03:18.819> okay<00:03:19.120> I<00:03:19.269> got<00:03:19.480> my<00:03:19.510> fault<00:03:19.870> set<00:03:20.139> back

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
can find okay I got my fault set back

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.699 
can find okay I got my fault set back
with<00:03:20.620> pin<00:03:21.250> 2<00:03:21.549> and<00:03:22.150> I'm<00:03:22.900> trying<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.290> put<00:03:23.560> the

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
with pin 2 and I'm trying to put the

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.470 
with pin 2 and I'm trying to put the
pick<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.190> rear<00:03:24.370> but<00:03:24.549> it's<00:03:24.700> snagging<00:03:25.180> up<00:03:25.299> on

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
pick to the rear but it's snagging up on

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.080 
pick to the rear but it's snagging up on
a<00:03:25.510> low<00:03:25.870> pin<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:27.220> feels<00:03:27.400> like<00:03:27.519> around<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.940> pin

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
a low pin it feels like around the pin

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.300 
a low pin it feels like around the pin
number<00:03:28.450> 3<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:29.319> let's<00:03:29.500> see<00:03:29.620> what<00:03:29.739> he's<00:03:29.889> doing<00:03:30.190> in

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
number 3 so let's see what he's doing in

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.280 
number 3 so let's see what he's doing in
there<00:03:30.400> I'm<00:03:31.060> getting<00:03:31.239> some<00:03:31.480> feedback<00:03:31.510> off<00:03:32.109> of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
there I'm getting some feedback off of

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.440 
there I'm getting some feedback off of
him<00:03:32.500> see<00:03:33.190> if<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.519> send<00:03:33.760> him<00:03:33.970> home

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
him see if we can send him home

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.539 
him see if we can send him home
and<00:03:35.160> there<00:03:36.160> we<00:03:36.280> go<00:03:36.400> we<00:03:36.579> got<00:03:36.670> it<00:03:36.700> open<00:03:37.120> on<00:03:37.299> the

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
and there we go we got it open on the

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.770 
and there we go we got it open on the
the<00:03:39.549> l's<00:03:40.389> it<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:41.380> Deus<00:03:41.650> padlock<00:03:42.510> not<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> bad

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
the l's it to Deus padlock not a bad

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.420 
the l's it to Deus padlock not a bad
little<00:03:43.989> lock<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.560> got<00:03:44.680> at<00:03:44.799> least<00:03:44.829> two

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
little lock it's got at least two

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.550 
little lock it's got at least two
perhaps<00:03:45.940> even<00:03:46.239> three<00:03:46.630> security<00:03:47.049> pins<00:03:47.319> and

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
perhaps even three security pins and

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.440 
perhaps even three security pins and
it's<00:03:48.190> got<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.370> pretty<00:03:48.609> unique<00:03:48.940> locking

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
it's got a pretty unique locking

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.020 
it's got a pretty unique locking
mechanism<00:03:50.109> so<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.620> think<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.489> might<00:03:51.639> use<00:03:51.819> this<00:03:51.970> to

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
mechanism so I think I might use this to

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.610 
mechanism so I think I might use this to
lock<00:03:52.269> up<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.510> toolbox<00:03:52.930> or<00:03:53.139> something<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.500> seems

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
lock up a toolbox or something it seems

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.740 
lock up a toolbox or something it seems
