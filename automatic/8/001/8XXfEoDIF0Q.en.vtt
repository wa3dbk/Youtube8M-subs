00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
circuit board but you're going to put

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.650 
circuit board but you're going to put
wires<00:01:02.640> in<00:01:02.910> there<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.180> you're<00:01:03.300> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> make

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
wires in there so you're going to make

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.719 
wires in there so you're going to make
sure<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.140> take<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.189> solder<00:01:05.430> out<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
sure that you take some solder out of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
sure that you take some solder out of

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that hole to keep it open as you can see

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.000 
that hole to keep it open as you can see
it<00:01:07.740> there's<00:01:08.070> nothing<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:08.659> now<00:01:10.010> there's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it there's nothing in it now there's

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.450 
it there's nothing in it now there's
also<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.900> surface<00:01:12.900> mount<00:01:13.310> resistor<00:01:14.310> right

also a surface mount resistor right

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090 
also a surface mount resistor right
there<00:01:14.900> make<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.380> don't<00:01:16.530> remove<00:01:16.830> that

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
there make sure you don't remove that

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.469 
there make sure you don't remove that
and<00:01:17.400> make<00:01:17.520> sure<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
and make sure that it's on there to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.910 
and make sure that it's on there to
begin<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.810> or<00:01:19.170> else<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.470> isn't<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
begin with or else this isn't going to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280 
begin with or else this isn't going to
work<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.210> it's<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.360> on<00:01:21.600> there<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.229> just

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
work if it's not on there you can just

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.740 
work if it's not on there you can just
solder<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.799> 220<00:01:23.670> ohm<00:01:23.790> resistor<00:01:24.270> between<00:01:24.570> these

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
solder a 220 ohm resistor between these

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.429 
solder a 220 ohm resistor between these
two<00:01:25.250> now<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:27.150> top<00:01:27.479> this<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:27.930> pretty<00:01:28.080> much<00:01:28.170> what

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
two now on top this is pretty much what

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.530 
two now on top this is pretty much what
it<00:01:28.470> looks<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:31.490> now<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.670> order<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.210> this

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
it looks like now in order to get this

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.810 
it looks like now in order to get this
little<00:01:33.869> circuit<00:01:34.259> right<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:35.700> going

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
little circuit right here you're going

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
little circuit right here you're going
to<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.180> take<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.540> regular<00:01:36.810> Kodak<00:01:37.439> funsaver

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
to have to take a regular Kodak funsaver

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.670 
to have to take a regular Kodak funsaver
board<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> cut<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.909> off<00:01:39.259> they<00:01:40.259> keep<00:01:40.500> this

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
board and cut this off they keep this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
board and cut this off they keep this
right<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.340> corner<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.299> should<00:01:42.570> fit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
right in the corner and it should fit

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
right in the corner and it should fit
something<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.470> I've<00:01:43.770> trimmed<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.250> down

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
something like that I've trimmed it down

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.859 
something like that I've trimmed it down
a<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.939> doesn't<00:01:44.970> fit<00:01:45.329> perfectly

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
a bit so it doesn't fit perfectly

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.830 
a bit so it doesn't fit perfectly
blowed<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.920> always<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> corner<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.659> can

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
blowed it's always in the corner you can

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.200 
blowed it's always in the corner you can
cut<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.439> here<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.939> then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
cut right here and right here and then

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.819 
cut right here and right here and then
it<00:01:51.360> will<00:01:51.420> fall<00:01:51.720> right<00:01:51.990> off<00:01:52.049> it'll<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> little

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
it will fall right off it'll be a little

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
it will fall right off it'll be a little
square<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.210> whatever<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.750> do

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
square like this but whatever you do

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899

you<00:03:49.639> want<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.849> see<00:03:50.000> what<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.180> did<00:03:50.389> to<00:03:51.139> my<00:03:51.349> is<00:03:51.709> I

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
you want to see what I did to my is I

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.500 
you want to see what I did to my is I
made<00:03:52.849> these<00:03:54.340> right<00:03:55.340> here

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
made these right here

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.890 
made these right here
I<00:03:56.540> basically<00:03:57.290> potted<00:03:58.040> them<00:03:58.220> inside<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:59.209> film

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
I basically potted them inside a film

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.770 
I basically potted them inside a film
canister<00:04:00.139> it's<00:04:01.099> nicer<00:04:01.909> because<00:04:02.269> it's<00:04:02.510> nice

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
canister it's nicer because it's nice

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.470 
canister it's nicer because it's nice
and<00:04:02.810> tell<00:04:03.169> you<00:04:03.739> can't<00:04:04.040> break<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.519> because

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
and tell you can't break it because

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.080 
and tell you can't break it because
there's<00:04:06.019> some<00:04:06.260> brittle<00:04:06.560> parts<00:04:06.889> on<00:04:07.040> this<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.669> I

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
there's some brittle parts on this so I

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.909 
there's some brittle parts on this so I
recommend<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.109> put<00:04:09.409> this<00:04:09.530> in<00:04:09.709> something

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:09.919 
recommend that you put this in something

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.580 
recommend that you put this in something
and<00:04:10.159> fill<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.489> with<00:04:10.519> hot<00:04:10.760> glue<00:04:10.939> or<00:04:11.319> wax<00:04:12.319> or

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
and fill it with hot glue or wax or

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.050 
and fill it with hot glue or wax or
something<00:04:12.889> like<00:04:12.980> that<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.340> keep<00:04:13.519> it<00:04:13.669> steady

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
something like that to keep it steady

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.189 
something like that to keep it steady
