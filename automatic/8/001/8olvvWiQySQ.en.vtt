00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:11.809
 Hello everyone who nonstop 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.730
 the new short wheat for minecraft is 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.200
 it's about weather and turnÃ© mode and 2 is 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.540
 say a bot that will add us 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.760
 tornados to minecraft is worth the truth is 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.400
 he is very handsome and he is also going to 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.200
 force us to make houses underground 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.390
 ok because if not how he asked us for a 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.980
 Tornado we're going to blow us will 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.200
 destroy everything we have in the 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.700
 surface so I'll quickly go to 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.980
 explain what this mode has and then 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.530
 I will teach you how to install it worth this mod 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.630
 It has a few things worth it has this 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.390
 block called sensor or sensor screw 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.360
 and it also has this sensor siren 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.760
 and then apart you have these options of 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.470
 here that are let's call the demos 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.079
 a kind of demos of how the 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.560
 physics of the way it's worth and we would have 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.150
 also this this surfboard and this 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.650
 vector trip, I'm going to put the 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.630
 vector tree that by the way does not have 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.579
 character or as I tell you is a kind 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.060
 of moss so what is going to serve is going to 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.610
 be for 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.280
 Let's give and it will start to grow 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.040
 tree is worth just as I say it is 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.680
 a way for us to see how they work 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.500
 the physics in this way is worth so if 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 we choose for example this item test 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.220
 greasing games so we choose the item dril 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.530
 going to go down let's give them you see 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.390
 it starts as it has undermined thus saying but 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.630
 you have kenny we got objects or nothing 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.060
 so it looks like download since it has 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.650
 come out as I tell you then those are the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 objects that we are not going to see 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.140
 this is the drill this one creates a 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.520
 little wave here in the grass you see 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.079
 lifts up so to speak the leaves 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.740
 but we're going to go to the 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:51.619
 important that are going to be these two of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.479
 here and this lathe advocate tornadoes are 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.840
 they go to spain we will also teach 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.280
 the surfboard that is so it has 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.920
 it has graph theo, it's worth, we're going to place it 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.840
 here it stays this way we're going to 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.270
 can mount with right click but not 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.549
 we are going to be able to move, it's just us 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.920
 we will be able to move if there is current in 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.709
 the water is to say if we have here some 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.290
 block that and the water is moving this 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.239
 table will move also well after 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.950
 see this let's move on with these 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.040
 blocks we're going to have the first of 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.890
 all this sensor is worth going to be created from 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.660
 this way gold iron and reston so that 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.790
 will serve once it detects a 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.220
 tornado will send a signal of the rest is worth 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.349
 let's put it like that just to 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.329
 let's see and we will also have a 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.920
 mermaid that is going to character this 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.440
 way we're going to need a sensor in the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.230
 half more iron and more rest very well 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.140
 the tornadoes will be created in a 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.480
 natural in the world is worth but now for 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.430
 that you see one I'm going to use this 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.310
 creative tool for what 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.370
 let's see you see also how this wind 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.130
 move the particles you will also be 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.280
 hearing the sound of the wind in the background 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.410
 so now, kids, let's go to 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.990
 try it out let's see how the 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.340
 rest will be very handsome and you'll see 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:13.510
 what poor houses right click 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.459
 and today radio keeps us away you are not hearing 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.920
 of good gone there so we 're 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.830
 turned on to see if it approaches here 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.600
 it is understood but good 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.600
 as you see sensor 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.060
 It's a ballet bar in the pine forest 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.520
 is leaving everything 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.310
 look how you create all the blocks worth 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.890
 he picks them up they start to give for the 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.130
 sent from villagers and now also 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.020
 when it starts it will also start to catch 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.510
 water to drink water you see change color 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.239
 also this is land if you go to 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.550
 around the trees is going to come back 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.540
 of green color I will place another one by 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:58.410
 here is that he is very handsome already when looking 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.510
 what bigger thing is worth as you see 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.880
 leaving this trail and mostly going 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.340
 picking up the blocks as the earth the 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.380
 sand gravel but wood 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.750
 trees but not the stone is worth so 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.360
 if we have a shelter made of stone or 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.549
 inside the earth it will not happen to us 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.290
 nothing right let's try to fiddle 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.790
 because I think this one is very good 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.790
 I had to like that 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.190
 the villagers 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:37.800
 but hey, I wanted him to go through a 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.800
 tree but good kids 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.330
 and I'm going to remove the creative now for 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.330
 what do you see 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:55.010
 and it also takes us to the top when 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.570
 we are in the middle of the ground not very good 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.620
 when we are more or less in the middle 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.840
 of the tornado 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.790
 the sound is muffled like in life 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.840
 real worth so but by the creative 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.010
 before killing me 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:09.530
 just in time kids but it is that 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.740
 very handsome 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:17.240
 so this module mode and so on 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.900
 but well there we have them brought this 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.760
 of the mod 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.890
 I hope you liked it really 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.740
 which is pretty good especially for 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.560
 Give a little more difficulty to 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.910
 play minecraft so nothing else 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.740
 I told you I was going to record a video today 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.360
 to show you the server is now 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.640
 maintenance itself is worth so I'm going 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.980
 to wait two or three hours to see if what 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.660
 they reopen I can record I do the 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.720
 video and see if we can this 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.630
 late-night we do not all play together 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.850
 so nothing said this I hope that you 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.200
 I liked the mold and I tell you I hope 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.610
 that you enjoy any doubt 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.310
 you comment and now 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.340
 now explain to you how it was until now 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.439
 kids to install the swimmer motor 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.000
 We are going to need forge as I did a 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.800
 tutorial explaining I leave the link 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.900
 up here on the left if any 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.550
 I did not have it installed and I'm going to leave you 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.319
 also the forge version in the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.050
 description of the video I leave you also the 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.819
 description of the video the mod is worth it 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.590
 that once installed forge and downloaded 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:15.110
 the bike we are going to come to start 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.479
 to write percentage data app 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.580
 percentage we 're going to go to the folder 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:22.129
 point minecraft and here is a folder 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.099
 call mods ok let's unzip 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:26.539
 our tornado mod with win win 

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:29.479
 winrar or any other type of 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:31.759
 compressor and we appear this puts that 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:35.210
 let's place the contents of this folder 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:37.069
 it's worth inside the mods folder so 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.860
 let's select these four 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.080
 files and we're going to copy them inside 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.879
 our mods folder and it very well 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.849
 we would have the mode installed so 

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:49.099
 let's run minecraft 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.759
 We select the forge profile and we 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.759
 we give to play 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.169
 very well single player create new world 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.169
 creative create 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.280
 ok we're here we're going to give the 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.680
 letter 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.960
 and in the mystery part we will 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.090
 appear the different objects you see the 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.320
 sensor we also have the sirens like this 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.410
 that we can say that it is installed 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.229
 correctly and we will activate one 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.079
 of these tornadoes are worth sales to see what 

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.379
 What's up 

00:07:19.079 --> 00:07:22.379
 up 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:30.940
 the quintal is great and as you can see here 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:34.650
 we would have our tornado 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.650
 and then leaves the trees 

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.030
 so we can not say anything that we have 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.730
 installed correctly 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.610
 the tornado is still 100% destructive 

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:49.120
 so I do not expect you to enjoy it 

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.460
 I hope you make us of the houses and nothing 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.710
 to see if in a few hours I can 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.540
 record the other video to talk about it 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.240
 we talk about the server as I have already 

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:02.700
 said and nothing and see you tonight is worth 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.700
 so nothing kids until then
