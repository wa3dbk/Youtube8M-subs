00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.740
 ah 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.340
 very good to all I bring you a new 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.570
 video about the 1.8 this good I'm 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.070
 a snapshot version but these are 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.220
 characteristics for the future no point 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.239
 8 and good taking advantage of the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.890
 pistons with slim blocks made here a 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.739
 little nonsense but how good is 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.000
 curious is a jump is worth so that 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.680
 let's jump with the boats we could put 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.320
 again turn here there you can 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.780
 enter and just as I was more 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 entertaining 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.890
 because now that I've only put one and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.560
 it's pretty simple to highlight how 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.450
 liked it 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.800
 you can not ride here we go up 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:01.650
 an aquatic amusement park 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.590
 how we come here and we jump 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:08.210
 It's pretty simple just what 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.290
 It carries is two hooks with the rope and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.990
 tornadoes detected we have to put 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 down here the line block with the piston 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.390
 and well this is how you see when 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.480
 it detects happened 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:24.040
 in fact it drives me up 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.520
 sometimes it leaves me 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.020
 and see what else 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.440
 good as it is low down here 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.920
 the mechanism 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.530
 here it is 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.659
 to boost it the repeater can be 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.229
 go down here put some pumpkins because 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.670
 good to cover a little as you see 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 because if water enters because it goes 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.030
 all to hell 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.610
 and nothing then simply connect the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.320
 rest 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.479
 with the piston install line block 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.030
 and that we detect quite simple and 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.010
 good can ride and with this trick and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.510
 a couple of tricks more than good to go for 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.729
 montage internet a park 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.200
 aquatic attractions I do not know when I wait 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.820
 that you have liked and exhibit but more 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.500
 tricks that you do not give line blog that I 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.180
 I really like this new feature 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.070
 that they have put for 1.8 as it is in 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.640
 keep teaching more tricks soon 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.640
 bye
