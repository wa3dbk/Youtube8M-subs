00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.869 
didn't take very long to get that first
pair<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> rage<00:00:43.739> fire<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> was<00:00:44.460> pretty<00:00:44.670> happy

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
do this with the app because I had to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.709 
do this with the app because I had to
bring<00:00:55.680> magic<00:00:55.920> no<00:00:56.219> papers<00:00:56.610> i<00:00:56.640> quickly<00:00:57.360> learned

to our long trips using the axe and all
and<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.360> account<00:01:15.770> at<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.100> start<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.430> was

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
and on this account at the start I was

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
and on this account at the start I was
only<00:01:17.670> doing<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:18.090> war<00:01:18.299> tortoise<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:18.900> bank

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
only doing one war tortoise and our bank

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
only doing one war tortoise and our bank
after<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.890> was<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:20.250> slow<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.520> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
after that but that was a bit slow so I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
after that but that was a bit slow so I
decided<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.630> work<00:01:21.810> towards<00:01:22.170> trips

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
decided to do to work towards trips

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
decided to do to work towards trips
instead<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.159> an<00:01:23.280> hour<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.610> 20<00:01:23.700> minutes

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
instead to about an hour and 20 minutes

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
instead to about an hour and 20 minutes
so<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.810> slower<00:01:25.110> trips<00:01:25.590> than<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.189> used

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so a bit slower trips than what I'm used

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.580 
so a bit slower trips than what I'm used
to<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.060> course<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.540> guys<00:01:27.570> saw<00:01:27.960> my<00:01:28.140> road

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
glaziers but it's pretty even for the

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.449 
glaziers but it's pretty even for the
most<00:03:20.879> part<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.419> if<00:03:21.689> you<00:03:22.349> can<00:03:22.530> average<00:03:22.709> 100

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.249 
most part so if you can average 100
Glaser<00:03:24.150> kills<00:03:24.389> per<00:03:24.509> hour<00:03:24.659> you're<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.169> to

average about 100 Crimson's 100 blues
per<00:03:27.900> hour<00:03:28.049> roughly<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:29.280> very<00:03:29.549> very<00:03:29.879> good

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
per hour roughly so it's very very good

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.179 
per hour roughly so it's very very good
because<00:03:30.449> they<00:03:30.569> drop<00:03:30.780> three<00:03:31.109> charms<00:03:31.709> per<00:03:32.009> every

because they drop three charms per every

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:33.860 
because they drop three charms per every
kill<00:03:32.489> so<00:03:32.699> thirty<00:03:33.000> three<00:03:33.150> percent<00:03:33.209> drop<00:03:33.599> rate

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
kill so thirty three percent drop rate

kill so thirty three percent drop rate
for<00:03:34.049> each<00:03:34.169> charm<00:03:34.590> means<00:03:35.159> you're<00:03:35.400> getting

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
basically a charm at kill so you average

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.819 
basically a charm at kill so you average
