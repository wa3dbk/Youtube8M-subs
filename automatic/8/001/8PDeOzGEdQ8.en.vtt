00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.849 
seems he's like a flash villain and
something<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.140> thought<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.469> kind<00:00:58.649> of<00:00:58.680> cool

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
something I thought was kind of cool

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.869 
something I thought was kind of cool

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
here - lets get a you know a really nice

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.240 
here - lets get a you know a really nice
white<00:01:24.270> paint<00:01:24.780> brush<00:01:25.110> through<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> looks

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
white paint brush through it looks

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.530 
white paint brush through it looks
really<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.549> brings<00:01:26.880> out<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.060> those<00:01:27.270> hairs

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
really good brings out all those hairs

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.289 
really good brings out all those hairs
and<00:01:27.780> everything<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:29.460> got<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> nice<00:01:29.790> sculpt<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and everything it's got a nice sculpt I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.960 
and everything it's got a nice sculpt I
think<00:01:30.920> they've<00:01:31.920> reused<00:01:32.430> some<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.880> these

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
think they've reused some of these

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.480 
think they've reused some of these
pieces<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.689> these<00:01:34.409> arms<00:01:34.799> look<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.100> lot<00:01:35.280> like

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
pieces and these arms look a lot like

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.590 
pieces and these arms look a lot like
ultra<00:01:35.880> Humanite

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
ultra Humanite

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
ultra Humanite
they<00:01:37.439> might<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.680> retooled<00:01:37.979> them<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> little

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
they might have retooled them a little

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
they might have retooled them a little
bit<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.390> look<00:01:39.540> pretty<00:01:39.689> similar<00:01:39.960> as<00:01:40.350> well

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
bit but they look pretty similar as well

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.749 
bit but they look pretty similar as well
as<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> feet

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
as the feet

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
as the feet
I<00:01:41.790> think<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> feet<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.170> same<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> ultra

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
I think the feet are the same this ultra

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.340 
I think the feet are the same this ultra
Humanite<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.090> legs<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.810> legs<00:01:46.200> are

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
Humanite and the legs are the legs are

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.830 
Humanite and the legs are the legs are
different<00:01:46.680> but<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.149> they've<00:01:48.299> reused<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
different but you know they've reused a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.740 
different but you know they've reused a
couple<00:01:49.259> pieces<00:01:49.439> for<00:01:49.770> him<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:51.270> got<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> pretty

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
couple pieces for him but got a pretty

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.690

cool-looking<00:01:51.930> gorilla<00:01:52.560> body<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.579> only

cool-looking gorilla body and the only

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.819 
cool-looking gorilla body and the only
complaint<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.380> kind<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> a

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
complaint I have on it is it's kind of a

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.980 
complaint I have on it is it's kind of a
lightweight<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:57.270> arms<00:01:57.540> are<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.780> nice

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
lightweight the arms are really nice

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.300 
lightweight the arms are really nice
it's<00:01:58.229> solid<00:01:58.560> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> legs<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.270> body<00:02:00.509> is

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
back and forward as well and then you

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.819 
back and forward as well and then you
just<00:03:01.950> get<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.810> hip<00:03:03.810> joints<00:03:04.260> to<00:03:04.319> go<00:03:04.470> up<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
just get the hip joints to go up and

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.000 
just get the hip joints to go up and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
down and his feet swivel and they have

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.500 
down and his feet swivel and they have
that<00:03:08.160> little<00:03:08.370> joint<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.819> there<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.120> it's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
that little joint in there but it's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.789 
that little joint in there but it's
handed<00:03:09.870> by<00:03:10.019> everything<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.590> doesn't

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
handed by everything so it doesn't

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.830 
handed by everything so it doesn't
really<00:03:10.920> do<00:03:11.069> anything<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:12.360> that's<00:03:12.599> about<00:03:12.690> it

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
really do anything and that's about it

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.930 
really do anything and that's about it
probably<00:03:13.739> one<00:03:13.980> of<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.160> few<00:03:14.370> figures<00:03:14.610> that

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
probably one of the few figures that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.210 
probably one of the few figures that
doesn't<00:03:15.299> have<00:03:15.450> big<00:03:16.379> holes<00:03:16.590> on<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:16.890> bottom<00:03:17.129> of

doesn't have big holes on the bottom of
his<00:03:17.310> feet<00:03:17.660> kind<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.780> interesting<00:03:19.170> they're<00:03:20.299> not

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
his feet kind of interesting they're not

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.879 
his feet kind of interesting they're not
like<00:03:21.450> he<00:03:21.569> really<00:03:21.750> needs<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.139> he<00:03:22.230> doesn't<00:03:22.500> stand

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
that great though and he does stand kind

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.099 
that great though and he does stand kind
of<00:03:25.500> funky<00:03:25.829> both<00:03:26.040> feet<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.880> don't<00:03:27.690> really<00:03:27.840> go

level but a definitely cool collecting
connect<00:03:38.639> figure<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.030> like<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.239> said<00:03:39.420> I<00:03:39.450> don't

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
connect figure and like I said I don't

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.140 
connect figure and like I said I don't
remember<00:03:39.720> what<00:03:39.959> series<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.440> was<00:03:40.530> from<00:03:40.739> but<00:03:40.950> uh
