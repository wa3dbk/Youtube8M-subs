well<00:00:27.680> after<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.130> first<00:00:28.370> moto<00:00:28.670> we<00:00:29.200> discovered

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
well after the first moto we discovered

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.140 
well after the first moto we discovered
physically<00:00:30.830> where<00:00:31.040> we're<00:00:31.190> at<00:00:31.310> with<00:00:31.490> James<00:00:31.790> I

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
physically where we're at with James I

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.830 
physically where we're at with James I
think<00:00:32.650> we<00:00:33.650> got<00:00:33.800> into<00:00:34.040> the<00:00:34.130> Moto<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.840> we've

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
think we got into the Moto and we've

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.530 
think we got into the Moto and we've
made<00:00:36.020> progress<00:00:36.340> since<00:00:37.340> he<00:00:37.940> first<00:00:38.180> heard<00:00:38.360> it

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
made progress since he first heard it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.920 
made progress since he first heard it
but<00:00:38.750> we're<00:00:39.080> still<00:00:39.290> not<00:00:39.470> that<00:00:39.650> one<00:00:39.890> percent<00:00:40.930> we

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
but we're still not that one percent we

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.390 
but we're still not that one percent we
got<00:00:42.080> to<00:00:42.170> build<00:00:42.260> our<00:00:42.440> conditioning<00:00:42.950> back<00:00:43.160> up

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
got to build our conditioning back up

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.850 
got to build our conditioning back up
earlier<00:00:44.390> this<00:00:44.600> season<00:00:44.780> James<00:00:45.199> went<00:00:45.410> down<00:00:45.590> hard

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
earlier this season James went down hard

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.070 
earlier this season James went down hard
and<00:00:46.100> sustained<00:00:46.520> injuries<00:00:46.940> to<00:00:47.059> his<00:00:47.180> wrist<00:00:47.420> even

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
and sustained injuries to his wrist even

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.140 
and sustained injuries to his wrist even
after<00:00:48.290> four<00:00:48.500> weeks<00:00:48.620> of<00:00:48.800> rehab<00:00:48.980> he<00:00:49.640> wasn't<00:00:50.000> back

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
after four weeks of rehab he wasn't back

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.180 
after four weeks of rehab he wasn't back
to<00:00:50.270> 100

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
to 100

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.000 
to 100
I<00:00:51.570> think<00:00:52.570> he<00:00:52.629> also<00:00:52.780> realizes<00:00:53.289> you<00:00:53.739> know<00:00:53.829> these

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
I think he also realizes you know these

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.759 
I think he also realizes you know these
guys<00:00:54.250> have<00:00:54.519> been<00:00:54.670> racing<00:00:55.600> all<00:00:55.690> along<00:00:56.019> and<00:00:56.410> then

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
guys have been racing all along and then

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.939 
guys have been racing all along and then
we<00:00:56.890> lost<00:00:57.780> basically<00:00:58.780> four<00:00:59.109> good<00:00:59.350> weeks<00:00:59.589> there

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
we lost basically four good weeks there

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.910 
we lost basically four good weeks there
so<00:01:00.610> it's<00:01:01.539> gonna<00:01:01.659> take<00:01:01.989> probably<00:01:02.199> about<00:01:02.649> three

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
so it's gonna take probably about three

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.109 
so it's gonna take probably about three
or<00:01:02.949> four<00:01:03.159> weeks<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.519> get<00:01:03.610> back<00:01:03.789> to<00:01:03.940> where<00:01:04.089> we

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
or four weeks to get back to where we

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.840 
or four weeks to get back to where we
were<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:05.379> realistic<00:01:06.070> about<00:01:06.460> it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
were but realistic about it

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.460 
were but realistic about it
we'll<00:01:07.090> just<00:01:07.299> take<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.540> day-by-day<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:08.170> keep

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
we'll just take a day-by-day and keep

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.109 
we'll just take a day-by-day and keep

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
thought I'd be a little bit better in

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:11.220 
thought I'd be a little bit better in
this<00:04:03.820> but

strength<00:06:16.090> to<00:06:17.090> me<00:06:17.240> just<00:06:17.480> wasn't<00:06:17.780> worth<00:06:17.930> it

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
strength to me just wasn't worth it

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.340
