 limitations I think I saw a hotel near 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.840

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.510
 we wait 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.020
 I want to ask you some questions 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.290
 I do not understand much I know how old 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.960
 you have I am 13 years old 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.869
 I am 14 years old but as they leave you 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.700
 go out on the street so young good I just 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.920
 I live with my mom since my father 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.200
 she died and she gave me permission to leave in 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.570
 this trip since I'm on vacation from 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.970
 the clear school gave me money clothes 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.580
 extra things that I need and I take them in 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.850
 my pocket and you because you are alone 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.550
 also good my father is a person 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.590
 very busy does not let me do anything like that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.319
 who told me that if I wanted to be a 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.709
 stronger should win it on my own 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.019
 account and gave me permission to go on a trip 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:21.050
 seriously, it's very interesting to what 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.660
 your dad is dedicated I prefer to keep it in 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.739
 secret for now but I have one last 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.760
 ask why you travel with straight that's 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.310
 very easy 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.170
 you'll see his card shop went bankrupt so 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.450
 he needs money to reopen it 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.610
 one of the awards of the angel tournament 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.500
 an ice cream is ten thousand dollars so 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.319
 I have two reasons to win the tournament 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.180
 one is to help the ex and the other is to earn it 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.019
 to be closer to being the king of 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.660
 the duels king of the duels and driver I know 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.660
 that we are friends but it will take years to be 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.090
 the king of duels well if the boss 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.450
 think you're an interesting dualist 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.670
 let's see if it's true there's no way 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.269
 that you can summon a real monster 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.129
 to one that is not a simple hologram 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.120
 right now invoke a small test 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.160
 for you 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.470
 let's see how you react 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.720
 of course I will be the king of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.860
 the duels alone that will take a certain 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.860
 time to become 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.439
 do not 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.450
 but what is that I be what thing 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.690
 but that monsters are not supposed to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.360
 they are only in the duels but as 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.250
 made real, I'm not going to stay for 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.250
 find out josep let's go now 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.740
 or not 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:57.060
 wait, that's my culture, but what 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.010
 heck, you're supposed to have 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.740
 an energy to be able to invoke a 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:05.430
 real monster where did he get that 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.200
 energy as it invokes this is to grow not 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.300
 I know but it 's my opportunity 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.840
 uribe throw a ball of darkness 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.840
 isolated 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.230
 or not uribe uribe rapid multiplication 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.520
 incredible the curved absorbed the 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.520
 impact 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.780
 or not with devils where rex will be 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.550
 They are slow to take care of me and all because a 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.050
 guy started to annoy the 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.130
 receptionist god what stressful 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.730
 surely woman is having it 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.140
 well bored also now cube launches 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.140
 you several balls of darkness 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.140
 and be careful with the buildings 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.799
 hell, I feel a great pain as if 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.559
 who just had just q Libolo 

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:19.899
 feel like it seems that your energy 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:22.649
 vital is what makes code follow 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:26.679
 foot remember to see that this is not a flight 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:29.399
 it's true this is not a duel now I know 

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:29.399
 what I have to do 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.639
 now you live multiplication again 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:44.469
 again it will be of no use to be 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:44.469
 doing the same 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.680
 do it 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.460
 curse I could feel that blow I do not know 

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:09.830
 how the hell that boy got the 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.669
 energy to summon a monster but 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.830
 I'm going to find out I can not believe it 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.830
 yesiiiii I beat that monster and everything 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.479
 thanks to that little ass I wonder how 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.240
 I will have invoked and why was my 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.610
 vital energy related to forgiveness 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.669
 for taking me is that the mixed region does not 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.129
 I wanted to attend, I lost something 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:34.129
 Do you have any idea what just happened? 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:36.409
 we will tell you at the hotel but on the way 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:40.520
 to the hotel tell me how old you are 'breaks' 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:42.469
 I'm 20 years old seriously this was very 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.439
 rare but the best thing will be to go with my 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:47.629
 boss friends and I just did the 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:50.330
 test that child and not only proved 

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:54.129
 have potential in the duels but that 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.779
 is able to summon monsters seriously 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:00.139
 interesting this child proved to be more 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:03.159
 capable of what I imagined then will be of 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.159
 great help in my plan 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.430
 hehehe I think they finally saw a 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.650
 episode that is not exactly not about 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.840
 of only duels and here they go as always 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.050
 the questions that evaluation serves me 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.600
 and to improve the following episodes 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:22.630
 what did you think about the episode that 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.810
 They seemed the characters waiting for the 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.940
 next episode if you liked this
