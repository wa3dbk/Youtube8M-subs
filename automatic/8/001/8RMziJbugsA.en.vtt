would say you should do this hairstyle
when<00:00:54.290> your<00:00:55.220> hair's<00:00:55.579> not<00:00:56.060> freshly<00:00:56.630> washed<00:00:57.200> it

can<00:00:58.160> hold<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.730> hairstyle<00:00:59.450> way<00:00:59.809> better<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.649> has

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
can hold the hairstyle way better it has

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.210 
can hold the hairstyle way better it has
no<00:01:01.130> grip<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:01.880> more<00:01:02.420> texture<00:01:03.260> when<00:01:03.829> your<00:01:03.980> hair

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
no grip and more texture when your hair

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.730 
no grip and more texture when your hair
hasn't<00:01:04.519> been<00:01:04.790> watch<00:01:05.089> for<00:01:05.119> two<00:01:05.829> to<00:01:06.829> three<00:01:06.860> days

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
hasn't been watch for two to three days

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.590 
hasn't been watch for two to three days
so<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.770> would<00:01:10.219> say<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.850> should<00:01:10.880> do<00:01:11.479> this

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
so I would say you should do this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.410 
so I would say you should do this
hairstyle<00:01:11.960> when<00:01:12.409> your<00:01:12.649> hair's<00:01:12.979> nap<00:01:13.420> freshly

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.399 
hairstyle when your hair's nap freshly
washed<00:01:14.890> so<00:01:15.890> it's<00:01:16.040> not<00:01:16.250> slippery<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.409> sloppy

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
washed so it's not slippery and sloppy

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.459 
washed so it's not slippery and sloppy
if<00:01:19.090> you<00:01:20.090> want<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.389> learn<00:01:20.569> how<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.990> get<00:01:21.259> this

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
so the first thing I like to do is to

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.960 
so the first thing I like to do is to
brush<00:01:32.990> through<00:01:33.020> my<00:01:33.350> hair<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.010> make<00:01:34.940> sure

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.200
