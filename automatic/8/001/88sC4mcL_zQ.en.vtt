Clarisonic I had to buy a new one

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.210 
Clarisonic I had to buy a new one
because<00:04:47.930> my<00:04:48.080> other<00:04:48.200> one<00:04:48.320> broke<00:04:48.650> down<00:04:48.860> on<00:04:49.070> me

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
because my other one broke down on me

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.640 
because my other one broke down on me
and<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:50.060> really<00:04:50.390> think<00:04:50.570> it<00:04:50.750> was<00:04:50.840> because<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.530> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
and I really think it was because of the

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.440 
and I really think it was because of the
face<00:04:51.860> wash<00:04:52.070> I<00:04:52.250> was<00:04:52.400> using<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.940> had<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.270> little

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
face wash I was using it had the little

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.140 
face wash I was using it had the little
exfoliating<00:04:54.200> beads<00:04:54.320> in<00:04:54.530> it<00:04:54.650> and<00:04:54.860> I<00:04:55.700> think<00:04:55.910> it

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
exfoliating beads in it and I think it

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.540 
exfoliating beads in it and I think it
may<00:04:56.300> have<00:04:56.420> just<00:04:56.450> killed<00:04:56.840> it<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:57.200> don't<00:04:58.130> do<00:04:58.340> that

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
may have just killed it so don't do that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.300 
may have just killed it so don't do that
