00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.730 

after<00:01:11.240> you've<00:01:11.450> traced<00:01:11.840> out<00:01:12.110> both<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:12.590> your

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
after you've traced out both of your

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.289 
after you've traced out both of your
ears<00:01:13.039> you're<00:01:13.369> going<00:01:13.610> to<00:01:13.670> take<00:01:13.789> some<00:01:14.030> scissors

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
ears you're going to take some scissors

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.630 
ears you're going to take some scissors
or<00:01:14.990> if<00:01:15.409> you<00:01:15.500> have<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.649> styrofoam<00:01:16.189> cutter<00:01:16.460> this

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
or if you have a styrofoam cutter this

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.090 
or if you have a styrofoam cutter this
would<00:01:16.820> probably<00:01:17.299> be<00:01:17.420> easier<00:01:17.600> but<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.079> didn't<00:01:18.560> so

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
would probably be easier but I didn't so

I'm taking my scissors and kind of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.600

that<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.310> want<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:01.789> you<00:02:02.090> actually<00:02:02.299> need<00:02:02.810> to

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
that you want and you actually need to

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.319 
that you want and you actually need to
trace<00:02:03.289> out<00:02:03.530> about<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:03.950> half<00:02:04.310> inch<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.880> an<00:02:05.000> inch

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
trace out about a half inch to an inch

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.039 
trace out about a half inch to an inch
outside<00:02:05.899> of<00:02:06.709> your<00:02:07.039> template<00:02:07.579> and<00:02:07.840> you'll<00:02:08.840> see

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
outside of your template and you'll see

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.719 
outside of your template and you'll see
why<00:02:09.229> in<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.410> second<00:02:09.829> what<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.310> for<00:02:10.549> it's

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
why in a second what this is for it's

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.699 
why in a second what this is for it's
basically<00:02:11.030> just<00:02:11.150> some<00:02:11.750> extra<00:02:12.110> room<00:02:12.440> to

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
basically just some extra room to

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.280 
basically just some extra room to
actually<00:02:12.950> wrap<00:02:13.400> around<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.940> ear<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:15.170> am

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
actually wrap around the ear and I am

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.879 
actually wrap around the ear and I am
cutting<00:02:15.620> out<00:02:16.100> my<00:02:16.160> fabric<00:02:17.260> folded<00:02:18.260> in<00:02:18.380> half<00:02:18.530> so

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:18.889 
cutting out my fabric folded in half so

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.280 
cutting out my fabric folded in half so
that<00:02:19.010> way<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.489> two<00:02:19.940> sides<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:21.170> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
that way you have two sides to the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.750 
that way you have two sides to the
fabric<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.769> you're<00:02:21.920> cutting<00:02:22.250> out<00:02:22.400> and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
fabric that you're cutting out and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.280 
fabric that you're cutting out and
you're<00:02:23.150> going<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.329> do<00:02:23.450> two<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.660> those<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.260> that

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
you're going to do two of those so that

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.280 
you're going to do two of those so that
you<00:02:24.560> have<00:02:24.769> four<00:02:25.579> little<00:02:25.940> fabric<00:02:26.299> pieces<00:02:26.840> total

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
you have four little fabric pieces total

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.809 
you have four little fabric pieces total
so<00:02:27.590> basically<00:02:28.100> two<00:02:28.310> sides<00:02:28.609> for<00:02:28.910> each<00:02:29.090> ear

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.670 

in<00:02:32.819> taking<00:02:33.240> my<00:02:33.360> styrofoam<00:02:33.959> I'm<00:02:34.170> gonna<00:02:34.319> spray

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
in taking my styrofoam I'm gonna spray

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.280 
in taking my styrofoam I'm gonna spray
some<00:02:34.709> spray<00:02:35.459> glue<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.000> one<00:02:36.030> side<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.870> I'm
