kind<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.190> bad<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:18.270> now<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.220> just<00:02:20.370> kind

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
kind of bad right now so you just kind

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.940 
kind of bad right now so you just kind
of<00:02:20.640> wait<00:02:20.760> for<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.090> load<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.530> actually

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
of wait for it to load this is actually

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.250 
of wait for it to load this is actually
really<00:02:23.340> basic<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:24.660> kind<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.989> weird

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
really basic it's just kind of a weird

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.890 
really basic it's just kind of a weird
way<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.530> do<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.239> basically<00:02:27.630> two

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
way to do it it's it's basically two

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.220 
way to do it it's it's basically two
commands<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:30.750> just<00:02:30.989> select<00:02:31.739> which<00:02:32.100> one

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
commands so you just select which one

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:40.970 
commands so you just select which one
okay<00:02:34.230> let's<00:02:34.790> say<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.989> I<00:02:37.010> want<00:02:39.110> let's<00:02:40.110> let's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
okay let's say that I want let's let's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.350 
okay let's say that I want let's let's
say<00:02:41.280> that<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.940> die<00:02:42.060> right<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:44.269> what<00:02:45.269> you're

you go they're frozen in midair and now
everybody's<00:03:43.290> like<00:03:43.530> oh<00:03:43.950> well<00:03:44.549> I<00:03:44.579> can<00:03:44.760> do<00:03:44.880> that

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
everybody's like oh well I can do that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.150 
everybody's like oh well I can do that
in<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.180> demo<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.720> will<00:03:45.930> not<00:03:46.109> show<00:03:46.380> up<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.739> demos

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
in a demo this will not show up in demos

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.640 
in a demo this will not show up in demos
it<00:03:47.760> will<00:03:47.910> just<00:03:48.120> stay<00:03:48.390> like<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
it will just stay like this so the

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.800 
it will just stay like this so the
easiest<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.519> probably<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:51.209> fastest<00:03:51.630> way<00:03:51.780> to

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
easiest and probably the fastest way to

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.729 
easiest and probably the fastest way to
record<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.320> cinematic<00:03:52.799> like<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:54.739> CG

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
record a cinematic like this is CG

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.840 
record a cinematic like this is CG
underscore<00:03:56.579> draw<00:03:56.940> gun<00:03:57.269> zero<00:03:58.400> I'll<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.640> push

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
underscore draw gun zero I'll just push

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.110 
underscore draw gun zero I'll just push
nine<00:04:00.120> on<00:04:00.329> cut<00:04:00.540> TV<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.130> then<00:04:02.130> no<00:04:02.310> clip<00:04:02.549> for<00:04:02.970> your

nine on cut TV and then no clip for your

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.150 
nine on cut TV and then no clip for your
things<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.780> use<00:04:04.319> if<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.859> want<00:04:05.040> better

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
things I use if you want better

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.800 
things I use if you want better
cinematics<00:04:06.030> use<00:04:06.479> CG<00:04:07.079> five<00:04:08.010> scale<00:04:08.489> point<00:04:09.150> two

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
cinematics use CG five scale point two

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.530 
cinematics use CG five scale point two
two<00:04:10.169> four<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.799> use<00:04:11.040> point<00:04:11.489> three

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
two four I use point three

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:21.439 
two four I use point three
so<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.489> execute<00:04:14.489> our<00:04:14.580> config<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.609> let's<00:04:21.030> let's

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
so and execute our config so let's let's

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.129 
so and execute our config so let's let's
make<00:04:21.750> it<00:04:22.010> boom<00:04:23.010> boom<00:04:23.520> boom<00:04:24.000> boom<00:04:24.419> boom

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
make it boom boom boom boom boom

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.070 
make it boom boom boom boom boom
okay<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.060> execute<00:04:27.060> configure<00:04:27.750> yeah<00:04:27.930> because

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
okay so execute configure yeah because

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.300 
okay so execute configure yeah because
it<00:04:28.260> resets<00:04:28.740> all<00:04:28.919> that<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:30.169> let's<00:04:31.169> see<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:32.250> you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
it resets all that and let's see so you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.580 
it resets all that and let's see so you
push<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.820> on<00:04:33.120> your<00:04:33.360> thing<00:04:33.570> and<00:04:33.810> what<00:04:34.500> you're

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
push to on your thing and what you're

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.000 
push to on your thing and what you're
gonna<00:04:34.680> do<00:04:34.949> is<00:04:35.360> on<00:04:36.360> your<00:04:36.419> number<00:04:36.870> pad<00:04:36.900> it's<00:04:37.710> just

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
gonna do is on your number pad it's just

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.120 
gonna do is on your number pad it's just
like<00:04:38.160> in<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.400> demo<00:04:38.760> just<00:04:39.389> push<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.870> and<00:04:40.169> then

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
like in a demo just push to and then

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.820 
like in a demo just push to and then
when<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.520> starts<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.090> just<00:04:42.270> push<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:43.560> on<00:04:43.710> your

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
when it starts you just push to on your

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.620 
when it starts you just push to on your
number<00:04:44.039> pad<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.340> slow<00:04:44.520> it<00:04:44.610> down<00:04:44.669> and<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.479> just

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
number pad to slow it down and you just

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.969 
number pad to slow it down and you just
record<00:04:45.990> with<00:04:46.110> fraps<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.650> like<00:04:46.800> if<00:04:46.889> you're

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
record with fraps so like if you're

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.330 
record with fraps so like if you're
doing<00:04:47.070> 500<00:04:47.550> FPS<00:04:47.910> just<00:04:48.330> do<00:04:48.419> 50<00:04:48.780> and<00:04:49.229> this<00:04:50.190> is

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
doing 500 FPS just do 50 and this is

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.480 
doing 500 FPS just do 50 and this is
basically<00:04:50.760> all<00:04:51.180> that<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.810> to<00:04:51.960> do<00:04:52.110> and

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
basically all that you have to do and

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.550 
basically all that you have to do and
then<00:04:53.490> after<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.449> just<00:04:54.870> thought<00:04:55.020> in<00:04:55.199> v-dub

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
then after this I just thought in v-dub

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.800 
then after this I just thought in v-dub
and<00:04:55.830> you're<00:04:56.070> good<00:04:56.310> you<00:04:56.940> now<00:04:57.060> have<00:04:57.300> yourself<00:04:57.660> a

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.110 
and you're good you now have yourself a
good<00:04:58.320> cinematic<00:04:58.919> with<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.160> frozen<00:04:59.550> character

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
good cinematic with a frozen character

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.270

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
and if you're if you want to see an

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.070 
and if you're if you want to see an
example<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.850> what<00:05:03.030> I<00:05:03.060> mean<00:05:03.300> by<00:05:03.360> if<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.960> go

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
example of what I mean by if you go

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.379 
example of what I mean by if you go
through<00:05:04.289> a<00:05:04.320> surface<00:05:04.560> it<00:05:05.010> resets<00:05:05.639> just<00:05:06.240> go

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
through a surface it resets just go

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:14.480 
through a surface it resets just go
underground<00:05:06.810> or<00:05:10.340> this<00:05:11.419> and<00:05:12.470> boom<00:05:13.470> lays<00:05:14.220> on<00:05:14.400> the

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
underground or this and boom lays on the

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.089 
underground or this and boom lays on the
ground<00:05:15.020> so<00:05:16.020> that's<00:05:16.949> basically<00:05:17.789> the<00:05:18.949> 100%<00:05:19.949> way

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
ground so that's basically the 100% way

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.300 
ground so that's basically the 100% way
