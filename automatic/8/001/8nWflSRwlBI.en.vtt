hopefully<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.369> bases<00:00:23.789> are<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.119> ridiculous

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
hopefully these bases are not ridiculous

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
hopefully these bases are not ridiculous
um<00:00:26.779> one<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.109> could<00:00:28.230> make<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.380> base<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
um one thing that could make this base a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
um one thing that could make this base a
little<00:00:29.130> bit<00:00:29.340> less<00:00:29.640> ridiculous<00:00:30.269> actually<00:00:30.720> not

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
little bit less ridiculous actually not

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.549 
little bit less ridiculous actually not
using<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.470> readers<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.160> was<00:00:32.309> just<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.820> oh<00:00:33.559> its

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
using all readers that was just a oh its

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.860 
using all readers that was just a oh its
first<00:00:34.860> secret<00:00:35.340> strategy<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> was<00:00:36.690> gonna

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
first secret strategy that I was gonna

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.470 
first secret strategy that I was gonna
use<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.500> don't<00:00:37.770> wish<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.610> real<00:00:39.210> just

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
use that I don't wish to real just

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.150 
use that I don't wish to real just
kidding<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:39.780> no<00:00:39.899> secret<00:00:40.170> strategy<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.980> was

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
kidding it's no secret strategy I was

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.310 
kidding it's no secret strategy I was
just<00:00:41.309> getting<00:00:41.579> some<00:00:41.760> gold<00:00:41.969> okay<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:43.050> getting

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
just getting some gold okay just getting

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.810 
just getting some gold okay just getting
some<00:00:43.469> gold<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.890> we're<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.370> able<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.640> beat

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
some gold so we're gonna be able to beat

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
some gold so we're gonna be able to beat
this<00:00:44.969> base<00:00:45.210> pretty<00:00:45.510> easily<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.500> too

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
this base pretty easily so I'm not too

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.670 
this base pretty easily so I'm not too
concerned<00:00:47.420> I'm<00:00:48.420> actually<00:00:48.629> thinking<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.289> for

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
concerned I'm actually thinking that for

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.100 
concerned I'm actually thinking that for
these<00:00:49.829> daily<00:00:50.190> quests<00:00:50.520> Admiral<00:00:51.090> Lee<00:00:51.360> although

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
these daily quests Admiral Lee although

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.779 
these daily quests Admiral Lee although
he<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.410> probably<00:00:52.710> one<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.160> least<00:00:53.280> use

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
he is probably one of my least use

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.729 
he is probably one of my least use
ancient<00:00:54.059> he<00:00:54.420> might<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.780> actually<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.530> good

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
ancient he might be actually really good

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.040 
ancient he might be actually really good
for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.180> sea<00:00:57.390> goose<00:00:57.570> horizon

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
for the the sea goose horizon

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
for the the sea goose horizon
specifically<00:00:58.710> daily<00:00:59.010> quest<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.670> he<00:00:59.879> does

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
specifically daily quest because he does

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.540 
specifically daily quest because he does
just<00:01:00.539> snipe<00:01:01.230> off<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.710> struggle<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.309> kind

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
just snipe off the struggle that's kind

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.700 
just snipe off the struggle that's kind
of<00:01:02.579> his<00:01:02.699> main<00:01:02.910> focus<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.660> focus<00:01:03.989> down<00:01:04.439> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
of his main focus you can focus down a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
of his main focus you can focus down a
stronghold<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> out<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
stronghold and take it out so if it's a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
stronghold and take it out so if it's a
little<00:01:07.320> bit<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> difficult<00:01:08.189> based<00:01:08.490> I

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
little bit more of a difficult based I

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609 
little bit more of a difficult based I
could<00:01:09.060> definitely<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.510> how<00:01:09.960> he<00:01:10.020> could<00:01:10.409> be

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
could definitely see how he could be

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
could definitely see how he could be
effective<00:01:11.280> for<00:01:11.880> something<00:01:12.330> like<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.689> now

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
effective for something like that now

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.260 
effective for something like that now
have<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.400> experimented<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.610> him<00:01:14.760> like<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> said

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
have I experimented with him like I said

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.969 
have I experimented with him like I said
have<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.080> experimented<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.680> him<00:01:16.830> too

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
have a really experimented with him too

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.469 
have a really experimented with him too
much<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.400> already<00:01:17.700> strong<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.119> 12<00:01:18.360> oh

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
much this is already strong all 12 oh

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.179 
much this is already strong all 12 oh
boy<00:01:18.720> we're<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.229> difficult<00:01:19.680> running<00:01:20.040> here

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
boy we're in for difficult running here

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
boy we're in for difficult running here
boys<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.390> could<00:01:21.540> end<00:01:21.689> up<00:01:21.869> terribly<00:01:22.229> once

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
boys so this could end up terribly once

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
boys so this could end up terribly once
again<00:01:22.860> my<00:01:23.490> honor<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.909> suppose<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.750> too

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
again my honor I suppose is just too

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
again my honor I suppose is just too
high<00:01:25.170> for<00:01:25.590> my<00:01:25.740> stronghold<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.549> making

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
high for my stronghold and that's making

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880 
high for my stronghold and that's making
it<00:01:27.060> difficult<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.630> me<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.770> know

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it difficult for me to get you know

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.819 
it difficult for me to get you know
basis<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.640> i<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.270> actually<00:01:30.650> defeat<00:01:31.650> now

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
basis that I i can actually defeat now

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.800 
basis that I i can actually defeat now
this<00:01:32.130> base<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.369> very<00:01:32.549> defeatable<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
this base is very defeatable and I this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.170 
this base is very defeatable and I this
is<00:01:33.960> something<00:01:34.560> realistic<00:01:35.009> towards<00:01:36.000> what<00:01:36.150> I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
is something realistic towards what I

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
is something realistic towards what I
would<00:01:36.390> get<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> multiplayer<00:01:37.380> match<00:01:37.770> however

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
which way so we're gonna do it to start

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
which way so we're gonna do it to start
off<00:02:12.959> as<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.230> tack

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
off as a tack

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.400 
off as a tack
from<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.190> direction<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.030> try<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.960> see<00:02:16.200> if<00:02:16.350> we

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
from this direction and try to see if we

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.230 
from this direction and try to see if we
could<00:02:16.470> take<00:02:16.770> out<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.520> first<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.090> all<00:02:18.180> all

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
could take out this first of all all

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.510 
could take out this first of all all
this<00:02:18.480> trash<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.200> second<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.740> all<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
this trash and then second of all that

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.400 
this trash and then second of all that
catapult<00:02:21.150> over<00:02:21.450> there<00:02:21.600> which<00:02:21.780> is<00:02:21.810> next<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.320> the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
catapult over there which is next to the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.830 
catapult over there which is next to the
Primus<00:02:22.950> conduit<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.610> I'm<00:02:23.700> thinking<00:02:24.120> for<00:02:24.600> able

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
Primus conduit so I'm thinking for able

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.600 
Primus conduit so I'm thinking for able
to<00:02:24.900> take<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.110> out<00:02:25.350> while<00:02:25.650> taking<00:02:26.070> barely<00:02:26.460> any

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
to take that out while taking barely any

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.760 
to take that out while taking barely any
damage<00:02:27.120> or<00:02:27.270> just<00:02:27.540> taking<00:02:27.870> damage<00:02:28.110> from<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
damage or just taking damage from the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.500 
damage or just taking damage from the
spell<00:02:29.370> tower<00:02:29.610> which<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.970> see<00:02:30.150> right<00:02:30.180> here

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
spell tower which you see right here

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.390 
spell tower which you see right here
it's<00:02:30.660> doing<00:02:30.900> barely<00:02:31.110> anything<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.710> us<00:02:31.860> we

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
it's doing barely anything to us we

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.070 
it's doing barely anything to us we
could<00:02:32.550> potentially<00:02:32.610> put<00:02:33.210> ourselves<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.930> a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
could potentially put ourselves in a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.630 
could potentially put ourselves in a
great<00:02:34.320> position<00:02:34.440> okay<00:02:34.800> we<00:02:34.980> were<00:02:35.160> able<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.550> do

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
great position okay we were able to do

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.340 
great position okay we were able to do
that<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.210> I'm<00:02:36.270> going<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.420> do<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.540> couple<00:02:36.810> flybys

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
that so I'm going to do a couple flybys

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.250 
that so I'm going to do a couple flybys
with<00:02:37.980> this<00:02:38.340> caria<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.540> let's<00:02:39.720> see<00:02:39.930> how<00:02:40.200> this

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
with this caria and let's see how this

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.820 
with this caria and let's see how this
goes<00:02:41.600> let's<00:02:42.600> see<00:02:42.750> how<00:02:42.930> much<00:02:43.080> how<00:02:43.770> many

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
goes let's see how much how many

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.080 
goes let's see how much how many
structures<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.400> could<00:02:44.520> actually<00:02:44.640> take<00:02:44.910> out

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
structures we could actually take out

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.610 
structures we could actually take out
okay<00:02:45.210> so<00:02:45.270> we<00:02:45.510> did<00:02:45.690> get<00:02:45.810> taken<00:02:46.140> out<00:02:46.230> over<00:02:46.470> there

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
okay so we did get taken out over there

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.090 
okay so we did get taken out over there
I'm<00:02:46.950> gonna<00:02:47.460> place<00:02:47.850> down<00:02:48.150> our<00:02:48.770> wardens<00:02:49.770> over

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
I'm gonna place down our wardens over

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.130 
I'm gonna place down our wardens over

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
freeze out on the entire base and we

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.080 
freeze out on the entire base and we
should<00:02:58.680> be<00:02:58.770> able<00:02:58.830> to<00:02:59.040> focus<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.370> down<00:02:59.670> the
