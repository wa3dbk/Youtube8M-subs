00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.140 

it<00:03:18.410> really<00:03:18.710> reminds<00:03:19.070> me<00:03:19.130> of<00:03:19.250> those<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.460> Book<00:03:20.030> of

it really reminds me of those a Book of

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.790 
it really reminds me of those a Book of
the<00:03:20.210> Dead<00:03:20.300> editions<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:20.960> Evil<00:03:21.200> Dead<00:03:21.320> 1<00:03:21.560> &amp;<00:03:21.680> 2

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
the Dead editions of Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.770 
the Dead editions of Evil Dead 1 &amp; 2
where<00:03:22.010> if<00:03:22.070> you<00:03:22.160> press<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.550> IH<00:03:22.880> screams<00:03:23.270> that's

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
where if you press the IH screams that's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.330 
where if you press the IH screams that's
what<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.080> reminds<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.710> for<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.070> alone

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
what it reminds you of it for that alone

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.590 
what it reminds you of it for that alone
it's<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.610> really<00:03:25.880> awesome<00:03:25.910> set

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
it's a really awesome set

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.390 
it's a really awesome set
I<00:03:26.630> picked<00:03:26.960> this<00:03:27.020> up<00:03:27.200> for<00:03:27.410> about<00:03:27.500> $30<00:03:28.220> and

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
I picked this up for about $30 and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.500 
I picked this up for about $30 and
that's<00:03:28.520> because<00:03:28.760> my<00:03:28.880> brother<00:03:29.090> had<00:03:29.270> a<00:03:29.300> coupon

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
that's because my brother had a coupon

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.260 
that's because my brother had a coupon
for<00:03:29.900> about<00:03:30.110> 20<00:03:30.650> percent<00:03:31.010> off<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.370> believe<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.000> I

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
for about 20 percent off I believe so I

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.090 
for about 20 percent off I believe so I
recommend<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.870> Philly<00:03:33.440> stock<00:03:33.710> up<00:03:33.860> because<00:03:34.010> I

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
recommend you Philly stock up because I

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.260 
recommend you Philly stock up because I
believe<00:03:34.460> they're<00:03:34.670> selling<00:03:34.970> these<00:03:35.030> for<00:03:35.180> about

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
believe they're selling these for about

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.410 
believe they're selling these for about
35<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.230> 44<00:03:37.160> dollars<00:03:37.430> somewhere<00:03:37.880> in<00:03:38.060> that<00:03:38.090> range

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
35 to 44 dollars somewhere in that range

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.540 
35 to 44 dollars somewhere in that range
so<00:03:38.720> it's<00:03:38.870> not<00:03:39.050> a<00:03:39.110> cheap<00:03:39.530> collector's<00:03:40.010> edition

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
so it's not a cheap collector's edition

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.030 
so it's not a cheap collector's edition
but<00:03:41.090> for<00:03:41.360> what<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.690> get<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:42.380> really<00:03:42.800> cool

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
but for what you get it's really cool
