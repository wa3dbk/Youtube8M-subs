bar on the front sight made the same
issue<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:26.900> made<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.200> template<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:29.090> rubies

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
issue so we made a template and rubies

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.780 
issue so we made a template and rubies
we<00:02:29.900> put<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.319> frame<00:02:31.040> will<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.340> tacking<00:02:31.670> this

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
we put in a frame will be tacking this

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.400 
we put in a frame will be tacking this
in<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> building<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.599> didn't<00:02:32.840> fully<00:02:32.959> but<00:02:33.260> right

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
in a building I didn't fully but right

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.890 
in a building I didn't fully but right
now<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.590> is<00:02:33.769> sitting<00:02:34.069> there<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:35.390> front

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
now this is sitting there and the front

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.449 
now this is sitting there and the front
part<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.230> roll<00:02:36.440> cage<00:02:36.620> will<00:02:36.829> fit<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.010> top<00:02:37.129> of

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
part of the roll cage will fit on top of

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.729 
part of the roll cage will fit on top of
that<00:02:37.579> I<00:02:38.140> think<00:02:39.140> it's<00:02:39.349> roll<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:39.620> whole

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
that I think it's roll the whole

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.220 
that I think it's roll the whole
decision<00:02:40.069> was<00:02:40.340> where<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.610> halo<00:02:40.879> bar<00:02:41.180> went<00:02:41.450> we

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
decision was where the halo bar went we

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.960 
decision was where the halo bar went we
have<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.440> move<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.620> halo<00:02:42.890> far<00:02:43.250> back<00:02:43.489> off<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
have to move the halo far back off the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.440 
have to move the halo far back off the
header<00:02:45.220> halo<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.549> this<00:02:46.700> going<00:02:46.879> to<00:02:46.910> be<00:02:47.060> in<00:02:47.180> front

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
header halo is this going to be in front

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.530 
header halo is this going to be in front
of<00:02:47.599> the<00:02:47.690> header<00:02:47.840> panel<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.489> roof<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:50.359> that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
of the header panel on the roof in that

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.630 
of the header panel on the roof in that
drove<00:02:50.840> where<00:02:51.079> we<00:02:51.170> put<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.440> roll<00:02:51.620> bar<00:02:51.650> we<00:02:52.519> had

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
drove where we put the roll bar we had

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.349 
drove where we put the roll bar we had
the<00:02:52.730> build<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.060> all<00:02:53.180> up<00:02:53.390> at<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.629> back<00:02:55.359> door

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:56.359 
the build of all up at the back door

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:03.860 
the build of all up at the back door
doesn't<00:02:56.629> close

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.599 

so<00:03:04.870> yeah<00:03:05.049> we<00:03:05.200> we<00:03:05.680> taped<00:03:05.890> up<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.159> window<00:03:06.340> back

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
so yeah we we taped up this window back

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.520 
so yeah we we taped up this window back
here<00:03:06.819> because<00:03:07.450> when<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:07.930> went<00:03:08.109> to<00:03:08.170> break<00:03:08.290> these

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
here because when we went to break these

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.119 
here because when we went to break these
windows<00:03:08.980> here<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.579> glass<00:03:09.819> went<00:03:10.120> everywhere

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
windows here the glass went everywhere

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.979 
windows here the glass went everywhere
and<00:03:12.129> actually<00:03:12.489> we<00:03:12.579> got<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> feed<00:03:13.060> from<00:03:13.269> somebody

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
and actually we got a feed from somebody

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.599 
and actually we got a feed from somebody
saying<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.799> if<00:03:14.859> we<00:03:14.950> tape<00:03:15.129> out<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.400> window

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
saying that if we tape out the window

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.190 
saying that if we tape out the window
and<00:03:15.730> then<00:03:15.939> break<00:03:16.209> it<00:03:16.389> it's<00:03:16.540> a<00:03:16.629> lot<00:03:16.780> easier<00:03:16.810> on

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
and then break it it's a lot easier on

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.289 
and then break it it's a lot easier on
the<00:03:17.349> cleanup<00:03:17.590> overall<00:03:18.249> so<00:03:18.430> that's<00:03:18.609> pretty

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
the cleanup overall so that's pretty

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.670 
the cleanup overall so that's pretty
much<00:03:19.420> what<00:03:19.599> we're<00:03:19.689> gonna<00:03:19.780> do<00:03:19.959> right<00:03:19.989> now<00:03:20.200> so

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
much what we're gonna do right now so

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.099
