00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 all right 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.519
 the subscribers on youtube I know that 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.549
 yesterday or good I do not know when but I know that 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.949
 I showed the roms of unemployment that are drones 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.869
 to play but these are some more drone 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.850
 specialized guys and first of all 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.470
 I want to show you this project I'm going to 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.359
 show something that they do not have it flying 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.400
 here of the great ones that are but look 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.480
 this guy look how stable is they have 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.460
 how he moves him and does not leave the course 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.349
 of what he is doing can not be 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.910
 control with ipad but bring their 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.810
 own control as you can see 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.040
 here 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.450
 the company is based dj dj and look 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.940
 guys and look what interested me a lot 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.890
 have a go pro 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.570
 and it's going down in Chinese and look like 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.570
 he can move the go pro good 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.260
 and then the good thing is that when the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.570
 little thing moves long but does not move 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.690
 that interests me much less lake but it 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.269
 keeps stable without control 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170
 spin an approach so that 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.390
 see 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.630
 go see a pro moving and look how 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.659
 I do but it does not move when he moves the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.579
 of prophet lake in the same place when 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.659
 he moves the big lake but stays 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.950
 stable 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.170
 Of course it moves a bit because 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.960
 Imagine but you do not tremble or anything 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.320
 it stays stable that I really liked it 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.750
 wait for a true image and it's done 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.170
 by Chinese people know that they are working 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.140
 well during the salary the control released 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.470
 he left the control 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.830
 the rum stays stable flying and it does not 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.680
 move guy spain 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.410
 they do not lose control that is surprising 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.120
 let's show them some good roms 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.130
 interesting that are on this side 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.130
 they created or what you are seeing is a 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.630
 rom and these are I imagine they would be 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.300
 our also that we are going to use for 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.100
 bring the packages we want to take 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.770
 like amazon everyone knew about this 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.440
 news but look at this drone guys 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.200
 7 ellis is a true monstrosity 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.940
 here you can mount your camera but you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.830
 you can make a professional camera not 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.960
 a go pro or anything from your audience of 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:15.900
 that look at the design the engines 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.830
 a beautiful design for us so the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.370
 crazy with technology come here 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.800
 usb port connections cable gps camera 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.080
 which has everything seems that even the 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.780
 temperature can give in incredible 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.790
 guys amazing and there is no one 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.680

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.900
 It's a bit complicated but I wanted to 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:46.170
 show them this 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.170

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.690
 another one look at the camera that can 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.100
 to hold 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.100

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.440
 Some features 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.260
 look at the remote control that you are going to use in 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.260
 the future another more 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.090
