performs<00:01:30.850> after<00:01:31.090> 27<00:01:31.600> years<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:32.530> think<00:01:32.890> it's

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
performs after 27 years but I think it's

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.680 
performs after 27 years but I think it's
a<00:01:33.040> testimony<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.640> what<00:01:33.760> a<00:01:33.790> great<00:01:34.000> boat<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.510> that

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.439 
this project and I think something like
this<00:03:56.169> says<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.400> monastery<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.269> want

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:58.449 
this says to the monastery if you want

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.649 
this says to the monastery if you want
to<00:03:58.510> do<00:03:58.599> something<00:03:59.019> good<00:04:00.209> doing<00:04:01.209> things<00:04:01.449> that

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
to do something good doing things that

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.780 
to do something good doing things that
are<00:04:01.750> exciting<00:04:02.049> and<00:04:02.470> a<00:04:02.799> bit<00:04:03.190> dangerous<00:04:03.400> and

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
are exciting and a bit dangerous and

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:04.860 
are exciting and a bit dangerous and
where<00:04:03.909> you<00:04:04.000> challenge<00:04:04.359> yourself<00:04:04.659> is<00:04:04.810> very

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
where you challenge yourself is very

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.050 
where you challenge yourself is very
important<00:04:05.560> in<00:04:05.650> life<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.040> certainly<00:04:06.639> that's<00:04:06.879> a

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
important in life and certainly that's a

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.000 
important in life and certainly that's a
very<00:04:07.269> strong<00:04:07.569> philosophy<00:04:08.169> of<00:04:08.590> Richard<00:04:08.919> and

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
very strong philosophy of Richard and

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.229 
very strong philosophy of Richard and
there's<00:04:09.129> a<00:04:09.220> pretty<00:04:09.400> strong<00:04:09.609> philosophy<00:04:09.849> of

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
there's a pretty strong philosophy of

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.530 
there's a pretty strong philosophy of
verging

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
verging

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.880 
verging

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
new era of space travel so ridiculously

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.939 
new era of space travel so ridiculously
incredibly<00:04:39.120> exciting<00:04:39.600> and<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.410> hate<00:04:40.650> people
