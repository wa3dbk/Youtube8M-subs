00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.900
 and to spontaneously say what you think about it, do not worry, there is nothing 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.900

 next to Marion Schumacher is Giancarlo Fisichella has surprised her 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:23.759
 however, these should be much stronger here than in most ones 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.800
 This year I was a little surprised how fast it is repaired 

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:30.359
 Iran alone is going to have its true performance in the race 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.460

 Bergamin Baker 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.100
 Judge is 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.070
 as already known 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.360
 as Guttenberg's complex map Bezirksliga and which 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.060
 Kappacher asked if it was right he says he is a dangerous one 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.190
 Sport if he can get out of the gate Pablo Montoya had injury due to the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.600
 Areas and northeastern Nigeria now a few months ago it was a

 tennis or at Moto Cross and bath towels Tesla Roadster I know it 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.330
 not in the end, it's not that important, after all, it was not 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.700
 good for the team and very special not good for him 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.600
 Maybe that does not happen 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 Hamburg has an anti-inflammatory effect 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.220
 the door but already as a small child consumer played there only one 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.000

 drove the Latvian the outer pressure is gone "I do not mean I meant when 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.250
 it is not always easy swr2 is okay next map district 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.540
 This evil by the just did not like that so much in the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.040
 Master race its best funkte it means it is about last race 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.600
 We Kimi Raikkonen to run through the paddock are buying price of 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.939
 A runaway is usually playing under the helmet party 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.950
 Because we do not have much because then you are just 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.610
 disappointing especially when you're leading the race what's worse 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.680
 if that's appreciated in such an important phase of the season 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.350
 But that is a sport can happen quite a lot of drivers 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.440
 provides that also be signed

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.440
 as Kimi but I only drive info measurements for me 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.919
 Quaresma is the "Pulpo Paul" interrogated that is normal 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.599
 By the beginning of May, the team wants to examine everyone as many points as possible 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.099
 win 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.769
 but ultimately the interest of the team is as many points as possible for 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.999
 That's why I understand how to bring the konstrukteurs-wm home 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:31.719
 Point of view fully and completely he may have his own statute, though 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.280
 comes at some point the time has been point distance between and so big 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.509
 and of course one should help the other 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:41.799
 may that be so in the exciting world 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.599
 Picture gives in the main operation 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 Radiator is asking next cashier 

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:53.649
 yes be sure if not from the last weekend he has that's just fine 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.389
 why is it always so Alonso the next world champion »said 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.979
 Backseat 4 everything looks very good to him he has a huge lead 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.389
 lively in the World Cup and now nothing more can happen if they still catch 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.169
 Bratwurst Ludger insist that no high scores more than even me 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.750
 should win all races 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.980
 I'm not even in the best possible position this weekend 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.430
 I would have let the animal drive in the front row but we try everything 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.640
 Realistically you have to say that is very very difficult I will never know what 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.680
 Anyway, in the last race, that's what happens anyway 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.830
 We want our best through the Places, we can make the characters fuller 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.150
 more exciting those Manuel Schoppel Lars Völkel Cheryl Bernard Hinault 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.379
 the cafe is 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.379
 the last card is drawn 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:40.900
 the motive the next weekend computational clear that there are a few in 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.379
 He's Journey to More Than Today on the Journey from Fourth 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.999
 What is the overall level of confidence in the car after it is in this 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.959
 Year so problems with the stability Gerold Amann would get the trust in 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.589
 Car is not less than the beginning of the year, but of course the 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.949
 Damage usually shows ads that have always worked before 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.959
 So what does not understand maybe next time another 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.029
 Part of the silence of the men 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.839
 but every one of our technicians checks the car and every single part of it 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.939
 that should still pay close attention that actually still his house but that 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.149
 Racing itself becomes a long and hard wood can always break something 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:13.269
 go very clear 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.900
 but that does not bother me soon one the visas is full throttle gate and a good one 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.299
 Contribute the result to wealth 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.460
 So many children would be inadequate this way they can RG
