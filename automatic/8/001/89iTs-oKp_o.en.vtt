00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:21.950
 in order to divide by brake you 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:26.180
 will need this one hose that goes 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:30.649
 on the back working cylinder you had it 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.870
 screwed here here here we are from here 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.379
 unscrew and fasten on himself 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.040
 cylinder 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.489
 and the tube that was going on this tube 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.239
 was going 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.390
 here we are and calcium and twist in 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.350
 the place where you were screwed and the tube 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.020
 rear brake and all 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.120
 with the perimeter of the basics nothing more to do 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.739
 you don't need this looped one 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.840
 twist it all put on and 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.159
 pumping the brakes means this 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:09.619
 tedious procedure that's what i did 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:12.560
 to pump disconnect the tank for 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.900
 disconnect the tube and take it like this 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:23.030
 the syringe is filled with brake fluid 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:25.310
 let out the air here and then insert it into 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.030
 this tube is not up to the end 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.400
 we press again it is necessary a little bit so that we have 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.950
 higher air out of the hose to extra 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.619
 missed and then we push further 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:44.150
 hose we type almost full brake 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.750
 fluid and unscrew the fittings one by one 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.720
 nipple 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.490
 on the rear brake street 2 that choke 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.180
 for pumping 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.729
 unscrew started one choke and gave them 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.189
 our own prize we run away 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.180
 brake fluid through the whole system 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.830
 through the cylinder through the hose and at the whole 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.250
 the air goes out 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 on the fittings one pushed here 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.930
 twist and then unscrew 2 and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.370
 Repeat the operation with a syringe 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.840
 liquid we tighten the union more 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.990
 pump anything right away 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.530
 there is a brake means it is gone from me 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.100
 somewhere 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.760
 Well, here I am a full syringe here and that's all 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.760
 rocked about 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:45.299
 there is one more such interesting idea 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:51.480
 then if this machine breaks here 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:55.680
 it costs quite expensive here and buy 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.019
 puts the car on the steering wheel on the left side and 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.709
 transfer work here this hose 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.489
 change put longer and spend 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.040
 on the left handlebar here's this at all 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.280
 all clean the foot brake no for him 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.250
 they will both be handed for this here 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.329
 such a machine is such an interesting thing 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.629
 with parking brake function 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.859
 I'll show you how it all works. 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:30.560
 push the handle she locked in 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:34.129
 letting go has been unlocked from the handle 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.129
 Here is such a machine 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.690
 alternative steering brake 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.600
 Thank you all for your attention with you 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.600
 alexey bye
