 will be recharged 

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:34.859
 a combat system slavishly taken over by fallout 3 that 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.709
 benefits from some small adjustments made of comics

 to frontally attack the slowness of the building's disabled protagonist 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.489
 definitely not designed to enhance firefights 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.919
 among the different filings of the Templars we point out an improved management of the 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.309

 end up dehydrated with or starving 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.210
 the feature that has bewitched millions of players in fallout 3 is 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.460
 certainly the extreme freedom granted to the tim player based on his own 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.940
 creations of desires will be able to decide how to face a mission and to 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.419
 consequently influence the evolution of fame

 it's up to you to choose the destiny of vegas and its inhabitants 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.860
 peppers these developers took care to leave multiple open 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.520
 possibility of self resolution so as not to favor a specialization 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.889
 compared to another 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.919
 the different factions in the Iran ranch game in a credible way according to 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:05.930
 past interactions with s 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.040
 an interesting variable will be to be able to wear the vestiges of

 location to go unnoticed between the source avoiding in this way 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.460
 discredits attentions even in the event that you possess reputation passes with 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.370
 poor mimetic ability 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.860
 finished the game that will ask you for 15 to 20 hours if you are 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.580
 very little time exploration and secondary quests wanted 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.350
 real abstraction summarized by final movie we will discover as ours 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.660

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.559
 the many suspects one of the main limitations of a product as a fallout 

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:42.930
 new vegas the legacy that must support few elements such as game mechanics 

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.769
 the narrative style and above all the technological profile make me feel choices 

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:48.330
 done with fallout 3 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.909
 therefore, the obsidian boys find us having to use a package 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.659
 that already in 2008 I showed some sites especially when compared with 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.650
 modern videogame production 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.330
 these are the premises for Rome's developers and lethal leaps must be made 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.910
 to further elevate the performance of a rather dated graphics engine shot 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.259

 once in motion, however, they begin to emerge above all on consoles 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.830
 problems like these take the time passes and poorly defined text that has 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.400
 sin for which it grows with pate of various nature frits show uncertainty 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.180
 target balance in pods 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.750
 similar in some respects to the audio sector yes 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.330
 made of a soundtrack of absolute value interspersed with long silences 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.860
 dressed and perfectly in tune with the production choir 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.810
 the bulk of the dialogues did not allow the Italian adaptation of 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.390
 achieve the same types of quality because of nonsensical sentences that 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:42.789
 sometimes displace user
