00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.130
 it was people plus a video of the series of 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.660
 makeup with the program is a 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.200
 I'm going to use lunch today with the 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.790
 my mother 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.950
 we always do at least once 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.809
 for a month we took the day to go out alone 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.940
 the two to put the catch up 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 to kill the longing so I created one 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.439
 Makeup lighter with makeup than 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.970
 It was not very time-consuming, so I opted 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.560
 by a vibrant lipstick because so the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.189
 You do not need every time to the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.930
 eyes 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.760
 I hope you like it and if you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.470
 want this makeup vehicle is just 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.329
 continue watching the video then with the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.219
 skin ready to receive the makeup will 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.710
 show you what I used as 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 preparative I used the fluids of 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.200
 facial cleanser and preparatory tonic 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.550
 I also used the moisturizing contour of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.110
 eyes that I have already told you that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.809
 super important mainly for 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 who has more dry eye area and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.500
 I already learned the table because I'm going to apply 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.239
 the base with my hands this time I want 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.879
 cover is very light then with 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.520
 the hands she gets the younger I go 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.000
 start with concealer mda my co to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.650
 My color is flash 08 and the order is 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 correction of the base depends a lot on what 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.159
 Do you want I like to apply the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.990
 before the base and if I find 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.790
 that needs coverage and some more 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.290
 place I learned a little later also 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.640
 but if you like to apply the base the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.409
 first collective then does not have 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.820
 No problem then I'll stay with 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.890
 fingers because I want one too. 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.310
 very light coverage 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.770
 I will focus here in the area of dark circles and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.080
 in the first spots I'm going to deposit 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.560
 the collective and then I've been spreading 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560
 with finger 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.759
 My name is corrective in the area of 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.130
 eyelids because in this area I will use a 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.450
 specific collective I'm going to use press 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.429
 work that is a little pen I deposit the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.810
 product and then the estate with the 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.810
 same way I did with the skin 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.030
 I already bought the base because I'm not going 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.800
 To give a dark shadow I'll focus on 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.300
 makeup on the sides I'll spend one 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.080
 lipstick plus choice leaves the eye more 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.300
 soft 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.459
 then go straight to the base is I will 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.739
 pass the second skin base which is a 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.420
 a perfect base 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.080
 for the day to day she leaves the skin 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.120
 most natural and my color is sincere 08 is 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.620
 this tone is a little darker 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.970
 because in summer we end up losing 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.920
 a little bronze 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.780
 even those who do not take sun just catching 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.510
 a little something then it is important you have 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.640
 one or two tones of base it the lightest 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.220
 for you using envy and a darker 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.250
 for you to use on my then this one is 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.530
 my base see your summer that is a 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.280
 a little darker you 'll see 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.890
 but it is well matched with the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.650
 tone of my skin I'll apply with the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.230
 hands all deposit here because I think 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.880
 I got carried away doing too much and I'm going 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.209
 spread with your fingers as if it were a 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.209
 moisturizing 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.420
 the coke I chose is mdl is a little 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.750
 loose so it will leave the cover 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.870
 also very soft and I'll apply with the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.459
 kabuki brush my color is medium 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.459
 I put a little bit here in the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:30.519
 I took the access and will apply 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:33.099
 with circular movements on the cheeks 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.680
 I'll use the dowd blush orchid 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.650
 satin in sparkling romance I go 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.660
 to use this one more alone is what I'm going to use 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.540
 a pink lipstick I preferred to leave the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.220
 all makeup in the same tone I'm going out 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.810
 hence I will apply today's convention 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:58.030
 They will use it only and if today I will not 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:04:00.519
 mix both eyes carefully I 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.140
 I decided to make only one outline but to 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.790
 seal the collective to prevent it from 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.379
 accumulate in the folds I'll use a 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.200
 compact shade 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.060
 this here is the champagne and opaque that it is 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.799
 well skin color even without any shine 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.370
 I'll apply for the very purpose 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.370
 celsinho 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.700
 I'll wear eyeliner and color 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.680
 black and tense and I'll apply with this 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.150
 beveled pawn is specific for 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.100
 paste eyeliner 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.440
 I'll be just a little bit in the middle of the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.440
 eyes broking external 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.270
 now to close your eyes and leave 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.249
 the eyelashes are more defined and I will use the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.930
 children's computer and the 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.930
 3d amplifier and volume 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.310
 really I like to set the eyebrow 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.620
 make it right then I'll use the 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.659
 from the mayor to the eyebrow and I go 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.050
 applying with the brush side zinho 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.050
 chocofra 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.319
 and to give an up on that makeup I 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:25.860
 I chose a pink lipstick this one is 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:27.180
 the kind and intense creamy that is very well 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.699
 Pretty pink 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.699
 but I will use the award to 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.699
 lips that he disguises the fine lines 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.999
 and I want the button to be very intense 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.330
 so I'll apply it straight from the bullet in the 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:49.330
 lips 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.540
 then this is the end result of 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.450
 makeup I really hope you guys 

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.450
