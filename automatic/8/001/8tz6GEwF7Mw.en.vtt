00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:02.360 
why don't I show you is how to build the

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.560 
why don't I show you is how to build the
bottom<00:00:02.570> base<00:00:02.899> with<00:00:03.320> the<00:00:03.499> edging<00:00:04.210> this<00:00:05.210> is<00:00:05.360> just

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.570 
bottom base with the edging this is just

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.660 
bottom base with the edging this is just
for<00:00:05.780> demonstration<00:00:05.990> purposes<00:00:06.640> we're<00:00:07.640> going

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
for demonstration purposes we're going

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:16.060 
for demonstration purposes we're going
to<00:00:08.059> cut<00:00:09.009> about<00:00:10.009> what<00:00:10.820> inches<00:00:12.159> into<00:00:13.990> this<00:00:15.070> but

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
to cut about what inches into this but

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:43.470 
to cut about what inches into this but
these<00:00:16.700> are<00:00:16.970> flat

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.490 

and<00:00:43.960> put<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.320> up<00:00:44.500> here<00:00:45.190> until<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.960> top<00:00:47.200> and

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
and put it up here until the top and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
and put it up here until the top and
bottom<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.940> will<00:00:49.270> look<00:00:49.390> like<00:00:49.570> this

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
bottom which will look like this

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.050 
bottom which will look like this
then<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.170> connect<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.800> but<00:00:53.310> put<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.730> flap

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
then you connect them but put this flap

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.710 
then you connect them but put this flap
in<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.780> inside<00:00:55.410> then<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.490> can

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.580 

so<00:01:01.720> you<00:01:02.170> can<00:01:02.290> be<00:01:02.470> here<00:01:03.040> and<00:01:03.310> why<00:01:04.270> we<00:01:04.840> cut<00:01:05.380> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
so you can be here and why we cut the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.980 
so you can be here and why we cut the
bottom<00:01:05.980> so<00:01:06.520> what<00:01:06.700> you<00:01:06.790> going<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.150> do<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.720> that

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
bottom so what you going to do is that

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.220 
bottom so what you going to do is that
you're<00:01:08.290> going<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:09.000> get<00:01:10.000> something<00:01:10.210> show<00:01:10.570> make

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
you're going to get something show make

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.400 
you're going to get something show make
this<00:01:11.380> blue<00:01:11.590> down<00:01:11.770> here<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.180> then<00:01:13.450> you<00:01:14.140> are

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
this blue down here and then you are

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.750 
this blue down here and then you are
going<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.830> pour<00:01:15.190> poke<00:01:15.670> four<00:01:16.390> holes<00:01:16.840> into<00:01:17.760> the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
going to pour poke four holes into the

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:38.399 
going to pour poke four holes into the
edging<00:01:22.410> and<00:01:23.410> pull<00:01:24.010> out<00:01:24.450> sometimes

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.770 

it's<00:01:38.979> just<00:01:39.280> demonstration<00:01:40.149> sugar<00:01:40.450> everything

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
it's just demonstration sugar everything

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.760 
it's just demonstration sugar everything
is<00:01:41.020> perfect

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
is perfect

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
is perfect
then<00:01:42.280> you're<00:01:42.490> going<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.789> tie<00:01:43.090> them<00:01:43.240> together

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
then you're going to tie them together

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.410 
then you're going to tie them together
now<00:01:44.740> what<00:01:45.130> you're<00:01:45.310> gonna<00:01:45.430> do<00:01:45.640> after<00:01:45.939> that<00:01:46.240> is

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
now what you're gonna do after that is

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.870 
now what you're gonna do after that is
go<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.079> outside<00:01:47.259> then<00:01:47.829> hope<00:01:48.159> then<00:01:48.610> put

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
go on to the outside then hope then put

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.969 
go on to the outside then hope then put
this<00:01:49.149> wire<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.710> the<00:01:51.610> other<00:01:51.759> one<00:01:51.939> of<00:01:52.210> wire<00:01:53.020> into

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
this wire and the other one of wire into

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
this wire and the other one of wire into
both<00:01:54.250> holes<00:01:55.110> top<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.320> bottom<00:01:57.000> go<00:01:58.000> for<00:01:58.179> lining

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
both holes top and bottom go for lining

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:12.640 
both holes top and bottom go for lining
and<00:01:59.579> slide<00:02:00.579> so<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:02.350> can<00:02:02.500> tie<00:02:02.710> them

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.640 

then<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:14.040> tie<00:02:14.280> them<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.050> put<00:02:19.590> one

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
then you tie them and you put one

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.949 
then you tie them and you put one
through<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.160> loop<00:02:20.340> then<00:02:21.030> put<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.420> end<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
through the loop then put the end of the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:32.070 
through the loop then put the end of the
other<00:02:22.200> one<00:02:22.500> through<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> loop<00:02:25.040> it's<00:02:26.040> all<00:02:26.400> good

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.460

right here you can see it at my dad put
six<00:02:36.130> holes<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.760> tie<00:02:37.420> three
