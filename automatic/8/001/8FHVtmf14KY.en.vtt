00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hi to all youtube friends here is the 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.059
 22 97 are here with the final report 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.179
 as I promised and then we start 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 immediately tournament went badly enough 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.869
 made 22 metal dragon ones because today 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.119
 there were many people who were going to Turin 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.289
 so it's a fairly high level of 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.859
 tournament 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.960
 the theme goes against the united rules rule e 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.630
 it just does my ass was not 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.660
 so in short between us 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.980
 second go against account that the second 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.070
 fucking and I win 20 the third I go against 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.680
 spacebook 520 and the fourth mccaw 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.399
 elemental dragon with these two cards 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.699
 here with the mythical we say 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:01.649
 here are these here in short and I lose 2 a 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.830
 1 then I bring the udc file 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.580
 here is therefore quite a standard between 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.580
 blaster t produced by 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:19.660
 triple and docs and triple tempest so 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:25.190
 we play all twelve from the maxi two 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:27.740
 2 divers a trigon is a frommel watch 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.390
 so too but the troop because me 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.220
 also I love runs so well 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.090
 then I play two big stalks that I want 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.259
 taking one out is a good air is one 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.759
 scarecrow 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.009
 veron probably stop band 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.070
 self with the fright passes because the paper 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.619
 these monsters were very strong 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.430
 23 to be there the mistake 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.090
 then the brussels sword touched a 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:59.450
 definitely because the paper is too strong 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.700
 then double consonance super bowl 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.030
 because this is very strong of 2 dry 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.350
 then I play double throated dragon and a 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.080
 third never train because but to me the third 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.100
 I wo n't like it and I like it that way 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.220
 in short alcohol and double typhoon daemen 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.920
 double typhoon of mail because I will raise it 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.590
 probably but less and big because 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.600
 if they make you iron google the cards of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.000
 genre in red book of mood because it is the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.510
 metal card saves your own ass 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.220
 double gadget huge becker card better 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.209
 of the operational typhoon discard also i 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.440
 dragons that you do n't need a compulse a 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.500
 bdh and the card of the year in my opinion 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.500
 fd of paper that wins by itself 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.090

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.020

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:11.090
