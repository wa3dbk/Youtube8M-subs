00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
eat too much then you know it does it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.780

really<00:01:50.790> defeats<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.360> purpose<00:01:52.430> alright<00:01:53.430> so

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
really defeats the purpose alright so

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.350 
really defeats the purpose alright so
eat<00:01:54.030> six<00:01:55.020> small<00:01:55.110> meals<00:01:55.790> instead<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.119> three

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
eat six small meals instead with three

eat six small meals instead with three
large<00:01:57.600> meals<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:58.020> day<00:01:59.060> basically<00:02:00.140> what<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
large meals a day basically what this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.679 
large meals a day basically what this
does<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.520> instead<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.969> eating<00:02:03.270> three

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
does is that instead of eating three

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.200 
does is that instead of eating three
large<00:02:03.869> meals<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.290> know<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.759> really<00:02:05.759> takes<00:02:06.090> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
large meals you know it really takes a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.050

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.130 
lot longer for our bodies to eat larger
meals<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.560> did<00:02:10.709> six<00:02:10.979> small<00:02:11.220> meals<00:02:11.250> so

what it does it it our body digests the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.720 
what it does it it our body digests the
food<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.240> process<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.260> lot<00:02:19.980> faster<00:02:20.220> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
food and process is it a lot faster and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.790 
food and process is it a lot faster and
at<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> same<00:02:21.569> time<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:22.050> actually<00:02:22.200> heightens

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
at the same time it actually heightens

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.300 
at the same time it actually heightens
our<00:02:22.920> metabolism<00:02:23.700> which<00:02:24.270> increases<00:02:24.930> the

our metabolism which increases the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.970 
our metabolism which increases the
furnace<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.819> our<00:02:26.940> bodies<00:02:27.330> which<00:02:27.980> increases

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
furnace in our bodies which increases
