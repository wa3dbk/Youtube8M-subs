00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.809
 Anita Lomeli is already with us as 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.059
 these have been very good thanks javier 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.370
 very good evening because today we want 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.860
 share with you a story what 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.960
 first is to collect bottles they are 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.009
 remove the label the covers after 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.009
 grinds and washes 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:28.490
 it proceeds to the machine by means of 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:33.460
 Warm up if one goes out 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.460
 some paris are and the machine catches it 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.620
 and then air is injected 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.870
 that air makes it expand within the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.140
 mold and take the figure that has the 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.950
 mold in this case is the septum that goes 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.080
 to go low you need 8 bottles of 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.900
 pet to make a partition these pieces 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.860
 they are assembled as if they were toy 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.320
 this module is 11 20 120 x 240 which is 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.690
 the universal measure this has some 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.100
 rods which will give you 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.750
 structure that rod is born from a 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.080
 channel that we have in the part 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.300
 later 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.540
 when we are going to reach the end 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.840
 the other gutter is placed and soldered and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.480
 It already gives me a completely pre-armed module 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.510
 to get between castles 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:29.980
 between wood or between metal 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.310
 so there is a wall the castle is the one 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.710
 is replacing the casting 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.000
 we already are doing as 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.009
 direct this implies that we are going to 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.530
 have savings from planting has a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.619
 tremendous resistance 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.619
 ah 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.890
 If so, you can hit him 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.420
 and how much would a brick knot cost 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.570
 A) Yes 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.770
 per square meter we have a 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.649
 cost of approximately 390 is the 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.679
 resistant that a normal house is 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.750
 within the regulations here little to 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.209
 recently opened step in the world of 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.400
 hugo terrace construction was like 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.950
 that of the neighbors he decided to take advantage 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.160
 this space and do a study and another 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.010
 room how much did you save yourself as 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.170
 30 or 40 percent less than the cost 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.750
 potter with mariano showed that with 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.330
 these partitions there is a saving of 75 per 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.800
 structural weight and 75 percent 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.010
 hundred percent savings in time 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.870
 construction playing and saving already 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.530
 he built several houses and even a 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.170
 fractionation in Oaxaca undoubtedly everything 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.599
 can have another life 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.120
 that is not good Javier is fantastic 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.970
 this because it also seems like a 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.510
 game is very resistant is thermal 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.270
 and surely the most important addition 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.950
 The saving is also fun to put together 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.140
 these in addition to saving 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.670
 is the care of the environment that is 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.910
 so important at this time of 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:13.410
 world not only from mexico go to the trash 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.410
 help build a house
