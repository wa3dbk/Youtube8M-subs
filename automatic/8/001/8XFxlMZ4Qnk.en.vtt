00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.760
 hi i'm crank this week i'm going to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.520
 teach how to make tweezers with elastic 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.520
 which are super weaving practices 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.320
 let's use a pair of small tongs 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.910
 preference that they be the color of your 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.260
 hair 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.290
 and some scissors 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:36.100
 and a tubular spring that is of color 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.100
 of the visits 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:48.160
 We are going to cut two stretches of spring 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.160
 between 5 to 8 centimeters each 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.980
 A) Yes 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.100
 to attach the spring to the ribbons 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.020
 we took one end of this and had it 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.899
 behind the beginning 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.229
 on the other side we make a nice little nudity 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.570
 tight and as close to the edge as possible 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.210
 Little hair should be enough so that 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.700
 escape through the clamp if you cheat 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.240
 you can make another one or put a little 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.240
 silicone 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.010
 and with the other end we do 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.010
 exactly the same 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.840
 6 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:47.040
 and we repeat this procedure for the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.040
 another spring and the other two clamps 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.380
 yes 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.380
 we can make a very simple chongo 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.090
 taking the hair and spinning it 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.090
 so that there is a lump 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.940
 We take the chombo by hand and with 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.730
 the other one we are putting the tweezers 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.840
 we put them in a cross way so that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.840
 stay more fixed 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.660
 This hairstyle is ideal to make 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.980
 exercise or for a normal day because no 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.980
 moves with nothing 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.300
 we can also do a little hairstyle 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.280
 more formal taking as in half a tail 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.459
 our hair to put our 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.810
 comb like in my hair tutorial 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.810
 bulging with comb 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.620
 we let our hair fall 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.099
 and we take some hair from one side 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.099
 we put a clamp 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.630
 and we cross it to the other side too 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.290
 taking some hair to put the 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.290
 other physics 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.980
 and we do the same with the second strip 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.980
 but a little below 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.350
 and this highlights a lot the bulky 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.020
 hair and it looks very nice with the part 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.020
 that is left down we can leave it 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.700
 smooth 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.700
 or toch a little 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.540
 for this hairstyle we will also use 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.220
 our comb 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.840
 we put it back 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.840
 and let go of the hair 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.050
 we take all the hair and we're going 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.050
 rolling up 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.840
 after we roll it up we leave a 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.840
 finger inside 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:17.500
 we put the little piece on one side 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.519
 and the other one we went through the tunnel that 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.810
 it stays inside the hair 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.810
 to the other side 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.930
 and we hold it very well 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.770
 we do the same with the other but a 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.770
 little below 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:43.590
 after we did this you can 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.590
 hold if necessary with pins 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.259
 these are the are some examples 

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:54.289
 what can be done with these visits 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:57.099
 there are a lot of us see you next 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.099
 week
