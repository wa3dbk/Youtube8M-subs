00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
it says lippy there and on the other

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.979 
it says lippy there and on the other
side<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.280> says<00:00:50.430> gloss<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:53.600> it's<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.870> exactly

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
side it says gloss and it's just exactly

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.160 
side it says gloss and it's just exactly
what<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.440> says<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.579> side<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.030> lipstick<00:00:57.449> you

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
what it says this side is a lipstick you

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.700 
what it says this side is a lipstick you
get<00:00:58.289> quite<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> decent<00:00:58.649> amount<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.719> then<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
get quite a decent amount and then the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.210 
get quite a decent amount and then the
other<00:01:01.739> side<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:04.019> lip<00:01:04.769> gloss<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:07.530> thought

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
other side is a lip gloss and I thought

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.100 
other side is a lip gloss and I thought
was<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> good<00:01:08.610> idea<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.420> colors<00:01:09.900> match

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
was a good idea because the colors match

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.289 
was a good idea because the colors match
really<00:01:10.560> nicely<00:01:11.630> I've<00:01:12.630> got<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.110> lips<00:01:13.260> now

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
really nicely I've got it on my lips now

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.550 
really nicely I've got it on my lips now
although<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.570> pretty<00:01:15.869> dark<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.350> can't

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
although it's pretty dark so you can't

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.630 
although it's pretty dark so you can't
really<00:01:16.650> see<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:19.200> color<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.520> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
number one and basically it's just a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.550 
number one and basically it's just a
really<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.850> nice<00:01:27.090> sort<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> lilac<00:01:28.200> purple

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
on the screen at the moment but trust me

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.499 
on the screen at the moment but trust me
is<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.579> prettiest<00:01:36.590> purple<00:01:37.590> lilac<00:01:38.340> color<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
is the prettiest purple lilac color and

the thing I like mainly about this is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.490

did I go out on thurs no Wednesday
today's<00:02:54.120> Thursday<00:02:54.330> yesterday<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.320> it<00:02:56.280> pretty

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
today's Thursday yesterday and it pretty

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.450 
today's Thursday yesterday and it pretty
much<00:02:56.640> lost<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.540> whole<00:02:57.720> time<00:02:58.020> I<00:02:58.080> was<00:02:58.260> out<00:02:58.500> as

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
much lost it the whole time I was out as

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.100 
much lost it the whole time I was out as
up<00:03:00.270> quite<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.570> while<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.580> yeah<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.730> lasts<00:03:03.330> for

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
up quite a while so yeah it lasts for

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.230 
up quite a while so yeah it lasts for
ages<00:03:04.620> which<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:04.950> surprising<00:03:05.640> considering<00:03:06.030> the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
ages which is surprising considering the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.570 
ages which is surprising considering the
lipstick<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.750> actually<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.980> not<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> matte

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
lipstick is actually like not a matte

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.350 
lipstick is actually like not a matte
color<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.770> usually<00:03:10.770> map<00:03:11.010> sheds<00:03:11.340> there<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:12.030> lot

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
color and usually map sheds there a lot

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.530 
color and usually map sheds there a lot
longer<00:03:12.570> than<00:03:13.110> these<00:03:14.040> soft<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.550> don't<00:03:15.240> really

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
longer than these soft I don't really

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.710 
longer than these soft I don't really
know<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:15.990> finish<00:03:16.710> it<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:17.270> but<00:03:18.270> it<00:03:18.360> says<00:03:18.570> that

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
know what finish it is but it says that

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.590 
know what finish it is but it says that
they<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:18.980> matte<00:03:19.980> glossy<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.880> everything<00:03:21.330> at

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
they do matte glossy and everything at

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.860 
they do matte glossy and everything at
once<00:03:21.810> Matt's<00:03:22.739> all<00:03:22.980> glossy<00:03:23.220> or<00:03:23.780> everything<00:03:24.780> at

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
once Matt's all glossy or everything at

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.290 
once Matt's all glossy or everything at
once<00:03:25.020> yeah<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.180> yeah<00:03:28.910> considering<00:03:29.910> the

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
once yeah so yeah considering the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.150 
once yeah so yeah considering the
texture<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.050> is<00:03:31.110> I'm<00:03:31.500> really<00:03:31.709> surprised

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
texture that is I'm really surprised

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.040 
texture that is I'm really surprised
that<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> actually<00:03:32.550> stays<00:03:32.970> on<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.510> my<00:03:33.780> lips

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
that it actually stays on on my lips

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.830 
that it actually stays on on my lips
especially<00:03:34.470> my<00:03:34.620> lips<00:03:34.920> because<00:03:35.310> they<00:03:35.459> do<00:03:35.840> tend

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
especially my lips because they do tend

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.680 
especially my lips because they do tend
to<00:03:37.020> just<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.610> have<00:03:38.610> a<00:03:38.640> drink<00:03:38.910> of<00:03:39.000> something<00:03:39.270> and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
to just I have a drink of something and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.350 
to just I have a drink of something and
then<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.200> lipsticks<00:03:41.160> completely<00:03:41.700> gone<00:03:41.940> but

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
then the lipsticks completely gone but

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.250 
then the lipsticks completely gone but
this<00:03:42.600> lasted<00:03:43.470> through<00:03:44.220> me<00:03:44.459> drinking<00:03:45.000> eating

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260

that<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:45.120> camera<00:04:45.480> would<00:04:45.570> pick<00:04:45.630> it<00:04:45.900> up<00:04:46.020> the

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
that the camera would pick it up the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.440 
that the camera would pick it up the
color<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:46.620> it<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.940> but<00:04:47.940> it<00:04:48.000> never<00:04:48.180> seems<00:04:48.390> to

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
color that it is but it never seems to

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.290 
color that it is but it never seems to
