00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
because I resolve the activation for one

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.650 
because I resolve the activation for one
unit<00:00:34.739> then<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.399> resolve<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> activation<00:00:36.480> for

unit then you resolve the activation for
unit<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.410> go<00:00:37.530> back<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.920> forth<00:00:38.129> until<00:00:38.309> all

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.090 
units have acted and then the next turn
begins<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> let's<00:00:42.239> conduct<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.690> attack<00:00:43.100> by

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
begins so let's conduct this attack by

m1 Abrams tank can do two things during

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.810 
m1 Abrams tank can do two things during
its<00:00:48.120> turn<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.750> actions<00:00:49.320> one<00:00:50.129> action<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.670> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
its turn to actions one action is to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
its turn to actions one action is to
move<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.510> move<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.960> four<00:00:52.199> hexes<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
move it can move up to four hexes the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.310 
move it can move up to four hexes the
second<00:00:53.670> action<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> shoot<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.289> its

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
second action is to shoot it can use its

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.740 
second action is to shoot it can use its
cannon<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> shoot<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> range<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.030> 6<00:00:57.329> x's

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
cannon to shoot out to a range of 6 x's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.170 
cannon to shoot out to a range of 6 x's
so<00:00:58.320> my<00:00:58.469> first<00:00:58.680> action<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> move<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.090> I'm

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
so my first action is to move so I'm

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.250 
so my first action is to move so I'm
going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.329> move<00:01:00.449> 1<00:01:00.870> 2<00:01:01.379> 3<00:01:01.739> 4<00:01:02.660> then<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> figure<00:01:04.229> out

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
going to move 1 2 3 4 then I figure out

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
going to move 1 2 3 4 then I figure out
is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.070> Russian<00:01:05.939> Federation<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.840> range<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
is the Russian Federation in range the

is the Russian Federation in range the
range<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.950> 1234<00:01:10.950> my<00:01:11.880> abrams<00:01:12.299> can<00:01:12.510> shoot<00:01:12.720> out

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
range is 1234 my abrams can shoot out

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.350 
range is 1234 my abrams can shoot out
your<00:01:13.049> range<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.439> six<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.640> engage<00:01:15.060> this

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
your range of six so I can engage this

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.920 
your range of six so I can engage this
target<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.400> card<00:01:17.670> itself<00:01:17.850> tells<00:01:18.390> me<00:01:18.600> what

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
target the card itself tells me what

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.350 
target the card itself tells me what
kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> dice<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.799> roll<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.220> an<00:01:20.280> attack<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
dice mock-ups that we have so I'm going

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.640 
dice mock-ups that we have so I'm going
to<00:01:28.860> roll<00:01:29.189> three<00:01:29.460> dice<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.049> because<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.079> moved

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
my tank two or more hexes it means I get

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350 
my tank two or more hexes it means I get
to<00:01:34.500> also<00:01:34.950> roll<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.369> salt<00:01:35.670> die<00:01:35.909> because<00:01:36.270> i

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.030 
19 though does get some defense dice of
its<00:01:50.220> own<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.630> see<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.869> for<00:01:52.170> defense<00:01:52.590> it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
its own you can see that for defense it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.609 
its own you can see that for defense it
gets<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> roll<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.970> defense<00:01:54.689> dice<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.439> will

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
gets to roll to defense dice which will

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
gets to roll to defense dice which will
be<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.420> because<00:01:57.420> those<00:01:57.659> defense<00:01:58.079> sites

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
be these and because those defense sites

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.530 
be these and because those defense sites
are<00:01:58.500> probably<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.759> enough<00:01:59.969> it's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
are probably not going to be enough it's

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.179 
are probably not going to be enough it's
also<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> use<00:02:01.320> its<00:02:01.530> action<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
also going to use its action for the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.730 
also going to use its action for the
turn<00:02:02.600> activating<00:02:03.600> its<00:02:03.750> countermeasure<00:02:04.409> dice

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
turn activating its countermeasure dice

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.880 
turn activating its countermeasure dice
hoping<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.210> best<00:02:06.420> now<00:02:07.290> when<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> does

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
hoping it for the best now when it does

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.750 
hoping it for the best now when it does
that<00:02:07.920> it<00:02:08.759> does<00:02:09.050> use<00:02:10.050> its<00:02:10.319> turn<00:02:10.709> which<00:02:11.370> means<00:02:11.610> it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
that it does use its turn which means it

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.550 
that it does use its turn which means it
will<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.270> able<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.540> act<00:02:12.660> later<00:02:12.930> on<00:02:13.140> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
will not be able to act later on this

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.229 
will not be able to act later on this
and<00:02:13.800> we<00:02:13.890> mark<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> little<00:02:14.640> prototype

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
and we mark that with a little prototype

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.760 
and we mark that with a little prototype
counter<00:02:15.660> dust<00:02:15.900> trail<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.319> show<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.620> it's

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
counter dust trail to show that it's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.479 
counter dust trail to show that it's
active<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.819> here's<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.180> attack<00:02:18.950> my<00:02:19.950> abrams

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
active so here's the attack my abrams

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.920 
active so here's the attack my abrams
rolls<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:23.330> total<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.540> ten<00:02:26.270> we<00:02:27.270> then<00:02:27.450> roll<00:02:27.690> for

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
rolls a total of ten we then roll for

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.240 
rolls a total of ten we then roll for
the<00:02:28.020> defense<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:29.459> 2s<00:02:29.819> 19<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.830> it<00:02:31.830> rolls<00:02:32.069> a

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the defense of the 2s 19 and it rolls a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.360 
the defense of the 2s 19 and it rolls a
total<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.670> six<00:02:32.970> because<00:02:33.959> my<00:02:34.140> attack<00:02:34.530> exceeded

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
total of six because my attack exceeded

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.390 
total of six because my attack exceeded
its<00:02:35.519> defense<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.540> 2s<00:02:36.900> 19<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.500> destroyed<00:02:38.040> and

its defense the 2s 19 is destroyed and

its defense the 2s 19 is destroyed and
