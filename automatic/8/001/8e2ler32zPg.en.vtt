00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
one of the biggest problems is that it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.160 
one of the biggest problems is that it
was<00:01:02.219> never<00:01:02.460> made<00:01:02.699> clear<00:01:03.059> why<00:01:03.480> korra<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.019> mako

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
apparently she has her other bending

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.699 
apparently she has her other bending
abilities<00:02:14.579> again<00:02:15.090> which<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.780> don't<00:02:16.079> know<00:02:16.200> maybe

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
abilities again which I don't know maybe

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.890 
abilities again which I don't know maybe
I<00:02:16.950> misunderstood<00:02:17.819> something<00:02:18.120> at<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.569> end<00:02:18.689> of

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
I misunderstood something at the end of

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.750 
I misunderstood something at the end of
season<00:02:19.110> one<00:02:19.290> Amon<00:02:19.920> took<00:02:20.159> her<00:02:20.310> bending<00:02:20.489> away

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
season one Amon took her bending away

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.030 
season one Amon took her bending away
but<00:02:21.180> accidentally<00:02:21.870> opened<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.379> airbending

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
but accidentally opened up airbending

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.250 
but accidentally opened up airbending
for<00:02:23.340> her<00:02:23.549> then<00:02:23.790> Aang<00:02:24.180> showed<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.689> and<00:02:24.900> unlocked

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
for her then Aang showed up and unlocked

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.080 
for her then Aang showed up and unlocked
her<00:02:25.409> Avatar<00:02:25.950> state<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.430> also<00:02:26.730> gave<00:02:26.939> her

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
her Avatar state and also gave her

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.420 
her Avatar state and also gave her
spirit<00:02:27.540> bending<00:02:27.959> now<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.530> was<00:02:29.069> under<00:02:29.400> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
spirit bending now I was under the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.429 
spirit bending now I was under the
impression<00:02:29.549> that<00:02:30.209> she<00:02:30.540> could<00:02:30.720> only<00:02:30.840> use<00:02:31.049> her

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
impression that she could only use her

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.410 
impression that she could only use her
other<00:02:31.620> bending<00:02:32.129> abilities<00:02:32.250> while<00:02:32.849> in<00:02:33.209> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
other bending abilities while in the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.420 
other bending abilities while in the
Avatar<00:02:34.019> state<00:02:34.049> but<00:02:34.650> she<00:02:34.769> would<00:02:34.920> still<00:02:34.950> need<00:02:35.250> to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
Avatar state but she would still need to

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
Avatar state but she would still need to
work<00:02:35.609> on<00:02:35.879> being<00:02:36.120> able<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.569> use<00:02:36.750> them<00:02:36.989> normally

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
work on being able to use them normally

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.250 
work on being able to use them normally
again<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.340> either<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:39.000> was<00:02:39.420> wrong<00:02:39.689> and<00:02:40.049> Aang

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
again so either I was wrong and Aang

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.319 
again so either I was wrong and Aang
pressing<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.829> reset<00:02:41.280> button<00:02:41.310> also<00:02:41.849> gave<00:02:42.209> her

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
pressing a reset button also gave her

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.360 
pressing a reset button also gave her
the<00:02:42.450> other<00:02:42.480> bending<00:02:43.019> abilities<00:02:43.109> back<00:02:43.709> or<00:02:44.010> they

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
the other bending abilities back or they

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.129 
the other bending abilities back or they
set<00:02:44.579> up<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.790> major<00:02:45.000> crisis<00:02:45.659> at<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> end<00:02:46.049> of

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
set up a major crisis at the end of

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.809 
set up a major crisis at the end of
season<00:02:46.349> one<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.739> then<00:02:47.040> resolved<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.609> off

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
season one and then resolved it off

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.910 
season one and then resolved it off
screen<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.750> if<00:02:48.900> that's<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.200> case<00:02:49.440> then<00:02:49.500> I'm

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
screen and if that's the case then I'm

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.949 
screen and if that's the case then I'm
really<00:02:50.400> not<00:02:50.579> sure<00:02:50.639> how<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.090> feel<00:02:51.359> about<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.659> now

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
really not sure how to feel about it now

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.839 
really not sure how to feel about it now
on<00:02:52.079> one<00:02:52.290> hand<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.680> seems<00:02:52.889> like<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.129> lazy<00:02:53.430> way<00:02:53.790> to

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
on one hand it seems like a lazy way to

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.059 
on one hand it seems like a lazy way to
deal<00:02:54.150> with<00:02:54.329> that<00:02:54.420> situation<00:02:54.659> but<00:02:55.349> i<00:02:55.500> also<00:02:55.620> have

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
deal with that situation but i also have

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.460 
deal with that situation but i also have
to<00:02:56.190> admit<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.549> really<00:02:57.299> wasn't<00:02:57.599> looking<00:02:58.079> forward

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
to admit I really wasn't looking forward

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.080 
to admit I really wasn't looking forward
to<00:02:58.560> seeing<00:02:58.799> or<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.099> to<00:02:59.250> repeat<00:02:59.790> Aang's

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
to seeing or have to repeat Aang's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.670 
to seeing or have to repeat Aang's
journey<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.810> relearn<00:03:01.200> all<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.530> other

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
journey and relearn all the other

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.069 
journey and relearn all the other
bending<00:03:02.129> types<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.849> this<00:03:03.209> helps<00:03:03.389> save<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.810> bit

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
bending types so this helps save a bit

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.929 
bending types so this helps save a bit
of<00:03:04.109> screen<00:03:04.500> time<00:03:04.530> from<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.159> but<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.700> main

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
of screen time from that but the main

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.330 
of screen time from that but the main
story<00:03:06.269> here<00:03:06.720> is<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.109> angry<00:03:07.590> spirits<00:03:08.189> are

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
story here is that angry spirits are

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.490 
story here is that angry spirits are
beginning<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.819> attack<00:03:09.180> people<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.959> meanwhile

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.060 
sitting right over there there's no way
we<00:04:47.700> can<00:04:47.820> possibly<00:04:48.120> resolve<00:04:48.930> this<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.560> I<00:04:49.740> just

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
we can possibly resolve this and I just

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.220 
we can possibly resolve this and I just
seemed<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.340> such<00:04:50.760> a<00:04:50.790> cheap<00:04:51.240> way<00:04:51.540> to<00:04:51.570> get<00:04:51.870> tens

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
seemed like such a cheap way to get tens

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.930 
seemed like such a cheap way to get tens
and<00:04:52.440> out<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.830> scene<00:04:53.130> but<00:04:53.370> after<00:04:53.760> that<00:04:53.880> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
and out of the scene but after that the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.640 
and out of the scene but after that the
thing<00:04:54.270> that<00:04:54.300> probably<00:04:54.660> bothered<00:04:55.350> me<00:04:55.470> the<00:04:55.620> most

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
thing that probably bothered me the most

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.680 
thing that probably bothered me the most
was<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.190> they<00:04:56.370> made<00:04:56.550> such<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.000> big<00:04:57.210> deal<00:04:57.630> about

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
was that they made such a big deal about

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.020 
was that they made such a big deal about
Korres<00:04:58.320> uncle<00:04:58.740> teaching<00:04:59.130> her<00:04:59.250> how<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.400> pacify

should probably trust the show to do the
right<00:05:44.520> thing<00:05:44.820> eventually<00:05:45.060> but<00:05:45.630> right<00:05:45.690> now<00:05:46.200> I'm

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
right thing eventually but right now I'm

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.470 
right thing eventually but right now I'm
actually<00:05:47.280> kind<00:05:47.700> of<00:05:47.790> worried<00:05:48.180> that<00:05:48.330> they're

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
actually kind of worried that they're

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.300 
actually kind of worried that they're
going<00:05:48.600> to<00:05:48.780> make<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.170> so<00:05:49.320> that<00:05:49.440> bolon<00:05:49.890> ends<00:05:50.160> up

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
going to make it so that bolon ends up

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.610 
going to make it so that bolon ends up
with<00:05:50.490> this<00:05:50.640> girl<00:05:50.940> and<00:05:51.150> I'm<00:05:51.810> probably<00:05:52.020> gonna<00:05:52.380> be

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
with this girl and I'm probably gonna be

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.220 
with this girl and I'm probably gonna be
pissed<00:05:52.860> off<00:05:53.070> if<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.460> happens<00:05:54.000> granted<00:05:54.960> not

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
pissed off if that happens granted not

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.620 
pissed off if that happens granted not
as<00:05:55.530> pissed<00:05:56.160> off<00:05:56.400> as<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:56.730> was<00:05:56.760> about<00:05:57.090> fart

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
as pissed off as I was about fart

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.900 
as pissed off as I was about fart
bending<00:05:58.170> but<00:05:58.470> still<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.220> only<00:05:59.370> reason<00:05:59.790> this

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
bending but still the only reason this

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.670 
bending but still the only reason this
kind<00:06:00.240> of<00:06:00.360> works<00:06:00.540> right<00:06:00.840> now<00:06:01.110> is<00:06:01.380> that<00:06:01.530> it's

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
kind of works right now is that it's

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.620 
kind of works right now is that it's
being<00:06:01.860> played<00:06:02.100> for<00:06:02.220> comedy<00:06:02.970> and<00:06:03.180> it's<00:06:03.270> already

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
being played for comedy and it's already

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.300 
being played for comedy and it's already
clear<00:06:03.960> that<00:06:03.990> Bolin<00:06:04.560> doesn't<00:06:04.740> want<00:06:05.100> to<00:06:05.160> be

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
clear that Bolin doesn't want to be

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.340 
clear that Bolin doesn't want to be
there<00:06:05.580> anymore<00:06:05.610> if<00:06:06.270> they<00:06:06.480> actually<00:06:06.720> turn<00:06:07.170> this

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
there anymore if they actually turn this

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.950 
there anymore if they actually turn this
into<00:06:07.530> a<00:06:07.620> serious<00:06:08.250> thing<00:06:08.520> I<00:06:08.790> really<00:06:09.360> don't<00:06:09.660> know
