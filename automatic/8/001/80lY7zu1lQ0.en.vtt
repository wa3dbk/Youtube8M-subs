00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:22.809 
but I do understand why some folks may
not<00:01:21.079> really<00:01:21.350> enjoy<00:01:21.709> the<00:01:21.889> translucent<00:01:22.549> nature

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:22.819 
not really enjoy the translucent nature

not really enjoy the translucent nature
of<00:01:22.939> figures<00:01:23.240> like<00:01:23.329> this<00:01:24.219> so<00:01:25.219> for<00:01:25.429> example

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
of figures like this so for example

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.760 
of figures like this so for example
let's<00:01:26.030> take<00:01:26.209> a<00:01:26.270> look<00:01:26.479> at<00:01:26.569> the<00:01:26.689> sculpt<00:01:27.079> the

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
at first I was almost expecting this to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.749 
at first I was almost expecting this to
just<00:01:32.630> be<00:01:32.689> a<00:01:32.780> rehash<00:01:33.439> of<00:01:33.709> the<00:01:34.159> old<00:01:34.340> DC

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
just be a rehash of the old DC

just be a rehash of the old DC
superheroes<00:01:35.509> Lex<00:01:35.810> but<00:01:36.560> that<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.100> not<00:01:37.279> at<00:01:37.429> all

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
superheroes Lex but that is not at all

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
the case standing them side-by-side you

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.010 
the case standing them side-by-side you
can<00:01:40.729> see<00:01:40.939> the<00:01:41.119> size<00:01:41.389> difference

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
can see the size difference

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.769 
can see the size difference
the<00:01:42.529> articulation<00:01:43.189> difference<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:43.939> yes<00:01:44.149> this

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:44.779 
the articulation difference and yes this

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:52.300 
the articulation difference and yes this
sculpt<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:45.380> armor<00:01:45.709> is<00:01:45.859> all<00:01:46.549> different

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.040 

but<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.610> all<00:01:53.730> being<00:01:53.940> translucent<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> is

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
but with it all being translucent it is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.690 
but with it all being translucent it is
a<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.530> hard<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.830> point<00:01:56.070> out<00:01:56.280> all<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> those

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
a bit hard to point out all of those

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.660 
a bit hard to point out all of those
details<00:01:57.410> without<00:01:58.410> a<00:01:58.590> proper<00:01:59.010> paint<00:01:59.250> job<00:01:59.520> we

details without a proper paint job we
sort<00:01:59.940> of<00:02:00.030> lacked<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.420> detailing<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.320> could

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
sort of lacked the detailing that could

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.820 
sort of lacked the detailing that could
make<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:02.070> sculpt<00:02:02.460> really<00:02:02.790> stand<00:02:03.090> out<00:02:03.270> and

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
make this sculpt really stand out and

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.620 
make this sculpt really stand out and
it's<00:02:04.830> hard<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:05.610> there<00:02:05.970> is<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.240> ring

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it's hard to see it but there is a ring

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.900 
it's hard to see it but there is a ring
sculpted<00:02:07.170> on<00:02:07.320> his<00:02:07.650> right<00:02:07.920> finger<00:02:10.730> also<00:02:11.730> worth

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
sculpted on his right finger also worth

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.550 
sculpted on his right finger also worth
noting<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.420> plastic<00:02:12.930> seems<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.230> be<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> bit

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
noting the plastic seems to be a bit

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.830 
noting the plastic seems to be a bit
softer<00:02:14.040> on<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> armor<00:02:15.360> pieces<00:02:15.570> are

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
softer on this is the armor pieces are

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.780 
softer on this is the armor pieces are
all<00:02:15.960> quite<00:02:16.290> pliable<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.040> even<00:02:17.610> have<00:02:17.760> a

it<00:03:13.489> is<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.730> bit<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.209> challenge<00:03:14.450> all<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.650> can

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
it is a bit of a challenge all you can

it is a bit of a challenge all you can
really<00:03:15.950> do<00:03:16.159> is<00:03:16.280> have<00:03:16.459> him<00:03:16.580> cradle<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.299> his

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
really do is have him cradle it in his

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.539 
really do is have him cradle it in his
arm<00:03:17.629> so<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.470> might<00:03:18.769> actually<00:03:19.040> work<00:03:19.250> better

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
arm so it might actually work better

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.460 
arm so it might actually work better

anti-monitor<00:03:35.989> figure<00:03:43.720> overall<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.750> do<00:03:44.870> still

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
anti-monitor figure overall I do still

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.170 
anti-monitor figure overall I do still
really<00:03:45.590> like<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.950> figure<00:03:46.160> as<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:46.940> stated

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
really like this figure as I stated

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.390 
really like this figure as I stated
earlier<00:03:47.569> I<00:03:47.720> like<00:03:48.079> translucent<00:03:48.859> figures<00:03:49.099> quite

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
earlier I like translucent figures quite

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.640 
earlier I like translucent figures quite
a<00:03:49.459> bit<00:03:49.730> and<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.180> think<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.780> works<00:03:50.959> well<00:03:51.200> for<00:03:51.230> this

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
a bit and I think it works well for this

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.339 
a bit and I think it works well for this
particular<00:03:52.250> version<00:03:52.459> of<00:03:52.700> Lex<00:03:53.230> with<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
particular version of Lex with the

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.380 
particular version of Lex with the
awesome<00:03:54.799> armor<00:03:55.160> sculpted<00:03:55.640> on<00:03:55.730> this<00:03:55.910> figure<00:03:56.269> it

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
awesome armor sculpted on this figure it

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.390 
awesome armor sculpted on this figure it
seems<00:03:56.690> like<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> no-brainer<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.769> Mattel<00:03:58.220> will

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
seems like a no-brainer that Mattel will

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.729 
seems like a no-brainer that Mattel will
eventually<00:03:58.910> release<00:03:59.299> a<00:03:59.510> repainted<00:04:00.349> version

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
eventually release a repainted version

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.710 
eventually release a repainted version
of<00:04:00.829> this<00:04:01.010> figure<00:04:01.310> without<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:02.299> power<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.599> the

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
of this figure without the power of the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.140 
of this figure without the power of the
orange<00:04:03.079> lantern<00:04:03.500> so<00:04:04.099> we<00:04:04.220> can<00:04:04.370> have<00:04:04.489> an<00:04:04.609> updated

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
orange lantern so we can have an updated

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.270 
orange lantern so we can have an updated
armored<00:04:05.629> Lex<00:04:05.900> with<00:04:06.139> more<00:04:06.440> articulation<00:04:07.130> and

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
armored Lex with more articulation and

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:16.120 
armored Lex with more articulation and
in<00:04:07.700> better<00:04:07.940> scale<00:04:08.359> time<00:04:09.349> will<00:04:09.530> tell<00:04:14.590> wave<00:04:15.590> 17

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
in better scale time will tell wave 17

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.219 
in better scale time will tell wave 17
should<00:04:16.459> be<00:04:16.609> hitting<00:04:16.849> store<00:04:17.209> shelves<00:04:17.239> now<00:04:17.840> so

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
should be hitting store shelves now so

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:23.169 
should be hitting store shelves now so
happy<00:04:19.010> hunting<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.150> until<00:04:20.570> next<00:04:20.810> time
