directly into my pot and now I'm going

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.820 
directly into my pot and now I'm going
to<00:01:01.159> let<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.309> boil<00:01:01.699> for<00:01:02.000> a<00:01:02.030> little<00:01:02.180> bit<00:01:02.830> and

to let that boil for a little bit and
you're<00:01:03.979> going<00:01:04.100> to<00:01:04.189> want<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.430> bring<00:01:04.640> this<00:01:04.760> to<00:01:04.939> a

you're going to want to bring this to a
boil<00:01:05.239> once<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:06.080> not<00:01:06.110> twice<00:01:06.290> we<00:01:07.220> keep<00:01:07.400> something

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
boil once if not twice we keep something

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.340

in<00:01:07.790> mind<00:01:07.850> adding<00:01:08.450> milk<00:01:08.659> destroys<00:01:09.170> the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
in mind adding milk destroys the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.830 
in mind adding milk destroys the
antioxidant<00:01:10.100> qualities<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.850> T<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:11.570> if<00:01:11.689> you're

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
antioxidant qualities in T so if you're

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.840 
antioxidant qualities in T so if you're
drinking<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.170> for<00:01:12.229> health<00:01:12.740> reasons<00:01:12.979> maybe<00:01:13.700> you

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
drinking it for health reasons maybe you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.999 
drinking it for health reasons maybe you
want<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.150> try<00:01:14.450> green<00:01:14.780> tea<00:01:14.960> instead<00:01:15.260> but<00:01:15.920> if

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
recommend this now it's time to strain

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.660 
recommend this now it's time to strain
my<00:01:20.540> tea<00:01:20.750> hopefully<00:01:21.380> your<00:01:21.560> strainer<00:01:21.950> has<00:01:22.310> a

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670
