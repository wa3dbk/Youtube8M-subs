00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.220
 It was not this time that Brazil resumed the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.570
 Belt average jersey fc and 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.369
 all on behalf of a guy who 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.960
 definitely can be called 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.480
 killer of brazilians 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.130
 Iran did not want to know at all. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.740
 history of vitor belfort in the world of 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.239
 fights that kept the title the knockout 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.610
 still in the first round 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.489
 despite the quick knockout the fight was not 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.410
 so easy for the oil is the forum 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.150
 came to flirt with the belt when 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.460
 fitted a great sequence of blows 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.530
 still in the beginning of combat 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.590
 the North American but survived in the 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.120
 clinch and went to the security game 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.700
 got the break and ended up with 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.059
 history in degree corner point were 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.520
 blows but I already suffered those in the gym and 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.190
 sweating on the result of the Brazilian 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.050
 that if I had programmed a mind that 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.089
 it would be a clinging fight but she wants a 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.550
 saves from clapping for strength 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.289
 He is a legend of the sport I am the 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.509
 last person who likes to speak ill of 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:15.050
 others only had something wrong with their 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.660
 but I do not want to fool anyone 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.430
 the animosity asks between the two 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.450
 they got to swear a lot 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.270
 during the survey 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.400
 waimea definitely reaffirms herself as 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.980
 It is a great champion 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.110
 curious that only in this fight did he succeed 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.100
 status and prestige that the owner of the 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.710
 belt deserves 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.140
 even so he ventured after more 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.690
 a victory saying stop doubting 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.040
 Me preparing my team is the last. 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.590
 invitation I make 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.680
 is perfect on the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.980
 career three wins now in 13 fights 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.080
 the last 4 in front of Brazilians in 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.060
 dispute for five nights twice 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.940
 before anderson silva one against 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.780
 lyoto machida ea vitor belfort sp 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 tonight 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.820
 your next rival has everything to be the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.890
 The team revealed that it was 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.790
 the week and the rules to follow the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.340
 close up dispute 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.860
 I 've seen the whole focus can not make the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.320
 two things that both wanted to be champion 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.600
 should be for the third time and the third 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.520
 different category and leave time to 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.220
 back the doubts as to its potential 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.920
 without the use of trt that was banned in the year 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.780
 last because at 38 he has left 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.150
 Retirement on the air during the week 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.010
 may be an option since he would have to 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.030
 restart the entire race for the title 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.580
 again 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.930
 according to our commentator and analyst 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.600
 ufc fights 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.150
 the victory of crisis the iran over vitor 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.970
 belfort does not make victor belfort 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.090
 be a bad fighter quite the opposite 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.390
 faced a well motivated young man 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.180
 prepared a great athlete who excelled 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.450
 all the advantages that gets pro forma 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.080
 however, it has not been 18 years since 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.880
 does vitor belfort PiÃ³ Buffay need 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.220
 prove nothing to anyone 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.700
 is a champion will always be remembered as 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.700
 a champion
