00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 welcome dear audience my 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.779
 name is niklas schmid and we are looking 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.490
 again a partie to the series 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.839
 incredible moves and today a chance 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.930
 the partie hommes against scott league often 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:21.660
 played ladies and to 92 white has one 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.750
 quality less work is in the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 attacked to some extent being of 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.570
 Black king on it and that's it 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.970
 saying goodbye 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.189
 after carefulness would be relatively safe 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.380
 standing and running on evi is indeed 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.160
 still attacked 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.700
 I already have that relatively 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.579
 many tips given but still if 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 you just want the video and 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 try to find out the train yourself 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.879
 here knows train and the actually one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.160
 Finnish was how to translate it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.579
 actually in German the lot, so to speak 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.350
 directly ended about that way 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:03.149
 ok i will show yes white normal train 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.630
 plays then comes just runs send 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.130
 she had 50 g 8 and then it was mine 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.580
 quality less of course one more 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.320
 little combinations but good and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.500
 that's why this is exactly why 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.990
 Dont ask for g8 played white 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:24.810
 Runner h7 is very nice and at once 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.970
 black leaf the lobby 7 I can 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.869
 be defended now three times 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.509
 attacked 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.740
 Tom Stuka would be seven runs seven 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.240
 of course, lose the lady here and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.110
 maybe it would be direct here too 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.540
 to dissipate 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.500
 yes and otherwise on 25 would like black 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.500
 of course not beat 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.640
 besides what else would he have here 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.909
 maybe d6 works but you can too 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.799
 not really believe in it here 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.030
 I think what counts the smartest 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.030
 way to end this 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.340
 may thus actually here 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.070
 I had also looked if there was something else 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.200
 better is but that's also 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.200
 relatively convincing here 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:29.450
 she was like you beat out here well 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:33.650
 Of course, winning both is clearly the one 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.040
 somehow i7 tower d8 can change that way 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.040
 go on 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.650
 and now lets point to 7 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.060
 rausschlagen 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.000
 and because it's the six 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.690
 here the tower would go on flutes 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.950
 and shows a figure that could be more good 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.960
 maybe you'll be smart again 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.570
 not her right here now the six 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.800
 runners might still have locked up 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.800
 I might not be very smart now 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.080
 made here although these are 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.530
 almost certainly won and here 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.380
 the game 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.090
 good is already too far white wins 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.209
 then maybe the six will run 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.489
 after the best attempt of black 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.459
 continue to play 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:19.120
 because besides the i8, I also see here 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.820
 just nothing better 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.540
 ok but in the game played black 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.250
 so that the 7 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.050
 and now yes, well, now wind is white 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.430
 also the runner and still has the ladies 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.520
 on the board there is of course deadly 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.940
 is the king here in the middle of the 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.220
 clear 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.470
 only five ladies b 7 b 48 crossings 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.380
 shame the two runners have now 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.310
 successfully the black king to 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:53.690
 stretch brought dull in the next train 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:56.150
 why black at this point up 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.210
 the runner to the very corner after h7 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.690
 in the black king, the field b8 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:06.890
 and suddenly it was over 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.910
 very nice motive of rom everything alright so 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.320
 much to this video 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.410
 see you next time makes it 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.410
 Well
