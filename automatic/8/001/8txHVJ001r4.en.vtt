the parasympathetic nervous system is
more<00:00:05.670> straightforward<00:00:06.529> there's<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.620> little

your cranial nerves carry some of it and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
your cranial nerves carry some of it and
then<00:01:36.270> you've<00:01:36.900> got<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.079> sacral<00:01:37.680> nerves<00:01:37.920> that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
then you've got some sacral nerves that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179 
then you've got some sacral nerves that
are<00:01:38.159> carrying<00:01:38.549> some<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.920> what<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
are carrying some of it and what is the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.600 
are carrying some of it and what is the
anatomy<00:01:41.460> what<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> spinal<00:01:42.750> cord<00:01:43.020> anatomy

we're<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:02.880> even<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.869> pretend<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.229> that

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
we're not even it just pretend like that

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.580 
we're not even it just pretend like that
doesn't<00:02:04.680> exist<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:06.049> parasympathetic<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.530> if

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
doesn't exist for parasympathetic so if

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.110 
doesn't exist for parasympathetic so if
we<00:02:10.739> were<00:02:10.860> gonna<00:02:10.950> map<00:02:11.849> this

we were gonna map this

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.160 
we were gonna map this

either the lateral gray horn or like the

lateral arena I think technically in the
sacral<00:02:31.750> spinal<00:02:32.680> cord<00:02:33.250> they<00:02:33.459> don't<00:02:33.640> call<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:33.970> a

sacral spinal cord they don't call it a

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.530 
sacral spinal cord they don't call it a
lateral<00:02:34.660> gray<00:02:34.959> horn<00:02:35.290> but<00:02:36.129> they<00:02:36.310> do<00:02:36.940> have<00:02:37.510> a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
lateral gray horn but they do have a

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.539 
lateral gray horn but they do have a
lateral<00:02:38.170> gray<00:02:38.920> area<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.799> then<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.980> course<00:02:42.250> in

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
lateral gray area and then of course in

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.990 
lateral gray area and then of course in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
fibers are coming out of the brain so

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.740 
fibers are coming out of the brain so
they're<00:02:51.160> not<00:02:51.340> gonna<00:02:51.549> have<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.329> we're<00:02:52.630> not

mapping it onto the spinal cord at all

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.259 
mapping it onto the spinal cord at all

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
that comes through just like everybody

my pre ganglionic neuron and it's still
let's<00:03:32.380> just<00:03:32.530> pretend<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:33.130> actually<00:03:33.489> doesn't

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
let's just pretend it actually doesn't

let's just pretend it actually doesn't
go<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.269> heart<00:03:34.569> it's<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.019> vagus<00:03:35.319> nerve

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
go to the heart it's the vagus nerve

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.599 
go to the heart it's the vagus nerve
that<00:03:35.709> goes<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:36.010> the<00:03:36.099> heart<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:36.430> we're<00:03:36.579> just

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
that goes to the heart but we're just

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.849 
that goes to the heart but we're just
gonna<00:03:36.819> pretend<00:03:37.410> cuz<00:03:38.410> you're<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:38.530> pretending

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
gonna pretend cuz you're not pretending

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.449 
gonna pretend cuz you're not pretending
is<00:03:39.069> fun<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:40.290> I'll<00:03:41.290> change<00:03:41.560> my<00:03:41.680> color<00:03:42.099> just

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
is fun and I'll change my color just

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.949 
is fun and I'll change my color just
slightly<00:03:42.940> we'll<00:03:43.239> make<00:03:43.389> it<00:03:43.419> a<00:03:43.630> little<00:03:43.780> bit

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
slightly we'll make it a little bit

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.309 
slightly we'll make it a little bit
Dokka<00:03:44.609> this<00:03:45.609> is<00:03:45.819> my<00:03:46.030> ganglionic<00:03:46.810> neuron<00:03:48.209> with

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
Dokka this is my ganglionic neuron with

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.170 
Dokka this is my ganglionic neuron with
parasympathetic<00:03:50.319> fibers<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:51.130> ganglia<00:03:51.760> the

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
parasympathetic fibers the ganglia the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.319 
parasympathetic fibers the ganglia the
ganglionic<00:03:52.750> neurons<00:03:53.290> are<00:03:53.470> really<00:03:53.709> short

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
ganglionic neurons are really short

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.750 
ganglionic neurons are really short
they're<00:03:55.329> often<00:03:55.870> embedded<00:03:56.319> in<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.130> wall<00:03:57.400> of

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
they're often embedded in the wall of

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.420 
they're often embedded in the wall of
the<00:03:58.419> effector<00:03:59.380> itself<00:04:01.019> again<00:04:02.019> the<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:03.160> heart

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
the effector itself again the the heart

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.759 
the effector itself again the the heart
is<00:04:03.730> innervated<00:04:04.030> by<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.480> vagus<00:04:04.959> nerve<00:04:05.200> so

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
is innervated by the vagus nerve so

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.440 
is innervated by the vagus nerve so
we're<00:04:05.950> not<00:04:06.040> going<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.310> see<00:04:06.549> this<00:04:06.880> coming<00:04:07.389> out

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
we're not going to see this coming out

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.550 
we're not going to see this coming out
of<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.660> spinal<00:04:07.900> cord<00:04:08.200> but<00:04:08.950> we<00:04:09.459> would<00:04:09.730> see<00:04:10.090> a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
of the spinal cord but we would see a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.289 
of the spinal cord but we would see a
pre<00:04:11.560> ganglionic<00:04:11.799> neuron<00:04:12.549> that's<00:04:12.730> really<00:04:13.120> long

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
pre ganglionic neuron that's really long

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.020 
pre ganglionic neuron that's really long
coming<00:04:13.840> out<00:04:13.989> of<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.530> brain<00:04:14.799> stem<00:04:15.130> where

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
coming out of the brain stem where

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.259 
coming out of the brain stem where
cranial<00:04:16.539> nerve<00:04:16.750> 11<00:04:17.289> exits<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:18.070> brain<00:04:18.310> I<00:04:18.669> mean

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
cranial nerve 11 exits the brain I mean

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.440 
cranial nerve 11 exits the brain I mean
10<00:04:19.539> because<00:04:20.109> that's<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.889> vagus<00:04:21.159> nerve

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
10 because that's the vagus nerve

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.940 
10 because that's the vagus nerve
Oh<00:04:24.150> what's<00:04:25.150> true<00:04:25.540> about<00:04:25.750> my<00:04:26.530> preganglionic

I'm doing it anyway go okay we have a

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.430 
I'm doing it anyway go okay we have a
little<00:04:49.780> bit<00:04:50.050> of<00:04:50.170> wonkiness<00:04:50.650> in<00:04:51.070> my<00:04:51.400> oh<00:04:52.320> look<00:04:53.320> I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
little bit of wonkiness in my oh look I

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.880 
little bit of wonkiness in my oh look I
did<00:04:53.620> it

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
did it

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.760 
did it
it's<00:04:54.610> totally<00:04:55.680> myelinated<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:57.660> my<00:04:58.770> ganglionic

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
urchins don't have spinal cords so we're

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:23.730
