00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.180
 deer inhabit a taiga forests 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.010
 Krasnoyarsk region forced twice and 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.789
 will migrate different 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.789
 extent 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.710
 but 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.170
 animals meet on the way of movement 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 all sorts of obstacles like natural 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:46.710
 so few times left everyone in these 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.110
 immigration conditions and wintering 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 inevitably leads to significant death 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.820
 roe deer which is held not only

 reconnaissance on snowmobiles 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.640
 does not shoot power under the park on the tracks 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.990
 migration unfortunately still persists 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.990
 and sad sound vessel 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:23.619
 where does it go 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:24.189
 inclined pipe on drips and then this 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.090
 bell 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.299

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:46.770
 do n't understand anywhere again 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.960
 1 2 loops 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:02:00.240
 choose to paint saws that is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:04.140
 Chinese wire loops of the left 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 needle loop goes captures second 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.080
 noose 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:14.510
 know so a hedge here by kilometer 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:18.620
 drive ready to play she does not board panic 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:23.220
 almost in every loop 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.870
 gets caught if the shark or carcass 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.250
 migrants are located in y virgins 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.920
 relatively little affected 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.560
 economic activities then wintering 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.170
 such roe deer and the paths suitable to them 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.480
 migration accounts for forest-steppe and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.209
 steppe areas are represented mainly 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.209
 my farmland 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.590
 transport infrastructure 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.959
 numerous settlements and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.030
 people for whom the roe was and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.030
 Remains the most desirable prey
