they<00:01:05.439> used<00:01:05.649> to<00:01:05.740> be<00:01:05.829> a<00:01:05.860> problem<00:01:06.100> with<00:01:06.399> in<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
they used to be a problem with in the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.730 
they used to be a problem with in the
earlier<00:01:06.880> days<00:01:07.090> but<00:01:07.570> it<00:01:07.689> modified<00:01:08.170> and<00:01:08.469> went<00:01:08.619> to

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
earlier days but it modified and went to

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.370 
earlier days but it modified and went to
a<00:01:08.770> thicker<00:01:09.640> type<00:01:09.909> of<00:01:10.060> gasket<00:01:10.509> which<00:01:10.899> when<00:01:11.259> you

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
a thicker type of gasket which when you

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.709 
a thicker type of gasket which when you
remove<00:01:11.709> the<00:01:11.889> inlet<00:01:12.130> manifold<00:01:12.609> should<00:01:13.299> be<00:01:13.509> a
