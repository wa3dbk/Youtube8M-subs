00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.229 
and two sizes of Phillips so it's
extremely<00:03:32.690> handy<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.590> have<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.070> on<00:03:34.760> top<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.030> it

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
extremely handy to have and on top of it

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.460 
extremely handy to have and on top of it
you<00:03:35.299> still<00:03:35.540> get<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.720> can<00:03:35.989> opener<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.350> the

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
you still get the can opener of the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.520 
you still get the can opener of the
bottle<00:03:36.799> opener<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.730> get<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:38.530> locking

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
bottle opener and you get a locking

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.920 
bottle opener and you get a locking
one-handed<00:03:40.040> opening<00:03:40.160> life<00:03:40.730> that<00:03:41.390> opens

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
one-handed opening life that opens

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.010 
one-handed opening life that opens
smoother<00:03:42.620> faster<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.670> easier<00:03:43.880> than

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
smoother faster and easier than

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.570 
smoother faster and easier than
the<00:03:46.030> than<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.150> one-handed<00:03:47.600> trekker<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.580> it's

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
the than the one-handed trekker and it's

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.240 
the than the one-handed trekker and it's
bigger<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:50.510> it's<00:03:50.960> full<00:03:51.170> plain<00:03:51.470> edge<00:03:51.680> which<00:03:51.980> I

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
bigger and it's full plain edge which I

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.550 
bigger and it's full plain edge which I
prefer<00:03:52.760> full<00:03:53.150> plain<00:03:53.420> edge<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.930> serrated

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
prefer full plain edge to serrated

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.560 
prefer full plain edge to serrated
knives<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.790> because<00:03:55.940> I<00:03:56.030> have<00:03:56.180> no<00:03:56.330> need<00:03:56.540> for

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
knives just because I have no need for

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.470 
knives just because I have no need for
it<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.050> it's<00:03:57.560> locked<00:03:57.890> back<00:03:58.190> so<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.910> isn't<00:03:59.180> no

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
it and it's locked back so it isn't no

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.290 
it and it's locked back so it isn't no
fumbling<00:03:59.930> over<00:04:00.200> here<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.830> nothing<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.760> screw

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
fumbling over here and nothing to screw

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.080 
fumbling over here and nothing to screw
up<00:04:02.420> down<00:04:02.660> here<00:04:02.690> because<00:04:03.610> lock<00:04:04.610> bags<00:04:04.880> are

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
up down here because lock bags are

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.150 
up down here because lock bags are
inherently<00:04:05.510> more<00:04:05.900> secure<00:04:06.350> than<00:04:07.000> liner<00:04:08.000> locks

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
inherently more secure than liner locks

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.610 
inherently more secure than liner locks
so<00:04:10.160> basically<00:04:10.700> this<00:04:10.880> is<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.240> a<00:04:11.440> Swiss<00:04:12.440> Army

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
so basically this is like a Swiss Army

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.090 
so basically this is like a Swiss Army
knife<00:04:12.950> on<00:04:13.130> steroids<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:15.500> thing<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.710> huge

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
knife on steroids and this thing is huge

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.340 
knife on steroids and this thing is huge
I<00:04:16.430> mean<00:04:16.610> you<00:04:17.270> let's<00:04:17.870> compare<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:21.140> this<00:04:21.320> is

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
I mean you let's compare to so this is

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.090 
I mean you let's compare to so this is
the<00:04:22.300> swiss<00:04:23.300> knife<00:04:23.810> the<00:04:24.170> unidentified<00:04:24.350> one

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
the swiss knife the unidentified one

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.960 
the swiss knife the unidentified one
that<00:04:25.280> I<00:04:25.310> compared<00:04:25.760> before<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:28.520> is<00:04:28.730> just

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
that I compared before that is just

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.230 
that I compared before that is just
being<00:04:29.210> eaten<00:04:29.630> for<00:04:30.020> dinner<00:04:30.170> for<00:04:31.240> breakfast

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
being eaten for dinner for breakfast

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.950 
being eaten for dinner for breakfast
actually<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:32.900> then<00:04:33.710> for<00:04:34.130> dinner<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.850> going<00:04:35.810> to

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
actually and then for dinner is going to

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.880 
actually and then for dinner is going to
be<00:04:36.910> the<00:04:37.910> one-handed<00:04:38.660> opening<00:04:38.890> trekker

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
be the one-handed opening trekker

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.010 
be the one-handed opening trekker
because<00:04:40.190> even<00:04:40.550> this<00:04:40.880> is<00:04:40.940> smaller<00:04:41.540> than<00:04:41.840> it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
because even this is smaller than it

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.700 
because even this is smaller than it
slightly<00:04:43.180> it's<00:04:44.180> definitely<00:04:44.810> not<00:04:44.930> as<00:04:45.140> thick<00:04:45.560> as

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
slightly it's definitely not as thick as

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.400 
slightly it's definitely not as thick as
it<00:04:45.740> it's<00:04:46.430> definitely<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:47.270> mean<00:04:48.050> they're

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
it it's definitely I mean they're

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.600 
it it's definitely I mean they're
actually<00:04:48.860> they're<00:04:48.920> about<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.250> same<00:04:49.370> weight

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
actually they're about the same weight

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:58.110 
actually they're about the same weight
but<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:51.200> knife<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:55.160> actual<00:04:55.460> blades<00:04:55.940> are

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
but the knife is the actual blades are

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.350 
but the knife is the actual blades are
all<00:04:59.120> right<00:04:59.390> so<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:01.460> one-handed<00:05:01.880> trekker<00:05:02.150> is

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
all right so the one-handed trekker is

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.960 
all right so the one-handed trekker is
longer<00:05:02.810> but<00:05:02.990> this<00:05:03.650> one<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:03.950> thicker<00:05:04.220> and<00:05:06.970> the

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
longer but this one is thicker and the

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.200 
longer but this one is thicker and the
one-handed<00:05:08.810> trekker<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.260> a<00:05:09.290> chisel<00:05:09.770> grind

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
one-handed trekker is a chisel grind

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.480 
one-handed trekker is a chisel grind
this<00:05:11.210> one<00:05:11.420> is<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:14.290> I<00:05:15.290> don't<00:05:16.010> know<00:05:16.070> what<00:05:16.190> you<00:05:16.310> call

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
this one is a I don't know what you call

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.490 
this one is a I don't know what you call
it<00:05:16.550> like<00:05:16.790> a<00:05:16.820> V<00:05:17.150> grind<00:05:17.480> that's<00:05:17.810> you<00:05:18.230> know<00:05:18.350> on

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
it like a V grind that's you know on

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.370 
it like a V grind that's you know on
both<00:05:18.710> sides<00:05:19.070> it's<00:05:19.280> just<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.580> regular<00:05:20.380> knife

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
both sides it's just a regular knife

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.670 
both sides it's just a regular knife
edge<00:05:21.620> so<00:05:21.950> to<00:05:22.640> be<00:05:23.210> honest<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.630> like<00:05:23.870> this<00:05:24.110> better

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
edge so to be honest I like this better

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.520 
edge so to be honest I like this better
than<00:05:24.920> I<00:05:25.040> do<00:05:25.100> any<00:05:25.790> of<00:05:26.180> my<00:05:26.360> victorinox<00:05:27.080> knives<00:05:27.350> at

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
than I do any of my victorinox knives at

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.909 
than I do any of my victorinox knives at
this<00:05:27.710> moment<00:05:28.030> except<00:05:29.590> there's<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.710> caveat

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
this moment except there's a caveat

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.780 
this moment except there's a caveat
except<00:05:31.610> for<00:05:31.850> this<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.990> that<00:05:33.400> because<00:05:34.400> this<00:05:34.640> is

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
except for this to that because this is

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.659 
except for this to that because this is
very<00:05:35.060> not<00:05:36.020> pocketable<00:05:36.680> because<00:05:37.220> of<00:05:37.370> all<00:05:37.490> the

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
very not pocketable because of all the

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.080 
very not pocketable because of all the
rubber<00:05:37.940> and<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.360> width<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:38.930> the<00:05:39.020> weight<00:05:40.090> this

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
rubber and the width and the weight this

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.300 
rubber and the width and the weight this
is<00:05:41.270> so<00:05:41.540> much<00:05:41.870> nicer<00:05:42.130> pocket<00:05:43.130> again<00:05:44.560> is<00:05:45.560> you

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
is so much nicer pocket again is you

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.310 
is so much nicer pocket again is you
know

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
know

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.640 
know
but<00:05:48.320> if<00:05:48.680> I'm<00:05:49.100> wearing<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.490> belt<00:05:49.730> or<00:05:50.090> if<00:05:50.600> I<00:05:50.780> if<00:05:51.470> I

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
but if I'm wearing a belt or if I if I

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.160 
but if I'm wearing a belt or if I if I
want<00:05:51.890> to<00:05:51.980> take<00:05:52.160> a<00:05:52.190> heavier<00:05:52.610> duty<00:05:53.000> knife<00:05:53.900> with

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
want to take a heavier duty knife with

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.320 
want to take a heavier duty knife with
me<00:05:54.200> and<00:05:54.470> I<00:05:54.560> don't<00:05:54.770> want<00:05:54.920> to<00:05:54.980> take<00:05:55.160> a<00:05:55.430> multi<00:05:56.150> tool

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
me and I don't want to take a multi tool

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.600 
me and I don't want to take a multi tool
because<00:05:56.720> that's<00:05:56.930> even<00:05:57.200> heavier<00:05:57.530> or<00:05:57.710> bigger

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
because that's even heavier or bigger

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.880 
because that's even heavier or bigger
like<00:05:59.390> if<00:05:59.540> I<00:05:59.660> was<00:05:59.780> going<00:05:59.930> to<00:06:00.020> reach<00:06:00.200> for<00:06:00.470> this<00:06:00.590> I

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890
