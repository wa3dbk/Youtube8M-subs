everybody<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.119> 12-string<00:00:21.119> electric

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
everybody this is a 12-string electric

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.120 
everybody this is a 12-string electric
and<00:00:22.519> never<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:24.060> ever<00:00:24.330> found<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.740> in

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and never have we ever found that in

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.980 
and never have we ever found that in
ever<00:00:26.670> there<00:00:27.210> could<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.510> tremolo<00:00:27.900> system

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
ever there could be a tremolo system

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.980 
ever there could be a tremolo system
that<00:00:28.590> could<00:00:28.740> be<00:00:29.279> close<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.029> accommodating<00:00:30.840> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
that could be close to accommodating a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.020 
that could be close to accommodating a
12-string<00:00:31.410> electric<00:00:31.560> well<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.399> course<00:00:32.460> why

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
12-string electric well of course why

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120 
12-string electric well of course why
because<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> amount<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> strings<00:00:34.320> 12

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
because of the amount of strings 12

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.709 
because of the amount of strings 12
strings<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.090> amount<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> pressure

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
strings and the amount of pressure

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.720 
strings and the amount of pressure
that's<00:00:36.989> put<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.559> instrument<00:00:38.129> makes<00:00:38.550> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that's put on the instrument makes it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
that's put on the instrument makes it
usually<00:00:39.270> very<00:00:39.750> very<00:00:39.870> improbable<00:00:40.590> or

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
usually very very improbable or

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
usually very very improbable or
impractical<00:00:41.390> now<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.450> interesting<00:00:42.989> thing

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
impractical now the interesting thing

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.880 
impractical now the interesting thing
about<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.129> rails<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.730> system<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
about the rails and system this is the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.840 
about the rails and system this is the
exact<00:00:47.670> design<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:49.039> this<00:00:50.039> rails<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
exact design on this rails and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.299 
exact design on this rails and
six-string<00:00:51.180> design<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.530> exactly<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> same

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
six-string design it is exactly the same

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.450 
six-string design it is exactly the same
but<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> high<00:00:55.170> quality<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
but because of the high quality and the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.689 
but because of the high quality and the
precise<00:00:57.030> machinery<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.680> involved<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
precise machinery that is involved in

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.819 
precise machinery that is involved in
the<00:00:59.940> construction<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.050> product<00:01:01.530> there

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the construction of the product there

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.020 
the construction of the product there
you<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:02.930> absolutely<00:01:03.930> outstanding<00:01:04.790> and<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you get absolutely outstanding and the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.170 
you get absolutely outstanding and the
same<00:01:06.390> feel<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> 12<00:01:07.770> string<00:01:10.670> that<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.880> get<00:01:12.060> on

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
same feel on a 12 string that you get on

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
same feel on a 12 string that you get on
a<00:01:12.210> sixth<00:01:12.570> string<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.260> has<00:01:13.439> never<00:01:13.680> ever<00:01:13.830> been

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
a sixth string this has never ever been

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.580 
a sixth string this has never ever been
done<00:01:14.430> before

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
done before

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.530 
done before

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
the sound of the electrics 12-string and

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.749 
the sound of the electrics 12-string and
would<00:01:22.420> love<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.990> take<00:01:23.200> your<00:01:23.409> music<00:01:23.759> creativity

would love to take your music creativity

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.649 
would love to take your music creativity
into<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.149> whole<00:01:25.600> different<00:01:26.170> higher<00:01:26.649> spectrum

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
into a whole different higher spectrum

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.899 
into a whole different higher spectrum
how<00:01:28.659> about<00:01:29.020> putting<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.799> Ray<00:01:29.979> Olsen<00:01:30.490> system

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
how about putting the Ray Olsen system

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.820 
how about putting the Ray Olsen system
on<00:01:31.149> your<00:01:31.420> electric<00:01:31.810> twelve-string<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.560> will

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
on your electric twelve-string it will

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.679 
on your electric twelve-string it will
fit<00:01:33.070> any<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.610> 12<00:01:33.880> strings<00:01:34.210> without<00:01:34.330> any

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
fit any of the 12 strings without any

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:42.539 
fit any of the 12 strings without any
problem<00:01:37.200> let's<00:01:38.200> check<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.619> tuning<00:01:41.549> this

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:42.549 
problem let's check the tuning this

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.039 
problem let's check the tuning this
sounds<00:01:42.880> pretty<00:01:43.060> good<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.390> me<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:46.750> can<00:01:46.899> get

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
sounds pretty good to me and you can get

00:01:47.049 --> 00:02:25.470 
sounds pretty good to me and you can get
a<00:01:47.080> little<00:01:47.259> rowdy<00:01:47.500> with<00:01:47.799> it

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.800 

let's<00:02:26.480> try<00:02:26.689> that<00:02:26.840> tuning<00:02:27.230> again<00:02:30.310> unbelievable

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
let's try that tuning again unbelievable

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.690 
let's try that tuning again unbelievable
this<00:02:32.810> can<00:02:33.049> only<00:02:33.260> be<00:02:33.409> done<00:02:33.530> with<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.129> rails<00:02:34.489> and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
this can only be done with the rails and

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.379 
this can only be done with the rails and
tremolo<00:02:35.120> system<00:02:35.200> thank<00:02:36.200> you
