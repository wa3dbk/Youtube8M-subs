Hendrickson<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.229> stronger<00:01:28.740> than<00:01:28.860> our<00:01:29.100> fur<00:01:29.310> but

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
Hendrickson is stronger than our fur but

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.609 
Hendrickson is stronger than our fur but
technically<00:01:30.240> our<00:01:30.450> fur<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.750> holding<00:01:31.200> back<00:01:31.380> -

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
technically our fur is holding back -

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
technically our fur is holding back -
he's<00:01:31.829> holding<00:01:32.040> his<00:01:32.310> cards<00:01:32.340> his<00:01:32.790> hand<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.450> he's

he's holding his cards his hand and he's

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
he's holding his cards his hand and he's
not<00:01:33.720> one<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:33.930> reveal<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.890> there's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
not one to reveal it because there's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.230 
not one to reveal it because there's
something<00:01:35.310> else<00:01:35.610> he's<00:01:35.759> trying<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> hide

wanting to kill r4 even though he's not
trying<00:01:42.329> hundred-percent<00:01:42.930> Lee<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.500> you

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
trying hundred-percent Lee but you

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.260 
trying hundred-percent Lee but you
clearly<00:01:43.829> see<00:01:44.189> both<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.490> these<00:01:44.670> characters<00:01:45.149> are

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
enchantment so what we could see from

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.320 
enchantment so what we could see from
this<00:02:14.650> entire<00:02:14.920> outlook<00:02:15.280> okay<00:02:15.580> is<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:16.150> there's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
this entire outlook okay is that there's

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.420 
this entire outlook okay is that there's
someone<00:02:16.690> behind<00:02:16.900> Hendrickson<00:02:17.740> Solon<00:02:18.220> is

someone behind Hendrickson Solon is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.550 
someone behind Hendrickson Solon is
backing<00:02:18.970> him<00:02:19.000> we<00:02:19.540> already<00:02:19.900> kind<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.290> guessed

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
backing him we already kind of guessed

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.290 
backing him we already kind of guessed
this<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:20.890> mean<00:02:21.010> he<00:02:21.160> wants<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.460> revive<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.970> demon

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
this I mean he wants to revive the demon

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.180 
this I mean he wants to revive the demon
clan<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:22.930> able<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.290> have<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> war<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.010> stuff

clan to be able to have a war and stuff
we<00:02:24.340> already<00:02:24.580> knew<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.940> yes<00:02:25.240> but<00:02:25.750> now<00:02:26.050> with

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
we already knew this yes but now with

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.840 
we already knew this yes but now with
this<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.740> kind<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.040> confirms<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.610> lot<00:02:27.760> of

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
this it kind of confirms a lot of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.250 
this it kind of confirms a lot of
theories<00:02:28.180> going<00:02:28.360> around<00:02:28.570> that<00:02:28.810> someone<00:02:29.140> is

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
theories going around that someone is

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.560 
theories going around that someone is
backing<00:02:29.620> Hendrickson<00:02:30.130> most<00:02:30.490> likely<00:02:30.880> a<00:02:30.910> demon

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
backing Hendrickson most likely a demon

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.540 
backing Hendrickson most likely a demon
trying<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.350> manipulate<00:02:32.650> him<00:02:33.040> like<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> puppet

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
trying to manipulate him like a puppet

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.090 
trying to manipulate him like a puppet
behind<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.030> shadows<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.780> given<00:02:35.740> him<00:02:35.920> power

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
behind the shadows and given him power

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.310 
behind the shadows and given him power
like<00:02:36.400> demons<00:02:36.820> type<00:02:37.000> power<00:02:37.209> probably<00:02:37.870> promised

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
like demons type power probably promised

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.140 
like demons type power probably promised
him<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.770> have<00:02:38.950> unlimited<00:02:39.280> strength<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.000> power

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
him to have unlimited strength and power

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.970 
him to have unlimited strength and power
like<00:02:40.450> he'll<00:02:40.690> blaze<00:02:40.959> enchantments<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:41.740> either

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
like he'll blaze enchantments so either
