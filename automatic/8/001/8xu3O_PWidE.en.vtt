00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
seconds yeah I was gonna say I don't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.520 
seconds yeah I was gonna say I don't
much<00:01:39.659> like<00:01:39.810> you've<00:01:39.960> given<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.439> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
much like you've given but how do you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.810 
much like you've given but how do you
think<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.829> might<00:01:40.979> affect<00:01:41.250> especially<00:01:41.700> team

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
think that might affect especially team

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.130 
think that might affect especially team
like<00:01:41.939> y'all<00:01:42.060> were<00:01:42.180> y'all<00:01:42.299> run<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.750> y'all<00:01:42.899> take

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
like y'all were y'all run and y'all take

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.770 
like y'all were y'all run and y'all take
your<00:01:43.259> time<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.880> well<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:44.939> mean<00:01:45.060> it'll<00:01:45.570> give<00:01:45.720> us

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
your time in well I mean it'll give us

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.969 
your time in well I mean it'll give us
more<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.020> set<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.590> think<00:01:46.770> we're<00:01:46.860> more

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
more time set up but I think we're more

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.560 
more time set up but I think we're more
of<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.159> fast<00:01:47.369> tempo<00:01:47.549> offense<00:01:47.790> we're<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.329> come
