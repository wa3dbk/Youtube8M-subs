00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
I think you know that was one thing that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.270 
I think you know that was one thing that
I<00:01:12.930> wanted<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.260> show<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.920> wasn't

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
I wanted to show is that it wasn't

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.910 
I wanted to show is that it wasn't
anything<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.850> change<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.890> crazy

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
anything I change that was like crazy

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.609 
anything I change that was like crazy
drastic<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.030> uncomfortable<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
drastic or uncomfortable I think you

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.230 
drastic or uncomfortable I think you
know<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.040> most<00:01:20.130> part<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:21.000> felt

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
know for the most part it felt

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.340 
know for the most part it felt
comfortable<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.930> looked<00:01:22.110> comfortable

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
comfortable and it looked comfortable

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
comfortable and it looked comfortable
and<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.310> think<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.909> think<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.479> something

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
