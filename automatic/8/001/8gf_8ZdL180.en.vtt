00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.110
 teaspoon of instant coffee and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.239
 obviously hot water here we are going to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.620
 use this container to mix 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.480
 so you can see how it is going 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.510
 but they can do it directly in the 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.610
 cup where they will serve 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.140
 then add the three teaspoons 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.080
 of sugar 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.640
 and the teaspoon of coffee if you 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.320
 he wants stronger because more coffee if he 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 you want more sweet because more sugar or 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.820
 less sugar according to your taste here 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.820
 we teach is how we prepare it 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.840
 notice that we are going to add water 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.750
 we are already what we have in the fire we are going 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.479
 to add a few drops very few drops 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.710
 to moisten this mixture of sugar and 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.600
 coffee 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.630
 once we have moistened 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.450
 let's add other drops look 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.960
 you do not the minimum of water between the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.479
 range 3-4 boticas and already with that is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.880
 enough so that beating so that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.479
 stirring with a lot of energy with a lot 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.909
 Energy 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.210
 we are mixing this sugar with coffee 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.490
 and until it is over and it is this 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.020
 consistency of our mix 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.479
 the time that is necessary until 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.250
 get that consistency we 're going 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.130
 to add to the cup where we are going to serve 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.660
