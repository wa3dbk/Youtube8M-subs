 hooooola friends of youtube, today I bring you a tutorial to teach them how to do 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.220
 an editable intro by walt disney 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.540
 first they must have a very good program called Sony Vegas Pro, if they do not have it they 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.870
 I will leave you in the description of the video, 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.310
 they will also need these three files that I will also leave them so they can download them. 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.880
 When you have all three files, open the one called '' Walt Disney '', this file 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.270
 is the style of letters we need to do the intro. 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.040
 We give it to install, I will not do it because I installed them, 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.940
 after installing the source proceed to unzip the file called '' Waltbpd '' 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.690
 Right clicking on it, and we give: '' extract in Waltbpd \ '' 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 they will have a folder in which is the template of the intro. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.360
 Now we will start the Sony Vegas and open the project or simply click on the project 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.609
 and it will open 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.450
 here if you ask them this they click on '' specify a new location or another file '', 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 accept and look for the template of the intro 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.390
 As you can see, I left them all done, the only thing they have to do is change the letters. 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:02.390
 for it they go to half generated and here the letters change. 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.060
 If you want you can change the color of the font or the size, you can also add more effects 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.340
 If they want. 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.440
 Now we proceed to do the same with the small letters, I recommend to put it in capital letters 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.960
 because that is the real way. 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.200
 Well, after this now we just have to render the video, 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.620
 Be careful with the format you choose there are many but I recommend the mp4 HD 1080p or if 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.860
 they like 720p, 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.720
 I will render it to 1080 to have more resolution. You can also customize the rendering 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.720
 In this section, I'll leave it like that. 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.000
 they give it to render and we wait for it to finish, I will cut this part so as not to make it long, 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.660
 xD 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.960
 and we already have a Walt Disney intro with our name !! waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!! 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.760
 Any doubt or problem that you have do not hesitate to leave it in the comments, I will try to 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.760
 answer everything they write as quickly as possible 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.960
 If you served the video, please give thumbs up, and if they subscribe to my channel, 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.000
