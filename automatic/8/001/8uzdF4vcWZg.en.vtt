my dialogue wise but the concept is
still<00:01:54.720> behind<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> actually<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:55.830> it's

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
still behind this is actually how it's

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.969 
still behind this is actually how it's
done<00:01:56.330> from<00:01:57.330> the<00:01:57.450> perspective<00:01:58.080> of<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.560> victim

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
done from the perspective of the victim

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.910 
done from the perspective of the victim
so<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.729> sort<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.240> general<00:02:00.920> concept

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
so this is sort of the general concept

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.510 
so this is sort of the general concept
of<00:02:02.399> what<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.000> scam<00:02:03.330> would<00:02:03.570> say<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.289> in<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
of what a scam would say to you in a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.109 
of what a scam would say to you in a
general<00:02:05.909> sense<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.539> just<00:02:06.750> keep<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.080> in<00:02:07.229> mind

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
general sense I just keep that in mind

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.400 
general sense I just keep that in mind
