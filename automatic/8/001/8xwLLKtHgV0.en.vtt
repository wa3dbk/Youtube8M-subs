 on their own with little or no people 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:24.180

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.520
 independent survival as for 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.630

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.330
 make more effort 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.760
 otherwise wool gets confused if combed 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.030
 this thin wool is not regular she will 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.970
 mess up these cats are suitable for families with 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.730
 older children don't have a Turkish van 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.450
 young children for their origin 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.450
 they are hunters 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.820
 this turkish van is very healthy cats but 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.950
 prone to heat and 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.320
 with their wool requires weekly 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.490
 combing an experienced borsch for his 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.890
