clear out one more unit and as the
market<00:02:25.200> continues<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.770> will<00:02:25.920> continue<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.630> to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.210 
take profit all right guys so we're
looking<00:02:30.150> at<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.480> euro<00:02:30.960> CAD<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.860> markets

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
looking at the euro CAD and the markets

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.680 
looking at the euro CAD and the markets
moved<00:02:32.460> up<00:02:32.640> pretty<00:02:32.850> nicely<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.300> we've<00:02:33.420> kind<00:02:33.630> of

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
moved up pretty nicely but we've kind of

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.280 
moved up pretty nicely but we've kind of
stalled<00:02:34.430> here<00:02:35.430> towards<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> top<00:02:35.960> if<00:02:36.960> we<00:02:37.080> go<00:02:37.230> to

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
stalled here towards the top if we go to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.390 
stalled here towards the top if we go to
the<00:02:37.410> week<00:02:37.560> chart<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:38.069> see<00:02:38.250> we're

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the week chart you can see we're

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.990 
the week chart you can see we're
actually<00:02:39.170> have<00:02:40.170> kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.530> topped<00:02:41.400> out<00:02:41.610> towards

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
actually have kind of topped out towards

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.900 
actually have kind of topped out towards
the<00:02:42.120> top<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.750> upper<00:02:43.050> range<00:02:43.370> now<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> don't

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
the top of the upper range now I don't

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.610 
the top of the upper range now I don't
want<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.120> close<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.510> thing<00:02:45.569> down<00:02:45.750> because<00:02:46.050> we

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
want to close this thing down because we

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.990 
want to close this thing down because we
know<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.830> could<00:02:46.950> still<00:02:47.160> have<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> break<00:02:47.760> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
know we could still have a break and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.790 
know we could still have a break and
then<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.150> really<00:02:48.540> strong<00:02:48.780> move<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.440> do<00:02:49.560> want

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
then a really strong move but I do want

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.640 
then a really strong move but I do want
to<00:02:49.860> protect<00:02:50.250> us<00:02:50.600> or<00:02:51.600> protect<00:02:51.960> our<00:02:52.080> position<00:02:52.560> in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
to protect us or protect our position in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
to protect us or protect our position in
case<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.950> market<00:02:53.280> does<00:02:53.580> reverse<00:02:54.030> we<00:02:54.360> don't

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
case the market does reverse we don't

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.260 
case the market does reverse we don't
want<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> lose<00:02:54.930> everything<00:02:55.380> we've<00:02:55.680> gained<00:02:55.890> now

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
want to lose everything we've gained now

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.120 
want to lose everything we've gained now
in<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.360> normal<00:02:57.600> situation<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:58.200> wouldn't<00:02:58.500> move

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
in a normal situation I wouldn't move

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.600 
in a normal situation I wouldn't move
the<00:02:59.400> stop<00:02:59.700> up<00:03:00.410> but<00:03:01.410> when<00:03:01.590> we<00:03:01.710> when<00:03:02.190> we<00:03:02.280> get<00:03:02.460> up

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
the stop up but when we when we get up

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.030 
the stop up but when we when we get up
around<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:03.210> strong<00:03:04.020> points<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.560> resistance

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
around these strong points of resistance

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.320 
around these strong points of resistance
I<00:03:05.160> do<00:03:05.220> want<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.580> protect<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.000> position

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
I do want to protect the position

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.690 
I do want to protect the position
because<00:03:06.600> it<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.870> come<00:03:07.020> down<00:03:07.170> fairly<00:03:07.350> quickly

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
because it can come down fairly quickly

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.410 
because it can come down fairly quickly
so<00:03:08.700> what<00:03:08.820> I'm<00:03:08.880> gonna<00:03:08.970> do<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.270> going<00:03:09.360> to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.850 
so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
move<00:03:09.540> this<00:03:09.690> stop<00:03:09.960> up<00:03:10.200> we're<00:03:10.410> still<00:03:10.440> not<00:03:10.740> gonna

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
move this stop up we're still not gonna

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.010 
move this stop up we're still not gonna
move<00:03:11.160> right<00:03:11.490> up<00:03:12.270> underneath<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.780> current

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
move right up underneath the current

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.810 
move right up underneath the current
position<00:03:13.380> but<00:03:13.410> we<00:03:14.100> are<00:03:14.250> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.490> look<00:03:14.640> for

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
position but we are going to look for

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.500 
position but we are going to look for
some<00:03:14.940> obvious

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
some obvious

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.510 
some obvious
we've<00:03:16.020> got<00:03:16.140> previously<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:17.040> know<00:03:17.130> support

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
we've got previously so you know support

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.360 
we've got previously so you know support
here<00:03:18.050> we<00:03:19.050> can<00:03:19.170> see<00:03:19.350> that<00:03:19.440> acted<00:03:19.770> as<00:03:19.830> resistance

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
here we can see that acted as resistance

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.730 
here we can see that acted as resistance
here<00:03:20.670> so<00:03:21.020> stands<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.200> reason<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.560> it<00:03:22.680> would

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
here so stands the reason that it would

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.250 
here so stands the reason that it would
be<00:03:22.890> support<00:03:23.280> again<00:03:23.520> in<00:03:23.760> this<00:03:23.940> area<00:03:24.140> so<00:03:25.140> what

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
be support again in this area so what

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.590 
be support again in this area so what
we'll<00:03:25.410> do<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.590> we'll<00:03:25.680> just<00:03:25.890> set<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.100> stop<00:03:26.600> down

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
we'll do is we'll just set a stop down

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.290 
we'll do is we'll just set a stop down
below<00:03:27.870> this<00:03:28.020> area<00:03:28.440> right<00:03:29.130> around<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.430> 30<00:03:29.670> 23

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
below this area right around a 30 23

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.360 
below this area right around a 30 23
level<00:03:30.720> so<00:03:31.170> we're<00:03:31.350> gonna<00:03:31.440> adjust<00:03:31.620> our<00:03:32.040> current

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
level so we're gonna adjust our current

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:45.530 
level so we're gonna adjust our current
stop<00:03:36.140> up<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.320> around<00:03:37.500> 30<00:03:37.860> 23<00:03:44.210> alright<00:03:45.210> guys<00:03:45.360> so

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
stop up to around 30 23 alright guys so

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.230 
stop up to around 30 23 alright guys so
the<00:03:45.660> Euro<00:03:45.900> CAD<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.500> uh<00:03:46.550> just<00:03:47.550> broke<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:47.910> up<00:03:48.030> to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and clear out another unit we're gonna

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
clear out one unit which will leave us

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.810 
clear out one unit which will leave us
with<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:54.810> unit<00:03:55.200> in<00:03:55.340> we're<00:03:56.340> not<00:03:56.460> right<00:03:56.640> on<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
with one unit in we're not right on the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.370 
with one unit in we're not right on the
level<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.240> we're<00:03:57.360> pretty<00:03:57.510> darn<00:03:57.660> close<00:03:57.900> so

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
level but we're pretty darn close so

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.430 
level but we're pretty darn close so
it's<00:03:59.340> good<00:03:59.520> enough<00:03:59.700> for<00:03:59.760> me<00:04:00.060> we're<00:04:00.390> at<00:04:00.540> 34<00:04:00.990> 13

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
it's good enough for me we're at 34 13

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.750 
it's good enough for me we're at 34 13
