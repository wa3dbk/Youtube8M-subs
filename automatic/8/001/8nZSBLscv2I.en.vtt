00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
out there for quite a long time then you

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.170 
out there for quite a long time then you
could<00:03:25.169> be<00:03:25.349> a<00:03:25.590> half<00:03:26.280> an<00:03:26.459> hour<00:03:26.549> lot<00:03:26.760> longer<00:03:26.909> than

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
could be a half an hour lot longer than

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.750 
could be a half an hour lot longer than
you<00:03:27.239> perhaps<00:03:27.719> predicted<00:03:28.409> the<00:03:29.159> main<00:03:29.340> critical

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
you perhaps predicted the main critical

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.159 
you perhaps predicted the main critical
thing<00:03:29.939> is<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.329> athlete<00:03:30.629> must<00:03:30.780> go<00:03:30.959> into

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
thing is that the athlete must go into

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.439 
thing is that the athlete must go into
the<00:03:31.260> race<00:03:31.430> knowing<00:03:32.430> what<00:03:32.730> they're<00:03:32.909> capable<00:03:33.060> of

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
the race knowing what they're capable of

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.119 
the race knowing what they're capable of
and<00:03:33.689> that<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.169> probably<00:03:34.349> the<00:03:34.650> single<00:03:34.980> most

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
and that is probably the single most

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.589 
and that is probably the single most
important<00:03:35.669> thing<00:03:35.699> they<00:03:35.879> can<00:03:36.030> do<00:03:36.150> in<00:03:36.269> advance

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
important thing they can do in advance

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.660 
important thing they can do in advance
so<00:03:37.379> they<00:03:37.469> don't<00:03:37.650> set<00:03:37.799> off<00:03:37.829> too<00:03:38.099> fast
