the other ones on here don't do that of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719 
the other ones on here don't do that of
course<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.290> zoom<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.250> little<00:01:20.369> bit<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> make

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
course just zoom in a little bit to make

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.710 
course just zoom in a little bit to make
it<00:01:20.790> easier<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:22.909> go<00:01:23.909> ahead<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.330> zoom<00:01:24.570> in

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
it easier I go ahead and just zoom in

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.020 
it easier I go ahead and just zoom in
real<00:01:24.930> quick<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:25.439> put<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> last<00:01:26.400> one<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
real quick there put the last one on and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.390 
real quick there put the last one on and
if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> look<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> dragon<00:01:28.650> face<00:01:28.860> opens<00:01:29.280> up

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
if you look that dragon face opens up

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
if you look that dragon face opens up
and<00:01:29.610> perfect<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.329> probably<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.140> rarest

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and perfect to get probably the rarest

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.069 
and perfect to get probably the rarest
mask<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> game<00:01:32.630> there's<00:01:33.630> probably<00:01:33.900> other

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
mask in the game there's probably other

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.109 
mask in the game there's probably other
cooler<00:01:34.320> masks<00:01:34.799> but<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.100> mask<00:01:35.340> by<00:01:35.610> far<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
cooler masks but that mask by far is the

how<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.479> quite<00:02:06.810> simple<00:02:07.380> but

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
how you get it it's quite simple but

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.199 
how you get it it's quite simple but
there's<00:02:07.920> really<00:02:08.129> no<00:02:08.340> point<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.700> getting<00:02:09.119> it

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
there's really no point in getting it

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.460 
there's really no point in getting it
unless<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.720> all<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.110> other<00:02:10.259> eight

unless there's something and I'm unaware
of<00:02:12.300> where<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> can<00:02:12.720> use<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.140> mask

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
of where you can use that mask

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.039 
of where you can use that mask
somewhere<00:02:13.920> else<00:02:14.219> to<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.489> something<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.480> yeah
