and<00:02:47.849> um<00:02:49.319> here's<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.379> front<00:02:50.709> here's<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.519> front

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
and um here's the front here's the front

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.320 
and um here's the front here's the front
axle<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.959> differential<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:54.370> here's<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
axle and differential and here's the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.119 
axle and differential and here's the
front<00:02:55.480> part

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
front part

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.490 
front part
are<00:02:57.129> you<00:02:57.370> joint<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.720> they<00:02:58.810> got<00:02:58.959> the<00:02:59.110> bolts<00:02:59.349> out

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
are you joint so they got the bolts out

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.199 
are you joint so they got the bolts out
and<00:02:59.739> everything<00:03:00.129> and<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.370> tapped<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:01.030> move

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
and everything and I tapped it to move

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.899 
and everything and I tapped it to move
it<00:03:01.330> we've<00:03:02.140> got<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> white<00:03:02.709> paint<00:03:03.459> mark<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
it we've got the white paint mark to

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.320 
it we've got the white paint mark to
warm<00:03:04.650> there's<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.190> two<00:03:06.340> old<00:03:06.550> brackets

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
warm there's the the two old brackets

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.920 
warm there's the the two old brackets
and<00:03:07.720> bolts<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.260> stuff<00:03:08.730> um<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:10.540> method<00:03:10.840> that

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
and bolts and stuff um the method that

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.890 
and bolts and stuff um the method that
I'm<00:03:11.050> using<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.530> don't<00:03:11.650> have<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.129> rotate<00:03:12.310> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
I'm using I don't have to rotate the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.200 
I'm using I don't have to rotate the
drive<00:03:13.900> shaft<00:03:14.200> at<00:03:14.349> all

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.210 
drive shaft at all

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.660 
drive shaft at all
use<00:03:16.450> some<00:03:17.260> funky<00:03:17.590> extensions<00:03:18.100> for<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.400> harder

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
use some funky extensions for the harder

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.410 
use some funky extensions for the harder
to<00:03:18.700> reach<00:03:18.910> ones<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.940> right<00:03:22.180> here

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
to reach ones so I have this right here

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.330 
to reach ones so I have this right here
which<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.900> wobble<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.590> it'll<00:03:23.770> move<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.040> little

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
which is a wobble so it'll move a little

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.120 
which is a wobble so it'll move a little
bit<00:03:24.490> give<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:24.970> a<00:03:25.030> little<00:03:25.210> bit<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.510> slack<00:03:26.130> then

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
bit give you a little bit of slack then

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.360 
bit give you a little bit of slack then
I<00:03:27.160> got<00:03:27.520> this<00:03:27.970> pivot<00:03:28.450> right<00:03:28.930> here<00:03:29.350> then<00:03:30.100> another

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
I got this pivot right here then another

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.670 
I got this pivot right here then another
extension<00:03:30.790> and<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:31.720> seems<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.290> get<00:03:32.410> around

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
extension and that seems to get around

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.950 
extension and that seems to get around
pretty<00:03:32.890> easily<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.360> didn't<00:03:34.570> have<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:34.810> rotate

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:34.960 
pretty easily so I didn't have to rotate

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.320 
pretty easily so I didn't have to rotate
this<00:03:35.290> at<00:03:35.440> all

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
this at all

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.570 
this at all
now<00:03:37.330> there's<00:03:38.050> another<00:03:38.080> side<00:03:38.500> this<00:03:39.070> goes

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
now there's another side this goes

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.730 
now there's another side this goes
towards<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> transfer<00:03:40.450> case<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:41.410> also

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
towards the transfer case this also

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.980 
towards the transfer case this also
needs<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.100> be<00:03:42.160> aligned<00:03:42.490> there's<00:03:43.240> another<00:03:43.660> four

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
needs to be aligned there's another four

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.420 
needs to be aligned there's another four
bolts<00:03:44.290> right<00:03:44.620> there<00:03:44.830> these<00:03:45.010> are<00:03:45.190> different

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
bolts right there these are different

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.910 
bolts right there these are different
sizes<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:46.660> have<00:03:46.720> to<00:03:46.810> take<00:03:46.990> this<00:03:47.140> off<00:03:47.380> too<00:03:47.620> and

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
sizes you have to take this off too and

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.560 
sizes you have to take this off too and
then<00:03:49.110> from<00:03:50.110> axle<00:03:50.530> will<00:03:50.770> finally<00:03:51.570> remove

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
then from axle will finally remove

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.560 
then from axle will finally remove
itself<00:03:53.580> at<00:03:54.580> least<00:03:54.730> that's<00:03:55.060> what<00:03:55.270> I'm<00:03:55.390> being

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
itself at least that's what I'm being

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.290 
itself at least that's what I'm being
told<00:03:55.660> from<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.410> manual<00:03:56.800> you<00:03:57.700> can<00:03:57.730> kind<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.120> see

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
told from the manual you can kind of see

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.290 
told from the manual you can kind of see
the<00:03:58.420> split<00:03:58.810> in<00:03:59.350> between<00:04:00.540> right<00:04:01.540> right<00:04:02.260> there

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
the split in between right right there

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.790 
the split in between right right there
so<00:04:04.300> I'll<00:04:04.600> take<00:04:04.780> those<00:04:04.930> off<00:04:05.140> and<00:04:05.440> let<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.680> know

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
so I'll take those off and let you know

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.940 
so I'll take those off and let you know
what<00:04:05.920> happens<00:04:07.500> okay<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:11.620> what<00:04:11.830> we're

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
what happens okay so this what we're

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.320 
what happens okay so this what we're
working<00:04:12.070> with<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.490> got<00:04:12.670> one<00:04:12.820> of<00:04:12.880> the<00:04:12.940> bolts<00:04:13.180> out

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
working with I got one of the bolts out

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.400 
working with I got one of the bolts out
that's<00:04:13.660> on<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.870> other<00:04:14.020> side<00:04:14.080> I<00:04:15.000> disconnected

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
that's on the other side I disconnected

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.830 
that's on the other side I disconnected
that<00:04:17.410> part<00:04:17.650> of<00:04:17.710> the<00:04:17.800> drive<00:04:17.980> shaft<00:04:18.010> so<00:04:18.840> that's

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
that part of the drive shaft so that's

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:27.300 
that part of the drive shaft so that's
hanging<00:04:20.110> and<00:04:20.640> then<00:04:23.130> now<00:04:24.130> I<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:25.680> rotate<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:27.070> to

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
hanging and then now I can rotate it to

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.650 
hanging and then now I can rotate it to
get<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.580> each<00:04:27.700> bolt<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:31.360> that's<00:04:31.480> gonna<00:04:31.600> be

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
get to each bolt so that's gonna be

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.210 
get to each bolt so that's gonna be
painless<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:32.260> can't<00:04:32.500> use<00:04:32.650> my<00:04:34.590> my<00:04:35.590> power<00:04:35.830> tools

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
painless I can't use my my power tools

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.310 
painless I can't use my my power tools
so<00:04:37.030> they<00:04:37.120> won't<00:04:37.240> fit<00:04:37.570> so<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.870> have<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.080> sit<00:04:38.290> here

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
so they won't fit so I have to sit here

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.200 
so they won't fit so I have to sit here
with<00:04:38.500> a<00:04:38.560> stupid<00:04:39.070> little<00:04:39.370> box<00:04:39.640> and<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:39.970> wrench

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
with a stupid little box and a wrench

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.000 
with a stupid little box and a wrench
and<00:04:40.360> take<00:04:40.570> them<00:04:40.750> off<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.970> differential<00:04:43.630> is

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
and take them off the differential is

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.250 
and take them off the differential is
obviously<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.130> neutral<00:04:45.640> if<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.180> can<00:04:46.390> turn<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:46.990> so

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
obviously a neutral if I can turn it so

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.200 
obviously a neutral if I can turn it so
yeah<00:04:47.410> that's<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.280> neutral<00:04:48.460> along<00:04:48.970> with<00:04:49.120> the

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
yeah that's a neutral along with the

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.420 
yeah that's a neutral along with the
transmission<00:04:49.600> in<00:04:49.870> neutral<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.410> have<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
transmission in neutral I have the

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.770 
transmission in neutral I have the
parking<00:04:51.730> brake<00:04:51.910> on<00:04:52.060> along<00:04:52.450> with<00:04:52.660> um<00:04:54.300> stops<00:04:55.300> of

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
parking brake on along with um stops of

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.450 
parking brake on along with um stops of
other<00:04:56.230> things<00:04:56.560> to<00:04:56.890> keep<00:04:56.920> this<00:04:57.190> thing<00:04:57.400> from

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
other things to keep this thing from

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.460 
other things to keep this thing from
rolling<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:59.260> I'm<00:05:00.160> gonna<00:05:00.370> do<00:05:00.580> that<00:05:00.730> and<00:05:01.510> I<00:05:02.020> think

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
rolling so I'm gonna do that and I think

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.970 
rolling so I'm gonna do that and I think
that'll<00:05:02.710> be<00:05:02.740> absolutely<00:05:04.710> okay

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
that'll be absolutely okay

00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:56.119 
front near the differential okay so we

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:58.809 
front near the differential okay so we
have<00:05:56.300> both<00:05:56.629> our<00:05:56.869> white<00:05:57.020> marks<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:58.610> that<00:05:58.729> we

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
have both our white marks so that we

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.389 
have both our white marks so that we
know<00:05:58.969> which<00:05:59.119> way<00:05:59.389> it<00:05:59.749> came<00:05:59.990> out<00:06:00.050> and<00:06:00.679> also

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:01.399 
know which way it came out and also

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.159 
know which way it came out and also
which<00:06:01.729> way<00:06:01.939> it'll<00:06:02.149> go<00:06:02.269> back<00:06:02.449> in<00:06:02.719> when<00:06:03.050> we

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
which way it'll go back in when we

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:22.059 
which way it'll go back in when we
install<00:06:03.559> it<00:06:03.969> so<00:06:06.129> axles<00:06:07.129> are<00:06:07.580> now<00:06:07.990> remove<00:06:21.069> it

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:22.069 
install it so axles are now remove it

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:28.210

figure out how to either get them back
on<00:07:10.230> the<00:07:10.290> wall<00:07:10.470> or<00:07:10.830> get<00:07:11.160> new<00:07:11.370> u-joints<00:07:11.840> but<00:07:12.840> at

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:12.930 
on the wall or get new u-joints but at

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.540 
on the wall or get new u-joints but at
least<00:07:13.020> that's<00:07:13.260> in<00:07:13.410> a<00:07:13.470> spot<00:07:13.770> that's<00:07:14.010> easier<00:07:14.490> to
