00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
okay I was it that's not the most

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.270 
okay I was it that's not the most
impressive<00:02:15.840> wheel<00:02:16.350> spins<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.950> we've<00:02:17.130> ever

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
impressive wheel spins that we've ever

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.410 
impressive wheel spins that we've ever
done<00:02:19.880> actually<00:02:20.880> would<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.090> thought<00:02:21.180> we<00:02:21.330> were

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
done actually would have thought we were

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.550 
done actually would have thought we were
we<00:02:21.540> gotta<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.840> something<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.260> little<00:02:22.410> bit

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
we gotta know something a little bit

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.680 
we gotta know something a little bit
better<00:02:22.680> than<00:02:22.890> than<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.580> but<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.510> guess

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
better than than that but I guess

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.130 
better than than that but I guess
