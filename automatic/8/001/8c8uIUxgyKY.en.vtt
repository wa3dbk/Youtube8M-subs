00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.850 

baidu<00:00:57.880> attach<00:00:58.450> this<00:00:58.690> sort<00:00:58.960> of<00:00:59.050> idea<00:00:59.320> of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
baidu attach this sort of idea of

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.770 
baidu attach this sort of idea of
meditation<00:01:00.460> with<00:01:00.640> BASE<00:01:00.820> jumping<00:01:01.270> for<00:01:01.750> a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
meditation with BASE jumping for a

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.229 
meditation with BASE jumping for a
reason<00:01:02.170> because<00:01:02.860> meditation<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.790> all<00:01:03.970> about

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
reason because meditation is all about

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.260 
reason because meditation is all about
now<00:01:04.870> focusing<00:01:05.740> on<00:01:05.860> you<00:01:06.010> on<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.370> moment<00:01:06.790> and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
now focusing on you on the moment and

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.690 
now focusing on you on the moment and
when<00:01:07.480> you<00:01:07.570> do<00:01:07.750> that<00:01:07.960> every<00:01:08.770> single<00:01:09.070> moment<00:01:09.460> is

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
when you do that every single moment is

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.170 
when you do that every single moment is
very<00:01:09.910> important<00:01:10.510> so<00:01:11.140> you<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.970> can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
very important so you you you can

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.530 
very important so you you you can
observe<00:01:13.300> it<00:01:13.720> almost<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.790> get<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:16.270> in

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
observe it almost to get to that in
