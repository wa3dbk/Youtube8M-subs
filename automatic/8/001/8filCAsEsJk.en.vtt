assist<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.980> along<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.880> he<00:02:27.880> was<00:02:27.910> 5<00:02:28.630> inches<00:02:29.640> 5

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
assist it along and he was 5 inches 5

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.000 
assist it along and he was 5 inches 5
inches<00:02:30.670> long<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.690> little<00:02:32.230> bit<00:02:32.410> longer<00:02:32.650> than<00:02:32.950> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
inches long a little bit longer than the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.030 
inches long a little bit longer than the
back<00:02:33.190> float<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> water<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.590> not<00:02:38.710> getting

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
back float so the water is not getting

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.650 
back float so the water is not getting
down<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.430> salep<00:02:39.790> at<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.000> rate<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.450> it's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
down to the salep at the rate that it's

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.100 
down to the salep at the rate that it's
pumping<00:02:41.020> back<00:02:41.200> in

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.180 

there<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.200> goes<00:02:46.379> it's<00:02:46.730> shutting<00:02:47.730> off<00:02:47.940> now

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
there it goes it's shutting off now

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.259 
there it goes it's shutting off now
that's<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.310> noise<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.760> my<00:02:50.849> wife<00:02:51.060> heard

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
that's the noise and my wife heard

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.699 
that's the noise and my wife heard
that's<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.250> pop<00:02:53.250> shutting<00:02:53.760> off

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.140 

they<00:02:58.709> were<00:02:58.769> completely<00:02:59.160> shut<00:02:59.519> down<00:02:59.580> here<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.090> a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
they were completely shut down here in a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:25.520 
they were completely shut down here in a
second<00:03:21.110> it's<00:03:22.110> completely<00:03:22.620> shut<00:03:22.829> off<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:24.530> siphon

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
second it's completely shut off a siphon

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.140 
second it's completely shut off a siphon
break<00:03:25.739> I'm<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:26.010> returnable<00:03:26.519> break<00:03:26.760> here<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.060> a

break I'm a returnable break here in a

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:38.750 
break I'm a returnable break here in a
second<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:34.400> asked<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:37.250> water<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.519> salt

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
second I asked the water and the salt

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.850 
second I asked the water and the salt

right there when the water drops below
that<00:04:03.310> point<00:04:04.320> it'll<00:04:05.320> shut<00:04:05.620> off<00:04:05.770> the<00:04:05.950> return

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250
