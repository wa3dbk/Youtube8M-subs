it's actually a bit simplistic and
really<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.380> strategy<00:01:06.950> isn't<00:01:07.160> quite<00:01:07.610> as<00:01:07.820> deep

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
as i would like but it's still a solid

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.370 
as i would like but it's still a solid
game<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:11.210> book<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.540> really<00:01:11.690> nice<00:01:12.050> it's

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
actually really thin it clocks in it

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.120 
actually really thin it clocks in it
under<00:01:14.390> 200<00:01:14.840> pages<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.380> manages<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.830> fit<00:01:15.980> in

warhammer fantasy is obviously the

warhammer<00:02:19.220> fantasy<00:02:19.489> 8th<00:02:19.849> edition<00:02:19.970> got<00:02:20.360> a

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
warhammer fantasy 8th edition got a

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.350 
warhammer fantasy 8th edition got a
little<00:02:20.720> too<00:02:21.050> much<00:02:21.230> into<00:02:21.620> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
little too much into to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.260 
little too much into to
random<00:02:22.900> elements<00:02:23.320> like<00:02:23.500> random<00:02:24.430> charges<00:02:25.030> and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
random elements like random charges and

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.210 
random elements like random charges and
spells<00:02:25.660> are<00:02:25.900> all<00:02:25.930> random<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
spells are all random and it's just so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.210 
spells are all random and it's just so
much<00:02:27.280> randomness<00:02:28.060> which<00:02:28.210> while<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.020> enjoy<00:02:29.380> a

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
much randomness which while I enjoy a

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.190 
much randomness which while I enjoy a
decent<00:02:30.970> amount<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.180> randomness<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.870> my<00:02:31.960> games

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
decent amount of randomness in my games

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.020 
decent amount of randomness in my games
I<00:02:32.410> also<00:02:32.950> enjoy<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.400> decent<00:02:33.820> amount<00:02:34.000> of

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
I also enjoy a decent amount of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.300 
I also enjoy a decent amount of
structure<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.870> takes<00:02:35.530> care<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.070> lot<00:02:36.100> of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
structure this takes care of a lot of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.460 
structure this takes care of a lot of
that<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:37.360> example<00:02:37.750> this<00:02:37.930> actually<00:02:38.260> works

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
that for example this actually works

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.680 
that for example this actually works
charges<00:02:39.010> like<00:02:39.220> 7th<00:02:39.670> edition<00:02:39.760> fancy<00:02:40.330> did<00:02:40.480> where

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
charges like 7th edition fancy did where

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.290 
charges like 7th edition fancy did where
it's<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.200> double<00:02:41.560> your<00:02:41.710> movement<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:43.210> I

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
it's just double your movement and I

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.180 
it's just double your movement and I
really<00:02:43.630> like<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.170> don't<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.770> random

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
really like that I don't like the random

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.730 
really like that I don't like the random
charges<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.850> doesn't<00:02:46.120> make<00:02:46.210> sense<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.780> me<00:02:47.020> but

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
charges it doesn't make sense to me but

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.460 
charges it doesn't make sense to me but
that's<00:02:48.550> for<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> whole<00:02:49.300> nother<00:02:49.480> video<00:02:49.690> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
that's for a whole nother video the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.140 
that's for a whole nother video the
combat<00:02:50.890> rules<00:02:51.100> in<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:51.340> are<00:02:51.490> so<00:02:51.760> much<00:02:51.940> easier

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
combat rules in this are so much easier

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.230 
combat rules in this are so much easier
to<00:02:52.450> get<00:02:52.600> to<00:02:52.870> because<00:02:53.290> every<00:02:53.800> unit<00:02:54.280> has<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.459> melee

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
to get to because every unit has a melee

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.020 
to get to because every unit has a melee
and<00:02:55.540> ranged<00:02:55.570> attack<00:02:56.440> value<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.160> tells

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
and ranged attack value and that tells

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.270 
and ranged attack value and that tells
you<00:02:58.150> what<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.450> need<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.750> roll<00:02:58.930> on<00:02:59.170> a<00:02:59.200> d6<00:02:59.770> so

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
you what you need to roll on a d6 so

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.550 
you what you need to roll on a d6 so
once<00:03:00.850> you're<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.300> combat<00:03:01.660> all<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.230> have<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.440> do

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
once you're in combat all you have to do

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.560 
once you're in combat all you have to do
is<00:03:02.709> look<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.310> number<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.760> attacks<00:03:04.090> you<00:03:04.300> get

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
is look at the number of attacks you get

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.410 
is look at the number of attacks you get
and<00:03:04.840> then<00:03:05.680> roll<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.580> many<00:03:06.760> dice<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.300> you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
and then roll that many dice and you

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.140 
and then roll that many dice and you
need<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.690> roll<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.170> many<00:03:08.760> hits<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:09.970> that

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
need to roll that many hits on that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.760 
need to roll that many hits on that
number<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:10.660> if<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.870> have<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:10.989> unit<00:03:11.350> with<00:03:11.470> 10

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
number so if you have a unit with 10

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.410 
number so if you have a unit with 10
attacks<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.310> they<00:03:12.400> have<00:03:12.489> a<00:03:12.550> melee<00:03:12.970> of<00:03:13.090> three

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
attacks and they have a melee of three

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.080 
attacks and they have a melee of three
up<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:14.320> get<00:03:14.440> 10<00:03:14.709> attacks<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.280> you<00:03:15.580> three<00:03:15.940> ups

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
up you get 10 attacks and you three ups

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.570 
up you get 10 attacks and you three ups
to<00:03:16.239> hit<00:03:16.390> it's<00:03:16.680> right<00:03:17.680> there<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.160> simple

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
to hit it's right there it's simple

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.030 
to hit it's right there it's simple
there's<00:03:18.790> no<00:03:18.910> charts<00:03:19.390> or<00:03:19.570> tables<00:03:19.720> if<00:03:20.500> none<00:03:21.010> of

there's no charts or tables if none of

there's no charts or tables if none of

design ideas behind a lot of their

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.340 
design ideas behind a lot of their
miniatures<00:03:46.090> they're<00:03:46.360> elves<00:03:46.600> actually<00:03:47.200> look

models<00:05:41.430> as<00:05:41.580> they<00:05:41.610> die<00:05:41.909> you<00:05:41.970> just<00:05:42.360> put<00:05:42.539> one

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
models as they die you just put one

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.270 
models as they die you just put one
counters<00:05:43.110> next<00:05:43.349> to<00:05:43.409> the<00:05:43.500> unit<00:05:43.830> because<00:05:44.099> that

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
counters next to the unit because that

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.890 
counters next to the unit because that
means<00:05:44.430> all<00:05:44.970> those<00:05:45.180> models<00:05:45.509> you<00:05:45.599> spent<00:05:45.840> all

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
means all those models you spent all

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.300 
means all those models you spent all
that<00:05:45.960> time<00:05:46.110> painting<00:05:46.590> don't<00:05:46.949> just<00:05:47.070> become

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
that time painting don't just become

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.920 
that time painting don't just become
fancy<00:05:47.639> lune<00:05:47.820> markers<00:05:48.680> however<00:05:50.599> when<00:05:51.599> it's<00:05:51.780> not

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
fancy lune markers however when it's not

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.450 
fancy lune markers however when it's not
your<00:05:52.110> turn<00:05:52.320> there's<00:05:52.590> nothing<00:05:52.949> to<00:05:53.039> do<00:05:53.190> because

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
your turn there's nothing to do because

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.820 
your turn there's nothing to do because
your<00:05:53.699> opponent<00:05:54.419> rolls<00:05:54.719> your<00:05:55.020> nerve<00:05:55.320> scores

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
however there is one big flaw with the

however there is one big flaw with the
campaign<00:06:18.870> system<00:06:19.259> when<00:06:19.979> you<00:06:20.070> get<00:06:20.219> experience

campaign system when you get experience

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:24.170 
campaign system when you get experience
you<00:06:21.780> save<00:06:22.259> that<00:06:22.289> up<00:06:22.620> and<00:06:22.860> when<00:06:23.219> a<00:06:23.460> unit<00:06:23.820> gets<00:06:23.969> a

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
you save that up and when a unit gets a

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.879 
you save that up and when a unit gets a
certain<00:06:24.449> amount<00:06:24.599> of<00:06:24.780> experience<00:06:25.080> they<00:06:25.650> gain

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
certain amount of experience they gain

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.749
