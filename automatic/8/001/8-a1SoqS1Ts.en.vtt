00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.700

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.190
 tutorial 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 I 'm not going to talk here that explains 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.120

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.880
 bow with the largest coconut the common already put 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.740
 in the thing already blame them but the thing is that I 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.520

 Come back here, it's over and that's it. 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:40.399
 here is the following command here it is 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.399
 basically you use a position of 

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:46.349
 highlight but the opposition have 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:50.009
 speed a portion of slowness is 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:53.759
 basically this is the command and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.189
 subcommand that I got a forum was a 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.329
 I've been working there, the guy in charge. 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.499
 Here for you, I do not know very well. 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.569

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:18.750
 I understand it is slow speed ac 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.709
 10 also asks of slowness is a business 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.580
 It's a business here that makes the bow 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:29.340

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.019
