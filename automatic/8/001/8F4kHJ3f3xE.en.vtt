it<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.220> obvious<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.109> really<00:00:22.109> didn't<00:00:22.410> know

are not a good thing for an amateur it's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
are not a good thing for an amateur it's
also<00:00:46.590> good<00:00:46.980> when<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.340> first<00:00:47.520> start<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.059> if

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
also good when you first start out if

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.209 
also good when you first start out if
you're<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:48.780> learning<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.710> stay<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.070> your

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you're just learning to stay on your

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
you're just learning to stay on your
knees<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.820> stay<00:00:51.449> really<00:00:51.690> low<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> Machine

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
knees and stay really low on the Machine

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.350 
knees and stay really low on the Machine
because<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> stand<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.940> feels<00:00:54.149> like

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
because as you stand up it feels like

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.209 
because as you stand up it feels like
you're<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.629> top<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> Eiffel<00:00:55.410> Tower<00:00:55.440> or

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
you're on top of the Eiffel Tower or

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.279 
you're on top of the Eiffel Tower or
something<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.239> tall<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.600> tippy

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
something it's just so tall and tippy

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.200 
something it's just so tall and tippy
it's<00:00:58.890> better<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.309> kind<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.579> find<00:00:59.820> your<00:00:59.940> feet

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it's better to kind of find your feet

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.349 
it's better to kind of find your feet
down<00:01:01.050> low<00:01:01.379> before<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.370> start<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> stand<00:01:03.149> up

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
down low before you start to stand up

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.520 
down low before you start to stand up
and<00:01:04.070> go<00:01:05.070> chest<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.549> chest<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.720> jet<00:01:07.290> ski

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and go chest to chest with the jet ski

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
and go chest to chest with the jet ski
world<00:01:08.119> another<00:01:09.119> tip<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.689> give<00:01:10.049> you

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229

world another tip that I can give you
and<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> probably<00:01:11.540> my<00:01:12.540> worst<00:01:13.350> problem

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and this is probably my worst problem

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
and this is probably my worst problem
with<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.220> machine<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.750> if<00:01:15.990> you're

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
with this machine is that if you're

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.410 
with this machine is that if you're
turning<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.549> start<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.000> tip<00:01:18.180> over

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
turning right and you start to tip over

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
turning right and you start to tip over
to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:20.100> left<00:01:20.900> it's<00:01:21.900> hard<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> recover<00:01:22.710> from

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to the left it's hard to recover from

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.859 
to the left it's hard to recover from
that<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.790> best<00:01:24.000> advice<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.540> give<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that and the best advice I can give you

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.140 
that and the best advice I can give you
is<00:01:25.200> try<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> turn<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> handlebars<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.759> give

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
is try to turn the handlebars and give

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.230 
is try to turn the handlebars and give
it<00:01:27.270> gas<00:01:27.680> try<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> thrust<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.729> pull<00:01:30.060> out

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
it gas try to use the thrust to pull out

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.350 
it gas try to use the thrust to pull out
of<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:31.009> few<00:01:32.009> folks<00:01:32.310> told<00:01:32.610> me<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.150> haven't

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
of it a few folks told me that I haven't

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.450 
of it a few folks told me that I haven't
tried<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.110> method<00:01:34.560> yet<00:01:34.799> we'll<00:01:35.189> see<00:01:35.369> if

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
tried out that method yet we'll see if

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.140 
tried out that method yet we'll see if
it<00:01:35.579> works<00:01:35.610> today<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:37.220> I'm<00:01:38.220> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> start<00:01:39.060> up

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
it works today so I'm going to start up

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.370 
it works today so I'm going to start up
the<00:01:39.180> machine<00:01:39.570> see<00:01:40.500> how<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> does<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
the machine see how it does and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:03:30.030 
the machine see how it does and
hopefully<00:01:43.380> it'll<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.399> positive<00:01:44.460> experience

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.410 

what<00:03:31.040> do<00:03:31.129> you<00:03:31.220> think<00:03:31.430> what's<00:03:31.640> not<00:03:31.849> quite<00:03:32.180> as

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
what do you think what's not quite as

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.680 
what do you think what's not quite as
blatantly<00:03:33.220> amateur<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.580> first<00:03:34.849> run<00:03:35.150> it

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
blatantly amateur is the first run it

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.320 
blatantly amateur is the first run it
was<00:03:35.840> very<00:03:36.050> good<00:03:36.370> fell<00:03:37.370> off<00:03:37.489> a<00:03:37.550> couple<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:38.060> times

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
was very good fell off a couple of times

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.790 
was very good fell off a couple of times
you<00:03:39.019> can<00:03:39.319> tell<00:03:40.239> it's<00:03:41.239> it's<00:03:41.690> unlike<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.110> bicycle

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
you can tell it's it's unlike a bicycle

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.550 
you can tell it's it's unlike a bicycle
or<00:03:42.830> motorcycle<00:03:43.010> where<00:03:44.230> there<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.349> some

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
or motorcycle where there is some

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.920 
or motorcycle where there is some
inherent<00:03:46.010> stability<00:03:47.019> with<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.140> machine

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
inherent stability with the machine

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.059 
inherent stability with the machine
because<00:03:50.930> of<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.050> spinning<00:03:51.380> wheels<00:03:51.680> this

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
because of the spinning wheels this

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.120 
because of the spinning wheels this
