00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.779
 but 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.479
 hello today we will tell you 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.849
 sports suspension urban and about 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:10.990
 options but so to say about 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.940
 intermediate suspension options which 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.639
 you can use let's start with 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.500
 sports suspension by example 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.390
 collins shock absorbers which we 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.140
 use our racing ahead psp2 we 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.550
 we give in to the class supersport we need 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.770
 great performance features 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.050
 suspensions so this risotto is enough 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.030
 Dear in themselves include a lot 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.800
 most of various settings adjustments 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.899
 simple setup is necessary it 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.610
 spring preload it 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.239
 We need to be placed free 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.670
 stroke and load with the pilot 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.160
 further we have more thin 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.950
 March settings but such as 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.629
 adjustment clamp and shock absorbers then 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.579
 there is a speed of its damping and 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.309
 spin speed adjustment 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.850
 since the shock absorber quickly kills it 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.649
 backwards 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.480
 further thanks to the arrangement of this 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.119
 shock absorber we can adjust it 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.090
 height and already how to say homemade 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.039
 part we can adjust the height 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.950
 carved washers that allow us 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.630
 change the angle of the geometry of the front 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.319
 pendants to influence the shift on 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.509
 controllability 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.209
 With regards to the front shock absorber on 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.590
 zip u scooters uninstalled 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:22.359
 pendulum plug so the front 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.310
 our shock absorber is not telescopic 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.289
 an attack resembling but slightly posterior 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.259
 shock absorber here also we have 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.990
 spring preload adjustment 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.419
 compression speed adjustment shock absorbers 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.490
 and rebound adjustment do not forget about 

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:38.289
 that fine tuning the suspension and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.359
 adjustment is made when already 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.490
 suspension you worked that is 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.689
 warmed up on three oils and went out on his 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.090
 optimum temperature 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.880
 workers only tuning suspension 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.450
 adjustment is made by changing 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.609
 so-called click clicks here on 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.229
 adjustment interval we need 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.200
 suspension usually starts hard 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.359
 values ​​and you gradually leads her to 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.859
 level you need at the same time on 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.069
 all must be recorded 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.110
 parameters that are displayed adjustment 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.679
 preload springs are carried out 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.079
 nuts which 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.510
 necessarily quatrice or second nut 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.280
 either a cog that rests the thread 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.530
 does not and unwind during your 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.540
 work this professional suspension 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.280
 very good at let you translate into 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.900
 life all your ideas all your 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.239
 racing scooter features 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.420
 here we are still probably recommended 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.250
 use in class supersport i 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 the only minus is of course 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.989
 high price if you want to perform in 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.620
 class for example open and i recommend 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.689
 you use more budget 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.489
 pendants such as makeda i'm other 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.919
 there are manufacturers too interesting 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.739
 option from bands more budget which 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:51.200
 which you can ride not only 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.079
 let's say there races on and combine and 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.519
 movement with the city of this shock absorbers 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.370
 also have preload adjustment 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.150
 spring speed adjustment 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.280
 firms not that is laugh and shock absorber and 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.409
 damper speed adjustment 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.650
 it is also made in the form of clicks that 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.629
 eases our setup and in principle he 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.780
 works in all necessary ranges 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.419
 difference from cooler suspensions 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.030
 sports racing just having at least 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.159
 the number of adjustments here for example if 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.189
 there is a racing suspension of them maybe 10 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.229
 here dead 25 she performs all the same 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.060
 most functions can jump speed 

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:31.939
 work may be late which you 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.419
 Basically you will not notice if you do not 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.400
 throw one hundred percent further to the floor 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.290
 sports suspension will tell you on 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.000
 Example insey front dampers 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.629
 that fits on japanese scooters 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.349
 such to fund affairs and yamaha jog in these 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.799
 shock absorbers stiffness and compression soon 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.239
 regulated by pouring oil into them 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.150
 required viscosity will be up to the 15th 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.979
 action or 5 and rebound rate from them 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.340
 governed by special such tricks 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:03.409
 bread can be manually twisted here 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.949
 the necessary scale on which you can 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.139
 expose its stiffness shock absorbers 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.989
 work quite well showed themselves to 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:14.900
 competitions in our practice and 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.669
 are a good substitute for staff from 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.769
 simple shock absorbers can offer 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.759
 on the example of such a shock absorber 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.220
 with this damper tion 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.050
 hang up and the like already laid factory 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.509
 they are not governed by him 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.430
 Only preload spring adjustment with 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.379
 using such a key to he enters 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.740
 shock absorber kit and by 

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:38.360
 permutations in different positions you 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.099
 adjust its stiffness data 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.139
 shock absorbers are very inexpensive it costs 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:43.669
 about two thousand rubles he is fine 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.740
 Suitable for use in 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:48.740
 urban setting and racing us in 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.539
 classroom drain either open if you 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.720
 exhaust it with the potential of santalova 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.099
 few can always buy yelets today 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.080
 There is a huge variety on the market. 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.659
 various suspensions and they are all 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.300
 differ in price in quality 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:05.630
 So as not to wrestle, I recommend you 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.009
 Use the hair catalog in 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.500
 which if beautiful 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.139
 suspension for the base level is not enough 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.960
 rs3 it fits perfectly for the city and 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.710
 for elementary classes so much open 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.199
 few times myself 24 this is the initial stage 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.759
 racing suspension gas 2410 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.830
 if at all for the supersport class 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.550
 milk suspension pic 24 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.560
 10r these pendants after quality 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.990
 I think that the best option would be me 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.580
 work great 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:37.479
 subscribe to our channel 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.479
 amortize properly for now
