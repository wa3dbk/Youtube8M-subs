 gastronomy where we teach them to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 prepare simple recipes and step by step 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.880
 we explain many techniques 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.270
 used in the kitchen the dish that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.829
 let's prepare today is salad tabbouleh 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.759
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:36.270
 semolina ingredients of couscous or wilbur 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:39.149
 parsley tomato cucumber pepper olives 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.600
 black onion tarragon raisins 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.030
 pitted pine nuts fresh mint cheese 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.670
 parmesan olive oil lemon juice 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.070
 salt and pepper and as a companion 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.260
 pampita that the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.880
 prepare the wheat comes in two versions 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.250
 that you can use at home 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.960
 one is the bureau bulbul that also 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 get in the supermarkets is the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.489
 same wheat but with a little shell or 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.519
 the couscous that is made much faster and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.469
 It is already previously peeled and is more 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.579
 easy to cook in this case like 

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:10.619
 we are talking about vegetarian meals 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.869
 We will make it healthier and we will 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.050
 use the vulgar look for each cup 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.390
 of bulger you are going to aa 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.940
 and a cup of water in this case I have 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.580
 two cups then we have two cups of water 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.890
 that I already put very hot to boil it 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.640
 we obviously put in the pot and 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.980
 we mix with a little salt ok this is 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.540
 will cook for about five 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.490
 minutes eight minutes but they have to 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.800
 wait for all the water to be absorbed 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.930
 because look, I've already removed from the fire 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.120
 the bulgaria is ready is like a 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.990
 obviously much softer grain you 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.619
 they can eat it 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.360
 it's delicious and especially that we have it 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.009
 ready so we can mix all the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.600
 previously chopped ingredients what 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.270
 what is the paprika onion the tomato 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.720
 and the cucumber but the important thing of the table 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.460
 is the parsley look, let's go 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.530
 let's have the parsley that's a lot 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.700
 more curly let's call it that so 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.799
 you look much richer and 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 abundant we remove part of the stems 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.580
 I had already advanced a little here and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.950
 what are we going to do to explain the ends 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.110
 final finely ok then fine 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.660
 we retired a little more and now 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 we just grab all this we try 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.220
 to compact as much as possible and what 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.350
 we are going to chop finely we started so 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.470
 smaller and you go until 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.750
 we started to chop everything has to 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.180
 look like it's paper and I 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.370
 be as confite ok we cut a little bit 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.769
 the part that gives it a taste and a smell 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.330
 delicious look the color that rich and 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.480
 apart we will complement it with a 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.730
 little sale also chopped the grass 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.489
 let's mix all the ingredients 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.040
 very simple , we already have ready 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.680
 obviously the bulb we are going to 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.450
 enter here all this quickly 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.750
 along with all the vegetables that we're going 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.940
 to use allow me to add this here 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.920
 we do this part that is a 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.270
 super healthy delicious combination that 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.130
 you can have it at home 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.350
 they are very well preserved because 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.240
 It carries a lot of oil 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.400
 olive we are not going to mix this a 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.770
 little and now I will add also 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.000
 You can add the chopped cucumber 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:19.110
 squares 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.110
 we do this let me a second tomato 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.069
 onion and a little bit of paprika all this 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.900
 we are going to mix it and later what 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.299
 let's season with a little oil 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.709
 olive more or less depending on how 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.140
 you like it I am going to use a 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.819
 half a cup you have to throw enough 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.010
 olive oil because it will give you a 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.690
 taste and juice of about 3 lemons for 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.940
 this amount because that is the secret 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.769
 the tabulÃ© that has takes quite 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.810
 pretty lemon, look, we're going to 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.310
 already mix salt milk and 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.079
 pepper you will make it to taste 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.680
 get a little more fresh pepper 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:54.099
 of course you can not miss and what 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.030
 that we're just going to mix ok 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.099
 after we've already mixed it 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.530
 let's go with pampita and what 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.510
 we serve or in such a large bowl 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.300
 well rich or we serve it in a way 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.280
 individual allow me here look 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.540
 and we put in the center 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.969
 ok we do like a tower taboo quote 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.440
 a little bit more here to determine and 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.810
 notice , we will accompany you as you 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.600
 I said with pampita in this case 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.419
 selected miniature pampita ok can 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.669
 also be some ornamental olives 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.370
 but the most important thing is that you 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.530
 add some toasted pine nuts 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.130
 on top and additionally some raisins 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.380
 sweets to complement an entire recipe 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.389
 vegetarian ok I leave here 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.350
