00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
manufacture a door that has follows

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.610 
manufacture a door that has follows
absolute<00:02:49.200> precision<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:50.010> its<00:02:50.340> manufacturing

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
absolute precision in its manufacturing

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.740 
absolute precision in its manufacturing
this<00:02:52.620> enables<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.519> product<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.300> work<00:02:54.480> in

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
this enables that the product to work in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.110 
this enables that the product to work in
a<00:02:55.110> free<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.680> easy<00:02:55.950> way<00:02:56.570> without<00:02:57.570> restriction
