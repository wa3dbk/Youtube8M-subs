00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
today I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.000 
today I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:04.410> rowboat<00:00:05.870> just<00:00:06.870> simple<00:00:07.770> simple<00:00:09.800> get<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
a rowboat just simple simple get a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.589 
a rowboat just simple simple get a
square<00:00:11.550> piece<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.000> paper<00:00:14.210> valley-fold<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
square piece of paper valley-fold the

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.890 
square piece of paper valley-fold the
top<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> bottom<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:17.570> quarter<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.690> an

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
top and the bottom about quarter of an

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:31.099 
top and the bottom about quarter of an
inch<00:00:19.109> from<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.740> edges<00:00:29.539> valley<00:00:30.539> fold<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
inch from the edges valley fold the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.220 
inch from the edges valley fold the
paper<00:00:31.349> from<00:00:31.679> top<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> bottom<00:00:32.570> which<00:00:33.570> basically

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
paper from top to bottom which basically

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:44.470 
paper from top to bottom which basically
in<00:00:39.980> and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.879> bring<00:00:42.180> valley<00:00:43.079> fold<00:00:43.469> your

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
in and then you bring valley fold your

00:00:44.480 --> 00:01:00.369 
in and then you bring valley fold your
bottom<00:00:45.980> piece<00:00:47.930> for<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.170> center<00:00:49.620> crease<00:00:52.370> same

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.170 

then<00:01:02.690> diagonally<00:01:03.690> valley<00:01:04.320> fold<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.610> corners

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
then diagonally valley fold the corners

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:14.670 
then diagonally valley fold the corners
to<00:01:06.689> make<00:01:06.869> triangles

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.250 

these<00:01:15.340> are<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:16.150> back<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.750> front<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:17.140> your

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
these are the back and the front of your

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.740 
these are the back and the front of your
book<00:01:17.440> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:21.130> valley<00:01:21.940> fold<00:01:22.300> along<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
book and then valley fold along the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.130 
book and then valley fold along the
lines<00:01:23.250> indicated<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.540> this

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:48.610 

all<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.530> way

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.060 

I'm<00:01:49.160> value<00:01:49.640> full<00:01:49.910> one<00:01:50.870> at<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.380> top<00:01:51.590> or<00:01:51.800> bottom

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
I'm value full one at the top or bottom

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.740 
I'm value full one at the top or bottom
point<00:01:52.540> about<00:01:53.540> like<00:01:54.670> water<00:01:55.670> of<00:01:56.120> an<00:01:56.270> inch<00:01:56.450> from

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
point about like water of an inch from

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.630 
point about like water of an inch from
the<00:01:56.840> center<00:01:57.470> line<00:01:59.500> that<00:02:00.500> same<00:02:00.740> tips<00:02:03.460> and<00:02:04.460> then

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
the center line that same tips and then

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.900 
the center line that same tips and then
once<00:02:05.360> you've<00:02:05.540> done<00:02:05.690> that<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:06.320> fold<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:09.910> so

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
once you've done that you fold it so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.070 
once you've done that you fold it so
when<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.240> have<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:13.070> inside<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.570> open

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
when you have that inside and you open

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.560 
when you have that inside and you open
it<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:17.270> then<00:02:17.630> very<00:02:18.140> carefully<00:02:19.150> turn<00:02:20.150> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
it and then very carefully turn the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:29.229 
it and then very carefully turn the
whole<00:02:20.780> thing<00:02:21.220> inside

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:34.280 

very<00:02:30.239> own<00:02:31.280> rowboat
