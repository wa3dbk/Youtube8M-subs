you<00:00:43.980> could<00:00:44.129> even<00:00:44.160> do<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> loop<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.329> real<00:00:45.480> life

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
you could even do the loop in real life

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.900 
you could even do the loop in real life
because<00:00:46.170> Messiah<00:00:46.829> 7<00:00:47.309> hadn't<00:00:47.579> even<00:00:47.670> been

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
because Messiah 7 hadn't even been

I only run it as a personal tech because
I<00:04:55.040> think<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.310> runs<00:04:55.460> pretty<00:04:55.730> well<00:04:55.880> in<00:04:56.180> the<00:04:56.270> deck

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
I think it runs pretty well in the deck

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.910 
I think it runs pretty well in the deck
I<00:04:56.720> mean<00:04:57.050> at<00:04:57.170> the<00:04:57.290> end<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.470> the<00:04:57.560> day<00:04:57.680> you<00:04:57.740> know

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
I mean at the end of the day you know

get two of them out then you just play

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.300 
get two of them out then you just play
that<00:05:02.360> get<00:05:02.750> galaxy-eyes<00:05:03.290> out<00:05:03.650> special<00:05:04.130> similar

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
that get galaxy-eyes out special similar

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.510 
that get galaxy-eyes out special similar
to<00:05:04.430> what<00:05:04.610> tales<00:05:04.880> and<00:05:05.180> then<00:05:05.360> you<00:05:05.450> can<00:05:05.630> special<00:05:05.870> a

to what tales and then you can special a

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.980 
to what tales and then you can special a
photon<00:05:07.520> strike<00:05:07.700> bounzer<00:05:07.760> now<00:05:08.720> that's<00:05:08.900> a

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
photon strike bounzer now that's a

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.810 
photon strike bounzer now that's a
pretty<00:05:09.170> cool<00:05:09.380> field<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:09.950> even<00:05:10.400> then<00:05:10.610> you

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
pretty cool field and even then you

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.440 
pretty cool field and even then you
could<00:05:11.060> just<00:05:11.180> go<00:05:11.390> graphic<00:05:12.640> item<00:05:13.640> which<00:05:14.270> would

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
could just go graphic item which would

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.960 
could just go graphic item which would
be<00:05:14.540> even<00:05:14.780> better<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.260> then<00:05:16.220> will<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.460> 8am<00:05:16.790> out

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
be even better and then will the 8am out

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.310 
be even better and then will the 8am out
you<00:05:17.150> can<00:05:17.270> just<00:05:17.420> special<00:05:17.690> someone<00:05:17.930> whatever<00:05:18.200> it

and then you'd special him but half the
time<00:05:27.080> of<00:05:27.380> agent<00:05:27.710> I<00:05:27.830> would<00:05:28.010> go<00:05:28.190> for<00:05:28.220> galaxy<00:05:28.940> eyes

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
time of agent I would go for galaxy eyes

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.370 
time of agent I would go for galaxy eyes
because<00:05:29.270> then<00:05:29.390> you<00:05:29.480> banish<00:05:29.780> him<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.140> then<00:05:30.230> his

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
our issues because we're never going to

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.560 
our issues because we're never going to
have<00:06:40.400> the<00:06:40.580> gift<00:06:40.760> keys<00:06:40.940> in<00:06:41.060> our<00:06:41.180> hand<00:06:41.360> all<00:06:41.510> the

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.690 
have the gift keys in our hand all the
time<00:06:41.630> and<00:06:42.080> then<00:06:42.920> finally<00:06:43.100> we<00:06:43.340> have<00:06:43.430> a<00:06:43.490> sword

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
time and then finally we have a sword

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.070 
time and then finally we have a sword
breaker<00:06:44.030> it's<00:06:44.330> just<00:06:44.630> pretty<00:06:44.900> much<00:06:45.050> a

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
breaker it's just pretty much a

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.200 
breaker it's just pretty much a
catastrophe<00:06:45.800> even<00:06:46.040> stronger<00:06:46.280> so<00:06:46.730> it<00:06:47.030> works

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
catastrophe even stronger so it works

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.260 
catastrophe even stronger so it works
out<00:06:47.980> there<00:06:48.980> is<00:06:49.100> no<00:06:49.220> side<00:06:49.460> deck<00:06:49.669> people<00:06:50.000> only

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
out there is no side deck people only

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.450 
out there is no side deck people only
because<00:06:50.600> I<00:06:50.780> haven't<00:06:51.590> exactly<00:06:51.950> four<00:06:52.310> other

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
because I haven't exactly four other

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.940 
because I haven't exactly four other
side<00:06:52.639> deck<00:06:52.850> yet<00:06:53.120> and<00:06:53.410> I'm<00:06:54.410> not<00:06:54.470> going<00:06:54.830> to
