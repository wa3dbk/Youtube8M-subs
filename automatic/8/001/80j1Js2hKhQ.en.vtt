hey it's mike here AKA lego man and this
is<00:00:07.189> my<00:00:07.370> mock<00:00:07.609> of<00:00:07.939> the<00:00:08.330> fourth<00:00:08.630> series<00:00:08.990> stringer

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590

is my mock of the fourth series stringer
this<00:00:10.400> is<00:00:10.519> based<00:00:10.760> off<00:00:10.940> of<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.269> preliminary

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.450 
this is based off of the preliminary

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.439 
this is based off of the preliminary
pictures<00:00:12.290> and<00:00:13.150> well<00:00:14.150> um<00:00:15.820> yeah<00:00:16.820> this<00:00:17.269> is

the<00:01:03.050> gun<00:01:03.289> i<00:01:03.620> actually<00:01:04.399> thought<00:01:04.729> it<00:01:04.789> was<00:01:04.909> pretty

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
the gun i actually thought it was pretty

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.419 
the gun i actually thought it was pretty
cool<00:01:05.380> it's<00:01:06.380> actually<00:01:06.499> going<00:01:06.740> to<00:01:06.829> be<00:01:06.889> silver

00:01:07.419 --> 00:01:07.429 
cool it's actually going to be silver

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:10.330 
cool it's actually going to be silver
and<00:01:07.899> have<00:01:08.899> a<00:01:08.959> silver<00:01:09.289> ice<00:01:09.619> shield<00:01:09.920> which<00:01:10.189> I

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
and have a silver ice shield which I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.440 
and have a silver ice shield which I
thought<00:01:10.490> was<00:01:10.639> pretty<00:01:10.789> cool<00:01:10.939> I<00:01:11.090> don't<00:01:11.359> know

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
thought was pretty cool I don't know

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.149 
thought was pretty cool I don't know
exactly<00:01:11.840> how<00:01:12.020> it's<00:01:12.170> built<00:01:12.319> but<00:01:12.649> I<00:01:12.709> just<00:01:12.920> built

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
exactly how it's built but I just built

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.769 
exactly how it's built but I just built
it<00:01:13.279> the<00:01:13.399> best<00:01:13.609> I<00:01:13.729> could<00:01:13.789> um<00:01:16.359> no<00:01:17.359> it's<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.599> pretty

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:17.779 
it the best I could um no it's a pretty

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:21.039 
it the best I could um no it's a pretty
cool<00:01:18.159> guy<00:01:19.159> overall<00:01:19.729> if<00:01:19.939> it<00:01:20.149> were<00:01:20.270> just<00:01:20.299> him<00:01:20.840> if

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
cool guy overall if it were just him if

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.199 
cool guy overall if it were just him if
it<00:01:21.649> weren't<00:01:21.889> if<00:01:22.429> there<00:01:22.670> weren't<00:01:22.819> all<00:01:23.029> those

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209 
it weren't if there weren't all those

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:25.629 
it weren't if there weren't all those
past<00:01:23.539> stringers<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:24.709> would<00:01:25.009> say<00:01:25.219> that<00:01:25.249> this<00:01:25.490> is

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639 
past stringers I would say that this is

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:30.249 
past stringers I would say that this is
a<00:01:25.670> pretty<00:01:25.999> cool<00:01:26.209> set<00:01:26.479> but<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:30.020> color

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
a pretty cool set but it the color

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.959 
a pretty cool set but it the color
scheme<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:30.979> mean<00:01:31.159> they<00:01:31.279> even<00:01:31.549> gave<00:01:31.729> him<00:01:31.939> a

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:31.969 
scheme I mean they even gave him a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.080 
scheme I mean they even gave him a
different<00:01:32.149> colored<00:01:32.569> head<00:01:33.490> it's<00:01:34.490> blue<00:01:34.819> now

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
different colored head it's blue now

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.620 
different colored head it's blue now
instead<00:01:35.539> of<00:01:35.599> um<00:01:35.869> or<00:01:36.439> ash<00:01:37.419> doesn't<00:01:38.419> make<00:01:38.599> very

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
instead of um or ash doesn't make very

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.499 
instead of um or ash doesn't make very
much<00:01:38.899> sense<00:01:39.259> um<00:01:39.740> anyway<00:01:40.549> back<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.359> gun

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
much sense um anyway back to the gun

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.529 
much sense um anyway back to the gun
again<00:01:41.779> the<00:01:41.899> gut<00:01:42.109> I<00:01:42.380> kind<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:43.310> like<00:01:43.849> the<00:01:44.149> idea<00:01:44.179> of

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
again the gut I kind of like the idea of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.039 
again the gut I kind of like the idea of
the<00:01:44.689> gun<00:01:44.899> it's<00:01:45.079> actually<00:01:45.409> only<00:01:45.529> one<00:01:45.859> handed<00:01:46.279> um

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
the gun it's actually only one handed um

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.539 
the gun it's actually only one handed um
couldn't<00:01:48.049> find<00:01:48.259> another<00:01:48.529> black<00:01:48.799> hand<00:01:49.130> so<00:01:49.520> I

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
couldn't find another black hand so I

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.819 
couldn't find another black hand so I
just<00:01:49.849> had<00:01:50.029> to<00:01:50.060> put<00:01:50.329> one<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.599> these<00:01:50.829> bionicle

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
just had to put one of these bionicle

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:57.429 
just had to put one of these bionicle
pieces<00:01:52.639> there<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:56.060> body<00:01:56.359> armor<00:01:56.869> on<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.200> real

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
pieces there the body armor on the real

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.109 
pieces there the body armor on the real
one<00:01:57.799> will<00:01:58.039> actually<00:01:58.219> be<00:02:00.309> translucent<00:02:01.309> and<00:02:01.909> it

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
one will actually be translucent and it

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.599 
one will actually be translucent and it
will<00:02:02.239> be<00:02:02.389> one<00:02:02.569> of<00:02:02.599> the<00:02:02.719> new<00:02:02.899> style<00:02:03.489> here<00:02:04.489> all

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:04.609 
will be one of the new style here all

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:07.569 
will be one of the new style here all
body<00:02:04.849> armor<00:02:05.239> pieces<00:02:05.619> pretty<00:02:06.619> cool<00:02:06.859> that

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
body armor pieces pretty cool that

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.759 
body armor pieces pretty cool that
part's<00:02:07.909> pretty<00:02:08.330> cool

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
part's pretty cool

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.539

arm armor is actually supposed to have

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.399 
arm armor is actually supposed to have
this<00:02:20.579> piece<00:02:21.030> right<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:22.049> really<00:02:22.829> small

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
this piece right here this really small

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.050 
this piece right here this really small
blue<00:02:25.409> piece<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> then<00:02:26.700> it's<00:02:26.849> going<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
blue piece here and then it's going to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.720 
blue piece here and then it's going to
have<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> new<00:02:27.420> piece<00:02:27.659> of<00:02:27.689> armor<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.370> just<00:02:29.519> put

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
have a new piece of armor so I just put

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.429 
have a new piece of armor so I just put
these<00:02:29.939> here<00:02:30.389> and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.810> just<00:02:30.959> thought<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.290> looked
