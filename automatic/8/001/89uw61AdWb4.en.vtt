I am going to introduce you a new ice cream parlor

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.460
which has been recently launched in between Mid valley Megamall and Garden Shopping Centre

00:00:28.414 --> 00:00:33.554
In fact it is located in Garden mall but as you see here is partition between these two malls

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.080
This ice cream parlor is called Milk Cow

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.960
What is unique about this ice cream is they made it by organic milk

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.400
And as you can see, there are varieties

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:03.840
with honey, honey comb, chocolate and different other types

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.900
See she is preparing ice cream with honey comb

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.835
you must try it, it's so yummy

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:38.100
Here is the Coffee Menu which includes espresso, americano, cappuccino, cafe late, flat white 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.100
They arrange a lucky draw spin here 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.155
You need to spin it and then you will get a prize wherever it stops

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:14.615
This is our favorite ice cream 

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:18.154
Honey comb ice cream, very delicious

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.100

00:02:25.774 --> 00:02:28.014
