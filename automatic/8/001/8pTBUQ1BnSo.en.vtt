do shake it floats all I mean the flood
is<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.590> two-part<00:00:22.980> system<00:00:23.100> it's<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
is the it's a two-part system it's and

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.730 
is the it's a two-part system it's and
usually<00:00:23.730> want<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> shake<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.090> real<00:00:24.330> well<00:00:27.740> when

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
usually want to shake it real well when

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.990 
usually want to shake it real well when
we're<00:00:28.859> cutting<00:00:29.099> so<00:00:29.369> when<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.609> working<00:00:29.640> on

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we're cutting so when we're working on

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.560 
we're cutting so when we're working on
shred

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
shred

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.120 
shred
I<00:00:30.599> guess<00:00:31.109> whereas<00:00:31.320> they<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.529> work<00:00:31.679> on<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> trim

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
I guess whereas they will work on a trim

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.799 
I guess whereas they will work on a trim
we're<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> working<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.940> about<00:00:33.180> maybe

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
we're going to working with about maybe

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.270 
we're going to working with about maybe
two<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> half<00:00:34.320> inches<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.739> paint<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
two and a half inches of paint in the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.030 
two and a half inches of paint in the
bottom<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.760> cut<00:00:36.000> can<00:00:36.239> yeah<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:37.559> can't

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
bottom of a cut can yeah you can't

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.500 
bottom of a cut can yeah you can't
measure<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:38.850> as<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.059> really<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.390> have

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
measure it but as we really don't have

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.950 
measure it but as we really don't have
to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.389 
to
you<00:00:40.440> could<00:00:40.590> add<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:40.950> would<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.190> equivalent

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
you could add what would be equivalent

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
you could add what would be equivalent
to<00:00:41.640> say<00:00:41.850> half<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.870> Dixie<00:00:43.170> cup<00:00:43.200> three<00:00:43.649> quarters

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
to say half a Dixie cup three quarters

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.709 
to say half a Dixie cup three quarters
of<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.100> small<00:00:44.340> Dixie<00:00:44.670> cup<00:00:44.850> we<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:45.690> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
of a small Dixie cup we just kind of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.110 
of a small Dixie cup we just kind of
eyeball<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.260> right<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.280> pretty

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
eyeball it right in there pretty

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760 
eyeball it right in there pretty
straightforward<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:48.870> almost<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.469> making

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
straightforward it's almost like making

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.299 
straightforward it's almost like making
pasta<00:00:50.010> sauce<00:00:50.510> yes<00:00:51.510> okay<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.649> work<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> in

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
pasta sauce yes okay we just work it in

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.770 
pasta sauce yes okay we just work it in
real<00:00:53.489> well<00:00:53.640> into<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> paint<00:00:54.239> stir<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.660> in

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
real well into the paint stir it in

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.680 
real well into the paint stir it in
really<00:00:55.050> well<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.210> what's<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> happen

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
really well and what's going to happen

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.270 
really well and what's going to happen
now<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.289> working<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.890> our<00:00:59.039> trim

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
now is when we're working with our trim

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.130 
now is when we're working with our trim
