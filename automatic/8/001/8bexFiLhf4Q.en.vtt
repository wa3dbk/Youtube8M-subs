00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.050
 good 2 l2 to a good new video 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.500
 it seems that we are beginning to speculate 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.330
 or talk about the duration of metal gear 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.660
 solid 5 seems to be with player was a 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.480
 about to finish it in about 50 hours already 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.970
 you know how good they basically could 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 play a while ago to the game you know 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.199
 that serious progress has been made and others 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.599
 and good was people who could as I say 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.000
 it may be to try the game during 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.800
 for a few days and really as I say 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.650
 because they are one of them seems to be 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.470
 what good at 50 hours could we say 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.300
 I have a pretty good vice 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.980
 You also have to say it because it was 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 about to finish it not with 52% of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.740
 completed basically this means 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.690
 it's good that this was the main thing 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.060
 last about 50 hours and complete it at 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.880
 100% then about 100 hours basically 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.500
 is preparing as I say then and about 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.930
 this duration 100 hours in completing it 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.210
 one hundred percent I think is a whore 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.750
 barbarity is very, very much time 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.090
 and I do not think it's going to be that way really or 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 it is very difficult that really because you 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.630
 last 100 grizzled hours already depends too 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.399
 of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.049
 the skill of each player and others 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.060
 but the one that is close to 100 hours 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.270
 Well, it's totally amazing and 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.890
 it's good that we hope it's true 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 really good 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.060
 the thing does not end here then we have 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.939
 metal gear solid 'online that good that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.770
 will do something as I say that the game 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 lasts us many many more hours 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.750
 or even make us infinite not 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.920
 we could say with what then 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.310
 pretty good pretty happy 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.229
 let's wait as soon as the 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.380
 first good analyzes soon you know 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.080
 that one in September is going to be done 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.759
 long the wait really but good in 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.369
 when we do the ibi analyzes and other 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.349
 Well we will know if the game lasts so long 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.659
 but it does not last as long as I imagine it follows 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.159
 not seeing a few shots that was basically 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.899
 a prologue and others complete it at one hundred 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.640
 per hundred because we also take a long time 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.099
 in picking up everything we are talking about a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.130
 game we could say 100 times more 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:04.590
 large with which then the duration 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.149
 could could be out there could be 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.280
 very directed not to take all the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.410
 collectibles and all this make us 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.630
 all the costumes upload the mother you see 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.300
 maximum level and all this then 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.530
 I think we 'll try a lot, we'll see 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.750
 know why it's good to teach what the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.280
 game is to last so much is pretty good 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.580
 signal to have some games that really 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.410
 well they last a good misery though 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.380
 let's hope as I say that those 100 hours 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.910
 It is not about 100 hours duration of the 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.350
 game and that we have complete everything at 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.410
 hundred percent because they are not all the time 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.360
 the same and others not good so that we 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.860
 let's go having fun and surprising with 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.170
 each main mission of each mission 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 secondary that is sure to happen 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.080
 and surely the surprises that we are going to 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.890
 have the story are going to be amazing 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.720
 that's one of the things that hideo kojima 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.540
 of a secure company not that we 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.370
 we surprised a lot with the story and that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.510
 philip we have so nothing guys we 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.750
 we see in the next video until the 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.750
 next
