00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.240
 a classic not 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.240
 with a bigger tone of mexico 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.660
 sinking the truth party into a 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.150
 moment where the teams that 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.430
 we need to to enter and it says so 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.250
 what 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.770
 in the sense 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.770
 it's going to be very important and then nothing 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.760
 a good archer an archer selection as well 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.679
 what 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.239
 because there is no actor and nothing saying everything 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.879
 what he has achieved 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.350
 got to do the important thing is to know 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.350
 that without a week we can beat it and 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.309
 try storage rooms 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.060
 we do not know the quality that the 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.930
 players 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.130
 It has important names but we 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.410
 we are more confident what we can 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.780
 do what is going to come is that 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.510
 make the house 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.680
 I think it's going to be a worthy match 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.189
 open 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:10.470
 we are trying to play football and and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.780
 if we do not have a very good start 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.980
 but well now nobody has insured 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.160
 the delight let's say 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.920
 the post 14 15 still have idea of 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.630
 qualify then I think it's medium 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.970
 use opposite is a way 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.750
 competitive where all the teams 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.210
 they have the possibility to donate foreign currency 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.980
 try dollars the championship so 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.480
 in this case as I said no 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.010
 nobody has the line insured 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.310
 simply 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.750
 until the end you have to wait but what 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.970
 well we know it's up to us 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.090
 are left scored two matches that can 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.479
 enter quietly 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.079
 the truth that as I always say 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.609
 we 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.380
 matteoli every weekend the 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.560
 to win is from a visitor's place like that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.560
 what 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.340
 and more in this situation than not 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 we need that to enter to go to 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.009
 a template like 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.160
 you have players named also cougars 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.260
 so 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.120
 in the sense I do not think there 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.690
 difference I see it well football 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.220
 Mexican reflects the table 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.890
 no player no team takes out 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.240
 difference simply that good 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.280
 to get some players 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.060
 more money than another in that it can be 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.940
 but after 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.349
 good this last game always 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:36.210
 it is always analyzed who remains who 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.590
 the truth came down good as he said 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.440
 qualifying the group will be more 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 easy to make decisions try to make 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.090
 things well and for that are the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.350
 managers and the people the club that decides 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.990
 who stays and who is going to 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:53.290
 lose but if it is important for all 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.260
 finish well and good and try to follow 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.300
 in the club to see what happens if it improves 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.920
 because good the last championship 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.290
 five goals this is done 27 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.330
 I have improved it but good as I say 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.630
 you always have to keep working to 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.760
 to achieve the goals and try to 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.200
 that the people of the club say 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.489
 happy 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.489
 a player sits one
