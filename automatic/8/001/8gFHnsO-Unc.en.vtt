00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.560
 today I'm going to show you how to make a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.190
 plush frog 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:14.260
 The materials that we will need are 

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:17.980
 the pattern scissors threads needles filling and 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.350
 cloth now let's take the pattern that 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.539
 I leave you in the description and we will 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.150
 cut the number of pieces of cloth 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.689
 corresponding to each party and has 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.089
 cut will stay like this and we start 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.790
 accommodate the pieces first let's 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.220
 put your eyes on your face and we're going 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.190
 sewing either with the stitch of 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.510
 festoon or stitch back can choose 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 any of these 2 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.040
 when they finish with both eyes we are going to 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.870
 continue with the legs are eight 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.390
 pieces that will accommodate in four 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.120
 pallets and they'll get used to it with 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.730
 the festoon stitch then comes the 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.980
 difficult part that is to go around 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.300
 to take the pencils and they will do what 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.300
 I show next 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.850
 already cured and given back to the four 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.410
 couple let's take the body part 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.410
 and it's like we'll do the little legs there 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.380
 we put the other piece of the body on top 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.690
 when they are already placed and sewing mos 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.750
 with the festoon tip or the tip of 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.670
 back if you choose the tip of the piston in 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.170
 the parts of the leg use the tip of 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.170
 back to make them safer 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.979
 and used to everything we are going to give him 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.979
 turns 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.340
 already having the full body we return 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.330
 the head but now getting used to 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.330
 two pieces together 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.980
 let's get used to everything around but 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.380
 let's mark a space in the part of 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.380
 down where we are not going to postulate 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.920
 to build this part we can use 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.920
 the piston tip or the stitch back 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.820
 when we finish let's go around 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.310
 What we need is to put the filling and 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.410
 join the heads with the body 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.780
 I will put the filling so that no 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.110
 it's too tight so it will stay dry 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.110
 cited 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.800
 at the time of joining the two parties we are going to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.830
 give the stitch hidden around 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.599
 all the neck at the beginning will be difficult 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.599
 but with patience everything can be 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.150
 and we have our tool ready 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.199
 as a last detail I'm going to add a 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.199
 improvised scarf 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.469
 and ready we have in our mini 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.569
 frog this can do it the size 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.960
 they want and do it in the form of 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.969
 brooch keyring or as you like
