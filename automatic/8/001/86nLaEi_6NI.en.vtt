00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.199
 ae 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.740
 People came bringing another video 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:21.279
 tutorial for you here everything is cops 2 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.890
 multiplayer that is how you change the 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.149
 pc control settings for 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.239
 play the tactical grenade on the stab qe1 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:41.679
 no and want it like it was in mw3 first you 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:47.649
 will go into options against the 7 as 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:50.649
 coming first that we want is 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.429
 normal that's how you try to find yourself 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:58.329
 with the secular of space 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.879
 now comes a military attack on the 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.480
 here is set for me at 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.629
 vii 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.940
 otherwise you can let not see fit 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.610
 because it 's very close to I think 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.780
 or you can switch to the inem you 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:17.799
 select a child and then select from 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.200
 new he because he gets lonely and there you 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.100
 take a look here you do not have anything else to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.380
 shift shift than the trained grenade 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.909
 primary secondary grenade that would be 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.250
 aggravated tactic is at number 4 if you 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.170
 do not want to adapt and want as it was 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.469
 unanimity 3 you can switch to what 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.890
 here you put gods that he sent to 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:45.399
 what then did you change the stab for the wii 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.820
 There is nothing for what he and staff do for 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.950
 interact we have is seeing how to 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.430
 you interact that the weapon exchange is 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.539
 Calm down from the ground, you can see the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.170
 letter O 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:02.460
 and you click on muse and put effect that is the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.280
 Normally neither I believe it will. 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:10.390
 come back here in looks lindos left and nem 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.640
 right now they're working more 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.670
 would be like this 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.670
 skin and I'm sorry for not getting it wrong 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.650
 I think this trance is clean 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.060
 left to right is when you do 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.280
 a head to the right 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.080
 without moving the body only the head 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.770
 right to take a look 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.920
 on the side of the stable vcs object has some 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:35.700
 enemy is there if you select the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.470
 combat the child and nothing because you eh 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.069
 will lose these two options which is a 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.880
 actor that has since black pop that was 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.800
 taken from mw3 now it's missing and others are 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.170
 Do you want to not care about this? 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.019
 tape that I do not care about her in 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:57.660
 use then I left what was the name 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.430
 given three stab wounds and grenade in there 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.260
 these settings you can now 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:06.269
 play normally that will bring this 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.160
 and recalling that these 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.100
 modifications only for multiplayer if 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.830
 Do you want to change into men? 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.920
 You're going to have to let us change eggs. 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:23.579

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:26.370
