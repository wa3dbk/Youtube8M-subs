description for this video let's have a

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.019 
description for this video let's have a
look<00:00:22.680> okay<00:00:23.680> it<00:00:24.160> looks<00:00:24.340> like<00:00:24.490> it<00:00:24.609> may<00:00:24.730> have<00:00:24.820> come

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
look okay it looks like it may have come

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.429 
look okay it looks like it may have come
apart<00:00:25.330> I<00:00:25.539> don't<00:00:25.630> know<00:00:25.810> that's<00:00:25.990> deliberate<00:00:26.380> or

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
apart I don't know that's deliberate or

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.090 
apart I don't know that's deliberate or
not<00:00:26.760> let's<00:00:27.760> have<00:00:27.939> a<00:00:27.970> look<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:32.619> clips<00:00:32.920> back

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
not let's have a look just clips back

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.670 
not let's have a look just clips back
together<00:00:33.309> that's<00:00:34.239> fine<00:00:34.540> okay<00:00:35.320> I<00:00:35.350> don't<00:00:35.620> know

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
together that's fine okay I don't know

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.570 
together that's fine okay I don't know
there's<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.949> reason<00:00:36.250> for<00:00:36.280> that

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
there's a reason for that

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.220 
there's a reason for that
to<00:00:36.760> be<00:00:36.850> able<00:00:36.940> to<00:00:37.059> come<00:00:37.210> off<00:00:37.360> or<00:00:37.570> not<00:00:37.900> look

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
to be able to come off or not look

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.090 
to be able to come off or not look
anyway<00:00:38.799> so<00:00:39.640> what<00:00:39.879> have<00:00:40.000> we<00:00:40.030> got<00:00:40.299> it's<00:00:41.070> got<00:00:42.070> a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
anyway so what have we got it's got a

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.850 
anyway so what have we got it's got a
cylinder<00:00:42.460> of<00:00:43.080> transparent<00:00:44.080> plastic<00:00:44.260> with<00:00:44.830> a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
cylinder of transparent plastic with a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.119 
cylinder of transparent plastic with a
sort<00:00:45.100> of<00:00:45.159> printed<00:00:46.350> pattern<00:00:47.350> of<00:00:47.470> stars<00:00:47.650> inside

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
sort of printed pattern of stars inside

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.460 
sort of printed pattern of stars inside
it<00:00:48.879> has<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.210> months<00:00:49.479> of<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.629> year<00:00:49.720> round<00:00:50.260> the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
it has the months of the year round the

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.880 
it has the months of the year round the
side<00:00:51.159> but<00:00:51.400> I<00:00:51.460> don't<00:00:51.640> know<00:00:51.790> why<00:00:52.830> there's<00:00:53.830> a

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
side but I don't know why there's a

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.070 
side but I don't know why there's a
button<00:00:54.100> here<00:00:54.250> marked<00:00:54.699> star<00:00:55.030> another<00:00:55.930> one

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
button here marked star another one

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.189 
button here marked star another one
marked<00:00:56.350> LED<00:00:56.769> on<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.100> side<00:00:57.369> and<00:00:57.900> there's<00:00:58.900> what

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
marked LED on that side and there's what

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.109 
marked LED on that side and there's what
looks<00:00:59.409> like<00:00:59.470> a<00:00:59.619> power<00:00:59.949> input<00:01:00.220> for<00:01:00.820> running<00:01:01.030> it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
looks like a power input for running it

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:07.200 
looks like a power input for running it
from<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.330> mains<00:01:01.540> adapter<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.930> runs<00:01:05.110> on<00:01:06.210> three

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
from a mains adapter so it runs on three

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.530 
from a mains adapter so it runs on three
double<00:01:07.479> A<00:01:07.570> batteries

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.640 

let's<00:01:13.540> just<00:01:13.690> have<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:13.870> look<00:01:14.050> at<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.230> functions

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
let's just have a look at the functions

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.290 
let's just have a look at the functions
obviously<00:01:15.010> this<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.430> daylight<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.000> we<00:01:16.030> can't

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
obviously this is daylight so we can't

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.890 
obviously this is daylight so we can't
really<00:01:16.480> do<00:01:16.660> very<00:01:17.020> much<00:01:17.170> at<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.410> moment<00:01:18.300> so<00:01:19.300> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
really do very much at the moment so the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.410 
really do very much at the moment so the
star<00:01:20.710> button<00:01:21.070> turns<00:01:21.640> on<00:01:21.820> what<00:01:21.970> appears<00:01:22.270> to<00:01:22.330> be

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
star button turns on what appears to be

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.720 
star button turns on what appears to be
a<00:01:22.570> white<00:01:22.810> LED<00:01:23.190> inside<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.960> casing<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:27.340> LED

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
a white LED inside the casing the LED

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.090 
a white LED inside the casing the LED
button<00:01:28.090> turns<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:28.570> three<00:01:29.140> LEDs<00:01:29.470> inside<00:01:29.830> which

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
button turns on three LEDs inside which

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.650 
button turns on three LEDs inside which
flash<00:01:30.460> between<00:01:30.940> our<00:01:31.180> two<00:01:31.390> of<00:01:31.510> them<00:01:31.600> are

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
flash between our two of them are

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.790 
flash between our two of them are
flashing<00:01:31.960> between<00:01:32.290> red<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.500> blue

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
flashing between red and blue

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.530 
flashing between red and blue
the<00:01:33.400> other<00:01:33.520> ones<00:01:33.670> flashing<00:01:34.000> between<00:01:34.300> red<00:01:34.510> and

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
the other ones flashing between red and

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
the other ones flashing between red and
green<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:37.360> when<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:37.720> gets<00:01:37.870> dark<00:01:38.110> we'll<00:01:38.380> come

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
green so when it gets dark we'll come

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.260 
green so when it gets dark we'll come
back<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:38.860> test<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.520> see<00:01:40.060> what<00:01:40.180> it

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
back and test this and see what it

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.770 
back and test this and see what it
actually<00:01:40.300> does<00:01:42.330> okay<00:01:43.330> we're<00:01:43.450> going<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.630> have<00:01:43.720> a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
actually does okay we're going to have a

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.060 
actually does okay we're going to have a
look<00:01:43.900> at<00:01:44.020> this<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.290> darkened<00:01:44.710> room<00:01:44.770> in<00:01:45.010> a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
look at this in a darkened room in a

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.219 
look at this in a darkened room in a
moment<00:01:45.430> I'm<00:01:46.119> not<00:01:46.330> really<00:01:46.479> sure<00:01:46.720> how<00:01:46.900> well<00:01:47.080> the

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
moment I'm not really sure how well the

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.810 
moment I'm not really sure how well the
camera<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.740> going<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:47.979> detect<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.580> and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
camera is going to detect that and

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.030 
camera is going to detect that and
compared<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.540> human<00:01:49.900> eye<00:01:50.020> so<00:01:50.770> I'm<00:01:50.860> also

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
compared to the human eye so I'm also

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.160 
compared to the human eye so I'm also
going<00:01:51.190> to<00:01:51.340> show<00:01:51.550> you<00:01:51.720> close-up<00:01:52.720> what<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
going to show you close-up what the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.350 
going to show you close-up what the
effect<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:53.979> by<00:01:54.340> projecting<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:54.970> onto<00:01:55.119> this

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
effect is by projecting it onto this

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.469 
effect is by projecting it onto this
white<00:01:55.600> sheet<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.990> paper<00:01:56.020> so<00:02:00.270> that's<00:02:01.270> where<00:02:01.390> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
white sheet of paper so that's where the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.900 
white sheet of paper so that's where the
LED<00:02:01.810> lights<00:02:02.050> switched<00:02:02.590> on<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.400> that's<00:02:03.729> what

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
LED lights switched on and that's what

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.450 
LED lights switched on and that's what
the<00:02:04.000> star<00:02:04.270> lights<00:02:04.540> switched<00:02:05.020> on<00:02:05.259> now

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
the star lights switched on now

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.190 
the star lights switched on now
I'm<00:02:07.030> looking<00:02:07.390> around<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.750> room<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.110> it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
I'm looking around the room and it's

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.980 
I'm looking around the room and it's
actually<00:02:08.560> filled<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:09.040> 12<00:02:09.399> by<00:02:09.490> 8<00:02:09.790> room<00:02:10.119> quite

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
actually filled this 12 by 8 room quite

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.800 
actually filled this 12 by 8 room quite
nicely<00:02:11.260> and<00:02:11.740> I<00:02:12.310> can<00:02:12.580> see<00:02:12.730> stars<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.270> spots<00:02:13.570> all

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
nicely and I can see stars and spots all

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.550 
nicely and I can see stars and spots all
over<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> wall<00:02:14.880> quite<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> conspicuous

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
over the wall quite a conspicuous

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.770 
over the wall quite a conspicuous
colored<00:02:17.560> patch<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:18.070> lights<00:02:18.820> on<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.390> ceiling

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
colored patch of lights on the ceiling

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.530 
colored patch of lights on the ceiling
and<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.959> effect<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:24.610> actually<00:02:24.850> very<00:02:25.209> similar

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and the effect is actually very similar

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.840 
and the effect is actually very similar
to<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.350> human<00:02:26.650> eye<00:02:26.739> can<00:02:26.980> detect<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.640> on

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
to this the human eye can detect this on

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.670 
to this the human eye can detect this on
the<00:02:27.940> whole<00:02:28.090> walls<00:02:28.330> here<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:29.350> if<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.530> look

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
the whole walls here but if I look

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.280 
the whole walls here but if I look
around<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.040> room<00:02:30.300> you<00:02:31.300> probably<00:02:31.480> can't<00:02:31.959> see

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
around the room you probably can't see

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.240 
around the room you probably can't see
an<00:02:32.380> awful<00:02:32.709> lot<00:02:32.769> with<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.130> camera<00:02:33.519> so<00:02:34.510> anyway

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
an awful lot with the camera so anyway

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.400 
an awful lot with the camera so anyway
let's<00:02:36.250> have<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.400> look<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:37.200> that's<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.320> effect

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
let's have a look so that's the effect

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.400 
let's have a look so that's the effect
with<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.670> stock<00:02:40.239> with<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.570> LED<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.140> star

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
with the stock with the LED and the star

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.520 
with the stock with the LED and the star
lights<00:02:41.650> on<00:02:42.299> that's<00:02:43.299> the<00:02:43.450> effect<00:02:43.750> with<00:02:43.989> just

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
lights on that's the effect with just

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.420 
lights on that's the effect with just
the<00:02:44.860> stars<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:47.440> rotate<00:02:47.590> this<00:02:48.040> it's<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
the stars you can rotate this it's a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.650 
the stars you can rotate this it's a
kind<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.850> bit<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> shame<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.450> doesn't

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
kind of a bit of a shame it doesn't

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.970 
kind of a bit of a shame it doesn't
rotate<00:02:49.810> on<00:02:50.080> its<00:02:50.110> own<00:02:50.350> actually<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.830> would<00:02:50.950> be

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
rotate on its own actually that would be

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.610 
rotate on its own actually that would be
quite<00:02:51.250> nice<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.680> with<00:02:53.680> just<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.670> LEDs<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.620> you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
quite nice and with just the LEDs on you

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.130 
quite nice and with just the LEDs on you
get<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:56.980> kind<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.340> an<00:02:57.459> effect<00:02:57.959> which<00:02:58.959> is<00:02:58.989> a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
get that kind of an effect which is a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.890 
get that kind of an effect which is a
little<00:02:59.470> bit<00:02:59.590> too<00:02:59.830> vigorous<00:03:00.700> and<00:03:00.880> flashy<00:03:01.570> for

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
little bit too vigorous and flashy for

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.180 
little bit too vigorous and flashy for
me<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.049> think<00:03:02.440> I<00:03:03.180> actually<00:03:04.180> quite<00:03:04.630> liked<00:03:05.190> just

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
me I think I actually quite liked just

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.539 
me I think I actually quite liked just
the<00:03:06.459> stars<00:03:07.170> personally<00:03:08.170> but<00:03:08.920> that's<00:03:09.070> just<00:03:09.459> a

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
the stars personally but that's just a

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.009 
the stars personally but that's just a
matter<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.820> personal<00:03:10.060> taste<00:03:12.720> okay<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:13.780> in

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
matter of personal taste okay so in

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.870 
matter of personal taste okay so in
conclusion<00:03:14.370> what<00:03:15.370> are<00:03:15.489> we<00:03:15.549> going<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.760> say

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
conclusion what are we going to say

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.970 
conclusion what are we going to say
about<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.180> star<00:03:16.390> master<00:03:16.660> first<00:03:17.530> off<00:03:17.709> I<00:03:17.799> think

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
about the star master first off I think

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.020 
about the star master first off I think
we<00:03:18.070> ought<00:03:18.160> to<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.400> acknowledge<00:03:18.580> that<00:03:18.820> this

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
we ought to just acknowledge that this

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.390 
we ought to just acknowledge that this
is<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> pocket<00:03:19.510> money<00:03:19.810> priced<00:03:20.200> item<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:21.069> cost

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
is a pocket money priced item this cost

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.460 
is a pocket money priced item this cost
four<00:03:21.880> pounds<00:03:22.209> 84<00:03:22.690> on<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.020> bank

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
four pounds 84 on the bank

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.750 
four pounds 84 on the bank
site<00:03:23.650> at<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.890> time<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.190> making<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.580> video

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
site at the time of making this video

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.210 
site at the time of making this video
that's<00:03:25.450> pocket<00:03:25.930> money<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.590> think<00:03:26.890> we<00:03:27.010> need

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
that's pocket money so I think we need

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.760 
that's pocket money so I think we need
to<00:03:27.310> set<00:03:27.700> our<00:03:27.730> expectations<00:03:28.510> accordingly<00:03:28.780> and

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
to set our expectations accordingly and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.130 
to set our expectations accordingly and
I<00:03:29.950> found<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.520> a<00:03:30.610> little<00:03:31.000> bit<00:03:31.270> garish<00:03:31.630> with<00:03:32.050> the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
I found it a little bit garish with the

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.710 
I found it a little bit garish with the
LED<00:03:32.500> thing<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:33.010> bit<00:03:33.430> frantic<00:03:33.760> really<00:03:34.420> spam

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
LED thing and a bit frantic really spam

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.050 
LED thing and a bit frantic really spam
but<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.320> can<00:03:35.530> see<00:03:35.710> how<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.890> child<00:03:36.220> might<00:03:36.790> find

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
but I can see how a child might find

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.640 
but I can see how a child might find
that<00:03:37.150> an<00:03:37.270> entertaining<00:03:37.690> effect<00:03:38.110> in<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.290> bedroom

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
that an entertaining effect in a bedroom

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.190 
that an entertaining effect in a bedroom
or<00:03:38.770> something<00:03:38.800> like<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:40.060> white<00:03:40.330> star

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
or something like that the white star

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.960 
or something like that the white star
effect<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.740> found<00:03:42.040> actually<00:03:42.190> quite<00:03:42.520> nice<00:03:42.790> and

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
effect I found actually quite nice and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.510 
effect I found actually quite nice and
pleasant<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.680> obviously<00:03:44.950> together

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
pleasant and and obviously together

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.290 
pleasant and and obviously together
it's<00:03:45.910> another<00:03:46.240> effect<00:03:46.630> as<00:03:46.750> well<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.180> think

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
it's another effect as well so I think

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.300 
it's another effect as well so I think
this<00:03:50.110> would<00:03:50.230> be<00:03:50.320> quite<00:03:50.440> appealing<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> child

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
this would be quite appealing to a child

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.980 
this would be quite appealing to a child
if<00:03:51.550> they<00:03:51.670> wanted<00:03:51.910> a<00:03:52.000> star<00:03:52.270> effect<00:03:52.630> in<00:03:52.840> their

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990
