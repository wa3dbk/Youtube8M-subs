about<00:02:00.470> power<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.070> speed<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.580> you<00:02:01.640> really

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
about power and speed and you really

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.990 
about power and speed and you really

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
force to spring off of and you don't

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.250 
force to spring off of and you don't
lose<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:10.090> we<00:02:11.090> use<00:02:11.209> patting<00:02:11.540> on<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:11.720> 7<00:02:11.989> because

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
lose it we use patting on the 7 because

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.410 
lose it we use patting on the 7 because
it's<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.500> little<00:02:12.650> stronger<00:02:13.070> it<00:02:13.970> allows<00:02:14.209> us<00:02:14.239> to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
it's a little stronger it allows us to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.600 
it's a little stronger it allows us to
basically<00:02:14.630> pull<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.290> midsole<00:02:15.620> up<00:02:16.070> into<00:02:16.489> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
basically pull the midsole up into the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.870 
basically pull the midsole up into the
upper<00:02:17.170> making<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.500> higher<00:02:19.070> sidewall<00:02:19.670> for

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
lightweight elements of the shoe give

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:24.850 
lightweight elements of the shoe give
you<00:02:23.300> kind<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.630> stable<00:02:23.989> foundation<00:02:24.560> from

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
you kind of a stable foundation from

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.460 
you kind of a stable foundation from
there<00:02:25.100> we<00:02:25.489> really<00:02:25.900> reduce<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.140> amount<00:02:27.380> of

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
there we really reduce the amount of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.260 
there we really reduce the amount of
materials<00:02:27.950> in<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.070> upper<00:02:28.160> taking<00:02:28.700> away<00:02:28.910> kind

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
materials in the upper taking away kind

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.790 
materials in the upper taking away kind
of<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.420> leather<00:02:29.630> gasket<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.170> replacing<00:02:30.680> it

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
of the leather gasket and replacing it

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.150 
of the leather gasket and replacing it
with<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.190> huge<00:02:31.550> panel<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.769> Flywire<00:02:33.769> flour

with just a huge panel of Flywire flour
that<00:02:34.400> has<00:02:34.519> been<00:02:34.670> specifically<00:02:35.299> tuned<00:02:35.600> for

that has been specifically tuned for

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.870 
that has been specifically tuned for
what<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.739> shoe<00:02:36.920> is<00:02:37.040> meant<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.310> do<00:02:37.459> provide

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
what the shoe is meant to do provide

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.789 
what the shoe is meant to do provide
LeBron<00:02:38.269> with<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.690> support<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.290> he<00:02:39.590> needs

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
LeBron with the support that he needs

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.860 
LeBron with the support that he needs
for<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.340> playoffs<00:02:40.730> oh<00:02:40.910> it's<00:02:41.060> minimal<00:02:41.570> but

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
for the playoffs oh it's minimal but

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.420 
for the playoffs oh it's minimal but
just<00:02:42.110> where<00:02:42.290> LeBron<00:02:42.410> pushes<00:02:42.950> off<00:02:43.070> here<00:02:43.280> in<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
just where LeBron pushes off here in the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.039 
just where LeBron pushes off here in the
forefoot<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> globe<00:02:44.390> Ron<00:02:44.510> can<00:02:44.660> activate

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
forefoot so the globe Ron can activate

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.110 
forefoot so the globe Ron can activate
the<00:02:45.230> zoom<00:02:45.380> backs<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.920> really<00:02:46.850> have<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.090> shoe

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
the zoom backs and really have the shoe

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.820 
the zoom backs and really have the shoe
be<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.480> one-to-one<00:02:47.959> fit<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.500> his<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:49.100> his<00:02:49.130> foot

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
be a one-to-one fit to his to his foot

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.440 
be a one-to-one fit to his to his foot
the<00:02:51.830> bootie<00:02:52.160> has<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.370> more<00:02:52.640> breathable<00:02:53.239> and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
the bootie has a more breathable and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.810 
the bootie has a more breathable and
open<00:02:53.930> mesh<00:02:54.320> material<00:02:54.830> than<00:02:54.980> we<00:02:55.040> used<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.489> 7

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
open mesh material than we used on the 7

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.789 
open mesh material than we used on the 7
greater<00:02:56.269> moisture<00:02:56.930> wicking<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.440> also<00:02:57.769> a

greater moisture wicking but also a

00:02:57.799 --> 00:02:59.860 
greater moisture wicking but also a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
lighter package to just mesh so it's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.720 
lighter package to just mesh so it's
much<00:03:00.019> lighter<00:03:00.290> looking<00:03:00.860> at<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.160> tongue<00:03:01.400> top

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730

we've actually kind of reconsidered that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.280 
we've actually kind of reconsidered that

so<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.260> know<00:03:56.470> we<00:03:56.560> just<00:03:56.590> kind<00:03:56.770> of<00:03:56.890> wanted<00:03:57.100> to

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
so you know we just kind of wanted to

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.920 
so you know we just kind of wanted to
reflect<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.700> little<00:03:57.970> bit<00:03:58.120> as<00:03:58.270> well<00:03:58.540> as<00:03:58.750> the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
reflect that a little bit as well as the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
l23 button which again on the 7 was

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.070 
l23 button which again on the 7 was
metal<00:04:02.650> riveted<00:04:03.490> very<00:04:03.880> strong<00:04:04.300> what<00:04:04.750> we<00:04:04.840> wanted

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
metal riveted very strong what we wanted

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.630 
metal riveted very strong what we wanted
to<00:04:05.170> do<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.410> reinterpret<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.340> still<00:04:06.550> be

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
to do is reinterpret that to still be

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.340 
to do is reinterpret that to still be
detailed<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.300> really<00:04:07.510> tell<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.810> story<00:04:07.840> it

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
detailed and really tell the story it

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.720 
detailed and really tell the story it
would<00:04:08.470> be<00:04:08.590> much<00:04:08.740> lighter<00:04:09.040> weight<00:04:09.220> same<00:04:09.580> with

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
would be much lighter weight same with

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.460 
would be much lighter weight same with
the<00:04:09.820> line<00:04:10.000> head<00:04:10.330> we<00:04:10.540> felt<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:10.870> come<00:04:11.200> playoff

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
the line head we felt like come playoff

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.590 
the line head we felt like come playoff
time<00:04:11.650> it's<00:04:12.160> really<00:04:12.340> about<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.970> ravenous

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
time it's really about that ravenous

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.840 
time it's really about that ravenous
inner<00:04:14.380> beast<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.860> know<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.100> line<00:04:15.310> comes<00:04:15.640> out

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850
