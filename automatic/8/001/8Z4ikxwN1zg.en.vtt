00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.030
 welcome to rock school radio yo 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.100
 I am hernÃ¡n cruz school teacher 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.690
 musical call of the town today them 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.690
 I bring a little Afro-Cuban music 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.690
 this is called the songo the songo has 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.610
 many ways of interpreting it from some 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.460
 way I do some personal things 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.320
 as I would like it to sound but let's 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.150
 look at the basic patterns of the song or the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.040
 are 21 very important elements in the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.720
 Cuban music and many of the great ones 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.420
 the great orchestras the big bands 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.539
 that play this type of music that calls 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.539
 the timba use this element a lot 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:12.399
 exam are the first pattern that says me 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:14.320
 born to me from the heart is very personal 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:17.300
 let's look then how would the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.500
 songo in its traditional form 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.580
 the first step would be 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580
 we can touch it 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.710
 notice that the discrete always goes 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.760
 trying to make the key to 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.220
 complement the whole battery 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 it has many variants we are going to see a 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.350
 little we are touching a little bit 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.350
 faster 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.790
 it is a variant let's go to another variant 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.790
 with the charles 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.250
 is there was a second variant let's go 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.250
 make a variant 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.970
 Y 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.710
 this last variant is a little more 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.990
 orchestrated is a bit more aggressive the 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.060
 sound of the battery but it still follows 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.730
 the same sense being the same 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.140
 same pattern that is given at this rate 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.459
 what amazon 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:04:07.550
 may be the last the last sense 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:04:10.850
 more a little more font that go enjoy it 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:13.330

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.330
