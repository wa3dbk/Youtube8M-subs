large<00:00:22.140> buttons<00:00:22.590> presets<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.670> side

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
large buttons presets here on the side

we<00:00:24.570> also<00:00:24.720> do<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.930> separate<00:00:25.380> separated<00:00:26.189> variable

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
we also do a separate separated variable

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310 
we also do a separate separated variable
color<00:00:26.880> which<00:00:27.180> allows<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.869> change<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
color which allows you to change the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.310 
color which allows you to change the
color<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.920> your<00:00:29.730> button<00:00:30.570> zone<00:00:30.810> versus<00:00:31.199> your

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
color on your button zone versus your

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.290 
color on your button zone versus your
display<00:00:31.679> zones<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.910> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
display zones so I can go in and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
display zones so I can go in and
basically<00:00:33.840> set<00:00:34.140> up<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.410> dual<00:00:34.590> color<00:00:34.860> scheme

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
basically set up a dual color scheme

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.100 
basically set up a dual color scheme
like<00:00:35.610> for<00:00:35.820> example<00:00:35.910> right<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.510> this<00:00:36.989> would

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
like for example right here this would

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.780 
like for example right here this would
be<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> color<00:00:37.469> scheme<00:00:37.739> for<00:00:37.890> Volkswagen<00:00:38.160> both

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
be the color scheme for Volkswagen both

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.090 
be the color scheme for Volkswagen both
red<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.090> blue<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
red and blue on here if I want to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.100 
red and blue on here if I want to
independently<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.840> change<00:00:42.930> my

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
independently I can go in and change my

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.869 
independently I can go in and change my
buttons<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.590> well<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.340> want<00:00:44.489> these<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.760> be

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
buttons as well so if I want these to be

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.590 
buttons as well so if I want these to be
a<00:00:44.910> different<00:00:45.270> color

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
a different color

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
a different color
that's<00:00:46.050> also<00:00:46.379> an<00:00:46.469> option<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.100> right<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that's also an option I have right in

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.459 
that's also an option I have right in
front<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> me<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:48.200> we<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.230> two<00:00:49.440> different

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469

models<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.370> your<00:00:50.520> level<00:00:50.760> piece<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.270> here

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
models and your level piece right here

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.220 
models and your level piece right here

with the iPod port and oxygen USB and

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.959 
with the iPod port and oxygen USB and
then<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> step-up<00:00:56.399> piece<00:00:56.699> which

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
then we have a step-up piece which

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.150 
then we have a step-up piece which
actually<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:57.780> USB<00:00:58.289> ports<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
actually has two USB ports one on the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.369 
actually has two USB ports one on the
front<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> back<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.629> allows<00:01:01.079> you

upgraded display still has a separated
variable<00:01:16.830> color<00:01:17.009> resets<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> line<00:01:18.180> outputs

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
variable color resets the line outputs

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.890 
variable color resets the line outputs
on<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
on it

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.660

right<00:01:41.140> there<00:01:41.290> you<00:01:41.650> can<00:01:41.800> wave<00:01:42.010> your<00:01:42.040> hand<00:01:42.400> right

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
right there you can wave your hand right

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.280 
right there you can wave your hand right
in<00:01:42.700> front<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.090> that<00:01:43.150> and<00:01:43.660> you<00:01:43.870> can<00:01:43.990> actually

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
in front of that and you can actually

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.280 
in front of that and you can actually
activate<00:01:44.620> the<00:01:44.890> keys<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.720> DVD<00:01:46.720> menu<00:01:46.990> screens

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
activate the keys and DVD menu screens

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.630 
activate the keys and DVD menu screens
and<00:01:47.470> things<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:48.070> come<00:01:48.220> up<00:01:48.250> right<00:01:48.520> on

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
and things like that to come up right on

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.790 
and things like that to come up right on
the<00:01:48.730> screen<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:50.110> this<00:01:50.230> is<00:01:50.410> the<00:01:50.530> entry-level

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
the screen so this is the entry-level

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.650 
the screen so this is the entry-level
piece<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.610> then<00:01:51.700> we<00:01:51.790> have<00:01:51.910> a<00:01:51.940> step<00:01:52.270> up<00:01:52.450> base

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
piece and then we have a step up base

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.260 
piece and then we have a step up base
which<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.050> ATX<00:01:53.440> 8:30<00:01:53.980> so<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:54.760> also<00:01:54.970> has

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
which is the ATX 8:30 so this also has

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.600 
which is the ATX 8:30 so this also has
that<00:01:55.390> proximity<00:01:55.810> sensor<00:01:56.410> on<00:01:56.530> here<00:01:56.920> one<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.550> the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
that proximity sensor on here one of the

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.880 
that proximity sensor on here one of the
coolest<00:01:57.940> features<00:01:58.390> on<00:01:58.600> here<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.230> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
coolest features on here is the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
anti-theft benefit by being able to take

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.990 
anti-theft benefit by being able to take
