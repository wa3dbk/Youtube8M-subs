his arms later on and the base behind

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:40.900 
his arms later on and the base behind
which<00:00:39.829> will<00:00:39.980> become<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.250> rest<00:00:40.519> of<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.730> body

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
so let's see here's bass mode let's

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.680 
so let's see here's bass mode let's
transform<00:01:12.830> into<00:01:13.010> this<00:01:13.160> enormous<00:01:13.640> robot<00:01:14.390> mode

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
transform into this enormous robot mode

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.840 
transform into this enormous robot mode
it's<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.350> first<00:01:15.560> thing<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:15.710> want<00:01:15.830> to<00:01:15.860> do<00:01:16.040> is

get this rocket out of the way and we
want<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.120> separate<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.350> track<00:01:21.650> into<00:01:22.130> four

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
want to separate the track into four

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.760 
want to separate the track into four
sections<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.120> I<00:01:23.780> have<00:01:23.900> done<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.440> you<00:01:24.680> can

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770

see these red you can see the red

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.680 
see these red you can see the red
thoughts<00:01:28.310> there<00:01:28.700> which<00:01:29.240> give<00:01:29.450> me<00:01:29.570> the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
thoughts there which give me the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.260 
thoughts there which give me the
indication<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:30.260> where<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:31.430> track<00:01:31.730> so

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
indication of where to the track so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.080 
indication of where to the track so
we're<00:01:32.450> gonna<00:01:32.540> break<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.900> up<00:01:33.020> into<00:01:33.920> we'll<00:01:34.880> take

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
we're gonna break it up into we'll take

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.170 
we're gonna break it up into we'll take
the<00:01:35.210> tank<00:01:35.450> guy<00:01:35.600> off<00:01:36.100> and<00:01:37.100> we'll<00:01:37.880> break<00:01:38.120> him

the tank guy off and we'll break him

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.270 
the tank guy off and we'll break him
into<00:01:38.540> cross<00:01:38.870> sections<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.710> want<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.950> meet<00:01:40.130> up

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
into cross sections you want to meet up

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.410 
into cross sections you want to meet up
two<00:01:41.210> sections<00:01:41.690> together<00:01:41.930> like<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.270> put<00:01:44.270> them

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
two sections together like so put them

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.240 
two sections together like so put them
back<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.870> back<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:47.720> other<00:01:47.870> side<00:01:48.230> same<00:01:48.950> thing

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
back to back the other side same thing

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.390 
back to back the other side same thing
again<00:01:49.600> put<00:01:50.600> them<00:01:50.690> back<00:01:50.870> to<00:01:51.110> back

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.950 

and<00:01:53.490> we'll<00:01:54.120> get<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.450> continue<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and we'll get to continue the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.500 
and we'll get to continue the
transformation<00:01:55.410> here<00:01:55.980> so<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.970> next<00:01:57.150> thing<00:01:57.360> we

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
transformation here so the next thing we

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.510 
transformation here so the next thing we
do<00:01:57.750> again<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.500> rock<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.980> the<00:01:59.100> way

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
do again get this rock out of the way

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.220 
do again get this rock out of the way
want<00:01:59.940> to<00:02:00.000> build<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.240> bottom<00:02:00.540> half<00:02:00.750> first<00:02:01.080> so

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.909 
these arms now and get them back up to a
cool<00:04:55.580> position<00:04:55.790> but<00:04:56.780> they're<00:04:57.110> kind<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.380> like

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
cool position but they're kind of like

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.000 
cool position but they're kind of like
so<00:04:58.870> okay<00:05:01.120> resting<00:05:02.120> like<00:05:02.270> this<00:05:02.540> so<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:02.960> is<00:05:03.320> the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
so okay resting like this so that is the

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.779 
so okay resting like this so that is the
bulk<00:05:04.220> of<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.520> robot<00:05:04.850> already<00:05:05.590> transformed

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
bulk of the robot already transformed

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.920 
bulk of the robot already transformed
let's<00:05:07.789> just<00:05:07.970> put<00:05:08.240> back<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:09.169> little<00:05:09.410> bit<00:05:09.680> okay<00:05:10.930> so

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
let's just put back a little bit okay so

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.670 
let's just put back a little bit okay so
you<00:05:12.020> can<00:05:12.169> see<00:05:12.200> him<00:05:12.820> from<00:05:13.820> that<00:05:14.030> side<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.590> the

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
you can see him from that side so the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.540 
you can see him from that side so the
next<00:05:15.950> thing<00:05:16.039> you<00:05:16.130> wanna<00:05:16.280> do<00:05:16.370> for

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
next thing you wanna do for

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.620 
next thing you wanna do for
transformation<00:05:17.150> now<00:05:17.240> it<00:05:17.360> gets<00:05:17.450> a<00:05:17.570> little

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
transformation now it gets a little

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.850 
transformation now it gets a little
tricky<00:05:17.960> because<00:05:18.050> it'll<00:05:18.350> get<00:05:18.440> kind<00:05:18.680> of<00:05:18.740> heavy

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
tricky because it'll get kind of heavy

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.100 
tricky because it'll get kind of heavy
here<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:19.760> we're<00:05:20.060> going<00:05:20.210> to<00:05:20.300> take<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.690> rocket

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
here so we're going to take the rocket

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.379 
here so we're going to take the rocket
and<00:05:21.310> we're<00:05:22.310> gonna<00:05:22.400> separate<00:05:22.880> in<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.090> middle

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
and we're gonna separate in the middle

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.750 
and we're gonna separate in the middle
this<00:05:23.660> who<00:05:23.840> house<00:05:24.250> should<00:05:25.250> we<00:05:25.340> come<00:05:25.520> the<00:05:25.610> two

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
this who house should we come the two

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.940 
this who house should we come the two
arms<00:05:26.150> okay<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.380> this<00:05:27.530> is<00:05:27.620> where<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.770> gets<00:05:27.830> a

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
arms okay and this is where it gets a

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.260 
arms okay and this is where it gets a
little<00:05:28.010> tricky<00:05:28.370> so<00:05:28.490> I<00:05:28.550> might<00:05:28.760> have<00:05:28.910> to<00:05:29.060> hold

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
little tricky so I might have to hold

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.900 
little tricky so I might have to hold
him<00:05:29.419> but<00:05:29.630> because<00:05:30.560> he<00:05:30.710> has<00:05:30.889> to<00:05:31.100> weigh<00:05:31.460> him

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
him but because he has to weigh him

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.180 
him but because he has to weigh him
so<00:05:32.479> yeah<00:05:33.200> you<00:05:33.260> can<00:05:33.380> see<00:05:33.530> he<00:05:33.650> would<00:05:33.830> start<00:05:34.010> to

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
so yeah you can see he would start to

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.029 
so yeah you can see he would start to
forward<00:05:34.580> but<00:05:34.760> his<00:05:35.090> wing<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.810> tracks<00:05:36.139> well

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
forward but his wing to the tracks well

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.830 
forward but his wing to the tracks well
let's<00:05:37.220> do<00:05:37.340> it<00:05:37.430> this<00:05:37.550> way<00:05:37.820> we'll<00:05:38.350> cross<00:05:39.350> cross

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
let's do it this way we'll cross cross

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.480 
let's do it this way we'll cross cross
so<00:05:42.840> you<00:05:43.200> want<00:05:43.350> to<00:05:43.410> take<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.710> two<00:05:43.890> track<00:05:44.190> pieces

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
so you want to take the two track pieces

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.270 
so you want to take the two track pieces
here<00:05:44.910> come<00:05:45.330> back<00:05:45.570> to<00:05:45.750> back<00:05:45.960> and<00:05:46.800> then<00:05:46.980> slide

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
here come back to back and then slide

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.720 
here come back to back and then slide
them<00:05:47.430> on<00:05:47.640> I'll<00:05:48.450> be<00:05:48.660> playing<00:05:48.990> at<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.170> back<00:05:49.730> for

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
them on I'll be playing at the back for

00:05:50.730 --> 00:06:09.210 
them on I'll be playing at the back for
it<00:05:50.850> to<00:05:51.000> slide<00:05:51.300> onto<00:05:57.050> there's<00:05:58.050> one<00:05:59.690> there's<00:06:00.690> two

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.249 

maybe<00:06:10.220> no<00:06:10.430> there's<00:06:11.090> two<00:06:11.419> then<00:06:11.990> there's<00:06:12.139> a

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
maybe no there's two then there's a

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.170 
maybe no there's two then there's a
little<00:06:12.470> piece<00:06:12.740> that<00:06:12.770> locks<00:06:13.099> down<00:06:13.310> so<00:06:14.030> that

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
little piece that locks down so that

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.029 
little piece that locks down so that
will<00:06:14.300> hold<00:06:14.449> them<00:06:14.539> kind<00:06:14.750> of<00:06:14.810> steady<00:06:15.020> for<00:06:15.319> us<00:06:15.409> as

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 
will hold them kind of steady for us as

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:17.559 
will hold them kind of steady for us as
you<00:06:16.250> finish<00:06:16.520> them<00:06:16.669> off<00:06:16.849> so<00:06:17.090> let's<00:06:17.270> do<00:06:17.449> the

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
you finish them off so let's do the

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.879
