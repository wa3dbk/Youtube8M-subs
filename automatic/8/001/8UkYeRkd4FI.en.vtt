 dry pistachios 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.180
 but just as tasty walnut 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.790
 milky wax ripening is different from 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.150
 walnut dry dried 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.200
 Here are the pistachios for the first time in my life and I 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:34.960

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:39.120

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.050
 wild pistachio tree can it 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.870
 once many years ago there was no 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:51.790
 wild growing maybe here were home but 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.300
