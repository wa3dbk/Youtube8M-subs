00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:11.550
 lazy heinz lived in the world lazy heinz 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.540
 let's go all he had that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.850
 his goat 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.240
 but this occupation seemed like ha in su 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.359
 overwork and overwhelming 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.160
 unfair 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.300
 so going home in the evening 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.590
 sighed with fatigue and resentment 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:37.920
 hard this work used to say he and 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:42.110
 a lot of it so now year after year 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.500
 chase the goat in the field until late autumn and 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:51.510
 even if you could lie down 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.420
 until when you fall asleep, but no, see the club so that 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.980
 she young trees did not hurt 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.000
 either through a fence in the garden does not snuck 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:06.510
 either the field did not run well, calm down 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.229
 you won't be happy here 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 he sat down trying to collect his thoughts and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.590
 I thought everything to him that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.610
 his shoulders 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.259
 throw off all these considerations for a long time 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.950
 what did not lead 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:32.390
 and suddenly he is like a veil of eyes 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:37.350
 fell I know what to do he exclaimed 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.009
 I marry fat 3 not that one too 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.420
 goat 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.689
 so she can and mine with her steal 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:52.170
 then I will not have to torture myself 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:56.100
 and so haynes rose led his tired 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.670
 nomination members crossed the street 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.070
 then you could have no need for that house 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.430
 where trine's parents lived 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.700
 and began to woo for their hard-working u 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.039
 and virtuous daughter parents affliction 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.930
 fanned leveled 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.280
 chamomile couple they thought and agreed 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.480
 here is a thick trine 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.830
 and became Heinz's wife and began to drive 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:31.440
 both braids in the field came for Heinz 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.470
 red days and he did not need 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:39.390
 from what work to rest except from 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.099
 of their own laziness only occasionally 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.760
 and he left home with his wife and 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:51.239
 spoke only for those i go out to me 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.390
 then peace seemed sweeter 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:59.400
 and you start losing to him too 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:04.110
 interest however the thick 3 was not 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.230
 less his spouse is lazy cute heinz 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.769
 she told him once 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.280
 why do we become lifeless 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:18.530
 spoil yourself and even in the best years since 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.440
 our goats break us every morning 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.670
 sweetest dream so no better 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:30.690
 if we give them to a neighbor and take ourselves 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.500
 from him in return beehive because Greenshank 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.590
 we put in the sun and behind the house yes 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.250
 we don't even care about him 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:44.549
 feed not in the field to drive they do not need 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.709
 yourself and fly out of the hive and fly 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.019
 back and honey is collected 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:55.590
 not demanding any labor cost from us 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:59.310
 you are this little wife reasonably thought out praised 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.470
 Hines past and execute your offer 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.319
 immediately besides honey and tastier and 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.330
 more nutritious than goat milk and stored 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:13.170
 longer 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:16.440
 neighbor of course very willingly gave for two 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.220
 goats a pack of bees bees tirelessly flew 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.410
 from the deck back and forth from morning to 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.920
 late evening and on the floor 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:31.440
 or honeycomb finest honey so that 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:34.830
 Autumn Heinz got him a whole mug of this 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.910
 they put the mug on their shelf 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.880
 the bedroom 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.370
 probably out of concern that honey can 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.530
 steal and to protect it from 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.680
 mice 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:50.490
 3 put a stick near her 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.120
 beds so as not to get up to drive away from 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.560
 honey stick uninvited guests 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:02.280
 lazy heinz reluctantly left the bed 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:07.440
 early in the afternoon who would get up early would say 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:12.120
 he does not regret himself once in white 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:16.770
 day lying in bed and resting from a long 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:20.310
 sleep he told his wife all women 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:24.060
 slastony and you're sucking up honey until 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:30.120
 you haven't eaten him, is it better for us to barter 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:32.460
 his goose condensed milk perhaps answered 3 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.610
 at only'm not used to such as the use 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.860
 having a child who would give us this 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.370
 goose with beads began to graze 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.480
 not for me as it would take care of goslings 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:49.320
 your strength to spend on it and you think 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.830
 said holmes that your baby will become 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:56.280
 geese graze now childhood parents are not 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.910
 very listen more and more at will 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.730
 do it because smarter than parents themselves 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:08.760
 say let me just try it 

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:12.030
 I won't be happy to listen then 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.560
 I will take the stick to give him a good system 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.140
 bashing here is how I will teach him 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:21.000
 exclaimed 3 on and in her zeal 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:25.350
 grabbing a stick cooked for mice 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.640
 so waved what is the mug of honey 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.039
 on the shelf 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:35.220
 the mug hit the wall and fell off the shelf 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:40.920
 broke into pieces and wonderful honey 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:46.200
 spilled on the floor here and you 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:51.120
 in the thick of the condensed milk he said now his 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:54.830
 and almost all have a vie w happiness 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:57.710
 that the circle on my head fell 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.540
 rights we can not on their own destiny 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.270
 complain 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:06.540
 having seen in one of the shards a little honey 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.750
 he held out his hand to him and said with 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.620
 visible pleasure 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:16.950
 remnant wife eat and then with 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.560

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:24.680
