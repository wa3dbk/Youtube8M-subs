00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.290
 unique fish is a unique sunflower 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.290
 unique color dory skills and here 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:18.500
 5 that someone catches him is already visible 17 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:22.380
 kilogram and he is caught in the state 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.230
 north carolina and recovering here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.130
 he is caught with the fox of the left position 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.320
 the left place is just us here and 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.270
 set off means get up and water we go 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.270
 way and its such a stone 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.480
 according to insulin this stone with the left 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.239
 sides so we cuddle and aim at 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.780
 here is the side of those snags here is korea which 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.719
 there is 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.440
 but we need to throw somewhere in 10 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:56.280
 meters about 10 meters there plus or minus 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 2 meters from eight to twelve chakras 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.760
 thrown can pull from eight to 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.309
 twelve she pecks 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.250
 16 meters I mean that's 1600 before that 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.080
 the time when it begins to peck exactly 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.880
 most unique you of course 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.939
 you can find another one here the most 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 noticed that after 1600 the most 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.070
 pecking unique we catch 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.479
 respectively on the cricket at first 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.890
 hook and fishing line I put flarocarbon 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.869
 serve or if the fact that we have less 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.900
 noticeable in the water ie fish neat 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.930
 therefore it is advisable to put them 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.909
 fishing line that's unique fish weighs 17 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.369
 kilogram u should also count on 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:43.829
 your fishing line is not a fishing line and 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:46.439
 coil well wait for creed on somewhere 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.850
 1 3 minutes to peck muscles 1 6 minutes 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.860
 peck so here differently 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 have to wait that is, if you threw 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.399
 all done as you should 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.070
 do nothing how to correct not 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.210
 You can here block can leave as if but 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.210
 Nothing wrong with that 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.890
 usually melts unique fish here 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.619
 unique sun shafts just to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.540
 to pick up coins if you need there 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.790
 want to buy something with your head and you do not 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.650
 just not enough the coin can be raised 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:25.050
 here the glue is often alone 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.110
 fish somewhere three four coins well and 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.190
 actually all fishing is 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.040
 just sit and wait 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.130
 especially difficult stages 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.519
 no leads then what kind of fishing on the float 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:45.060
 I will throw it somewhere on 10 meters and 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.890
 wait for you to take a block 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.739
 leave is nothing bad can not 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:57.060
 to pay attention now 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:59.690
 poklevki we stop and we have something there 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.280
 unique immediately caught 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.540
 16 kilos is true but you are unique 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.040
 there is a top here and of course they give a lot but 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.910
 here especially not for lg's usual 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.450
 let's roll again and then show how 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.100
 it is caught by bass if at us so to feed not 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.390
 it turns out so too close 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.570
 just went to see the wrong side 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.540
 snag hold the left button and release it 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.190
 at the right moment his dream will throw about 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.190
 on do i throw up red snow 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.410
 my fishing rod is not very comfortable 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:04:04.340
 actually desirable to have a fishing rod 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:08.110
 shortened as when you lose 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.160
 have to turn the mouse 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.160
 to breakdowns flowed 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 but everywhere on the chat people are enough 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.120
 often catch unique 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:50.630
 two and beak insert another fish and 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:53.330
 In the next video, I'll show you how to 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:59.150
 the same location lavissa bass here 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:02.660
 poklevochka we cut and drag trophy 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.330
 Well, nothing terrible as you can see right away 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.920
 experience give for less than a total of 20 here 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.070
 I actually showed you the whole point 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.020
 remember we get up on this stone aim 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.960
 side of the snags throw on 10 meters 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:17.570
 about depth uno 180 centimeters 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.430
 we catch a cricket on the first hook like 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.970
 it is desirable to put a fishing line 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.060
 only less noticeable in the water and 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.180
 actually all thanks to all 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.650
 I hope this helped you 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.090
 The next video I will write about how this 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.090
 same location catch bass
