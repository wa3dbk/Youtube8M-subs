rustboro city the next one is possibly
going<00:00:46.690> to<00:00:46.780> be<00:00:46.870> in<00:00:47.079> rustboro<00:00:47.620> city<00:00:48.040> and<00:00:48.370> the

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
going to be in rustboro city and the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.119 
going to be in rustboro city and the
gameplay<00:00:49.750> itself<00:00:49.839> doesn't<00:00:50.290> look<00:00:50.500> really<00:00:50.860> cool

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
gameplay itself doesn't look really cool

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.250 
gameplay itself doesn't look really cool
but<00:00:51.370> you<00:00:51.460> can<00:00:51.610> see<00:00:51.760> we've<00:00:51.879> got<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.269> multi<00:00:53.050> nap

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
but you can see we've got the multi nap

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.189 
but you can see we've got the multi nap
now<00:00:53.470> which<00:00:53.769> is<00:00:53.949> located<00:00:54.159> on<00:00:54.579> route<00:00:54.879> 116<00:00:55.780> and

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
now which is located on route 116 and

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.340 
now which is located on route 116 and
then<00:00:57.070> we've<00:00:57.309> got<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:58.420> think<00:00:58.750> this<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> trainer

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
then we've got I think this is a trainer

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.840 
then we've got I think this is a trainer
that<00:00:59.530> you<00:00:59.589> can<00:00:59.739> call<00:00:59.920> back<00:00:59.949> in<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.370> multi<00:01:00.670> nap

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
that you can call back in the multi nap

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.450 
that you can call back in the multi nap
if<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.120> like<00:01:01.359> to<00:01:01.480> battle<00:01:01.750> them<00:01:01.989> again<00:01:02.460> later

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
if you like to battle them again later

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.310 
if you like to battle them again later
on<00:01:03.640> we've<00:01:03.850> got<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.210> thus<00:01:04.570> people<00:01:04.989> of<00:01:05.140> the

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
on we've got the thus people of the

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.990 
on we've got the thus people of the
different<00:01:05.740> cities<00:01:05.920> with<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.580> wing<00:01:06.789> golf

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
different cities with the wing golf

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.749 
different cities with the wing golf
course<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.660> this<00:01:08.590> is<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.100> think<00:01:09.160> this<00:01:09.700> is

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
course and this is I think this is

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.029 
course and this is I think this is
allocated<00:01:10.539> area<00:01:10.899> somewhere<00:01:11.470> where<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.860> can

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
allocated area somewhere where you can

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.710 
allocated area somewhere where you can
although<00:01:12.280> such<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.640> young<00:01:12.910> his<00:01:13.149> foolish<00:01:13.539> Tim

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
although such a young his foolish Tim

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.510 
although such a young his foolish Tim
its<00:01:14.200> broadest<00:01:14.470> Jen<00:01:14.770> this<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.160> new<00:01:15.310> gym

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
its broadest Jen this is the new gym

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.850 
its broadest Jen this is the new gym
that<00:01:15.700> he<00:01:15.880> is<00:01:15.940> a<00:01:16.000> developed<00:01:16.780> then<00:01:17.440> you<00:01:17.560> can<00:01:17.740> see

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
that he is a developed then you can see

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.650 
that he is a developed then you can see
we've<00:01:17.950> got<00:01:17.979> another<00:01:18.190> cutscene<00:01:18.460> their<00:01:18.940> ruling

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
we've got another cutscene their ruling

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.410 
we've got another cutscene their ruling
himself<00:01:20.259> as<00:01:20.590> we<00:01:21.399> are<00:01:21.490> about<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.729> battle<00:01:22.060> him<00:01:22.300> I

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
himself as we are about to battle him I

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.180 
himself as we are about to battle him I
think<00:01:22.600> this<00:01:22.660> is<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.899> cave<00:01:23.229> near<00:01:23.530> rustboro

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
think this is the cave near rustboro

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.600 
think this is the cave near rustboro
city<00:01:25.050> inside<00:01:26.050> from<00:01:26.560> a<00:01:26.590> different<00:01:26.950> angle<00:01:27.039> maybe

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
city inside from a different angle maybe

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.130 
city inside from a different angle maybe
when<00:01:27.820> you're<00:01:27.940> walking<00:01:28.149> towards<00:01:28.720> the<00:01:28.840> trainer

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
when you're walking towards the trainer

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.169 
when you're walking towards the trainer
and<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.470> turn<00:01:29.800> other<00:01:30.490> side<00:01:30.789> is<00:01:30.909> blocked

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
and in turn other side is blocked

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.730 
and in turn other side is blocked
because<00:01:31.539> you<00:01:31.630> haven't<00:01:31.810> got<00:01:31.899> rock<00:01:32.110> smash<00:01:32.440> maybe

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
because you haven't got rock smash maybe

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.559 
because you haven't got rock smash maybe
I<00:01:32.860> may<00:01:33.099> be<00:01:33.160> wrong<00:01:33.399> but<00:01:33.459> like<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.149> said<00:01:34.209> how<00:01:34.539> about
