00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:08.740 
you know I saw a prototype of this thing

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.720 
you know I saw a prototype of this thing
and<00:00:08.980> what<00:00:09.520> it<00:00:09.610> does

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
and what it does

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.509 
and what it does
condition<00:00:11.240> so<00:00:11.719> it<00:00:11.870> recognizes<00:00:12.139> your<00:00:13.009> agenda

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519

evil<00:00:44.519> in<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> mall<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.329> looked<00:00:45.510> at<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.780> i

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
evil in a mall i just looked at and i

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.869 
evil in a mall i just looked at and i
want<00:00:46.619> to<00:00:46.650> find<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.040> how<00:00:47.220> to<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.489> reach<00:00:47.699> that

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
want to find out how to go reach that

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.200 
want to find out how to go reach that
product<00:00:48.330> i<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:49.019> do<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.739> easily

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
product i can do that very very easily

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.170 
product i can do that very very easily
and<00:00:51.830> so<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:52.920> machine<00:00:53.220> can<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.610> figure<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and so the machine can a figure that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.140 
and so the machine can a figure that
this<00:00:55.049> is<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.229> super<00:00:55.830> smart<00:00:56.129> physical<00:00:56.580> side<00:00:56.790> and

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
this is a super smart physical side and

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.939 
this is a super smart physical side and
figure<00:00:57.239> out<00:00:57.390> who<00:00:57.659> i<00:00:57.720> am<00:00:57.960> what<00:00:58.589> I'm<00:00:58.739> interested

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
figure out who i am what I'm interested

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.950 
figure out who i am what I'm interested
and<00:00:59.489> then<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.909> can<00:01:00.030> lead<00:01:00.210> me<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.479> I<00:01:00.659> want

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and then it can lead me to where I want

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
and then it can lead me to where I want
to<00:01:00.989> go<00:01:01.049> buy<00:01:01.409> it<00:01:01.439> that's<00:01:02.400> one<00:01:02.580> example<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.299> be

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
to go buy it that's one example and be

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
pain if the one I was coaching teaching

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.850 
pain if the one I was coaching teaching
it<00:01:40.020> makes<00:01:40.200> ton<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.619> noise

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.360 

there<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.430> go<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:44.330> like<00:01:44.510> black<00:01:45.350> being<00:01:45.560> less

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
there you go it's like black being less

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:53.330 
there you go it's like black being less
playing<00:01:46.610> this

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.669 

of<00:01:53.609> course<00:01:53.880> I<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.869> stands<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.439> read<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
of course I one that stands we read that

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.300 
of course I one that stands we read that
way<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.109> again<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> can

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
way but I'm like again you know I can

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.990 
way but I'm like again you know I can
flip<00:01:59.340> over<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.759> another<00:02:00.030> game<00:02:00.329> roulette<00:02:00.890> or<00:02:02.000> I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
flip over to another game roulette or I

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.999 
flip over to another game roulette or I
could<00:02:03.329> maybe<00:02:03.990> order<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.350> drink<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.710> sounds

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
