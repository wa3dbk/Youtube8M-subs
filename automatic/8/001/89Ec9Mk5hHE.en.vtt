00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.799
 wh 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:10.470
 And Dotter college discovery 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:13.620
 I think there are a lot of candidates who think about the above partnership 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:20.810
 Say not wake up in the morning for brain function 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:27.120
 In a way, so to speak , the variants to pass should not be left alone 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 Although I am many new work the students that has brought about a slump in annual sides 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:36.780
 It's really there are more that Oh do not get up 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:44.070
 In the wake of not getting up in the morning 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:47.579
 It may take electrode motivation disappears as expires Butsun and thread 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.579
 Or the score of the mock test is this 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.579
 Much I think that's not it time cents videos 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.980
 Resulting in sharply reduced results 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:06.070
 Since then my heart has become unstable and I can not get anything 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:11.250
 You may also receive the would hit the parents by the bar 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:15.060
 Say that underestimate the fact that not be happening anyway morning 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.020
 Teachers can be intimidating 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.020
 It's a good thing 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.420
 The fact is that we are not aware 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:31.720
 The brain is doing great things to wake up in the morning 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.970
 For example, when getting up in the morning 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:46.820
 The hormone Cortisol will automatically increase for a while 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:50.770
 Impossible to harsh state that this by the activities taking place from the comfortable state say that the sleeping brain 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.770
 Not just migration 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:02.430
 However, when the time to wake up in the morning falls apart 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.950
 You won't know what to do with cortisol 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.979
 as a result 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.750
 The work of Koruchi tofu and the time to get up 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:15.500
 It will only be the number of earth 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.500
 So I can not wake up for more 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.470
 In fact Corti head is called both the stress hormone 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:33.150
 Plays a major role in stress control 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:35.600
 So the stress is getting worse and worse if you don't get the right amount at the right time 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.600
 I put away 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:51.060
 This is resulting in about Usubi to decrease in the course or study of the efficiency of cabbage exam study 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:53.620
 Of course ten thousand put one kid time life that occurs at the same time that's people have for brain function 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.760
 It is natural to say 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.970
 Because it is of the exam students human beings as corpses 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.330
 I'm not going to burn on time . 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.590
 Time to wake up child dat wake up 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:15.420
 Which is important 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:20.350
 It is a do overwhelming important more of that in the constant happens time for the brain function 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:29.590
 If the students get up at the same time they write here 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:35.210
 Please wake up at the same time every day without breakfast after Saturday and Sunday trays and New Year holidays 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:43.210
 It is fine if I have to bed early at night especially if fatigue is accumulated 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:43.210
 Please go to the sleep time at night rather than in the regulation takes place time of sleep time 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:50.600
 What is certainly happening do it peace Asaba east 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.890
 There are many ways 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:59.130
 I will write another article about this and introduce it in detail. Please see that as well. 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.130
 Yoshi was I did over over 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.130
