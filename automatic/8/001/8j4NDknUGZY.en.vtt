00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
story it's possible that when we read

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.540 
story it's possible that when we read
the<00:00:40.360> deposition<00:00:41.360> transcript<00:00:42.159> will<00:00:43.159> think

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
the deposition transcript will think

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.170 
the deposition transcript will think
that<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:43.940> was<00:00:45.340> underwhelming<00:00:46.340> it<00:00:46.579> might<00:00:47.030> be

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
that it was underwhelming it might be

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.450 
that it was underwhelming it might be
anti<00:00:47.480> climatic<00:00:47.809> that's<00:00:48.170> possible<00:00:48.770> but<00:00:49.250> even

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
anti climatic that's possible but even

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.479 
anti climatic that's possible but even
if<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:50.239> there's<00:00:51.050> still<00:00:51.489> significant

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
if so there's still significant

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.200 
if so there's still significant
historical<00:00:53.180> value<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:54.340> seeing<00:00:55.340> the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
historical value in seeing the

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.599 
historical value in seeing the
transcript<00:00:56.989> and<00:00:57.140> seeing<00:00:57.469> what<00:00:57.739> Nixon<00:00:58.280> had<00:00:58.460> to

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
say knowing that he stonewalled I think

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.630 
say knowing that he stonewalled I think
would<00:01:02.239> be<00:01:02.600> not<00:01:03.500> as<00:01:03.710> interesting<00:01:04.280> but<00:01:04.519> as

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
would be not as interesting but as

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.290 
would be not as interesting but as
important<00:01:05.239> as<00:01:06.039> hearing<00:01:07.039> him<00:01:07.220> say<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:07.850> he

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
important as hearing him say that he
