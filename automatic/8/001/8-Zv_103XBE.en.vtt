you know I think that Sony is very quick
on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> trigger<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.989> announce<00:00:37.260> their<00:00:37.469> sales

on the trigger to announce their sales

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.069 
on the trigger to announce their sales
to<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.309> themselves<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.910> better<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.899> make

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
to make themselves look better to make

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.490 
to make themselves look better to make
their<00:00:40.440> fanboys<00:00:41.070> kind<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.030> freak<00:00:42.809> out<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> give

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
their fanboys kind of freak out and give

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
their fanboys kind of freak out and give
them<00:00:43.649> something<00:00:43.920> positive<00:00:44.070> since<00:00:44.879> there's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
them something positive since there's

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.330 
them something positive since there's
actually<00:00:45.539> quite<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.899> lack<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.440> content<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
actually quite a lack of content and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.770 
actually quite a lack of content and
updates<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.629> their

updates and things like that on their
game<00:00:48.960> system<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.039> my<00:00:50.250> opinion<00:00:50.449> Microsoft

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
game system but in my opinion Microsoft

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.970 
game system but in my opinion Microsoft
should<00:00:51.840> actually<00:00:52.020> come<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.739> announce

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
should actually come out and announce

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
should actually come out and announce
some<00:00:53.610> sales<00:00:53.879> numbers<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:54.629> know<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
some sales numbers and I know that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.360 
some sales numbers and I know that
that's<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.410> really<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.739> Phil<00:00:55.949> Spencer's

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
that's not really in Phil Spencer's

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
that's not really in Phil Spencer's
nature<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.109> get<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

understand the whole humble thing it's

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.389 
understand the whole humble thing it's
working<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.620> way<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.219> it's

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
working for them in a way but it's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
working for them in a way but it's

almost 3 million more consoles in the US
alone<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.259> mention<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.770> over<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
alone not to mention that over the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.440 
alone not to mention that over the
holidays<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.729> were<00:01:38.820> number<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.270> in

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
holidays they were number one in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
holidays they were number one in
multiple<00:01:39.930> territories<00:01:40.409> not<00:01:40.590> just<00:01:40.890> North

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
multiple territories not just North

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.859 
multiple territories not just North
America<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.060> at<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.450> end<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.720> day

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
America so I think at the end of the day

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.840 
America so I think at the end of the day
they<00:01:43.290> should<00:01:43.350> come<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.890> say<00:01:44.040> hey<00:01:44.280> we've

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
they should come out and say hey we've

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.510 
they should come out and say hey we've
got<00:01:44.930> 17<00:01:45.930> million<00:01:46.350> we've<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.710> 18<00:01:47.280> million

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
got 17 million we've got 18 million

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.010 
got 17 million we've got 18 million
because<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.090> gonna<00:01:48.210> help<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.720> look<00:01:48.960> better

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020

in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.710> mindshare<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.610> people<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> think

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
in the mindshare of people and I think

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
in the mindshare of people and I think
that<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.899> very<00:01:52.200> much<00:01:52.740> important<00:01:53.280> even<00:01:53.460> if

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
that that's very much important even if

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
that that's very much important even if
you're<00:01:53.700> never<00:01:53.850> gonna<00:01:54.000> catch<00:01:54.270> Sony<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.930> look

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
at this point they probably won't but

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.240 
at this point they probably won't but
you're<00:01:57.509> putting<00:01:57.780> up<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.990> fighting<00:01:58.530> chance<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
you're putting up a fighting chance and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.740 
you're putting up a fighting chance and
you're<00:01:59.340> putting<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.670> good<00:01:59.880> numbers<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.630> know
