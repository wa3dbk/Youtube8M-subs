00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:20.960
 Aha 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.609
 So you returned Ole Ole 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.769
 I'm Siegfried's kite coach and head of the top player did you know that 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.440
 Cracking mystical Pokemon are they are hard to catch and tame 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.110
 but it's well worth the effort 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.830
 they are almost invincible 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.160
 Are you ready to face fate? The trip ends in death 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.640
 the Pokemon league ranks Bolero 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.160
 four wheels everything that has said now 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.550
 November the fact that they are so 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.550
 Stans waited three months for this game 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.050
 which ultimately ended the last of the top 4 1-win the nerves way 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.150
 is on the way to the champion 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.660
 the breathless 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 I did not expect that 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 the virus is not the best choice 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.860
 from Darabos with 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.530
 two double 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 I hope he has several times 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 Apple points the region 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 Germany have 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.790
 than many 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 to the hostage-taking 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.310
 this Gaba Plus Germany is high 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.110
 and that was it 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.110
 so they are windsurfing 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.629
 but sure way 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.759
 it almost sounds like next 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:20.759
 but you can feel the word 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.649
 But that's not the case 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.649
 be designed 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.159
 but how fast 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.549
 in the Wasserburg 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.249
 and show what she has on it 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:45.959
 I know how cool 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.959
 while advanced striker Lauth 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.949
 the market expectations 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.949
 set up with switches 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.759
 it is my job 

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:08.209
 what his wife left 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.829
 in the open air 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.829
 the Aero bar 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.439
 Holy shit facts 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.139
 if he is anything that can not fulfill the expectation it is the city 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.229
 indicates the device with reference to Luxembourg before 11 o'clock 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.629
 that will not work 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.760
 than twelve years waiting for this game Â»one would have to be true 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.979
 I think so 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:34.659
 that's also what she's waiting for this game 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.329
 below us it is not destroyed by a neck shot itself 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.659
 To judge it is the game itself is even encouraged 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.189
 were from 2003 on 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.090
 As important as all the players themselves, I wanted it that good, but so on 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:52.279
 is not it 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.149
 Dr, I want to change that now 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.059
 he is 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.059
 Fly your face so high 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.229
 very well 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.559
 but here are two more tournaments 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:10.069
 for what in the second generation trusts in the last two years after the first 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.879
 study 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.879
 but unfortunately it was these lions 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.029
 what you thought 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.799
 White steam over the champion 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.799
 Numbers founded many do not miss 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.860
 MTM 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.180
 more than 60 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.790
 whereas they are in plus 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.090
 most 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.309
 behind where will be towed 

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:40.809
 the director Thomas s 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:44.099
 Diarra foul 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.099
 some chances 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.680
 End cap 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.779
 the last car closer 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.779
 but 20 came instead growing 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.719
 I think that's nonsense is over 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:12.300
 Fights denied 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.889
 now it is time that way 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.889
 explosions 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.639
 County League a Dutch MP 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.360
 a good friend i know on the other hand it gets cooler again 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.630
 Head should be up to 31
