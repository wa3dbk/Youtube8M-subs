00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
and some of the longer established

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.029 
and some of the longer established
vineyards<00:01:13.340> have<00:01:13.579> even<00:01:14.920> demonstrated<00:01:15.920> that

the Tribuna the boot so can age for
decades<00:01:19.310> brutes<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.389> not<00:01:20.539> only<00:01:20.719> about<00:01:20.869> red

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
decades brutes is not only about red

decades brutes is not only about red
wine<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.560> think<00:01:21.590> because<00:01:22.159> multiple<00:01:22.670> John<00:01:22.880> de

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
wine I think because multiple John de

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.730 
wine I think because multiple John de
bruit<00:01:23.179> was<00:01:23.359> so<00:01:23.569> diffused<00:01:24.049> in<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.289> world<00:01:24.469> it's

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
bruit was so diffused in the world it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010 
bruit was so diffused in the world it's
become<00:01:25.039> sort<00:01:25.249> of<00:01:25.479> synonymous<00:01:26.479> with<00:01:26.599> red<00:01:26.810> wine

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
become sort of synonymous with red wine

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.519 
become sort of synonymous with red wine

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.210 
Oda boot saw and multi-port Ronda boot
saw<00:02:07.609> can<00:02:08.060> be<00:02:08.149> produced<00:02:08.479> in<00:02:08.660> huge<00:02:09.649> swaths<00:02:10.009> of

saw can be produced in huge swaths of

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.940 
saw can be produced in huge swaths of
land<00:02:10.510> so<00:02:11.510> they're<00:02:11.659> huge<00:02:12.049> production<00:02:12.530> regions

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950

which of course results in in
variety<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.280> qualities<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.720> can<00:02:18.410> reach

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
variety of qualities but can reach

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.130 
variety of qualities but can reach
really<00:02:19.360> spectacular<00:02:20.360> heights<00:02:20.600> in<00:02:20.840> certain

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
really spectacular heights in certain

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.630 
really spectacular heights in certain
territories<00:02:21.650> there's<00:02:22.280> definitely

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
territories there's definitely

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.160 
territories there's definitely
opportunity<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.360> there's<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.600> potential<00:02:23.990> for

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
opportunity and there's a potential for

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.560 
opportunity and there's a potential for
growing<00:02:24.830> different<00:02:24.980> markets<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.480> I

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
growing different markets and and I

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.020 
growing different markets and and I
think<00:02:26.630> because<00:02:26.870> there<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.710> such<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.460> wide<00:02:28.700> range

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
think because there is such a wide range

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.590 
think because there is such a wide range
of<00:02:29.420> production<00:02:30.080> styles<00:02:30.740> it<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.970> necessary<00:02:32.480> for

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
of production styles it is necessary for

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.080 
of production styles it is necessary for
producers<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:33.140> target<00:02:34.040> markets<00:02:34.460> according<00:02:34.880> to

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
producers to target markets according to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.380 
producers to target markets according to
demand<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.350> for<00:02:37.190> example<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.760> less<00:02:38.060> expensive

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
demand so for example the less expensive

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.810 
demand so for example the less expensive
wines<00:02:38.810> are<00:02:39.170> perfect<00:02:39.530> for<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.920> Scandinavian

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
wines are perfect for the Scandinavian

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.650 
wines are perfect for the Scandinavian
market<00:02:41.210> which<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:42.560> think<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.430> average

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
market which I think the the average

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.570 
market which I think the the average
