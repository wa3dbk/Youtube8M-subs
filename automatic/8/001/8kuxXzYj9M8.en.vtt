just to back this up make it a little
more<00:00:24.830> rigid<00:00:26.860> this<00:00:27.860> is<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.520> bulk<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:28.820> the

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
more rigid this is the bulk of the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.750 
more rigid this is the bulk of the
machine<00:00:29.210> right<00:00:29.450> here<00:00:29.660> electric<00:00:30.290> motor<00:00:30.730> with<00:00:31.730> a

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
machine right here electric motor with a

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.119 
machine right here electric motor with a
belt<00:00:32.029> rigged<00:00:32.870> up<00:00:32.989> to<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.199> pulley<00:00:33.440> system<00:00:33.559> here

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
belt rigged up to a pulley system here

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.280 
belt rigged up to a pulley system here
all<00:00:34.910> these<00:00:35.000> parts<00:00:35.390> from<00:00:35.449> a<00:00:35.600> lawn<00:00:35.780> mower<00:00:36.019> deck

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
all these parts from a lawn mower deck

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.049 
all these parts from a lawn mower deck
and<00:00:40.390> built<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.480> frame<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.309> this<00:00:43.309> drum<00:00:43.760> over

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
and built the frame and this drum over

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.950 
and built the frame and this drum over
here<00:00:44.350> is<00:00:45.350> gonna<00:00:45.620> set<00:00:45.860> in<00:00:45.949> that<00:00:46.040> frame<00:00:46.960> with

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
here is gonna set in that frame with

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.149 
here is gonna set in that frame with
fingers<00:00:48.350> in<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.620> also

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
fingers in it also

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.020 
fingers in it also
so<00:00:49.690> about<00:00:50.690> all<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:52.430> bottom<00:00:52.699> plates<00:00:52.909> gonna

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
so about all the bottom plates gonna

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.270 
so about all the bottom plates gonna
spin<00:00:53.449> around<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.620> chicken<00:00:54.920> bounces

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
spin around and the chicken bounces

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.250 
spin around and the chicken bounces
around<00:00:55.400> and<00:00:55.879> the<00:00:55.940> rubber<00:00:56.120> fingers<00:00:59.110> which<00:01:00.110> are

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
around and the rubber fingers which are

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.119 
around and the rubber fingers which are
pretty<00:01:00.470> soft<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.010> flexible<00:01:02.650> will<00:01:03.650> pull<00:01:04.040> the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
pretty soft and flexible will pull the

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.300 
pretty soft and flexible will pull the
feathers<00:01:04.280> off<00:01:04.840> so<00:01:05.840> that's<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.619> theory<00:01:06.830> anyway

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.070 

and<00:01:10.310> yeah<00:01:10.520> I<00:01:10.790> just<00:01:11.240> thought<00:01:11.390> I'd<00:01:11.570> clear<00:01:11.810> buddy

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
and yeah I just thought I'd clear buddy

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.679 
and yeah I just thought I'd clear buddy
you<00:01:12.200> know<00:01:12.260> might<00:01:12.470> play<00:01:12.920> this<00:01:13.130> little<00:01:13.400> project

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
you know might play this little project

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.109 
you know might play this little project
may<00:01:14.689> not<00:01:14.869> look<00:01:15.020> pretty<00:01:15.909> hopefully<00:01:16.909> it<00:01:17.030> will

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
may not look pretty hopefully it will

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.180 
may not look pretty hopefully it will
work<00:01:20.260> hoping<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.350> have<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.590> work<00:01:21.740> working

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
work hoping to have this work working

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.930

we can actually do it this happens to be
an<00:01:35.450> old<00:01:35.570> electric<00:01:35.690> motor<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.170> had<00:01:36.380> around<00:01:36.680> it

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
an old electric motor I had around it

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.770 
an old electric motor I had around it
was<00:01:37.250> actually<00:01:37.520> hooked<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.820> an<00:01:37.940> old<00:01:38.090> grinding

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
was actually hooked to an old grinding

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.899 
was actually hooked to an old grinding
wheel<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.740> was<00:01:40.010> actually<00:01:40.310> my<00:01:40.400> partner<00:01:40.520> Tim's

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
wheel it was actually my partner Tim's

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.140 
wheel it was actually my partner Tim's
was<00:01:43.909> in<00:01:44.060> his<00:01:44.150> house<00:01:44.330> so<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:46.610> motor<00:01:46.850> is<00:01:47.000> nice

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
was in his house so this motor is nice

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.970 
was in his house so this motor is nice
and<00:01:47.330> torquey<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:47.840> powerful<00:01:48.230> and<00:01:48.380> auto<00:01:48.770> work

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980 
and torquey and powerful and auto work

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.370 
and torquey and powerful and auto work
good<00:01:49.190> so<00:01:49.520> that's<00:01:50.420> what<00:01:50.510> we're<00:01:50.600> gonna<00:01:50.659> use

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.350 

we'll<00:01:54.380> see<00:01:54.650> I'll<00:01:55.520> show<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.880> again<00:01:55.970> when

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
we'll see I'll show it again when

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.200 
we'll see I'll show it again when
there's<00:01:56.510> more<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:56.900> more<00:01:56.960> together
