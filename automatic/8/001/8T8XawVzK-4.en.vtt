00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.390
 Here she is fit again 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.010
 I want to greet you and join you 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.180
 another subscriber gameplay 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.630
 present 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.960
 jessie j the naughty one is very simple 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.360
 from here it has a circular theme of 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.840
 played the whole on the map cargo 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.480
 with the pd as you see with the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.000
 Silencer and the reflex is as a box 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
 or five pieces thereby geisterfahrer 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.579
 toughness and fluency 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.860
 extreme conditions 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 there will not be much left for 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.060
 any grenades or from the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.750
 secondary and so it is he too plays 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.910
 he only has the pgw as pons tricks 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.270
 the drone the lightning stroke and the furnace 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.380
 copter dragonfly fire or as it is now 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.790
 that's exactly what we mean now 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.549
 probably see if it for the 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.229
 then we'll try it 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.549
 times to remember, this wants to remember 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.500
 conclusion series is called because I play 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.540
 thus not so I genuinly 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.950
 not so the relation to because the thing 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.810
 just be completed too fast 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.579
 may require not and 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.549
 farewell to a corner one does not know 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.469
 link to the channel of subscribers is like 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.240
 always below in the description and are 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.429
 see here I like what is the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.889
 Maybe I can pass it once 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.670
 and let's see what's so loud there 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:34.139
 or just ask indirectly 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.600
 write and ask a question so 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:40.770
 we have that we come to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.289
 the real topic for us today was 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.630
 I wanted to talk about it today 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.369
 in the last faq yesterday addressed that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.529
 I change the whole system a little bit 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.060
 would have for my channel because that is 

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:53.069
 just become way too much and me 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.700
 do not make it all that much anymore 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:59.909
 ask too many and then the video 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.490
 so long and all the edges and edges 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.380
 at my line here with the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.939
 upload that lasts similarly so that 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.970
 that's not how it is anymore 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.479
 I like doing that, but I just do it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.209
 a lot of 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.040
 That's why I thought so the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.440
 the whole earth I could of course 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.720
 say okay then she does her part 1 until 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.000
 2 million faq but no one for that 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.530
 I see not therefore is from 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.210
 Immediately in the way this thought 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.770
 then there is something else 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.790
 and I found that really funny 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.010
 and we will do it now 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.420
 test way so it works now so that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.920
 everyone first only one question 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.770
 I can make that very funny that he 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.680
 The house helps but everyone stands 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.760
 one more question and that no longer in 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.010
 written form 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.220
 no, because I would like that me 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.150
 audio or from me also video files 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.450
 can be sent with this 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:59.040
 a question and I the whole then so 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.360
 for the next faq user so i know 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.610
 not exactly accurate and video files 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.780
 really may use or how the whole 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.450
 then I must also first 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.540
 inquire I think so but it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.400
 is just a little more interactive with 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.950
 then you will be there so you send 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.500
 me that and I edit that sets that 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.720
 in a video purely and then will too 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.540
 Continue this series faq on main channel 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.960
 give so this is a follow sometimes 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.160
 one to two months maybe then 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.200
 wait for it and then comes the next one 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.660
 stop and if the whole thing works out 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.360
 Should we do that in the future 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.220
 handle if it does not work 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.380
 or the whole thing much more complicated 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.340
 then maybe I have something left 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.380
 to come up with something else 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.740
 but I actually found this idea 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.700
 funny and years you could the 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.620
 Write comments 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.180
 if he can live with it so well that 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.570
 only one question can be asked 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:56.100
 and now I want you there like that 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.880
 to call me such questions 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.190
 allow 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.420
 recorded with soundtrack is quite 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.070
 easy or city is a pretty good one 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.860
 simply record a free program 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.530
 and then I could like that here 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.660
 send or skype and I have online 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.520
 I can also send that to me 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.760
 or anyway, none of that 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.440
 problem or send by pn the left 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.120
 or whatever the world is with 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.060
 security in which solutions find me 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.560
 to send that out and that's exactly how it is 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.520
 would be that you stop with an audio file 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.580
 in the old whole with 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.410
 cam or her plans but me 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.020
 think you 're a bit technical there 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.960
 I also did my own and world's 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.879
 find a solution so I am very much there 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.349
 curious how the whole thing arrives and whether it 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.669
 works and how I cut that 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.319
 and if I ever have a gameplay 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.099
 in the background next to it or how 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.470
 always 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.930
 says no idea I movie me, too 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.180
 while you do not know yet died up 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.569
 we woke up there already 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.020
 times 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:57.310
 In any case, today I have to do it all day 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.490
 Laughing, I do not know why 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.900
 yes, no matter has never good mood 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.669
 harmed, perhaps it always lies 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.930
 nor that the 10,000 subscribers 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.490
 Brand has been cracked 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:11.590
 sensational or else that comes to an end 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.139
 from there comes to the conclusion and me 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.080
 hope very much and I'll tell 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.650
 as always moin moin and I hope you 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.650
 sees himself again
