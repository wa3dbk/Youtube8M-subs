00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.360
 next we will define the set 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.460
 of rational numbers also 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.430
 denotes with the letter q that comes from 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.110
 Latin quotient a rational number is a 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.040
 number that can always be written in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.720
 fraction form or ratio 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.400
 then the first case 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.790
 and let's take on the numbers 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.130
 decimals that are three the first one is the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.320
 exact or pure decimal 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.190
 Here we have the following example 1,2 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.140
 where exact decimals 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.469
 the decimal part is composed of a 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.989
 finite amount of numbers in this case 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.390
 12 and there ends then how happened to 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.350
 fraction let's take the number 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.369
 complete forgetting the coma 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.560
 and then it is divided by one and we observe 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.090
 in decimal the number of numbers that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.560
 there is after the coma 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.210
 in this case there is one follows of notaremos 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.090
 zero 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.479
 now they are delivered by two being like 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.060
 results hits then decimal pass 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.409
 a fraction therefore is this decimal 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.049
 it's a rational number 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.819
 second case in the periodic decimals 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:38.439
 where after the comma you define the 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:43.060
 number of numbers 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.909
 and they repeat themselves observing here that the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.810
 number is put an array and on top of that 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.549
 denotes that it is periodic 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.439
 now as it happened to fraction 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.710
 I write the complete number forgetting 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.840
 coma and bone period 26 but now the 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.360
 remainder of the number that has no period 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.730
 bone in this case 2 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.360
 then / 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.760
 after the comma numbers with periods 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 in this case only one that is denoted as 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.830
 nine 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.820
 but 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.160
 26 - 224 out of 9 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.650
 this can be simplified by 3 remaining 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.170
 as the final result 8 thirds 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.670
 then decimal period go to 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.530
 fraction rational number 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.610
 third case semi-periodic decimals 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.600
 What is when 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.830
 the decimal part is defined there is a part 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.080
 which is periodic and another that is not 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.270
 periodically then how did it happen to 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.220
 fraction write a number without a comma and 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.750
 without period the complete number 246 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.160
 for the rest of the part that does not have 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.160
 period that is 24 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.480
 I divide it by observing after the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.650
 I eat the numbers with periods I have one 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.150
 only as nine and the number before period 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:07.400
 with zero 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:09.110
 now it operates at 222 out of 90 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.120
 these can be simplified by six 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.590
 remaining as the final result 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.950
 37 out of 15 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.819
 now comes a more formal definition 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.010
 About rational numbers 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.999
 is a rational name is a number that 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.810
 is expressed in the form of envelope q where 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:29.810
 pq 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.159
 they are whole numbers 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.010
 but q 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.980
 non-zero because if it takes the value 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.950
 from zero without defining 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.150
 now for example the king root number of 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.340
 two that is a decimal where the pattern is 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.709
 repeat the numbers repeat and continue 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.879
 indefinitely these numbers are no longer 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.519
 rational because you can not write 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.250
 in fraction form and this number is 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.570
 they call irrational 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.570
 what are we going to see next 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.459
 Y 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.540
 yes
