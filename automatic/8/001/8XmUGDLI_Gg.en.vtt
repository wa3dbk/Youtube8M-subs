00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
called table-saw push stick comm and I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.200 
called table-saw push stick comm and I
took<00:00:24.529> a<00:00:24.680> look<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.130> they<00:00:25.310> claimed<00:00:25.640> to<00:00:25.820> have<00:00:25.970> the

world's<00:00:26.660> best<00:00:27.050> engineered<00:00:28.039> push<00:00:28.310> stick<00:00:28.609> so

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
world's best engineered push stick so

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.660 
world's best engineered push stick so
that<00:00:29.750> got<00:00:30.170> my<00:00:30.320> attention<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.039> I<00:00:31.369> wanted<00:00:31.580> to

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
take a look at one so I brought it in

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.619 
take a look at one so I brought it in
tried<00:00:34.400> it<00:00:34.519> out<00:00:34.610> in<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:34.850> shop<00:00:35.089> a<00:00:35.120> little<00:00:35.449> bit<00:00:35.600> I

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
tried it out in the shop a little bit I

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:36.910 
tried it out in the shop a little bit I
wanted<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.050> share<00:00:36.230> some<00:00:36.470> of<00:00:36.500> my<00:00:36.589> observations

wanted to share some of my observations

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.060 
wanted to share some of my observations
about<00:00:37.699> this<00:00:37.940> first<00:00:38.900> it's<00:00:39.170> manufactured<00:00:39.710> in

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
about this first it's manufactured in

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.549 
about this first it's manufactured in
America<00:00:40.640> by<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:40.879> company<00:00:41.210> called<00:00:41.299> ABS<00:00:42.110> tool

America by a company called ABS tool

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.060 
America by a company called ABS tool
designs<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:44.210> it's<00:00:44.510> my<00:00:45.260> first<00:00:45.530> impression

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
designs and it's my first impression

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.920 
designs and it's my first impression
when<00:00:46.159> I<00:00:46.309> took<00:00:47.000> it<00:00:47.089> out<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.299> the<00:00:47.330> package<00:00:47.720> was

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
when I took it out of the package was

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.530 
when I took it out of the package was
much<00:00:48.589> larger<00:00:49.159> and<00:00:49.369> more<00:00:49.519> substantial<00:00:50.330> than<00:00:50.420> I

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
much larger and more substantial than I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.799 
much larger and more substantial than I
had<00:00:50.690> imagined<00:00:51.260> for<00:00:51.409> a<00:00:51.470> push<00:00:51.739> stick<00:00:51.979> so<00:00:52.790> it<00:00:53.210> is

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
had imagined for a push stick so it is

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.320 
had imagined for a push stick so it is
it<00:00:54.290> really<00:00:54.710> keeps<00:00:54.979> your<00:00:55.250> hand<00:00:55.549> positioned

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
it really keeps your hand positioned

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.600 
it really keeps your hand positioned
well<00:00:57.019> away<00:00:57.409> from<00:00:57.439> the<00:00:57.680> spinning<00:00:58.129> table<00:00:58.339> saw

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
well away from the spinning table saw

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.329 
well away from the spinning table saw
blade<00:00:58.790> if<00:00:59.239> I<00:00:59.540> compare<00:00:59.989> it<00:01:00.049> to<00:01:00.170> the<00:01:00.320> size<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.220> the

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
blade if I compare it to the size of the

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.460 
blade if I compare it to the size of the
normal<00:01:01.729> push<00:01:01.909> stick<00:01:02.180> that<00:01:02.299> I<00:01:02.360> use<00:01:02.659> you<00:01:02.930> can<00:01:03.320> see

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
normal push stick that I use you can see

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.060 
normal push stick that I use you can see
it's<00:01:03.589> a<00:01:03.710> world<00:01:04.010> of<00:01:04.189> difference<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.680> second

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
it's a world of difference so the second

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.640 
it's a world of difference so the second
thing<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:07.250> I<00:01:07.400> noticed<00:01:07.850> was<00:01:08.080> this<00:01:09.080> soft

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
thing that I noticed was this soft

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.730 
thing that I noticed was this soft
rubber<00:01:10.100> cushion<00:01:11.000> on<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:11.359> bottom<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.960> this

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
rubber cushion on the bottom and this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.190 
rubber cushion on the bottom and this
really<00:01:13.130> allows<00:01:13.520> me<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:14.060> have<00:01:14.240> very<00:01:15.109> good

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
really allows me to have very good

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.190 
really allows me to have very good
control<00:01:15.469> over<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.609> work<00:01:16.820> piece<00:01:17.149> compared<00:01:18.079> to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
control over the work piece compared to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.099 
control over the work piece compared to
my<00:01:18.320> typical<00:01:18.710> wooden<00:01:19.399> ones<00:01:19.609> that<00:01:20.479> just<00:01:20.780> you

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
my typical wooden ones that just you

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:23.380 
my typical wooden ones that just you
know<00:01:21.170> they<00:01:21.380> don't<00:01:21.560> have<00:01:21.679> as<00:01:22.039> much<00:01:22.340> grip<00:01:22.729> as<00:01:23.329> a

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
know they don't have as much grip as a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.249 
know they don't have as much grip as a
as<00:01:23.869> a<00:01:23.929> soft<00:01:24.710> piece<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:24.920> rubber<00:01:25.249> does<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:27.020> third

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
as a soft piece of rubber does the third

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.169 
as a soft piece of rubber does the third
thing<00:01:27.469> that<00:01:27.530> I<00:01:27.649> noticed<00:01:28.130> was<00:01:28.549> this

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
thing that I noticed was this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.410 
thing that I noticed was this
retractable<00:01:29.869> heel<00:01:30.579> so<00:01:31.579> this<00:01:31.759> is<00:01:31.909> really<00:01:32.119> one

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
retractable heel so this is really one

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.209 
retractable heel so this is really one
of<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.570> keys<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.170> design<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.130> a

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
of the keys to the design it's a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.279 
of the keys to the design it's a
spring-loaded<00:01:34.909> heel<00:01:35.329> that<00:01:35.539> retracts<00:01:35.869> to

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
spring-loaded heel that retracts to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.649 
spring-loaded heel that retracts to
allow<00:01:36.649> you<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.920> have<00:01:37.069> that<00:01:37.249> same<00:01:37.310> full<00:01:38.090> control

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
allow you to have that same full control

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.130 
allow you to have that same full control
over<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.079> work<00:01:39.289> piece<00:01:39.560> whether<00:01:40.249> you're

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
over the work piece whether you're

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.200 
over the work piece whether you're
ripping<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.319> thicker<00:01:42.979> piece<00:01:43.340> of<00:01:43.640> stock<00:01:43.939> like

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
ripping a thicker piece of stock like

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.440 
ripping a thicker piece of stock like
this<00:01:44.240> 3/4<00:01:45.020> inch<00:01:45.170> piece<00:01:45.619> or<00:01:45.890> a<00:01:46.090> thinner<00:01:47.090> piece

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
this 3/4 inch piece or a thinner piece

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.359 
this 3/4 inch piece or a thinner piece
this<00:01:48.109> is<00:01:48.170> probably<00:01:48.649> about<00:01:48.799> an<00:01:49.130> eighth<00:01:49.340> inch

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
this is probably about an eighth inch

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.459 
this is probably about an eighth inch
and<00:01:49.909> you'll<00:01:50.359> see<00:01:50.630> that<00:01:50.810> when<00:01:50.960> I<00:01:51.020> get<00:01:51.200> over<00:01:51.380> the

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
and you'll see that when I get over the

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.209 
and you'll see that when I get over the
top<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:51.829> this<00:01:52.039> now<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:54.020> heel<00:01:54.409> retracts<00:01:54.950> into

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
top of this now this heel retracts into

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.520 
top of this now this heel retracts into
the<00:01:55.579> body<00:01:55.819> of<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.119> push<00:01:56.359> stick<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.289> allows

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
the body of the push stick and it allows

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.429 
the body of the push stick and it allows
me<00:01:57.799> to<00:01:57.920> engage<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:59.119> rubber<00:01:59.450> piece<00:01:59.869> to<00:02:00.289> the

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
me to engage the rubber piece to the

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.349 
me to engage the rubber piece to the
wood<00:02:00.619> across<00:02:00.889> the<00:02:01.219> full<00:02:01.520> length<00:02:01.789> of<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.149> push

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
wood across the full length of the push

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:05.379 
wood across the full length of the push
stick<00:02:02.630> now<00:02:03.469> I<00:02:03.499> have<00:02:03.979> full<00:02:04.310> control<00:02:04.729> from<00:02:05.119> side

00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
stick now I have full control from side

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:07.359 
stick now I have full control from side
to<00:02:05.420> side<00:02:05.630> over<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.289> thin<00:02:06.619> piece<00:02:06.859> of<00:02:06.889> stock

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
to side over this thin piece of stock

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.669 
to side over this thin piece of stock
which<00:02:07.850> gives<00:02:08.119> me<00:02:08.240> great<00:02:08.569> control<00:02:09.080> as<00:02:09.289> I<00:02:09.410> pass

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
which gives me great control as I pass

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.770 
which gives me great control as I pass
that<00:02:09.950> work<00:02:10.190> piece<00:02:10.459> through<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.240> table<00:02:11.600> saw

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
that work piece through the table saw

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.470 
that work piece through the table saw
and<00:02:12.050> past<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.040> spinning<00:02:13.220> blade<00:02:13.610> now<00:02:14.240> if<00:02:14.360> I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
and past the spinning blade now if I

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.170 
and past the spinning blade now if I
contrast<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.400> with<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.550> control<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.090> I

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
contrast that with the control that I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.480 
contrast that with the control that I
have<00:02:17.360> with<00:02:17.510> my<00:02:17.540> normal<00:02:18.020> push<00:02:18.230> stick<00:02:18.530> you<00:02:19.460> can

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
have with my normal push stick you can

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.290 
have with my normal push stick you can
see<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.850> have

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
see I have

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.420 
see I have
because<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> angle<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.680> I'm<00:02:21.830> sitting<00:02:22.250> at

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
because of the angle that I'm sitting at

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.150 
because of the angle that I'm sitting at
here<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.820> have<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> large<00:02:23.480> gap<00:02:24.010> underneath<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
here I have a large gap underneath the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.340 
here I have a large gap underneath the
push<00:02:25.370> stick<00:02:25.670> between<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.690> push<00:02:26.870> stick<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
push stick between the push stick and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.350 
push stick between the push stick and
the<00:02:27.500> work<00:02:27.710> piece<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:28.670> gives<00:02:28.970> me<00:02:29.240> a<00:02:29.510> lot<00:02:30.410> of

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
the work piece that gives me a lot of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.640 
the work piece that gives me a lot of
vulnerability<00:02:32.360> and<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.570> lack<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.840> control<00:02:33.470> over

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
vulnerability and a lack of control over

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.340 
vulnerability and a lack of control over
that<00:02:33.890> work<00:02:34.100> piece<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.120> why<00:02:35.660> don't<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.930> fire<00:02:36.200> up

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
that work piece so why don't I fire up

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.860 
that work piece so why don't I fire up
the<00:02:36.500> saw<00:02:36.710> and<00:02:37.040> run<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.880> through<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:38.570> you'll

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
the saw and run this through and you'll

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.960 
the saw and run this through and you'll
see<00:02:39.140> kind<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.590> control<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.280> have<00:02:40.610> in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
see kind of the control that I have in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:03:04.340 
see kind of the control that I have in
working<00:02:41.420> with<00:02:41.450> this<00:02:42.110> push<00:02:42.410> thing

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.500 

so<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.950> can<00:03:06.100> also<00:03:06.280> get<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> very<00:03:06.670> nice<00:03:07.120> quality

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
so you can also get a very nice quality

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.990 
so you can also get a very nice quality
of<00:03:07.840> cut<00:03:08.110> because<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.220> lateral<00:03:09.790> pressure

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
of cut because of the lateral pressure

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.140 
of cut because of the lateral pressure
that<00:03:10.510> you're<00:03:10.690> able<00:03:10.810> to<00:03:10.960> apply<00:03:11.970> toward<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
that you're able to apply toward the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.390 
that you're able to apply toward the
fence<00:03:13.420> holding<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.320> piece<00:03:14.530> firmly<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.220> place

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
fence holding the piece firmly in place

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.340 
fence holding the piece firmly in place
as<00:03:15.760> you're<00:03:16.000> going<00:03:16.150> through<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.600> cut<00:03:16.840> which<00:03:17.320> is

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
as you're going through the cut which is

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.380 
as you're going through the cut which is
something<00:03:17.830> that<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.040> really<00:03:18.250> can't<00:03:18.640> do<00:03:18.850> with

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
something that you really can't do with

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.530 
something that you really can't do with
this<00:03:19.570> type<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.990> push<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.230> net-net<00:03:21.300> really<00:03:22.300> like

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
this type of push to net-net really like

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.360
