00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.170
 with only a dozen steps it is possible to transform an image rgb a 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.509
 Photography 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.989
 a color drawing 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.009
 for it 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.009
 we got the following steps first 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.139
 we go acaponeta and double the current cup I can put 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.789
 black and white 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.359
 everything is at home cappa two robberies then 10 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.300
 the picture 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.760
 adjust 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.700
 saturated 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 with that black and white image what we are going to try from now on is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.580
 get traces like Saturday 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.220
 to those achieved with the actress 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.800
 for it 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.990
 Not few 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.010
 first filter 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 we choose 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.880
 will be 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.880
 and we choose resplendent borders 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.640
 we accept that those values ​​have come here by default 1 15 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.210
 and 5 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 we accept 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.040
 next 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.130
 we go the image 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 settings 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.980
 and we choose levels 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.530
 in order to get more contrast there is a greater definition 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.500
 in the lines for it 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.770
 we take impeller of the bank citigroup c the left 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.740
 until we get 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 a more pronounced definition 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.800
 next 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.240
 we are not going to image 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 settings 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.170
 and we choose to invest 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.580
 we want that we are already outlining the lines that already seem 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 practically 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.770
 d transit 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.590
 to give it a greater but similarity 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 we are going now to phyto 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.530
 artistic 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.670
 and let's choose 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.670
 quartered 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:15.509
 son I did not turn to cheese default values ​​7 3 3 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.279
 if we accept 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.559
 we see that the image is perhaps a bit dark then for them we are going to 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:27.379
 go now 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.889
 the picture 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.889
 Levels adjustments 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:33.749
 and we throw 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.719
 since 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.119
 i to the right to get a value of about 50 points 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.469
 we accept 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.589
 next 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.329
 we double 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.749
 it's here because we have active 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.749
 we let the man who leaves by default 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.009
 novo next 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.089
 to the filter 

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.369
 blur 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.639
 blur russia no 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.669
 we choose 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.669
 a value of 5 feet lgn by default 

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.199
 and with that then we get 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.199
 or what we intend to achieve 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.929
 There may be some traces of diffuse charcoal that we are going to 

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:24.449
 overlap 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:27.199
 with no other layer falling under 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.739
 for it 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.659
 we adjust opacity stands out by 50% 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.899
 To make it look 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:36.939
 the layer 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:38.219
 what we have 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.219
 yours between 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.229
 approximately 52% 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.139
 for more ease 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.019
 d for that action 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.019
 to the group we both launched these two capos 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.180
 tightening control co directly by selecting not here 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.249
 to get a 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:09.060
 fusion 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.409
 correct 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.829
 we choose the method 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.099
 overlap 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.229
 in those two layers 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.109
 we have here too 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.659
 jobs as his by putting 

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:25.120
 with which we are also seeing the background 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.410
 apart from the pool glasses we already see the color spots 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.710
 for the greatest realism we finally position ourselves in the background layer 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.430
 children we have filtered 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.819
 noise 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.389
 and medium 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.500
 crib stop 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.500
 greater feeling 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:49.819
 painting 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:53.259
 i accept 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.189
 and we will give you our affection 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.300
 that we can appreciate expanding the image 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.789
 its really nice effect 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.899
 if we finally want what we can do is garlic for the image 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.439
 with which we see that all the japac 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:11.029
 they have disappeared that have merged into one
