00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.840
 immediately 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.279
 all right 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.579
 good 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.579
 ah 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.300
 hello good morning good afternoon good 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.489
 nights at the time you are watching this 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.970
 video is not funny your vocabulary 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.390
 what do you mean you say watching this 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.790
 video 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.640
 maybe you can eat wolf to shoot a video 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.009
 I think it is understood that if 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.200
 it's a video you're watching it also not 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.229
 you're going to clarify why you have not uploaded a 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.149
 video in months so we do not have the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.430
 enough fans to do that kind of 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.520
 clarifications but what we have is 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.229
 they deserve this kind of clarification 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.850
 I have not done this kind of videos for the 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.979
 school since my study is 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.960
 quarterly means that what 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.330
 usually the topics that you see in 12 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.700
 months or in 6 months I see them in four 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.860
 months for which I have an almost 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.780
 every month to see all the topics 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.020
 what I did not have time to do 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.420
 videos happy already explain it if this 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.149
 video was sponsored by 2 fairness 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 evil and associates be welcome to 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.229
 the third part of four of the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.509
 best cartoons of today this day 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.940
 video combines the best cartoons of 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.159
 disney and disney xd since they belong to 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.710
 the same company did not consider putting them 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.110
 separated in place 10 is ironman 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.000
 adventure is 0 I do not think you have to 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.370
 clarifies because a caricature like this 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.950
 they see down at the top instead 9 is 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.569
 ultimate spider-man the cartoon is very 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.879
 superior to the previous one and some 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.190
 episodes I like animation too 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.290
 it is good what places it so low is 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.150
 that there are some things that I do not like 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.980
 like spiderman has a team of 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.290
 I work with superheroes that nobody 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.420
 he knew and if they knew them they knew them 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.640
 as adults or at least larger 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.640
 and there is something that does not convince me of this 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.629
 new version instead 8 is brand and the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.209
 Mr. mustaches 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.730
 this is an old caricature that still 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.950
 transmits in disney the animation is 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.709
 good has some characters 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.500
 interesting most of the chapters 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.019
 They are quite interesting and fun 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.480
 is in this place simply because 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.910
 others are better but do not want 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.269
 say it's a bad caricature in 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.760
 place 7 is blade this anime for being a 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.340
 anime has quite aesthetic drawings 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.620
 the animation is very good and with respect 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.819
 to the characters only some I like 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.219
 to others the 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.139
 needed what positions it in this 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:16.780
 place is that the plot and the fights are 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.239
 they are pretty silly in place 6 is 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.280
 jake long the western dragon is another 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.650
 old caricature that still airs in 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.989
 disney the animation is pretty good 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.030
 the characters are interesting the 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.340
 Most episodes are very good 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.260
 what positions it in this place is not 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.239
 I have something bad that I do not like is 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.299
 that the others I like more because they are 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.859
 better seriously the others I like more 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.900
 because they are better 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.540
 You are very eloquent with your words 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.939
 I like the others more because they are 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.430
 better for how long are you going to continue 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:51.609
 with that until you learn to talk to 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.760
 property continues with the top is fine in 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.859
 place 5 is underground is in 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.219
 this position since it is a caricature 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.870
 very good has a pretty plot 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:04.209
 interesting and the drawings are very good 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.549
 at the beginning I did not call myself much 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.370
 attention but after seeing the first 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:12.340
 episode I realized that it was quite 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.739
 interesting in place 4 is randy co 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.540
 league nigga total I started to see to give me 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.430
 mind that I was drawing was young 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.620
 who is the one who does not know who is young is 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.630
 vázquez he is the one who created invader without 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.550
 although that was only the beginning 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.650
 after some episodes the plot of 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.390
 the cartoon caught me but I would have 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.370
 liked it would have been completely 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.160
 made by vázquez as she was a pastor 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.350
 singh in place 3 and bronze medal is 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.050
 for gravity falls is a good program 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.870
 of mysteries the drawings are very good 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 the characters are very interesting the 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.800
 plot as I said before is mystery 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.600
 is what in each episode is a 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.730
 different adventure with different 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.340
 mythological creatures but in a way 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.440
 more burlesque like the Taurus man and the 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.970
 halloween super joker what 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.860
 gives the third place is that the other 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.900
 cartoons are better 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.360
 this program lost by a point or 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.210
 less for the next place instead 2 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.460
 and silver medal is for phineas and ferb 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.250
 It is a program where you can have fun 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.500
 seeing the structures made by this 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.660
 couple of brothers plus I like 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.210
 a lot of the songs that they put in each 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.640
 chapter without mentioning the generous ones 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.040
 contributions that we receive from 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.320
 12 thousand evil and associates and because 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.600
 We are united to jam and have 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.240
 and put it in a good place to follow 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.430
 enjoying these privileges and 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.890
 finally in place 1 and gold medal 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.290
 it's for the avengers there's not much 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.330
 say about this program besides that 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.220
 has a very good animation a good 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.840
 character development and the plot of 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.730
 the story is well developed 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.250
 also that the action scenes are 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.320
 quite good and besides that we can 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.150
 see many heroes that I did not know that 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.070
 they existed that started to please me 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.350
 since I started watching the show as 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.630
 black panther and hawk eye that was 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.850
 all for the moment comment if you 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.800
 liked the order of the 'top they like 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:04.020
 what not and what can we do to improve 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.020
 these videos see you soon
