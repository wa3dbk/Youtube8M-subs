expressing<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.159> work<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.490> there's<00:01:27.819> a<00:01:27.880> lot<00:01:28.030> of

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
expressing the work to there's a lot of

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.520 
expressing the work to there's a lot of
like<00:01:28.240> independent<00:01:28.780> comics<00:01:29.049> artists<00:01:29.350> that<00:01:29.409> we

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
like independent comics artists that we

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.219 
like independent comics artists that we
represent<00:01:30.179> gallery<00:01:31.179> comics<00:01:31.509> on<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.810> abstract

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.989 
represent gallery comics on is abstract
outsiders<00:01:32.709> and<00:01:32.859> so<00:01:33.310> basically<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.670> idea<00:01:33.700> is

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
outsiders and so basically the idea is

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:35.520 
outsiders and so basically the idea is
to<00:01:34.090> stop<00:01:34.389> looking<00:01:34.719> at<00:01:34.810> comments<00:01:35.079> as<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.319> genre

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
to stop looking at comments as a genre

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.190 
to stop looking at comments as a genre
and<00:01:36.520> look<00:01:36.700> at<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:36.819> as<00:01:36.999> a<00:01:37.119> medium<00:01:37.539> that

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
and look at it as a medium that

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.410 
and look at it as a medium that
everybody<00:01:38.709> has<00:01:38.920> access<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.549> and<00:01:39.819> so<00:01:40.270> that's

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
everybody has access to and so that's

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.510 
everybody has access to and so that's
why<00:01:40.569> it's<00:01:40.600> important<00:01:41.109> because<00:01:41.170> if<00:01:41.560> people<00:01:42.159> see

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
why it's important because if people see

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.459 
why it's important because if people see
because<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.179> corporate<00:01:43.600> corporate<00:01:44.020> entities

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
because the corporate corporate entities

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.370 
because the corporate corporate entities
can<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:45.159> control<00:01:45.999> how<00:01:46.179> we<00:01:46.240> see<00:01:46.539> things<00:01:46.569> so<00:01:47.020> so

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
can can control how we see things so so

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.620 
can can control how we see things so so
easily<00:01:47.789> it's<00:01:48.789> important<00:01:49.299> to<00:01:49.359> show<00:01:49.509> these

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
easily it's important to show these

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.219 
easily it's important to show these
independent<00:01:50.380> alternative<00:01:51.130> expressions<00:01:52.229> what

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
independent alternative expressions what

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.989 
independent alternative expressions what
I'm<00:01:53.319> looking<00:01:53.529> at<00:01:53.649> like<00:01:53.829> this<00:01:54.189> idea<00:01:54.459> of<00:01:54.609> black

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
I'm looking at like this idea of black

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.330 
I'm looking at like this idea of black
comics<00:01:55.389> not<00:01:55.899> only<00:01:56.079> are<00:01:56.289> we<00:01:56.350> looking<00:01:56.740> at

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
comics not only are we looking at

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.520 
comics not only are we looking at
people<00:01:57.670> who<00:01:57.759> are<00:01:57.880> proof<00:01:58.090> creating<00:01:58.810> them<00:01:58.960> but

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
people who are proof creating them but

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.800 
people who are proof creating them but
also<00:01:59.679> how<00:02:00.460> it's<00:02:00.759> how<00:02:01.179> it's<00:02:01.390> showing<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
also how it's how it's showing the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.389 
also how it's how it's showing the
diversity<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.409> black<00:02:02.619> experience<00:02:02.649> I

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
diversity of the black experience I

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.580 
diversity of the black experience I
think<00:02:03.659> because<00:02:04.659> you<00:02:04.840> get<00:02:04.929> to<00:02:04.990> act<00:02:05.170> American

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
think because you get to act American

promise the people who are making them
and<00:02:17.049> then<00:02:17.260> a<00:02:17.290> story<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.830> they're<00:02:17.950> trying<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
and then a story that they're trying to

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.220 
and then a story that they're trying to
tell<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.120> i<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.569> if<00:02:19.690> is<00:02:19.810> trying<00:02:20.110> to

tell and i think that if is trying to

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.440 
tell and i think that if is trying to
broaden<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.400> diversity<00:02:21.879> of<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.030> American

broaden the diversity of the American

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.289 
broaden the diversity of the American
experience<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:23.379> think<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.670> could<00:02:24.790> be<00:02:24.849> a

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
experience I think that could be a

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.720 
experience I think that could be a
really<00:02:25.900> good<00:02:26.140> basis<00:02:26.890> for<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.310> idea<00:02:27.580> what

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
really good basis for the idea what

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.210 
really good basis for the idea what
