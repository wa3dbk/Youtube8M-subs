even a new iphone but probably not right

even a new iphone but probably not right
now<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.000> summer<00:00:48.530> but<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.590> would<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.860> pretty

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
now this summer but I would be pretty

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.060 
now this summer but I would be pretty
epic<00:00:50.160> though<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.789> then<00:00:51.030> also<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.690> me<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> 27th

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
epic though and then also on me the 27th

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.310 
epic though and then also on me the 27th
it<00:00:53.520> seems<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:54.030> LG<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.570> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> also<00:00:54.960> hold

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it seems like LG is going to also hold

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.830 
it seems like LG is going to also hold
it<00:00:55.469> hold<00:00:55.890> an<00:00:56.100> event<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.579> San<00:00:57.030> Francisco<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
it hold an event in San Francisco and I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.799 
it hold an event in San Francisco and I
build<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> brand<00:00:58.469> new<00:00:58.680> LG<00:00:58.859> g3<00:00:59.510> which<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
build the brand new LG g3 which is of

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.349 
build the brand new LG g3 which is of
course<00:01:00.840> going<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> successor<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
course going to be the successor to the

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.859 
course going to be the successor to the
LG<00:01:03.359> g2<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.860> kind<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> feels<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.510> Apple

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
LG g2 so it kind of feels like the Apple

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.410 
LG g2 so it kind of feels like the Apple
that<00:01:07.110> something<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.680> doing<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.040> because

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
that something is doing this because

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
that something is doing this because
Apple<00:01:09.420> we've<00:01:09.900> heard<00:01:10.200> rumors<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.310> was<00:01:11.490> aids

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
Apple we've heard rumors that I was aids

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.300 
Apple we've heard rumors that I was aids
going<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> focus<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.570> health<00:01:13.130> with<00:01:14.130> some

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
going to focus a lot on health with some

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.969 
going to focus a lot on health with some
kind<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> health<00:01:14.790> /<00:01:15.000> gap<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.860> mean

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
kind of health / gap and so I mean

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
kind of health / gap and so I mean
something<00:01:17.250> kit<00:01:17.640> would<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.240> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.689> probably

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
something kit would be kind of probably

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.260 
something kit would be kind of probably
be<00:01:19.770> able<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.220> steal<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.610> show<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.090> bit

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
be able to steal the show a little bit

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.130 
be able to steal the show a little bit
if<00:01:21.509> they<00:01:22.140> started<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> talk<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.369> health<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
if they started to talk about health and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
if they started to talk about health and

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.030 
that is pretty pretty okay and I don't
really<00:02:10.060> believe<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.840> much<00:02:11.230> in<00:02:11.470> it<00:02:11.650> right<00:02:11.980> now

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
really believe that much in it right now

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.309 
really believe that much in it right now
because<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.420> battery<00:02:13.690> life<00:02:13.840> seems<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.200> be

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
because the battery life seems to be

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.449 
because the battery life seems to be
pretty<00:02:14.530> poor<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:16.140> those<00:02:17.140> devices<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:18.040> sounds

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
pretty poor on those devices and sounds

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.420 
pretty poor on those devices and sounds
like<00:02:18.580> probably<00:02:18.850> won't<00:02:19.240> unveil<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.380> brand-new

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
like probably won't unveil a brand-new

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.790 
like probably won't unveil a brand-new
product<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.640> mean<00:02:21.819> we<00:02:21.940> do<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.420> upcoming

Galaxy s5 mini which we are expecting to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.320 
Galaxy s5 mini which we are expecting to
come<00:02:26.380> out<00:02:26.590> around<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.640> summer<00:02:27.880> with<00:02:28.150> like

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
come out around this summer with like

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.760 
come out around this summer with like
720p<00:02:29.319> display<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.750> know<00:02:31.870> be<00:02:32.560> the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
720p display and you know be the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.210 
720p display and you know be the
successor<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.610> the<00:02:34.410> galaxy<00:02:35.410> s4<00:02:35.770> meaning<00:02:36.069> that

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
successor to the galaxy s4 meaning that

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.759 
successor to the galaxy s4 meaning that
it<00:02:36.459> was<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.610> very<00:02:36.940> good<00:02:37.330> smartphone<00:02:38.110> from<00:02:38.380> from

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
it was a very good smartphone from from

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.979 
it was a very good smartphone from from
something<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.489> lost<00:02:39.760> year<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.390> mini

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
something a lost year like a mini

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.620 
something a lost year like a mini
version<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> galaxy<00:02:41.650> s4<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.390> year

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
version of the galaxy s4 and this year

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.330 
version of the galaxy s4 and this year
hopefully<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.410> would<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.709> pretty<00:02:44.860> epic<00:02:44.980> if

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
hopefully it would be pretty epic if

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.759 
hopefully it would be pretty epic if
this<00:02:45.550> phone<00:02:46.060> here<00:02:46.330> also<00:02:46.600> came<00:02:46.930> out<00:02:47.080> with<00:02:47.560> water

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
this phone here also came out with water

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.229 
this phone here also came out with water
assistance<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:49.450> an<00:02:49.540> s5<00:02:49.900> mini<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.760> then

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
assistance and like an s5 mini but then

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.720 
assistance and like an s5 mini but then
they<00:02:52.959> probably<00:02:53.200> big<00:02:53.590> possibility<00:02:53.800> that<00:02:54.519> it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
they probably big possibility that it

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.080 
they probably big possibility that it
won't<00:02:54.940> be<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:56.590> dads<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:57.790> we're<00:02:57.970> probably

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
won't be be dads and but we're probably

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.300 
won't be be dads and but we're probably
