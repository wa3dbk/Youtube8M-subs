synthetic upper variation is a little

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.700 
synthetic upper variation is a little

bit stiff from right out of the box so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.320 
bit stiff from right out of the box so
it<00:00:25.800> does<00:00:25.949> need<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> couple<00:00:26.550> hours<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> break-in

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
it does need a couple hours of break-in

more<00:00:28.949> comfortable<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:30.060> far<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.449> overall

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
more comfortable as far as the overall

definitely<00:00:32.940> does<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.360> little<00:00:33.570> bit<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
definitely does have a little bit of a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.959 
definitely does have a little bit of a
tighter<00:00:34.140> fit<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.890> given<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.579> a

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
tighter fit about it given that it is a

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.420 
tighter fit about it given that it is a
thin<00:00:36.420> synthetic<00:00:36.989> soccer<00:00:37.260> shoe<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> as<00:00:38.129> far<00:00:38.309> as

thin synthetic soccer shoe and as far as
sizing<00:00:38.879> goes<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.239> definitely<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.780> fit<00:00:39.989> true

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
review and the fit in the length was

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
review and the fit in the length was
absolutely<00:00:45.239> perfect<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.230> looking

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
absolutely perfect so if you are looking

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
absolutely perfect so if you are looking
to<00:00:46.649> order<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.950> pair<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.370> yourself<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.969> would

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
to order a pair for yourself I would

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.229 
to order a pair for yourself I would
strongly<00:00:48.690> recommend<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.530> true<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.920> size

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
strongly recommend going true to size

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.330 
strongly recommend going true to size
the<00:00:51.239> synthetic<00:00:51.780> version<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.620> f50<00:00:53.160> adizero

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the synthetic version of the f50 adizero

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.580 
the synthetic version of the f50 adizero
is<00:00:53.940> definitely<00:00:54.449> less<00:00:54.629> popular<00:00:55.199> than<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is definitely less popular than the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.619 
is definitely less popular than the
leather<00:00:55.800> upper<00:00:56.070> variation<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
leather upper variation but I have to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.569 
leather upper variation but I have to
say<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.960> personally<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.649> prefer<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.039> feel<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
say that personally I prefer the feel of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.520 
say that personally I prefer the feel of
the<00:00:59.820> synthetic<00:01:00.030> model<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> simple<00:01:01.500> fact

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the synthetic model for the simple fact

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.009 
the synthetic model for the simple fact
that<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.039> feel<00:01:02.489> like<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.969> suits<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> overall

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
that I feel like it suits the overall

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
that I feel like it suits the overall
concept<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.769> shoe<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.400> bit<00:01:05.640> better

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
concept of the shoe a little bit better
