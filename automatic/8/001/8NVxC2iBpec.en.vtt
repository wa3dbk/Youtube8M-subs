you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.470 

okay<00:00:45.650> these<00:00:46.309> are<00:00:46.489> red<00:00:46.730> blood<00:00:46.970> cells<00:00:47.270> that

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
okay these are red blood cells that

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.420 
okay these are red blood cells that
carry<00:00:47.720> oxygen<00:00:47.980> you<00:00:48.980> see<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:49.280> they're

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
carry oxygen you see that they're

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.729 
carry oxygen you see that they're
stacked<00:00:49.760> up<00:00:49.940> together<00:00:50.330> they're<00:00:51.140> not<00:00:51.320> healthy

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
stacked up together they're not healthy

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.100 
stacked up together they're not healthy
the<00:00:52.309> blood<00:00:52.580> is<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:52.910> acid<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:53.600> they<00:00:53.780> need<00:00:53.960> to

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
the blood is so acid that they need to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.710 
the blood is so acid that they need to
stack<00:00:54.410> up<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.620> protect<00:00:55.129> themselves<00:00:55.720> these

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
stack up to protect themselves these

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.840 
stack up to protect themselves these
sizes<00:00:57.290> that<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:57.559> see<00:00:57.860> this<00:00:58.010> little<00:00:58.250> spots

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
sizes that you see this little spots

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.549 
sizes that you see this little spots
that<00:00:59.000> are<00:00:59.180> moving<00:00:59.510> those<00:00:59.720> are<00:00:59.840> bacteria<00:01:00.470> in

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
that are moving those are bacteria in

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.439 
that are moving those are bacteria in
the<00:01:00.710> blood

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
the blood

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.150 
the blood
we're<00:01:02.449> not<00:01:02.690> sterile<00:01:03.260> inside<00:01:03.739> of<00:01:03.860> our<00:01:04.009> body<00:01:04.250> and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
we're not sterile inside of our body and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.240 
we're not sterile inside of our body and
this<00:01:07.160> is<00:01:07.570> too<00:01:08.570> much<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.990> bacterial<00:01:09.560> content<00:01:09.860> in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
this is too much of bacterial content in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.370 
this is too much of bacterial content in
the<00:01:10.399> blood<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.910> is<00:01:11.090> an<00:01:11.210> exaggerated<00:01:11.840> content

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
the blood this is an exaggerated content

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
bacteria and other things that are there

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.630 
bacteria and other things that are there
you<00:01:26.720> know<00:01:26.840> what<00:01:26.990> these<00:01:27.170> pieces<00:01:27.440> of<00:01:27.800> dark

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
you know what these pieces of dark

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.330 
you know what these pieces of dark
material<00:01:28.880> are<00:01:29.740> those<00:01:30.740> are<00:01:30.950> pieces<00:01:31.310> of

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
material are those are pieces of

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.330 
material are those are pieces of
cholesterol<00:01:32.000> that<00:01:32.300> are<00:01:33.289> starting<00:01:33.710> to<00:01:33.740> form<00:01:33.890> in

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
cholesterol that are starting to form in

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.219 
cholesterol that are starting to form in
the<00:01:34.460> blood<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.910> these<00:01:35.509> are<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.810> pieces<00:01:36.020> that

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
the blood and these are the pieces that

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.710 
the blood and these are the pieces that
clog<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.190> arteries<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.789> capillaries<00:01:38.090> and

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
clog the arteries and capillaries and

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.100 
clog the arteries and capillaries and
the<00:01:38.869> circulation<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:40.729> is<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:41.149> patient<00:01:42.050> of

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
the circulation so this is a patient of

the circulation so this is a patient of
mine<00:01:42.319> before<00:01:42.530> taking<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.399> gorging<00:01:43.819> these

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
mine before taking the gorging these

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.300 
mine before taking the gorging these
cells<00:01:44.720> are<00:01:44.899> clumped<00:01:45.380> that's<00:01:45.709> why<00:01:45.860> they<00:01:46.039> feel

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
cells are clumped that's why they feel

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.969 
cells are clumped that's why they feel
so<00:01:46.520> tired<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.179> weak<00:01:47.959> and<00:01:48.259> oppress<00:01:48.740> and

anxious and angry and irritated because

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.580 
anxious and angry and irritated because

anything<00:02:12.040> lowers<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.250> pH<00:02:13.430> there's<00:02:14.060> acidity

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
anything lowers the pH there's acidity

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.190

and<00:02:14.900> bacteria<00:02:16.390> migrate<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.569> that<00:02:17.720> area<00:02:17.959> to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
and bacteria migrate to that area to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.680 
and bacteria migrate to that area to
feed<00:02:18.530> off<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.920> problem<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.180> what<00:02:20.360> if<00:02:20.510> you<00:02:20.630> have

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
feed off the problem so what if you have

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.030 
feed off the problem so what if you have
pain<00:02:21.020> in<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.260> body<00:02:21.440> there<00:02:21.709> are<00:02:21.800> bacteria

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
pain in the body there are bacteria

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.490 
pain in the body there are bacteria
there<00:02:22.550> so<00:02:22.790> we're<00:02:22.940> discovering<00:02:23.420> that<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
there so we're discovering that the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.320 
there so we're discovering that the
amount<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.040> not<00:02:25.220> as<00:02:25.370> large<00:02:25.730> as<00:02:25.940> when<00:02:26.090> you<00:02:26.209> have

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
amount is not as large as when you have

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.839 
amount is not as large as when you have
a<00:02:26.360> large<00:02:26.660> infection<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.349> they're<00:02:27.530> there

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
a large infection but they're there

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.580 
a large infection but they're there
we're<00:02:28.849> supposed<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.270> coexist<00:02:29.989> with<00:02:30.200> them<00:02:30.379> but

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
we're supposed to coexist with them but

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.350 
we're supposed to coexist with them but
this<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.860> an<00:02:30.980> abnormal<00:02:31.580> situation<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:32.239> we're

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
this is an abnormal situation that we're

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.330 
this is an abnormal situation that we're

now<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.700> not<00:02:45.910> totally<00:02:46.330> normal<00:02:46.840> there's

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
now it's not totally normal there's

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.210 
now it's not totally normal there's
about<00:02:47.760> 60%<00:02:48.760> less<00:02:49.030> bacteria<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:50.500> white<00:02:50.950> blood

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
about 60% less bacteria this white blood

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.520 
about 60% less bacteria this white blood
cell<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.550> moving<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:52.090> little<00:02:52.450> bit<00:02:52.630> better<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
cell is moving a little bit better the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.800 
cell is moving a little bit better the
cholesterol<00:02:54.100> pieces<00:02:54.550> have<00:02:54.790> reduced<00:02:55.270> in<00:02:55.540> size

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
cholesterol pieces have reduced in size

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.780 
cholesterol pieces have reduced in size
so<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:56.500> is<00:02:56.680> an<00:02:56.800> improvement<00:02:57.280> but<00:02:57.580> there's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
so this is an improvement but there's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
so this is an improvement but there's
still<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> lot<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.360> bacteria<00:02:58.960> floating<00:02:59.140> around

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
still a lot of bacteria floating around

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.400 
still a lot of bacteria floating around
so<00:03:00.460> it's<00:03:00.580> not<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.760> totally<00:03:01.270> normal<00:03:01.720> situation

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
so it's not a totally normal situation

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.180 
so it's not a totally normal situation
yet<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:04.620> there's<00:03:05.620> still<00:03:07.140> pale<00:03:08.140> red<00:03:08.920> blood

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
yet and there's still pale red blood

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.970 
yet and there's still pale red blood
cells<00:03:09.490> very<00:03:09.880> meaning<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:10.840> this<00:03:10.990> patient<00:03:11.230> even

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
cells very meaning so this patient even

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.550 
cells very meaning so this patient even
though<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.430> acidity<00:03:12.910> has<00:03:13.350> reducing<00:03:14.350> size

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
though the acidity has reducing size

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.230 
though the acidity has reducing size
they're<00:03:14.800> still<00:03:15.040> anemic<00:03:15.460> so<00:03:15.670> they<00:03:15.910> have<00:03:16.090> that

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
they're still anemic so they have that

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.260 
they're still anemic so they have that
problem<00:03:16.420> still<00:03:16.840> this<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.770> same<00:03:17.980> person<00:03:18.270> as

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
problem still this is the same person as

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.460 
problem still this is the same person as
we<00:03:19.570> continue<00:03:20.140> giving<00:03:20.530> them<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:21.220> golgi<00:03:22.470> you

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
we continue giving them the golgi you

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.320 
we continue giving them the golgi you
see<00:03:23.680> now<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.920> bacteria<00:03:24.700> are<00:03:24.940> almost

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
see now the bacteria are almost

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330 
see now the bacteria are almost
completely<00:03:25.780> disappear<00:03:26.350> this<00:03:26.950> is<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.160> bus<00:03:27.310> to

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
completely disappear this is the bus to

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.290 
completely disappear this is the bus to
have<00:03:27.580> any<00:03:27.730> two<00:03:27.880> hours<00:03:28.270> so<00:03:29.610> this<00:03:30.610> says<00:03:30.880> you<00:03:31.120> see

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
have any two hours so this says you see

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.060 
have any two hours so this says you see
them<00:03:31.450> moving<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.870> little<00:03:32.050> bit<00:03:32.260> now<00:03:32.860> they're

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
them moving a little bit now they're

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.980 
them moving a little bit now they're
moving<00:03:33.220> freely<00:03:33.730> they're<00:03:34.030> more<00:03:34.270> relaxed<00:03:34.840> now

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
moving freely they're more relaxed now

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.290 
moving freely they're more relaxed now
they're<00:03:35.170> able<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.560> carry<00:03:35.860> oxygen<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.670> carbon

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
they're able to carry oxygen in carbon

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.770 
they're able to carry oxygen in carbon
dioxide<00:03:37.840> out<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:39.130> web<00:03:39.340> blood<00:03:39.610> cell<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:40.420> still

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
dioxide out the web blood cell is still

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.380 
dioxide out the web blood cell is still
not<00:03:40.990> moving<00:03:41.200> great<00:03:41.680> he<00:03:42.340> needs<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:42.880> be<00:03:43.030> moving

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
not moving great he needs to be moving

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.580 
not moving great he needs to be moving
to<00:03:43.570> clean<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.080> environment<00:03:44.820> to<00:03:45.820> assist<00:03:46.590> with

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
to clean the environment to assist with

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.970 
to clean the environment to assist with
this<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.990> there's<00:03:49.990> still<00:03:50.200> acidity<00:03:50.710> you<00:03:50.740> see

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
this and there's still acidity you see

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.520 
this and there's still acidity you see
those<00:03:51.160> two<00:03:51.340> shiny<00:03:51.640> spots<00:03:52.060> on<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.300> top<00:03:52.530> that's

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
those two shiny spots on the top that's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.270 
those two shiny spots on the top that's
uric<00:03:53.920> acid<00:03:54.400> that's<00:03:55.300> what<00:03:55.510> gives<00:03:55.720> gout<00:03:56.280> so

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
uric acid that's what gives gout so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.220 
uric acid that's what gives gout so
dying<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.270> tells<00:03:58.570> me<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:58.780> there's<00:03:59.080> still

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
dying that tells me that there's still

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.970 
dying that tells me that there's still
acidity<00:03:59.830> in<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.010> blood<00:04:01.320> so<00:04:02.320> we<00:04:04.860> continue<00:04:05.860> with

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
acidity in the blood so we continue with

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.610 
acidity in the blood so we continue with
a<00:04:06.100> gradient<00:04:06.340> look<00:04:06.640> what<00:04:06.820> we<00:04:06.940> see<00:04:07.120> now<00:04:07.300> the

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
a gradient look what we see now the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.280 
a gradient look what we see now the
anemia<00:04:08.620> is<00:04:08.950> gone<00:04:09.270> these<00:04:10.270> cells<00:04:10.570> are<00:04:10.720> gone<00:04:10.960> you

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
anemia is gone these cells are gone you

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.099 
anemia is gone these cells are gone you
think

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.559 

so<00:04:16.859> there's<00:04:17.039> approximately<00:04:17.400> five<00:04:18.090> days<00:04:18.359> after

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:18.569 
so there's approximately five days after

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:21.409 
so there's approximately five days after
starting<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:19.289> five<00:04:19.889> days<00:04:20.129> it's<00:04:20.849> very<00:04:20.909> fast

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
starting it five days it's very fast

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.110 
starting it five days it's very fast
someone<00:04:22.109> that<00:04:22.409> was<00:04:22.560> anemic<00:04:23.220> at<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.639> microscopic

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
someone that was anemic at a microscopic

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.290 
someone that was anemic at a microscopic
level<00:04:24.650> now<00:04:25.650> they're<00:04:25.919> dark<00:04:26.250> that's<00:04:27.030> how<00:04:27.240> you

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
level now they're dark that's how you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.390 
level now they're dark that's how you
won<00:04:27.689> your<00:04:27.900> red<00:04:28.289> blood<00:04:28.500> cells<00:04:28.710> nice<00:04:28.949> and<00:04:29.189> dark

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
won your red blood cells nice and dark

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.240 
won your red blood cells nice and dark
mean<00:04:29.639> they<00:04:29.849> have<00:04:30.000> hemoglobin<00:04:30.360> inside

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
mean they have hemoglobin inside

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.730 
mean they have hemoglobin inside
transport<00:04:32.250> of<00:04:32.310> oxygen<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:33.409> optimal<00:04:34.409> and<00:04:34.620> at<00:04:34.710> a

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
transport of oxygen is optimal and at a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.230 
transport of oxygen is optimal and at a
maximum<00:04:35.009> very<00:04:35.759> good

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
maximum very good

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.619 
maximum very good

white<00:04:42.960> blood<00:04:43.199> cell<00:04:43.409> looks<00:04:43.770> healthier

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
white blood cell looks healthier

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.040 
white blood cell looks healthier
the<00:04:45.330> edges<00:04:45.960> are<00:04:46.849> smoother<00:04:47.849> it's<00:04:48.659> looking

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
the edges are smoother it's looking

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.050 
the edges are smoother it's looking
better<00:04:49.259> it's<00:04:49.560> looking<00:04:49.740> more<00:04:50.250> relief<00:04:52.969> so<00:04:53.969> you

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
better it's looking more relief so you

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.320 
better it's looking more relief so you
see<00:04:54.240> how<00:04:54.360> important<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.289> have<00:04:55.590> a

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
see how important it is to have a

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:03.110 
see how important it is to have a
healthy<00:04:57.330> environment<00:04:58.759> okay<00:04:59.759> now<00:05:01.940> let's<00:05:02.940> get<00:05:03.060> a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
healthy environment okay now let's get a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.140 
healthy environment okay now let's get a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
close-up of the white blood cell after

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.249 
close-up of the white blood cell after
seven<00:05:06.840> days<00:05:08.210> this<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.419> a<00:05:09.449> close-up<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.110> the

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 
seven days this is a close-up of the

this<00:05:27.599> is<00:05:27.779> from<00:05:28.020> Golgi<00:05:28.469> I<00:05:28.650> did<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.490> myself<00:05:29.729> in

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
this is from Golgi I did this myself in

this is from Golgi I did this myself in
my<00:05:30.240> patient<00:05:30.690> though<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:31.979> curiosity<00:05:32.759> that<00:05:32.909> I

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
my patient though the curiosity that I

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.480 
my patient though the curiosity that I
have<00:05:33.300> has<00:05:34.169> led<00:05:34.529> me<00:05:34.680> to<00:05:34.830> look<00:05:35.009> into<00:05:35.250> this

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
have has led me to look into this

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.029 
have has led me to look into this
because<00:05:35.879> there's<00:05:36.750> a<00:05:36.870> lot<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.199> research<00:05:37.680> that

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
because there's a lot of research that

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.189 
because there's a lot of research that
I've<00:05:38.279> seen<00:05:38.550> that<00:05:38.819> was<00:05:39.029> from<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.449> barium<00:05:39.960> from

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
I've seen that was from the barium from

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.860 
I've seen that was from the barium from
other<00:05:40.409> places<00:05:41.279> and<00:05:41.669> locations<00:05:41.819> but<00:05:42.449> I<00:05:42.479> wanted

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
other places and locations but I wanted

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.959 
other places and locations but I wanted
to<00:05:43.050> research<00:05:43.379> the<00:05:43.620> actual<00:05:44.069> goji<00:05:44.490> juice<00:05:44.520> I

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
to research the actual goji juice I

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.850 
to research the actual goji juice I
wanted<00:05:45.659> to<00:05:45.779> see<00:05:45.930> what<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.229> juice<00:05:46.589> could

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
wanted to see what that juice could

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.529 
wanted to see what that juice could
could<00:05:47.219> do<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.759> this<00:05:48.569> is<00:05:48.750> what<00:05:48.930> he<00:05:49.020> can<00:05:49.199> do<00:05:50.539> in

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
could do and this is what he can do in

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.879 
could do and this is what he can do in
all<00:05:52.190> the<00:05:53.190> patients<00:05:53.430> that<00:05:53.759> I<00:05:53.789> see<00:05:54.050> roughly<00:05:55.050> 90%

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
all the patients that I see roughly 90%

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.019 
all the patients that I see roughly 90%
of<00:05:56.610> them<00:05:57.800> will<00:05:58.800> have<00:05:59.009> an<00:05:59.190> increasing<00:05:59.669> their

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
of them will have an increasing their

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.329 
of them will have an increasing their
alkalinity<00:06:00.659> of<00:06:00.839> the<00:06:00.990> pH<00:06:01.379> within<00:06:01.949> two<00:06:02.159> weeks

90%<00:06:03.270> within<00:06:03.870> two<00:06:04.020> weeks<00:06:04.169> will<00:06:04.379> have<00:06:04.500> that

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
90% within two weeks will have that

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.469 
90% within two weeks will have that
change<00:06:05.000> that<00:06:06.000> is<00:06:06.469> amazing
