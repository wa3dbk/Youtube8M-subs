cucumbers soothing facial wipes which I

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.589 
cucumbers soothing facial wipes which I
use<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.590> remove<00:00:25.830> my<00:00:26.070> makeup<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:27.029> remove<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
use to remove my makeup and I remove the

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.570 
use to remove my makeup and I remove the
oil<00:00:27.630> or<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.289> could<00:00:28.470> use<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.769> warm<00:00:29.220> wet

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
oil or you could use a warm wet

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.790 
oil or you could use a warm wet
washcloth<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.689> think<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.170> easier<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
washcloth but I think this is easier and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.260 
washcloth but I think this is easier and
it<00:00:31.890> helps<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> extra<00:00:33.059> makeup

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it helps get some of the extra makeup

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.630

trying<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.540> first<00:03:05.750> time<00:03:05.990> and<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:07.310> did<00:03:07.580> like

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
trying for the first time and I did like

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.580 
trying for the first time and I did like
it<00:03:07.820> but<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.360> just<00:03:08.390> wasn't<00:03:08.720> moisturizing
