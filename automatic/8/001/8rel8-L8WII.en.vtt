00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.790
 Welcome to the Protestant 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.779
 dearer than against dresden 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:23.160
 how do you get to stefan köber around 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.160
 my left to cheftrainer 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.010
 I am relieved that we are the 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.370
 difficult homecoming overcome 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.850
 have and are also positively 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.900
 which way has done 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.280
 We were there in the first half 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.850
 one or the other mistake too much 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.489
 made play building especially that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.700
 Overall, not really around 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.899
 halfway addressed 2010 significantly 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.329
 especially played better over 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.190
 played outside and are a goal chance 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.070
 methods come and I think 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:04.660
 passed a deserved victory and with us 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.670
 Großaspach as well as expected 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.759
 what had prepared everything required 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.740
 has and think that this team 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.740
 this club has a good way to go 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.330
 Many Thanks 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.850
 a statement about the game i think 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.860
 that both are actually worlds 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.870
 but I think that we the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.440
 make the world a bit narrower today 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.270
 could 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.180
 we have everything in the balance 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.680
 thrown around dresden here too 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 to demand everything and I believe that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.730
 We also succeeded very well in everything 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.920
 the first half with a bit 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.020
 straightforward and accurate fitting game believe 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.730
 me that we are there the others 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.500
 situation for us too 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.110
 maybe that's what they are 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.010
 little things missing 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.420
 but they are certainly not 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.970
 little things you do not turn off 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.160
 can and therefore I am glad glad 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.530
 I know that my team today at 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.950
 limit was she gave everything we did 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.720
 every week try to do 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.760
 today he has the little things on the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.340
 third side ball jumping to the ball 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.350
 Washington a ball jumps in front of heart and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.370
 simons karad i left shortly before the time where 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.160
 it can do 21 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.930
 he does not make him in both 21st 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.959
 the ball jumps off he joke in 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.610
 sixteen shoots over and then you will 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.790
 you are the second winner after that 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.650
 kleinigkeiten third league is fun there 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.010
 was a great experience for my boys 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.530
 was great as the fans here too 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.610
 presented to that was a mood like 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.620
 We like every football player wishes 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.000
 We think both teams to do so 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.760
 contributed this is a great game 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.620
 will be a great afternoon for everyone 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.810
 stadium were 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.350
 and I think I'm very happy with that 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.980
 my troupe 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.930
 unfortunately no reason today but you have to 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.260
 also say that the dresdner with 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.580
 safety one or for me one 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.000
 the best teams were so far 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.630
 there was 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.430
 they were very structured they have 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.360
 the building game always variable 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.510
 then in the second half 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.120
 little bit changed and that changed 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.790
 I was thinking maybe afterwards too 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.239
 the reason is the game against us exactly 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.239
 Thank you
