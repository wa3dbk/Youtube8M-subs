00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:04.740 
for the natives and what that means to

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
actions in Hawaii well I think that

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.900 
actions in Hawaii well I think that
Hawaii<00:01:12.030> first<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.550> it's<00:01:14.550> a<00:01:14.700> great

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
Hawaii first of all is a it's a great

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.609 
Hawaii first of all is a it's a great
island<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.479> its<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.750> pretty<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.440> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
island and its really pretty and the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.870 
island and its really pretty and the
culture<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.009> amazing<00:01:17.460> that's<00:01:17.550> all<00:01:17.759> about

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880

culture is amazing that's all about
friends<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.540> family<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.290> think<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
friends and family and I think that that

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.340 
friends and family and I think that that
is<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.340> important<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.700> take<00:01:21.290> with<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
is really important to take with a

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.660 
is really important to take with a
message<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> film<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.310> me<00:01:23.399> is<00:01:23.490> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
message of the film for me is so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.150 
message of the film for me is so
important<00:01:24.149> it's<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.720> idea<00:01:24.899> of<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.920> know<00:01:26.009> no

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
important it's that idea of you know no

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.609 
important it's that idea of you know no
matter<00:01:26.310> how<00:01:26.550> advanced<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.630> don't<00:01:28.229> forget

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
matter how advanced we get don't forget

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.130 
matter how advanced we get don't forget
that<00:01:29.160> connection<00:01:29.819> to<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.149> land<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.660> to<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that connection to the land and to to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
that connection to the land and to to
indigenous<00:01:31.470> people<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.250> over<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.490> world<00:01:32.550> I

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
indigenous people all over the world I

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.910 
indigenous people all over the world I
think<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.899> time<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> fuse<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> two

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
think now is the time to fuse the two

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.130 
think now is the time to fuse the two
all<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.850> knowledge<00:01:36.090> but<00:01:36.869> let's<00:01:37.050> not

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
all of this knowledge but let's not

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.050 
all of this knowledge but let's not
forget<00:01:37.440> the<00:01:37.649> teaching<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> past<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.000> I

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
forget the teaching of the past and I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.160 
forget the teaching of the past and I
think<00:01:39.210> that's<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.630> movie<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> all

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
think that's what this movie is all

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.139 
think that's what this movie is all
about<00:01:40.200> 'let's<00:01:40.649> these<00:01:41.100> sacred<00:01:41.340> teachings<00:01:41.940> are

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
about 'let's these sacred teachings are

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.889 
about 'let's these sacred teachings are
still<00:01:42.479> here<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.080> must<00:01:43.530> be<00:01:43.619> preserved<00:01:44.039> I<00:01:44.899> think

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
still here and must be preserved I think

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.419 
still here and must be preserved I think
it's<00:01:45.990> really<00:01:46.200> important<00:01:46.619> I'm<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.830> Pacific

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429
