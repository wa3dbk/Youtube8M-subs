00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:13.170
 no-no-no-no-no-no-no 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:16.400
 and what is it what is it some kind of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:22.650
 a torch but it's a bit unusual 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 it is necessary to try it here and you somewhere 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.720
 not very safe but judging my 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 logic will be safe that I blow 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.219
 you yourself now this torch will 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.850
 completely safe 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.850
 I guarantee you 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.630
 Hello dear friends with you camp 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.730
 family will be 42 years old two fashion on the review 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.340
 So let's start with this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.380
 big at least what is there 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.720
 This mod adds us torch torches 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.910
 adds this mod that is seemingly 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.070
 that all is lost but no these torches 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.410
 quite interesting now they gave me three 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.270
 four kinds of torches one is standard 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.560
 like that burns thanks to my texture 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.050
 the second is also burning cool eat 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.900
 torch burning such and such shorter let 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.580
 let me forget 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.040
 bites in short what these torches do 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.620
 if you have enough to paint yourself like this 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.230
 here is the torch which is the most 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.140
 not burning more precisely the most not tenacious 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.070
 play this way I'm crafting at all 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.650
 not in sau 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.860
 in the course of just things and tormented randomly 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.690
 stuck and can collect eight santosh 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.940
 this torch allows us 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.619
 burn the mobs that is, all those on the torch 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.460
 noble burn can give but 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.280
 take whom we can take we do not 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.030
 hurt us we take zombies so he 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.460
 didn't hurt us 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.710
 let's type this standard and 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.500
 remove the more evil torch and will remain in 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.580
 here we are this torch and we will allow it 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.690
 zombies yes now I quickly turned on 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.790
 easy mode that's easy and it's night yes 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.649
 notice, by the way, that the torch illuminates 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.640
 quite a lot more 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.070
 this is also a plus comes to the zombies 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.080
 the wind it burns from the torch that is this 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.989
 the torch allows us to set fire to different 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.420
 can including this zombies could have been 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.220
 enlarge but i still decided to set fire to 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.690
 there we see that he is really offended 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.760
 then zombies and now we have to go 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.190
 burn out 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.590
 burn burn burn clear that you have not gone out 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.780
 filed everything burned down neighbors what is it 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.150
 torch can be protected from mobs but it 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.200
 only the first torch he most say so 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.010
 not effective 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.049
 sick and wheels on touch of Krasin 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.269
 eight fast drag plus evil crystal 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.690
 we lay down the center of the evil crystal in short 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.250
 this way up pretty fat 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.840
 painted but still it turns out 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.440
 we have 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.410
 so here is a torch he is one evil santa what 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.480
 he is also more dangerous for mobs 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.000
 but he is not dangerous for us to create it 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.160
 words bypass we put this torch and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.290
 look already at a greater distance to god 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.760
 starts to burn and damage is dealt 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.670
 naturally more that is this torch 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.890
 cooler and it would seem that this torch already 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.780
 can be inserted at home to defend against 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.590
 different mobs but not this yet 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.090
 limit 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.489
 further we have an even more epic torch 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.069
 that looks like this 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.530
 installation 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.230
 krafe dream of one evil santa cha and 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.360
 crystal again and he is so 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.880
 the scorching is so epic that he 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.519
 burns even us as I also sang a couple 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.769
 time to pour, that is, see we set 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.849
 if at some huge distance 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.730
 starts to burn 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.980
 as on the drain of mobs that is this torch 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.410
 just deliver I don't know where it is 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.700
 the village as you yourself and jumps and 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.440
 it's really dangerous so alright all with 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.660
 This mod seems to be all so I advise 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.670
 you download it oysters since it 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.200
 really interesting but the next one could 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.299
 mod will allow us here so visually 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.019
 change our characters now we 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:18.919
 see that I have oh oh oh oh now we 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.389
 we see that I have a pickaxe on my back 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.120
 it really is not worth it, Kirk 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.370
 just a picture but still there 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.139
 something in this interesting since 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.680
 look now behind my pick 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.750
 and let us take the ax did it then, 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.060
 keep in hand and remove this ax 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.210
 would you go on like that and now i have for 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.039
 back there is an ax also this acts with 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.530
 by all things seeds are things not 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.960
 torches do not block on exactly things to give 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.090
 take the golden sword support hands and 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.160
 remove and what we see we see 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.820
 the golden sword behind it is the same 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.320
 just epic also why am I showing 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:59.100
 that's because alone he 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.380
 that snow has been god since this mod 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.090
 alone as if useless but will 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.460
 much interesting and set it on 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.150
 your server now you can 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.370
 look more cool and show what 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.110
 things you have that is if you see 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.820
 diamonds that i think the rival is already 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.470
 lose to you before just 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.750
 the battle will begin and in principle 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.030
 part of you about side then put like if 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.580
 want more then sits about signature on 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.580
 channel and all good and new meetings
