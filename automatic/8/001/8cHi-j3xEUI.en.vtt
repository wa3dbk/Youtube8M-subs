camera to shoot with ever since I bought

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.820 
camera to shoot with ever since I bought
my<00:00:13.490> Leica<00:00:14.490> m3<00:00:14.940> which<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.450> over<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:15.800> but<00:00:16.800> I

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
my Leica m3 which I have over here but I

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010 
my Leica m3 which I have over here but I
wanted<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> digital<00:00:17.970> camera<00:00:18.270> that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
wanted it to be a digital camera that

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.470 
wanted it to be a digital camera that
had<00:00:19.340> not<00:00:20.340> exactly<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.180> rangefinder

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
had not exactly the rangefinder

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.120 
had not exactly the rangefinder
experience<00:00:22.080> because<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> course<00:00:22.619> Fuji<00:00:22.980> film

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
experience because of course Fuji film

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.150 
experience because of course Fuji film
isn't<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.779> rangefinder<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.769> know<00:00:25.859> just

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
isn't a rangefinder but you know just

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400 
isn't a rangefinder but you know just
that<00:00:26.310> compact<00:00:27.060> camera<00:00:27.660> system<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.260> can

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
that compact camera system that you can

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.160 
that compact camera system that you can
take<00:00:28.619> with<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.890> that's<00:00:29.250> really<00:00:29.820> just

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
take with you that's really just

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.580 
take with you that's really just
unobtrusive<00:00:32.540> lets<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.630> shoot<00:00:33.809> freely<00:00:34.170> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
unobtrusive lets you shoot freely and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220 
unobtrusive lets you shoot freely and
it's<00:00:34.950> not<00:00:35.100> really<00:00:35.370> big<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> distracting<00:00:36.510> in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it's not really big and distracting in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.229 
it's not really big and distracting in
terms<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> size<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.280> terms<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> size<00:00:39.030> so

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
terms of size so in terms of size so

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.450 
terms of size so in terms of size so
that's<00:00:39.360> why<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.600> chose<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.989> Fuji<00:00:40.320> film<00:00:40.469> XE<00:00:41.280> one

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that's why I chose the Fuji film XE one

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
that's why I chose the Fuji film XE one
I<00:00:41.910> chose<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.450> over<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> X<00:00:42.899> Pro<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.590> simply

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I chose it over the X Pro one is simply

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.209 
I chose it over the X Pro one is simply
because<00:00:44.219> one<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.000> cost<00:00:45.590> secondly<00:00:46.590> although

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
because one the cost secondly although

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.610 
because one the cost secondly although
the<00:00:47.820> optical<00:00:48.239> viewfinder<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.899> nice<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the optical viewfinder is nice I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.639 
the optical viewfinder is nice I
eventually<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> 10<00:00:51.989> V<00:00:52.440> naught

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
eventually want to get the 10 V naught

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.100 
eventually want to get the 10 V naught
to<00:00:52.770> 10<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> 15<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.730> 24<00:00:54.180> wide-angle<00:00:54.750> lens<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
to 10 the 15 to 24 wide-angle lens and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.900 
to 10 the 15 to 24 wide-angle lens and
that<00:00:55.140> doesn't<00:00:55.949> necessarily<00:00:56.100> work<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.820> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that doesn't necessarily work with the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.389 
that doesn't necessarily work with the
optical<00:00:57.270> viewfinder<00:00:57.469> unless<00:00:58.469> they<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:59.190> some

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
optical viewfinder unless they put some

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.360 
optical viewfinder unless they put some
sort<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.730> view<00:01:00.210> finder<00:01:00.539> attachment<00:01:01.370> because

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
sort of view finder attachment because

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
sort of view finder attachment because
the<00:01:02.760> viewfinder<00:01:03.030> isn't<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.660> wide<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.589> that's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the viewfinder isn't that wide so that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080 
the viewfinder isn't that wide so that's
why<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> went<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.700> has<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
why I went for this it has the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
why I went for this it has the
electronic<00:01:06.689> viewfinder<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> not<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
electronic viewfinder and not the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940 
electronic viewfinder and not the
optical<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.630> basically<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.590> what<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.920> see

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
optical so it's basically a what you see

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.039 
optical so it's basically a what you see
is<00:01:11.100> what<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.610> sort<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> things<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.780> let's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
is what you get sort of things so let's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.690 
is what you get sort of things so let's
just<00:01:13.170> go<00:01:13.290> straight<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> unboxing<00:01:14.430> so

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
just go straight into the unboxing so

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.929 
just go straight into the unboxing so
this<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> boxed<00:01:15.990> really<00:01:16.409> small<00:01:16.939> simple

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
this is the boxed really small simple

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.830 
this is the boxed really small simple
branding<00:01:18.540> on<00:01:19.070> all<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.369> sides<00:01:20.580> Fuji<00:01:21.060> xc1<00:01:21.570> as

branding on all the sides Fuji xc1 as

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.830 
branding on all the sides Fuji xc1 as
you<00:01:22.290> can<00:01:22.439> see<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> black<00:01:23.040> version<00:01:23.840> made

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
you can see it's the black version made

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.880 
you can see it's the black version made
in<00:01:24.990> Japan<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> bottom<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.259> has<00:01:28.860> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
bunch of stuff that I can't be bothered

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
bunch of stuff that I can't be bothered

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
believe it comes with silky pics to

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.859 
believe it comes with silky pics to
process<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.159> raw<00:01:59.280> files<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.540> won't<00:02:00.750> be

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
process the raw files but I won't be

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.080 
process the raw files but I won't be
using<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.259> because<00:02:01.409> Adobe<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.310> released

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
actually not sure what this is I think

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.589 
actually not sure what this is I think
these<00:02:39.579> are<00:02:39.640> for<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.120> straps<00:02:40.629> and<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:43.390> might

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
these are for the straps and that might

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.910 
these are for the straps and that might
be<00:02:43.629> for<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> straps<00:02:44.290> as<00:02:44.439> well<00:02:44.470> I'm<00:02:44.739> not<00:02:44.859> sure

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
be for the straps as well I'm not sure

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.940 
be for the straps as well I'm not sure
I'll<00:02:45.250> look<00:02:45.370> into<00:02:45.519> that<00:02:45.609> later<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.799> have<00:02:47.799> your

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
I'll look into that later you have your

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.250 
I'll look into that later you have your
battery<00:02:48.159> of<00:02:48.519> course<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.930> believe<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
battery of course and I believe the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.949 
battery of course and I believe the
battery<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.650> not<00:02:50.829> that<00:02:51.209> long<00:02:52.209> not<00:02:52.720> that

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
battery is not that long not that

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.720 
battery is not that long not that
powerful<00:02:53.139> so<00:02:53.620> I'm<00:02:54.010> going<00:02:54.159> to<00:02:54.250> be<00:02:54.400> getting

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
powerful so I'm going to be getting

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.759 
powerful so I'm going to be getting
extra<00:02:55.120> batteries<00:02:55.480> for<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.620> get

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
extra batteries for this and you get

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.509 
extra batteries for this and you get
your<00:02:57.269> simple<00:02:58.269> strap<00:02:58.769> to<00:02:59.769> go<00:02:59.889> with<00:03:00.040> your<00:03:00.129> camera

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519

and so let's now let's take a look at

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.559 
and so let's now let's take a look at
the<00:03:02.739> camera<00:03:03.010> itself<00:03:03.220> along<00:03:04.090> with<00:03:04.269> this<00:03:04.329> camera

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
the camera itself along with this camera

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.000 
the camera itself along with this camera
