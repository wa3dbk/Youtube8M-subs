stampede this is actually a two-wheel
drive<00:00:04.500> stampeding<00:00:05.160> that's<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.400> brush<00:00:05.730> one<00:00:06.029> I

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
drive stampeding that's a brush one I

drive stampeding that's a brush one I
just<00:00:06.330> don't<00:00:06.509> have<00:00:07.040> body<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> body<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.700> have

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
just don't have body for the body I have

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.310 
just don't have body for the body I have
I<00:00:08.970> just<00:00:09.120> paint<00:00:09.540> out<00:00:09.660> I'll<00:00:09.809> kind<00:00:10.080> of<00:00:10.110> want<00:00:10.290> to

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
I just paint out I'll kind of want to

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.379 
I just paint out I'll kind of want to
get<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.530> scratched<00:00:10.860> up<00:00:11.099> but<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.639> went<00:00:12.179> ahead<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
get it scratched up but I went ahead and

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.060 
get it scratched up but I went ahead and
built<00:00:12.599> this<00:00:12.809> up<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.650> only<00:00:13.769> difference

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
built this up the only difference

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.690 
built this up the only difference
between<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> regular

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
between this and a regular

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.420 
between this and a regular
two-wheel-drive<00:00:15.450> Stampede<00:00:16.230> xl5<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.190> I

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
two-wheel-drive Stampede xl5 is that I

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.760 
two-wheel-drive Stampede xl5 is that I
have<00:00:17.850> an<00:00:17.970> HP<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.390> motor<00:00:18.900> in<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.380> wanted<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
have an HP I motor in and I wanted to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.269 
have an HP I motor in and I wanted to
see<00:00:20.010> how<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.090> ran<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.420> have<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> 2's<00:00:22.320> lipo<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.010> here

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
see how it ran I have a 2's lipo in here

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.000 
see how it ran I have a 2's lipo in here
so<00:00:23.779> still<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> stock<00:00:25.140> servo<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.710> everything

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
so still a stock servo and everything

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.529 
so still a stock servo and everything
else<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> same<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.699> changed<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.330> motor

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
else the same I just changed the motor

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.680 
else the same I just changed the motor
out<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.859> will<00:00:29.039> leave<00:00:29.160> I<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.480> 18<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.599> 19

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.910 

2004<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> few<00:00:33.899> minutes<00:00:34.170> just<00:00:34.380> wanted<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> see

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
2004 a few minutes just wanted to see

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.229 
2004 a few minutes just wanted to see
the<00:00:35.040> difference<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.550> show<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> guys

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the difference to show this to you guys

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:47.840 
the difference to show this to you guys
as<00:00:36.600> well<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:44.989> am<00:00:45.989> using<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.379> different<00:00:46.850> radio

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
as well so I am using a different radio

00:00:47.850 --> 00:01:01.060 
as well so I am using a different radio
so<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.329> kind<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> hard<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.840> me<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> control

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.539 

not<00:01:02.070> running<00:01:02.340> bad<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:04.070> 50<00:01:05.070> turn<00:01:05.280> brush

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
not running bad for a 50 turn brush

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:35.770 
not running bad for a 50 turn brush
motor<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> lipo<00:01:07.040> so

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.999 

it's<00:01:36.780> running<00:01:36.960> real<00:01:37.229> good<00:01:37.259> actually

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:02:47.930 

in<00:01:41.009> my<00:01:41.250> opinion

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.370 

this<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.090> actually<00:02:49.420> running<00:02:49.630> pretty<00:02:49.870> good<00:02:49.990> I'm

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
this is actually running pretty good I'm

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.470 
this is actually running pretty good I'm
impressed<00:02:51.100> with<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.459> running<00:02:51.640> like<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.209> I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
impressed with it running like this I

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.780 
impressed with it running like this I
think<00:02:53.200> it's<00:02:53.380> faster<00:02:53.860> like<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.640> isn't

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
think it's faster like this and it isn't

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
think it's faster like this and it isn't
that<00:02:54.940> tight<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.620> well<00:02:56.620> time<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:59.260> about

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
that tight you well time I'm about

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.290 
that tight you well time I'm about
temperatures<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.220> motor<00:03:00.400> but<00:03:01.030> see<00:03:01.209> how

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
temperatures on the motor but see how

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.710 
temperatures on the motor but see how
hot<00:03:01.540> this<00:03:01.690> thing<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:03.209> we've<00:03:04.209> been<00:03:04.300> running<00:03:04.600> it

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
hot this thing is we've been running it

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.530 
hot this thing is we've been running it
for<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.959> few<00:03:05.140> minutes<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:06.840> do<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.959> finger<00:03:08.200> test

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
for a few minutes but do the finger test

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:24.870 
for a few minutes but do the finger test
now<00:03:10.540> it's<00:03:10.780> fairly<00:03:11.230> warm<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:23.670> guys<00:03:24.670> may<00:03:24.850> be

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
now it's fairly warm so you guys may be

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.840 
now it's fairly warm so you guys may be
asking<00:03:25.330> why<00:03:26.040> rushed<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:29.489> don't<00:03:30.489> know<00:03:30.550> for<00:03:30.700> some

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
asking why rushed I don't know for some

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.850 
asking why rushed I don't know for some
reason<00:03:30.880> I<00:03:31.209> still<00:03:31.450> like<00:03:31.959> running<00:03:32.560> brushed

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
reason I still like running brushed

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.199 
reason I still like running brushed
motors<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.330> brush<00:03:34.989> set<00:03:35.019> up<00:03:35.410> I<00:03:36.190> don't<00:03:37.060> know

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
motors and brush set up I don't know

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.050 
motors and brush set up I don't know
what<00:03:37.300> I<00:03:38.130> think<00:03:39.130> it's<00:03:39.250> kind<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.519> sound<00:03:39.760> of

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
what I think it's kind of the sound of

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.729 
what I think it's kind of the sound of
them<00:03:40.180> just<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.900> way<00:03:40.989> they<00:03:41.110> run<00:03:41.350> it's<00:03:41.560> kind<00:03:41.709> of

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
them just the way they run it's kind of

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.140 
them just the way they run it's kind of
like<00:03:41.860> some<00:03:42.010> people<00:03:42.280> in<00:03:42.340> nitro<00:03:42.730> cars

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
like some people in nitro cars

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.020 
like some people in nitro cars
I<00:03:43.739> mean<00:03:44.739> I'll<00:03:44.860> run<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.130> nitro<00:03:45.519> but<00:03:45.700> some<00:03:45.850> of<00:03:45.940> them

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
I mean I'll run a nitro but some of them

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.220 
I mean I'll run a nitro but some of them
are<00:03:46.090> just<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:46.299> little<00:03:46.480> bit<00:03:46.570> too<00:03:46.720> loud<00:03:46.900> but<00:03:47.140> I

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
are just a little bit too loud but I

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.500 
are just a little bit too loud but I
love<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.500> smell<00:03:47.739> on<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.340> them<00:03:48.459> but<00:03:49.269> for<00:03:49.299> me

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
love the smell on the of them but for me

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.979 
love the smell on the of them but for me
I<00:03:49.630> just<00:03:49.750> love<00:03:50.110> running<00:03:50.410> brushes<00:03:50.920> RC<00:03:51.340> cars

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989
