shooters<00:02:11.470> I'm<00:02:11.950> actually<00:02:12.310> guessing<00:02:13.030> it's

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
shooters I'm actually guessing it's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.509 
shooters I'm actually guessing it's
probably<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.260> ballpark<00:02:14.440> maybe<00:02:15.069> ten<00:02:15.370> to

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
probably in the ballpark maybe ten to

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.009 
probably in the ballpark maybe ten to
fifteen<00:02:15.910> percent<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.569> really<00:02:16.720> not<00:02:16.959> that

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
fifteen percent so it's really not that

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.430 
fifteen percent so it's really not that
great<00:02:17.489> but<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.780> know<00:02:19.900> some<00:02:20.140> people<00:02:20.260> have

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
great but you know some people have

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.900 
great but you know some people have

nobody's mentioned it till now and I'm
actually<00:05:28.870> surprised<00:05:29.469> that<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.740> didn't<00:05:29.949> think

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
actually surprised that I didn't think

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.709 
actually surprised that I didn't think
about<00:05:30.279> it<00:05:30.430> until<00:05:30.610> just<00:05:30.909> a<00:05:31.120> second<00:05:31.539> but<00:05:31.689> I

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
about it until just a second but I

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:35.279 
about it until just a second but I
actually<00:05:31.900> got<00:05:32.080> reminded<00:05:32.939> about<00:05:33.939> that<00:05:34.289> because

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
actually got reminded about that because

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.070 
actually got reminded about that because
a<00:05:35.800> few<00:05:36.219> people<00:05:36.550> had<00:05:36.789> mentioned<00:05:36.939> why<00:05:37.749> is<00:05:37.810> your

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
a few people had mentioned why is your

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.659 
a few people had mentioned why is your
other<00:05:38.229> eye<00:05:38.349> open<00:05:38.949> when<00:05:39.069> you're<00:05:39.189> showing<00:05:39.400> us

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.219 
other eye open when you're showing us
those<00:05:39.849> shooting<00:05:40.240> techniques<00:05:40.689> and<00:05:40.990> I<00:05:41.050> thought

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
those shooting techniques and I thought

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:42.809 
those shooting techniques and I thought
well<00:05:41.499> you<00:05:41.889> know<00:05:41.919> this<00:05:42.159> is<00:05:42.310> something<00:05:42.520> else

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
well you know this is something else

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:44.399 
well you know this is something else
that<00:05:42.909> I<00:05:43.060> bet<00:05:43.360> some<00:05:43.599> people<00:05:43.839> are<00:05:43.930> doing<00:05:44.169> wrong

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
that I bet some people are doing wrong

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.159 
that I bet some people are doing wrong
they're<00:05:45.339> actually<00:05:45.729> shooting<00:05:45.999> a<00:05:46.300> through<00:05:47.139> the

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
they're actually shooting a through the

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:48.749 
they're actually shooting a through the
viewfinder<00:05:47.409> with<00:05:47.860> their<00:05:47.979> non-dominant<00:05:48.400> eye

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
viewfinder with their non-dominant eye

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.379 
viewfinder with their non-dominant eye
