 red monroe 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.170
 the object that fell between 15 hours with 50 minutes and 16 hours after 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.159
 Wednesday in the mountain area to tulancingo hidalgo 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.909
 to activate the rumors of the population that inhabits the area 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:33.010
 its origin 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.140
 the location where it crashed and the consequences it could have 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.700
 according to the testimonies reported by the settlers the authorities 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.740
 municipals of Hidalgo has the hypothesis that the object in its fall 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.380
 drew a line almost horizontally from tulancingo hidalgo 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.510
 to the town of Ahuazotepec in Puebla 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.320
 the distance between the villages is 26 kilometers in a straight line 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.770
 but to get from Tulancingo to Aguas Atepec you have to cross the sierra 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.170
 if something fell in this area it should have stayed in this area 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.940
 for scientists it is about space junk remains of the Russian satellite 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.390
 for others it was a nice one that went through the atmosphere but never touched land 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.200
 the villagers say it was a meteorite and others even say he founded 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.860
 neither 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.320
 So far no one can say with certainty what was 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.700
 nobody found remains of anything or seen the crater or space junk 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.170
 of the Russian satellite 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.999
 but the settlers said that the earth shook and something without agreement 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.760
 according to the traced route 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.620
 the search should start from the hill of the wells just above 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.310
 that place the villagers refer that the fireball exploded and seconds 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.500
 then they felt the small tremor 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.590
 the earth shook but they saw no brightness 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.260
 guadalupe hernández granillo from the castle village on the slopes of the hill 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.040
 the wells and his son jorge aka the skinny 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.799
 they know these mountains like the palm of their hand carlos campón

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 as well as in life or death 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.310
 in 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.510
 I do not know why they saw anything village the thing was clear as for those who 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.980
 efe others this letter gender 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.279
 guadalupe was born here and is 52 years old 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.499
 his father died when he was 10 years old in one of the mines of these hills 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:34.259
 he lives in a stone house with wood and leaves with his 12 children and his wife and 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.749
 his six dogs an equal day and his sheep 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.319
 for guadeloupe what fell if he touched land because it is painless and considers that 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.249
 it was not too far from the wells 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.249
 he thinks it was the hills of it the boy and that's great 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.100
 but to get to it 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.019
 there are no roads and paths you have to walk in the mountains 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.099
 He knows her and wants to know what happened even though he has his own hypothesis

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.869
 efe I hope the rivers 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.299
 I already had an alert of 4 900 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.029
 long ago the nasa 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:11.029
 this can be a true 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.739
 the serrat mass 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.819
 everything ended up spiked so that it was not to hit the famous bullfighters 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.329
 this results 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.819
 the fucking asshole 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.799
 that practically toxic mind 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.799
 the goal 2 and 7 Chinese 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.729
 if it were given 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.729
 piece of cake 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.689
 we walked we climbed trails for more than five hours 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.870
 the first peak that we reach is the one of the valley above the wells rock and 

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:52.319
 guadeloupe distinguishes landslides and possible impacts on the foothills of the 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.590
 and we continue to the place called Corralillo and continue 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:59.589
 to the city of Lyon what 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.499
 from there the other hills are dominated but at sight nothing is seen there is not a 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.340
 great impact neither a visible crater nor remains of Russian satellite of a ship or 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.609
 nick carter 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.840
 the threat of rain and the strong wind force at will to return continue 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.579
 and taking risks would not work 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.800
 similar your authority is with your helicopters the dear to hear of what 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.240
 that's what happened vrae 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.529
 what happens if head 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.999
 p 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:35.110
 tomorrow he will try again tracking canyon by canyon 

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:39.079
 accompanied by his skinny squire who looks like a good one from a chain in the 

00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:39.800
 Mountain range 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.659
 appears on a hill and minutes after this and the other 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.580
 Some residents, such as the Guadalupe family, speculate and fear 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.529
 consequences of the object that fell from space 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.690
 they talk about terms like radiation and athletics 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.499
 and the consequences for them and their livestock 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:59.859
 until Thursday, no state or federal authority would have flown over 

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:00.490
 zone 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.339
 and participated in the search of the object 

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.879
 the certain thing is that the alert diminished when confirming the falsification of the tumors 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.659
 given by local media about the destruction of a bridge of the 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.379
 existence of a crater of 30 meters and damage to houses 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.289
 this time there was no civilian population affected or infrastructure damage 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.699
 but if what streets space junk that as it is claimed that the NASA had already 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.190
 alerted of its fall and about hypothetical zones of affectation in 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:26.129
 Mexico 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.099
 this time it was lucky that this did not become a new tragedy 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:33.990
 more in mexico than those that remain without being investigated and without being persecuted 

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:36.879
 the authorities and the responsible government 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.300
 guadalupe and her extended family know that this time they are saved 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.059
 hehehe get 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.059
 mulled piece of cake
