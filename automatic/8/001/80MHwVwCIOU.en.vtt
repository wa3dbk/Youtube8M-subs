00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
pointed stars I think the biggest reason

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.190 
pointed stars I think the biggest reason
that<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.489> couldn't<00:02:29.670> justify<00:02:29.970> spending<00:02:30.270> $72<00:02:31.080> on

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
that I couldn't justify spending $72 on

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.780 
that I couldn't justify spending $72 on
this<00:02:31.350> at<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.560> time<00:02:31.709> of<00:02:31.860> its<00:02:31.980> release<00:02:32.040> was

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
this at the time of its release was

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.309 
this at the time of its release was
because<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.239> black<00:02:33.480> sleeves<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.170> then

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
because of the black sleeves and then

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.559 
because of the black sleeves and then
the<00:02:34.440> black<00:02:34.800> back<00:02:35.250> no<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.880> not<00:02:36.000> really<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> bad

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
the black back no it's not really a bad

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.030 
the black back no it's not really a bad
thing<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.019> just<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.200> fact<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.650> don't

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
thing it's just the fact that I don't

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.640 
thing it's just the fact that I don't
really<00:02:38.370> think<00:02:38.459> that<00:02:39.180> these<00:02:39.840> like<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.470> all

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
really think that these like kind of all

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.530 
really think that these like kind of all
over<00:02:40.680> print<00:02:41.160> tees<00:02:41.459> when<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:41.819> has<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.269> big

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
over print tees when it has like a big

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.259 
over print tees when it has like a big
pattern<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.380> looks<00:02:43.800> very<00:02:43.920> good<00:02:44.519> when

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
pattern like this looks very good when

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.120 
pattern like this looks very good when
it<00:02:45.630> has<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.170> black<00:02:46.410> back<00:02:46.680> or<00:02:46.890> black

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130

sleeves<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.580> just<00:02:47.730> don't<00:02:48.090> think<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.390> looks

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
sleeves I just don't think it looks

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.150
