every<00:00:19.290> campaign<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.919> gives<00:00:20.220> us<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> chance<00:00:20.610> to

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820

every campaign it gives us a chance to
qualify<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.509> I<00:00:21.900> think<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.919> this<00:00:23.279> campaign

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759
