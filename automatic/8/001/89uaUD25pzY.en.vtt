00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.300
 everyone knows that I hope that 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.560
 you are well found 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.109
 today as every Sunday 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.870
 for a player review so I got 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.820
 said ok you asked me so to do 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.170
 a not very expensive player a player who 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.580
 be good and that change a little bit 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.010
 scorers of the wingers I have 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.720
 used to make ribery gareth style 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.199
 bale of guys who marks all the time 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.359
 goals 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.100
 that's frankly today it's a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.449
 players a little bit special it's up to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.310
 to say that it is not necessarily very expensive 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.599
 he is around 120 credits 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.029
 mines do not exceed 100 thousand 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.289
 credit he loves them to the transferor it changes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.669
 positions of usually I believe that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.280
 it's the same the first word it's 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.680
 of course francesco totti then francesco 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.730
 Totti is frankly it's the legend 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.920
 Italian football 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.050
 good there are others legends of the 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.579
 Italian football but he's here 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.539
 it's everybody knows him he 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.739
 starts to get old it's 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.629
 maybe that's why it's not in 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.620
 fifa but by cons what is it 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.030
 strong in passing and in striking that's gold you 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
 go see we're going directly started 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.239
 with the pliers look at me these two 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.829
 passes for yves barbaut and then there 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.620
 barbeau no problem is no problem 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.320
 but really the pass between limit 10 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.049
 named defenders made the pockets for 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
 francesco totti is a limit stuff 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.409
 basic to him is everyone 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.790
 should make passes like him except 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.890
 that only he knows how to do it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 this kind of passes the corner is 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.299
 exactly the same thing ie 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.890
 that for the corner and 20 his annuity to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.570
 every time look at me this is a little 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 the kayak digs age I get the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 ball absent very low but I 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 find the head if they will put no 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 Mario Balotelli 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.689
 so frankly you're doing a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.290
 not according to a short pass of the centers d 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.790
 corner of the free kicks of the Sanceans 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.200
 coup-francs we discover live all 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 what you want to watch me this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.270
 page if a defender trying to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.329
 cover 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.979
 I 'm doing a little bit of playing stick bam 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.479
 and then goes deep for yves 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.280
 barbaut sense the problem frankly 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.200
 so I advise you to put 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.600
 in words that's and then you put 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.250
 two scorers me g 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.840
 amy so the two scorers it's yves 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.640
 barbaut balotelli you will see my team 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.530
 later but at the same time raise what 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.850
 he is a strong scorer 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.470
 strongly recommend because I 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.670
 testing scorer he lacks speed 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.710
 concretely it lacks speed 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.149
 it's because we just try and 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.729
 moss and it's true that in emotions 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.530
 looking for someone who can do 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.239
 good passes of the very good pass of 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.980
 any distance someone who 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.930
 knows how to hit someone who is not 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.400
 inevitably too zero either in dribbling 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.230
 then to know that he has only two 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.440
 stars in technical gesture but he has 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.959
 still 86 in dribble which allows 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.819
 to still make some hooks his 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.319
 ball driving is just perfect 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.870
 it's nothing to say at the level of his 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.489
 ball driving at the pass level 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.110
 look at me that I'm doing a kind of 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.850
 little asphalt I do not know how 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.830
 is called with the ball goes into 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.540
 depth for yves barbaut yves 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.610
 Barbaut is still cares once 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.100
 really at the pass level this is the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.620
 maestro par excellence at the level of 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.390
 keystrokes sounds what baffe five stars of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.950
 bad foot of course at the level of 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.299
 keystrokes it's a crazy thing and 5 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.880
 stars we find them perfectly 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:55.190
 in this clip that is to say that I have a 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.560
 goes deep it controls at 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.570
 passage he still has 95 years 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.150
 so control under control it's 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.489
 easy for him then I control the 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.850
 right foot I hit a little foot lob 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.549
 left 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.859
 both feet are in this clip and we 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.570
 will see again in slow motion up who right then 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.980
 left it's finished frankly it looks like 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.480
 that it makes people that the guy who does 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.799
 juggling is too easy for him 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.450
 but he is too strong 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.530
 frankly he is too strong balotelli 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.750
 what is he going to do us a beautiful 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.609
 goes deep for totti totti which 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.200
 hit his left foot second time that 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.459
 will go in then I wanted to even if 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.230
 it's a goal a little bit of hook-and-do 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.820
 because the construction is it enough 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.280
 totti who made the construction at 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.910
 departure and who is at the finish this is it 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.320
 I'm looking for 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.019
 look at me totti he's trying to ride 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.630
 even though he only has 53 in speed he 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.370
 happens to make calls from 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.470
 ball which is a little foolish 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.989
 for this player but in any case it's 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.220
 not bad at all so totti that's what 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.319
 he misses you'll understand it's from 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.209
 speed but apart from that it stays 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.209
 a very very good month player really 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.340
 I really really very late and but 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.810
 what to play with him look at that but 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.370
 my nose to counter politicians 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.500
 standing and that's nice 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.180
 what will we do totti hop 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.270
 hop hop 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.220
 bam 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.840
 vim here I have no word limit for 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.790
 describe this purpose, ie there is 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.050
 had a defender in front of me even though he 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.120
 only two stars it's true we do not 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.110
 can not do internal stops and all 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.030
 what we want there are no worries 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.860
 tati does not need that he's good this 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.230
 that I told you in crochet is for 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.670
 that there are 86 dribbles on the map 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.040
 that is, the defender in front of 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.120
 I 'm going to stop myself I'm alone 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.520
 strike and ya goal 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.130
 that's it totti the strength of totti boost 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.010
 that's really it then unlike 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.510
 to the totti totti normal they have on 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.940
 the sides if I'm wrong he's at 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.480
 left him and at the center name you 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.910
 can put it 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.920
 mcm up and scorer but m rise and 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.690
 it's really the control tower it's 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.460
 which must therefore totti him what's 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.260
 will we do the hernane horde that makes 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.270
 the pass for totti there is a defender 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.070
 first defender ban second defender 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.930
 bam third defender there is the 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.820
 go guard the assault then at the level of 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.220
 strike of the left foot of the right foot 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.630
 it makes all the time do not ask you 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.050
 the question is it's foot 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.100
 left 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.680
 what if the right foot because 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.480
 I tried to get off to a good start 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.070
 do not care with totti it's no matter 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.530
 which foot limit with the head that passes 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.880
 also look fake little defender 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.470
 with two stars of technical gesture 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.960
 please hit it 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.670
 between a defender and his small pension 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.110
 net at my team level this is a 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.490
 series team to a team 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.560
 quietly frankly a good 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.330
 team with pop up boost totti 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.950
 how much does that give that gives 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.170
 still 30 games I did with him 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.300
 14 goals so it's not bad for a word 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.280
 his 11 assists really very 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.840
 complete at the level of his stats is 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.430
 true that there are much better stages 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.290
 but frankly I really liked 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.630
 joy with this player this is one of the players 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.160
 frankly the best in a nutshell 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.960
 is that I could test or even the 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.550
 better in a word it's true that dm 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.170
 rise is like that 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.700
 good like that there are not many 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.169
 ie that there are very 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.480
 fast but not necessarily good in 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.310
 striking going on they are good maybe in 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.630
 dribble but me for ramos and I 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.520
 look for the keystroke 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.320
 the pass frankly it's really 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.300
 something interesting and it's this 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.990
 we really find at francesco 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.750
 totti 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.910
 then small positive point small point 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.430
 negative to conclude positive point 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.080
 it's really his typing that goes small 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.870
 hook too even though the 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.650
 that d star unhooked he can do them 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.960
 his vista etc 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.400
 that's without a negative point it's really 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.960
 at the level of the head if he does not resume 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.939
 great thing and also at the level of the 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.379
 very very slow speed but hey I do not 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:20.699
 do not look for it like I wanted to say in 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.219
 Anyway I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.810
 this video I tried to change from 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:26.729
 post like lately I'm doing 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.080
 many goal scorers left down 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:30.539
 or right so that's why 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.889
 francesco totti he likes rise and that's 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.169
 perfect it changes a little bit 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:36.750
 in addition to that you asked me for 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.039
 some to change a little bit of 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.379
 put players a little cheaper 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.750
 francesco totti costs less than 100000 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:44.009
 credit so frankly if you have 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.659
 less than 100 me finally credit to 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.370
 around 100 thousand credit and that 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:49.020
 you want a very good and moss and I 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.120
 you strongly advise it is 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.159
 really very hard try it and say 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.319
 me on twitter how you got it 

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:57.240
 found in any case I hope you 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.919
 enjoyed this video overall 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.870
 do not hesitate to put a thumb to a 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.819
 comment for the next plainview 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.870

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.849

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.279

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:09.629

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:13.460
