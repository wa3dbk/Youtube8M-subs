00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.660
 remember the excitement that we 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 experienced in school when you need to go out 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.950
 before everyone tell a poem or later 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.669
 when you need to protect a diploma before 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.040

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.290
 my knees were shaking and we ate that 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.960
 treacherous fear we will begin now 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.480
 stumble forget everything lose your voice 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 fear before speaking 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.480
 made us walk on endlessly 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.540
 corridors gnaw handles and break 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.120

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.840

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.200
 take sedatives catch your breath now 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.540
 we will learn to do without it for 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
 start let's understand the reason that with 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.790
 we begin to occur during 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.160
 of fear 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:59.190
 we are afraid to screw up at this point the brain 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 gives the adrenal gland a command those scary 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 start producing adrenaline 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.519
 adrenaline is pure energy 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.380
 why hands start shaking 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.329
 walk your knees because 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.609
 the body is trying to put it somewhere 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.439
 energy so that you do not cook in this 

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:15.929
 adrenaline you try this 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.479
 able to run will develop very 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.130
 good speed 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.679
 adrenaline we received as a gift with 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.880
 time immemorial when from the bushes on 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:25.979
 a tiger jumped us 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.869
 adrenaline was produced in a split second 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.130
 which enabled the human 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.770
 body work wonders 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.490
 and now i will tell you how to reverse these 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.670
 processes in the body to their advantage 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.529
 remember 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.399
 on this fear we can do much 

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:44.429
 more than without it we fear what 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.529
 we are now broken of course there is no us 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.079
 the most ancient pores in us sits exactly 

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:50.999
 this fear and here we have adrenaline rush 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.549
 pounded in the blood of the heart we begin 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:55.619
 breathe more often did some deep 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.509
 breaths and jumped out 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.640
 like jump here and not thinking just 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.650
 talk about yourself one two three and all 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.540
 if you are afraid that you yourself can not 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.620
 push out then ask someone to do 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.080
 when you push yourself in public 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.710
 you will no longer be with your clips and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.500
 thoughts 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.930
 and your twin who is filled 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.330
 energy like a motor went into battle 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.790
 with the unknown at this moment 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.070
 adrenaline rush helps you in 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.610
 important first phrase of your submission 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.790

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.310

 places we start important hold out 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.960
 first 10 seconds in a few seconds 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.390
 no one will understand falls or would faint 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.600
 from your own fear or you are very 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.520
 self-confident person even if you 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.400
 understand that now before the public is not 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.740
 you and your artificial image all that you 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.920
 you need it to get a response from the hall 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.980
 and this feedback blocks 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.020
 adrenaline rush and starts producing 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.020
 endorphins we start to enjoy those 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.180

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.160

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.260
 really getting bold 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.260
