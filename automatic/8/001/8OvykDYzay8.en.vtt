00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 - Hi, man! You are the first time in Ukraine, what do you think about our country? .... Just plz let's not talk about traffic jams, but only about the country 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 - Well, while I like the country, here is a cool weather, a cool atmosphere. I really haven't seen much. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 I arrived only this morning, but for now I like everything 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 - Okay. Question about the team that will play here. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 Almost everyone in Russia thinks the guys won't win a single card here, what do you think about the M5 and their new lineup? 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 - I think they are a very good team. They also play much better on LAN, I think people very much underestimate their achievements. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 I think they can beat anyone here. PGG + 4, well, you vkurse)) terrible power 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 - The next question is about the team with which you will play in the semifinals. Team DARER 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 They played with CLG 3 times, and all 3 games lost 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 But after that, they won 22 games in a row. What do you think about their games for the last month, and will the game be hard? 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 - I'm not afraid to play against them, but I know how good they are as a team. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 It will definitely be a very tough match for us, but I believe that we can win 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 We are confident 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 - What about Navi? 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 - Navi, ehh it's hard, this is Navi. They are favorites of the tournament, and it will be very difficult to win them. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 - Talk about your team. We were warned 5 days ago that you will replace Smegle. How much time did you have to spend with new teammates? 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 - We played against coL, and a couple of pubs. 2 days ago we spit almost all day 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 It is clear that this is not enough, but I played with the guys before and I know how they play, so this is not a problem for us at all. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 - Will you play on a difficult line like Smagl, or have you not decided yet? 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 - It depends on the game. I can go to the middle, or on the complex or triple. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 - Next question about EG. What is going on there at all? 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 - Well, we do not yet know ourselves, we have signed contracts and we are trying to find a common language with the organization. I would like to say what will happen, but I really can not yet) 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 - What would you like? Play EG or with a new team, as it was in DDT with Loda, etc. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 - I do not know, I'm glad to be standing. But I'm still an EG player and I will hope that everything will be decided well for the team. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 - Well, the last question is your predictions. Who will win DARER or CLG 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 - CLG of course! 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 - NaVi vs. M5? 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 - Navi! 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 - Well, the final - NaVi vs. CLG? 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 - CLG! 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
 - Easy for you! Okay thank you! Good luck in the tournament!
