 sweet feet love to add sugar 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.259
 because it is not very useful so 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.930

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.829
 nutritious and just my favorite 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.110
 and the next recipe it will be my favorite 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.720
 summer salad and for starters I chop 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.390
 mozzarella and then and sing it in a salad bowl 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.009
 and then I cut enough 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.159
 tomatoes, in principle, this is for your taste 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.320
 and most importantly this hand because I have her 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.090

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.200
 olive oil and sprinkle with salt 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.600
 so that they find a small taste then they just 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.310

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.770

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.539

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.830

 I cut into the milling head or marriage 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.880
 so that they are very very small because 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.940
 that then you will need to mix everything 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.030

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.399

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.259

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.020
