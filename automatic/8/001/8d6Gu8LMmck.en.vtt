00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.720
 everyone finds what comes looking for it in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.480
 who are coming from 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.460
 camaraderie a little bit of escape beyond 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.779
 of their daily lives and is always 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.040
 behind and in the military world with 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.810
 the interest that can provide in terms of 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.150
 human relations a little bit of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.900
 adventure even though it's not always the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.059
 great adventure 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.489
 but here's even a mission too 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.360
 simple and may seem routine 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.460
 of vigipirate 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 we can be a little this sentinel who 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.210
 patrol the city to ensure 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.290
 what is going well in my case 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.300
 staff I am an old 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.360
 acting NCO I made seventeen 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.470
 years of career I made the decision to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.899
 leave for personal reasons 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.370
 because I wanted to do something else 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.079
 now when I found myself 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.860
 in the civilian world I realized 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.129
 that something was missing 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.140
 and so I decided after three years 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.060
 end of activity to hand over the trio 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.270
 last saint lary to be on the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.890
 field with men and live on 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.300
 the ground to have a little bit cold 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.820
 a little bit hungry and then to be a little 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.830
 in the rain it forges the character 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.600
 cohesion it's very important a 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.030
 of course it's going on in the civilian 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.470
 this melting pot a little bit of all 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.229
 social levels all formations 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.929
 all ex activex cultures 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.259
 civic contingent that come when 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:37.160
 never made armed as cape leo 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.160
 it's all an amazing thing 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.060
 I have never been a military activ 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.190
 but I followed the park the course 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.570
 training of what we could 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.330
 call the new reserves 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.800
 so a training in coëtquidan follows a 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 training in application school 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.080
 and then integration into regiment 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.340
 for what is purely military like 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.869
 shooting intervention techniques 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 close operational 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.590
 allow and have good 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.479
 posture when we patrol to know 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.580
 react to an individual who wants 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.200
 take a weapon that assault the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.090
 prerequisites are the same for all 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.300
 activated and reserve soldiers 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.120
 the purpose of the session was to 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.990
 to train staff to progress 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.640
 in urbanized zone 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.410
 so here it is rather a small 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.760
 town 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.340
 so that they take 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.930
 the habit of progressing other parks into 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.700
 under wood or on tracks what we 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.710
 usually does on the camp so the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.330
 medical visits are the same ist these 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.440
 are the same and the workouts well 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.470
 sure are the same since they have to 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.180
 to be able to replace 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.110
 personal activ therefore the training 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.110
 There is no difference 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.080
 we are lucky that our regiment 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.700
 gives a lot of missions this year 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.970
 we start with vigipirate here in 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.830
 province at the same time we take the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.440
 custody of a number of companies 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.900
 sensitive area with small 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.160
 detachments of saint como 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.290
 we have training camps of a 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.340
 week in general twice a year at 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.290
 spring and autumn 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.520
 So the activities it they 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.320
 Spread throughout the year 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.540
 their emissions from the company one is 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.210
 a lot about the discovery of the world 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.670
 military through preparation 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.230
 military discovery the pmd two 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.170
 military preparations for 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.670
 personnel for the brigade or 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.890
 preparations to go then in 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.720
 vigipirate the company planned a 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.000
 complete section in opex 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.490
 it's been a year now since the chance to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.320
 do 4 - of opex in the case of lady in 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.950
 12 in southern Lebanon as an officer 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.950
 communication 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.140
 to reconcile civil life and life 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.000
 military is quite difficult and asks 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.100
 my family's efforts already at the start 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.750
 my wife and my children and also 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.790
 vis-à-vis my employer gymnastics 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.410
 a bit peculiar so it 'll happen to 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.180
 programming is already an element 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.980
 and then after gets to surrender 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.600
 available when needed it's also 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.620
 something that can not be guaranteed 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.620
 but we are trying to do 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.200
 like as in units I am a 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.420
 direct subordinate of my corps leader 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.500
 and I am considered as such at the same 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.840
 title as others how dignity 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.660
 it is at most not to do 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.660
 distinction between managing them between 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.100
 status of reservist and activ a 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.470
 military activated anyway 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.150
 who live on the diet have who trains 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.280
 much more regularly than we do them 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
 reservations it is of course a complement 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.980
 active 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.540
 it is a military activ time 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.070
 partial and that I think it does not take 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.400
 forget it either, we still have 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.760
 some hardcore people in the 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.760
 professional setting
