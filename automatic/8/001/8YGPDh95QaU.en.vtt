lack of trying sometimes games not they
don't<00:01:50.240> get<00:01:50.330> the<00:01:50.479> run<00:01:51.080> of<00:01:51.200> all<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.619> results<00:01:51.950> go

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
don't get the run of all the results go

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.710 
don't get the run of all the results go
against<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:52.820> your<00:01:52.880> confidence<00:01:53.360> will<00:01:53.420> go

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
against you and your confidence will go

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.669 
against you and your confidence will go
so<00:01:54.500> I<00:01:55.070> just<00:01:55.610> think<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.210> know<00:01:56.440> it's<00:01:57.440> hard

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
so I just think that you know it's hard

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.279 
so I just think that you know it's hard
this<00:01:58.250> level<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:58.970> you<00:01:59.509> can<00:01:59.630> come<00:01:59.840> in<00:02:00.050> and

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
this level because you can come in and

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.620 
this level because you can come in and
you<00:02:00.560> know<00:02:00.679> you're<00:02:01.340> new<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.849> game<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:02.300> like

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
you know you're new to the game but like

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.540 
you know you're new to the game but like
the<00:02:02.810> guys<00:02:02.959> on<00:02:03.200> the<00:02:03.229> circuit<00:02:03.770> they<00:02:04.220> shouldn't

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
the guys on the circuit they shouldn't

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.240 
the guys on the circuit they shouldn't
work<00:02:04.729> out<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.000> way<00:02:05.149> that<00:02:05.780> they<00:02:06.619> need<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.979> play<00:02:07.130> to

work out a way that they need to play to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.460 
work out a way that they need to play to
beat<00:02:07.640> you<00:02:07.849> or<00:02:08.270> make<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.720> difficult<00:02:09.020> for<00:02:09.380> you
