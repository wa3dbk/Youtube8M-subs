00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.520
 condiments we have to use them but 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.500
 very moderately if we go over 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.680
 everything will come to us cumin but 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.780
 yes put a little bit, it will highlight all 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.360
 the flavors then put out the fire 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.230
 you're ready let's go to the ovens now 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.560

 very easy, look, it's going to take you two 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.450
 corn toast like these know that 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.340
 the toasts have their true side look 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.700
 let's put them for example if the 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.700
 we put like this this side is the most 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.010
 flat but here if we turn it over it 's 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.590
 a little more concave was going to be able to absorb 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.430
 or will be able to retain more stuffing that is 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.310
 what we want 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.860
