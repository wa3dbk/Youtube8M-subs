doing another ice cream flavor so I got

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.580 
doing another ice cream flavor so I got
a<00:00:08.760> lot<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.059> requests<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.660> do<00:00:09.870> strawberry

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
a lot of requests to do strawberry

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.249 
a lot of requests to do strawberry
cheesecake<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.049> flavor

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
cheesecake and so that is the flavor

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.530 
cheesecake and so that is the flavor
that<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.530> decided<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.370> so<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.389> my

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
that I decided to do so this is my

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.480 
that I decided to do so this is my
perception<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.379> what<00:00:16.440> strawberry<00:00:17.130> cheesecake

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
perception of what strawberry cheesecake

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.420 
perception of what strawberry cheesecake
would<00:00:17.970> look<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.390> in<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.529> opinion<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.400> just

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
would look like in my opinion I just

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.550 
would look like in my opinion I just
thought<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.660> redness<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
thought of the redness from the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.170 
thought of the redness from the
strawberries<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.400> then<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.760> creaminess

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
strawberries and then the creaminess

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.330 
strawberries and then the creaminess
from<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.779> cream<00:00:25.019> cheese<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> cheesecake

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
from the cream cheese in the cheesecake

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.330 
from the cream cheese in the cheesecake
and<00:00:26.539> in<00:00:27.539> my<00:00:27.840> mind<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.320> just<00:00:28.349> came<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.130> this

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and in my mind it just came up with this

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.680 
and in my mind it just came up with this
pastel<00:00:30.380> pink<00:00:31.380> orange<00:00:32.009> kind<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.669> color<00:00:33.000> so

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
pastel pink orange kind of color so

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.690 
pastel pink orange kind of color so
that's<00:00:34.020> basically<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.770> color<00:00:35.070> palette<00:00:35.579> that

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that's basically the color palette that

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.720 
that's basically the color palette that
I<00:00:35.760> went<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.690> this<00:00:37.110> sim<00:00:37.469> also<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.399> my<00:00:38.520> mind

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
I went with for this sim also in my mind

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.729 
I went with for this sim also in my mind
for<00:00:39.000> some<00:00:39.120> reason<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.780> thought<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
for some reason I just thought that a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.979 
for some reason I just thought that a
strawberry<00:00:41.250> cheesecake<00:00:41.309> would<00:00:42.030> look<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.840> of

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
strawberry cheesecake would look kind of

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.069 
strawberry cheesecake would look kind of
a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.410> more<00:00:43.559> mature<00:00:44.600> that's<00:00:45.600> just<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.050> I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
a little more mature that's just what I

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.080 
a little more mature that's just what I
was<00:00:46.320> thinking<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.860> while<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.520> making<00:00:47.700> her

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
was thinking of while I was making her

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.090 
was thinking of while I was making her
so<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.840> just<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> think<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
so this is just what I think the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
so this is just what I think the
strawberry<00:00:50.520> cheesecake<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:51.120> look<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.480> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
strawberry cheesecake would look like so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.560 
strawberry cheesecake would look like so
