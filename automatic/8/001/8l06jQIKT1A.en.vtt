00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
staying inside the baseball this is a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
staying inside the baseball this is a
pitch<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.079> right<00:01:31.409> over<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> play<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.790> may

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909

have<00:01:33.030> started<00:01:33.210> middle<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
have started middle in and I think it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.440 
have started middle in and I think it
was<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> slider<00:01:34.909> but<00:01:35.909> you'll<00:01:36.000> notice<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.299> he

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
was a slider but you'll notice that he

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.700 
was a slider but you'll notice that he
took<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.750> pitch<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.229> up<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> middle<00:01:37.650> he

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
took this pitch right up the middle he

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.050 
took this pitch right up the middle he
