into<00:00:37.739> bigger<00:00:38.070> pools<00:00:38.629> usually<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.960> know

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
into bigger pools usually you know

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049 
into bigger pools usually you know
shallow<00:00:40.350> pools<00:00:40.739> no<00:00:41.040> bigger<00:00:41.250> than<00:00:41.370> 22<00:00:41.910> feet

deep<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.770> hundreds<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.250> gallons<00:00:44.539> they

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
deep and can be hundreds of gallons they

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
deep and can be hundreds of gallons they
get<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> large<00:00:46.020> grow<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.559> rate<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
get a large grow out rate in this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
get a large grow out rate in this
because<00:00:47.760> only<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.210> strong<00:00:48.480> survive<00:00:49.020> because

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
because only the strong survive because

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.900 
because only the strong survive because
they<00:00:49.590> actually<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:49.950> kind<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.550> forget<00:00:50.789> about

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
they actually just kind of forget about

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.100 
they actually just kind of forget about
them<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.420> feed<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:51.780> or<00:00:51.870> anything

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
them they don't feed them or anything

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.240 
them they don't feed them or anything
like<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.289> they<00:00:52.590> let<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.860> live<00:00:53.039> off<00:00:53.219> what

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
like that they let them live off what

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.970 
like that they let them live off what
naturally<00:00:53.940> grows<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.449> water<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.989> any<00:00:55.829> kind

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
water from sit down outside and the alki

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.740 
water from sit down outside and the alki
and<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> environment<00:01:02.120> this<00:01:03.120> works<00:01:03.390> great<00:01:03.480> for

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and the environment this works great for

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.320 
and the environment this works great for
anybody<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.589> warmer<00:01:05.010> climates<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.240> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
anybody in warmer climates up here in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.000 
anybody in warmer climates up here in
Massachusetts<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.290> doesn't<00:01:07.619> work<00:01:07.710> all<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
Massachusetts it doesn't work all that

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.920 
Massachusetts it doesn't work all that
well<00:01:08.070> maybe<00:01:08.700> only<00:01:08.939> two<00:01:09.030> three<00:01:09.479> months<00:01:09.750> out<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
well maybe only two three months out of

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260 
well maybe only two three months out of
the<00:01:10.020> year<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:11.250> even<00:01:11.400> then<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.760> get<00:01:12.030> cold

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the year and even then you get cold

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.060 
the year and even then you get cold
snaps<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> Knights<00:01:13.770> drop

down<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> 50s<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.180> would<00:01:15.540> actually<00:01:15.840> kill

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
down to the 50s and would actually kill

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.060 
down to the 50s and would actually kill
off<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> babies<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.320> we're<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
know amped to do the next breeding

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.940 
know amped to do the next breeding
method<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.990> i'll<00:01:22.110> be<00:01:22.140> showing<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.740> part

method that i'll be showing you in part
three<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.590> poor<00:01:26.070> man's<00:01:26.310> way<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
three which is the poor man's way of

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.060 
three which is the poor man's way of
breeding<00:01:27.000> them<00:01:27.409> but<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.680> also<00:01:28.829> use<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
breeding them but you can also use a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.770 
breeding them but you can also use a
hobbyist<00:01:29.490> way<00:01:29.700> which<00:01:29.909> i<00:01:30.030> went<00:01:30.240> over<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.540> part

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
hobbyist way which i went over in part

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.740 
hobbyist way which i went over in part
one<00:01:31.250> but<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:33.329> i<00:01:33.420> said<00:01:33.479> they<00:01:33.689> just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
one but with this like i said they just

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
one but with this like i said they just
kind<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> throw<00:01:34.320> them<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.130> big<00:01:35.430> ol

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
kind of throw them in you know big ol

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
kind of throw them in you know big ol
shallow<00:01:36.150> pool<00:01:36.540> with<00:01:36.720> some<00:01:36.869> live<00:01:37.079> plan<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.590> let

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
shallow pool with some live plan to let

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.399 
shallow pool with some live plan to let
them<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.420> there<00:01:39.420> actually<00:01:39.630> jarring<00:01:40.259> these

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
them go out there actually jarring these

having the highest success rate for

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.160 
having the highest success rate for
breeding<00:02:08.580> vedas<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.479> they<00:02:09.660> originated

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

couple of days to get my you know to to
start<00:02:47.580> breeding<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.320> i<00:02:49.350> said<00:02:49.440> if<00:02:49.680> you

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
start breeding but like i said if you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.980 
start breeding but like i said if you
live<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:50.070> warmer<00:02:50.370> area<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:51.300> is<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.510> perfect

live in a warmer area this is a perfect
way<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.170> do<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.709> breeding<00:02:53.040> is<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> same

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
way to do it the breeding is the same

they're going to build a bubble nest
wrap<00:02:55.410> around<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.920> mouths<00:02:56.160> gonna<00:02:56.310> wrap<00:02:56.580> around

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
wrap around the mouths gonna wrap around

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.550 
wrap around the mouths gonna wrap around

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
the female you have squeezed the eggs

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.000 
the female you have squeezed the eggs
out<00:02:58.739> fertilize<00:02:59.190> them<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.670> then<00:02:59.790> raise<00:03:00.000> them

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
out fertilize them and then raise them

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.070 
out fertilize them and then raise them
the<00:03:02.010> only<00:03:02.280> major<00:03:02.520> difference<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.959> know

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
the only major difference is you know

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.710 
the only major difference is you know
using<00:03:04.370> not<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> five<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.910> ten<00:03:06.090> gallon<00:03:06.360> tank<00:03:06.570> but

to hold water they use so that's the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.750 
to hold water they use so that's the
only<00:03:15.209> difference<00:03:15.390> as<00:03:15.989> well<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.220> the

only difference as well as the the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
only difference as well as the the
