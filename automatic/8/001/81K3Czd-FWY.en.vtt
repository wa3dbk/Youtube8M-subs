I'm<00:05:03.490> say<00:05:04.290> we<00:05:05.290> gotta<00:05:06.540> like<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.570> breakout<00:05:08.080> cable

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
I'm say we gotta like a breakout cable

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.690 
I'm say we gotta like a breakout cable
HDMI<00:05:10.630> looks<00:05:11.110> like<00:05:14.130> it's<00:05:15.130> like<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.430> little

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
HDMI looks like it's like the little

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.860 
HDMI looks like it's like the little
hdmi<00:05:20.490> what<00:05:21.490> does<00:05:21.610> that<00:05:21.760> go<00:05:21.910> to<00:05:21.970> all<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.540> that

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
hdmi what does that go to all that that

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.309 
hdmi what does that go to all that that
might<00:05:23.050> be<00:05:23.080> a<00:05:23.200> piece<00:05:23.500> for<00:05:25.260> honing<00:05:26.260> in

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.439 

I'm<00:05:30.319> not<00:05:30.469> sure<00:05:30.620> what<00:05:30.770> that<00:05:30.800> cables<00:05:31.219> fork<00:05:31.490> it

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
I'm not sure what that cables fork it

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:40.379 
I'm not sure what that cables fork it
goes

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.870 

connect<00:05:41.389> somehow<00:05:42.070> you<00:05:43.070> got<00:05:43.250> there's<00:05:43.760> a

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
connect somehow you got there's a

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.450 
connect somehow you got there's a
standard<00:05:44.330> HDMI<00:05:46.240> here's<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.950> another<00:05:48.950> component

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
standard HDMI here's a another component

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.770 
standard HDMI here's a another component
like<00:05:49.850> break<00:05:50.150> out<00:05:51.820> and<00:05:52.820> I'm<00:05:52.940> assuming<00:05:53.180> it<00:05:53.480> goes

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
like break out and I'm assuming it goes

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.760 
like break out and I'm assuming it goes
in<00:05:53.870> there<00:05:54.020> is<00:05:54.260> component<00:05:55.010> in<00:05:56.410> I'm<00:05:57.410> guessing

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
in there is component in I'm guessing
