00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:23.740
 I'm actually from kindesbeinen 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.940
 a special love for the stories 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:33.850
 the sacred in words but also 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:36.790
 I'm in the picture and then as a 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.739
 relatively young priest 56 years 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.290
 after the priestly ordination in the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:45.190
 French abbey worry about this old one 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.930
 you got to know it 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.320
 once exactly to these stories of the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.320
 hallow 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:09.040
 Jesus said I came with it 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.040
 you have the life in abundance and 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:22.180
 Traditional religion often happens to us 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:27.760
 complain with something gray boring 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.760
 moralizing impersonal 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.920
 God feels the abundance you can feel 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.369
 I in the liturgy and afra 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.910
 Everywhere the drinks of all 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.979
 we place great value on the 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.890
 church music the gregorianik the year 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.960
 repeated for year and day after day 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.830
 so that one begins the church year too 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.390
 hear 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.380
 organ music, too 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.950
 So the whole thing is contemporary 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.470
 tradition includes the garments of 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.250
 smell of incense some say 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.250
 catholes for air 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.360
 to redeem us is god son human 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.990
 become 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:32.650
 meat accepted and that settles 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:36.550
 in a sense, in the little rites in 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.590
 the so-called outward appearances that way 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.500
 derogatory outward appearances 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.450
 actually called that one 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.790
 be continued meat or if 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.390
 say it the other way around then it is 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.240
 if I'm going to self on that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.240
 face of jesu christ in god 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.660
 glory 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.910
 actually light and shiny for me 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.280
 to lead 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.800
 this light is a danger to me as 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.470
 to blind or weak people 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:13.580
 maybe even burn 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:17.960
 the individual rites tour a church 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.930
 all that surrounds it as such 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.860
 whether to put this glistening light through 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.770
 prism chic and then many but just 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.680
 bearable for the sake of the 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:36.290
 small human-accessible colors 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.900
 has and sees more in these colors 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.330
 when you look at this inaccessible light 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.330
 could take hold here 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:06.180
 First of all is the action of God 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:11.080
 through the church and I have the grace 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.650
 that I, as a devout priest of 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.650
 shares 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.800
 if I'm in the right shape 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.900
 God will approach me 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:36.000
 It is a very different question if I am 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.120
 In this sense, feel subjectively that 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.610
 feeling a conversation with one another 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.160
 with god to conditions 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.020
 but it is not important if I am that 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.300
 I could feel myself too 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.120
 is deceiving but important that it 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.380
 actually happened 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:59.290
 and maybe this for days 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.100
 cultus runs next to me when I am 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:06.730
 God does not feel anything 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.240
 His saving and redemptive salvation 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.240
 act there
