00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
bit of a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.440 
bit of a
not<00:02:13.440> really<00:02:13.680> definition<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.970> sections

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
Marley bright on the front I just 499 I

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.690 
Marley bright on the front I just 499 I
used<00:02:51.569> color<00:02:51.870> number<00:02:52.110> one<00:02:52.530> really<00:02:53.370> doesn't

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
used color number one really doesn't

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.520 
used color number one really doesn't
matter<00:02:53.849> what<00:02:54.180> pack<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.630> get<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.079> brand<00:02:55.380> new

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
matter what pack you get what brand new

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.440 
matter what pack you get what brand new
get<00:02:55.739> but<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.459> did<00:02:56.910> find<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:59.340> brand<00:02:59.879> was<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
get but I did find that this brand was a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.569 
get but I did find that this brand was a
little<00:03:00.959> bit<00:03:01.079> easier<00:03:01.379> when<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.010> cut<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.459> it

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
little bit easier when it cut when it

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.780 
little bit easier when it cut when it
came<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.970> on<00:03:03.150> bussing<00:03:03.870> open<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.489> strands

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
came to on bussing open the the strands

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.009 
came to on bussing open the the strands
of<00:03:05.910> hair<00:03:05.970> because<00:03:06.360> when<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.599> pull<00:03:06.780> them<00:03:06.870> out

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
of hair because when you pull them out

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.670 
of hair because when you pull them out
this<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.500> basically<00:03:08.900> locks<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.110> these<00:03:10.379> and

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
this is basically locks like these and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.069 
this is basically locks like these and
then<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.370> can<00:03:11.579> separate<00:03:12.299> them<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.569> they're

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
then you can separate them so they're

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.270 
then you can separate them so they're
not<00:03:13.319> as<00:03:13.620> thick<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.180> doing<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.930> um<00:03:16.280> that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
not as thick so in doing that um that

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.830 
not as thick so in doing that um that
brand<00:03:17.639> was<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.880> lot<00:03:18.090> easier<00:03:18.120> than<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.690> other

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
brand was a lot easier than the other

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.940 
brand was a lot easier than the other
brand<00:03:19.109> because<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.410> other<00:03:19.500> brain<00:03:19.739> got

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
brand because the other brain got

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.039 
brand because the other brain got
tangled<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:21.209> wasn't<00:03:21.510> really<00:03:21.630> becoming

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
tangled and that wasn't really becoming

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.870 
tangled and that wasn't really becoming
what<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:22.980> was<00:03:23.130> going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.340> tell<00:03:23.519> you<00:03:23.549> guys<00:03:23.700> about

it doesn't tell you about length because

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.750 
it doesn't tell you about length because
it's<00:04:59.320> just<00:04:59.410> bright<00:04:59.800> in<00:04:59.979> here<00:05:00.010> so<00:05:00.430> I<00:05:00.460> can't

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
much not much longer but it was longer

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.480 
much not much longer but it was longer
than<00:05:04.810> that<00:05:05.080> than<00:05:05.470> what<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.710> is<00:05:05.740> right<00:05:05.860> now<00:05:06.070> but

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:10.660 
at the ends just to make it a little bit

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.490 
at the ends just to make it a little bit
more<00:05:10.840> shorter<00:05:11.320> even<00:05:11.889> and<00:05:12.160> not<00:05:12.430> is<00:05:12.699> stringing

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
more shorter even and not is stringing

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.450 
more shorter even and not is stringing
you're<00:05:14.500> always<00:05:14.650> going<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:14.889> have<00:05:14.949> these<00:05:15.190> kind

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
the way it is attached is going to you
