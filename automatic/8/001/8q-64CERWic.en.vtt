00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.460
 hello girls to come let's go mess 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.460
 this is what we are going to do now 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.600
 This is with extras and chain chain 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.670
 Well, as we said in videos 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.430
 previous of any necklace that does not 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.920
 we need or that has been damaged 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:44.039
 some part this same was of 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.000
 of a necklace that led to this but 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:51.870
 let's go like this has lost all the color 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.760
 and less golden I seem to know 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.179
 well, we take advantage of the chains 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.120
 these are the video that we disarm for 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.890
 make the bracelets and the extract and 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.920
 I also have not told you before it is 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.869
 of a belt that I had but we're going 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.939
 if you have a strapless dress or 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.869
 some bag that carries some adornment like this 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.640
 it serves you 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.090
 Well, this one we made in pink 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.700
 with 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.220
 with the extra and the chain 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:26.740
 and is going to use this chain 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.740
 a light brown leather 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.610
 and the extra that the extra is very expensive for 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.040
 at least here in my town I asked 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.740
 what he says in a previous video but 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.980
 good in case you have not seen I asked 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.040
 for the extras and I was dead I do not know if 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.240
 he told me twelve euros the meter I do not know 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.030
 it was 1 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.100
 this is from a belt that I had from 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.189
 when I was a young girl in a suit 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.830
 New Year's Eve and this in the fall that I had 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.320
 the belt you see that brings us close 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.329
 takes a bigger extras here what 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.900
 let's take advantage so that it hangs on us 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.390
 chain 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.210
 how can we also put some 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.700
 cant here hanging but good in 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.210
 what we are going to do is leave the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.520
 final to hang us 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.250
 and we are going to do it exactly 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.340
 just as we have done 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.090
 that we have done this before in the video 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.010
 of before 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.939
 the first 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.500
 we have to join we leave a piece for 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.500
 then do the knot 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.050
 here 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.890
 if you leave 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.020
 does not make 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.200
 come then we put it here between glass 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.990
 and crystal 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.420
 and we are going to make a knot 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.980
 so that it looks good to us well 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.980
 well subject 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.640
 you have to leave more to make the knots 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.460
 well then we adjusted well we tighten 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.190
 all right 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:27.030
 and now that we have to do then nothing 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.030
 and going on let's do it like this 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:36.190
 we went through the chain 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.630
 and we went between glass and glass 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 we turn around from behind 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.170
 I can take it so I can see and better 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.520
 we go through the chain again 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.550
 / crystal and glass 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.300
 the grace is in seeing the chain to 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 the sets 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:15.540
 as I said I hope not stirred 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.540
 we go through the chain again 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:21.019
 that comes out you have to adjust it well to 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.019
 that does not go away 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:30.860
 and we go through him again 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.860
 / crystal and beige glass 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.910
 the next chain 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.670
 there 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:46.820
 Y 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.820
 and the next one between glass and crystal 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.440
 you see how the academician is staying 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.950
 side 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.290
 and the crystals to me I love this 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.870
 Bracelet that I like the most is good 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.490
 we follow 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.490
 Well, we are already finishing 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.810
 we have a couple of chains left 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.810
 Y 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.190
 and we have finished the craft 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:24.500
 / crystal and glass 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.500
 so you see how it looks 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.910
 I love girls in which is the model 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.800
 what I like the most 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:38.550
 I love 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.550
 and now let's make sure 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.300
 simply for that 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.069
 a simple knot 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.970
 we adjust well 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.120
 it's in the back 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.340
 may 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:04.960
 and so it remains 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.840
 ahead 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.139
 and you're going to put the ones that the 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.040
 you see put we will put both the 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.460
 roses 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:20.120
 and the leather 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:24.190
 well, girls, that's how the 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.190
 pink and the one that we just did 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:32.539
 strass leather and chain and if you want 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:34.120
 focus then we would appreciate it 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:38.940
 heap 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:43.600
 me and all of you true 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:46.050
 now and now it looks perfect 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.050
 law 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:55.980
 I love this one is beautiful 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:59.010
 and what I tell you this is hanging 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.440
 as it was the termination here came one 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:04.380
 bigger stays hanging and if not 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.310
 you want the knot to be here so 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:10.410
 you just put a lock and you're done and 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.689
 nothing these are all those that we have not 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.909
 fact 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:16.909
 good the air rising little by little 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.860
 they all stay cool and we go super 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.960
 Fashion 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.569
