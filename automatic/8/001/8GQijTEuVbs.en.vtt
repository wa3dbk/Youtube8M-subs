00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello to all the first session 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.670
 free trial has just unfolded at 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.200
 Bahrain and again it's 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.889
 mercedes which occupies the first two 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 positions 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.840
 hamilton and rosberg jean-louis the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.410
 hierarchy is jostled compared to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.000
 last season 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 yes completely now we see well 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.849
 since the first two grand prizes that 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.590
 mercedes dominates that mercedes to some 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.910
 stocks 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.769
 because we saw that at the last big 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.950
 price red bull renault had reassembled the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.329
 slope and he tells himself that the season will only 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.309
 not easy so far 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.110
 but still she can bring to 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.420
 silver arrows something very 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 concrete what mercedes the parent company 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.140
 has been waiting for a long time 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270
 behind that gets closer we see it 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.129
 there was a lot of aerodynamic work 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.050
 especially at red bull and ferrari 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.789
 yes then work dynamic hero 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.350
 important for several reasons while 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.670
 first there have already been two sessions 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.500
 test in Bahrain four days 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 each during the winter tests 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.649
 this is the first thing the second 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.019
 thing you have to understand that the 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.970
 grand prize will start at dusk 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.860
 but unfold almost in its 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.210
 vast majority of night and that the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.700
 temperature will not be the same 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.490
 the wind will not be the same either 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.650
 wind that today at low price of sand 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.610
 on the track maybe the night of 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.049
 great price it will be different 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.040
 this is the first thing the second 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.100
 thing we made adjustments 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.270
 for one of the few times in history 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.159
 from the scuderia ferrari 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 we saw the famous ferrari d'alonso 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.479
 should still with paint 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.600
 green to show that she was the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.400
 flow chart because in Bahrain there is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.390
 of course difficult curves 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.860
 but there are two very long lines 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.750
 right you must not neglect them because 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970
 this is still do little beyond it 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.060
 must be in the hall the niche of the 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.040
 drs finally we saw red bull proceed to 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.680
 tests that we had rarely seen 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.229
 someone took a so small 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.380
 bell-lemon and steel the top of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.469
 fin 1 ie to improve 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.689
 the top speed of the car and one 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.979
 not reducing support too much 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.600
 aerodynamic back and that's it 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.939
 important because we realized 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.719
 account in Malaysia that with this fin 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.250
 back 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.660
 the red bull was penalized in speed of 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.130
 tip is penalized in top speed 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.950
 it means that you consume good 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.380
 more to keep up the pace and so eh 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.510
 well he I think the decision has some 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.470
 taken to do it and then the first 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.260
 wheel spin showed that it was 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.890
 necessary and well they did not hesitate 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.900
 cutting with chainsaw 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.380
 Jean-Louis there was no the same 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.120
 work at lotus again 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.890
 Roman Grosjean is 19th there on this 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.060
 first practice session yes then the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.560
 change is that they have 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.990
 shot during this first session 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.810
 try to remember that grosjean has 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.770
 makes the whole grand prize in 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.970
 Malaysia 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.290
 so for now we've seen both 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.730
 swamp cars is not quite 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.460
 stop so you know they had to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.750
 work catch up at lotus so me 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.430
 as long as I see cumulative laps 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.140
 I think it's going pretty good 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.910
 jean louis ii always in the french 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.400
 but in the paddock this time there has been 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.170
 reconciliation between jean eric vergne and 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.060
 jules bianchi after their clash of 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.340
 malaysia yes my friend laurent dupin 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.620
 gathered them in front of a channel camera + 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.480
 both I would say almost arm 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.780
 arm in arm and showed that good 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.950
 here is the sphere been forgotten there had been 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.450
 clumsiness on both sides but not 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.950
 bad will in this story 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.810
 you know the racing incidents at 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.700
 start of the races and that's what I 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.230
 reproaches the commissioners of the esta 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.090
 to be too harsh on this 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.450
 About this I close the parenthesis 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.610
 come 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.860
 these glitches and I return well that it did not 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.050
 not started the good mood between jev 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.550
 on one side and jules bianchi on the other and 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.730
 that's it I think they 've tightened the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.740
 hand 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 the air is forgotten we know we have 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.250
 deal with two young people who are broth 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.590
 who absolutely want to show what they 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.820
 good case here it was necessary to stop 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.950
 we put an end to this story 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.050
 everything is settled he smiles one and the other 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.100
 shut up to that she is what she is 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.110
 she really is really 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:49.080
 apparently the Williams team will 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.040
 excused from the Brazilian pilot is this 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.420
 that it's settle this case 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.010
 well listen I believe him because 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.230
 when williams team i'm referring 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.760
 history decided to move from 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.580
 instructions and that we do not respect them 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.040
 generally it rages I want for 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.030
 carlos rotman evidence against alan jones 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.350
 in 1981 well it turned out that 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.790
 carlos rodman disobeyed the grand prize of the 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.810
 brazil did not miss alan jones 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.900
 For victory 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.790
 it was important and well there the stable 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.320
 williams rotten him all his season and 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.739
 rotman was in a position to be champion 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.040
 of the world 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.740
 and the williams stable did nothing to 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.990
 but that was before now we are 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.820
 in a slightly softer period of the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.350
 f1 it's clear williams the daughter of 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.190
 frank williams who holds the reins 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.220
 and actually the instruction to leave 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.390
 to spend botas for massa and is very badly 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.460
 come because anyway 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.810
 well we saw that the williams do not 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.590
 could not exceed the mercedes mclaren 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.970
 from Boston 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.400
 so it was a bit silly this 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.560
 story there and that's where we saw that 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.390
 the team apologized to massa 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.220
 for giving instructions a little a 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.520
 little weird and why not an old 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.630
 can 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.800
 it must be said things as they are 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.230
 now it's the doctor era 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.000
 williams who is a very young woman 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.770
 nice that I know well and that he 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.240
 preferred to flatten the situation too 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.130
 along the gema this is to have 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.570
 the experience of massa botha if it is 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.060
 in his first season so he can 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.910
 take a step back on the sphere on 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.590
 is still out of this great Bahraini prize 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.760
 I envy we have a thought for michael 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.560
 schumacher apparently there are some 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.450
 improvements on his state of health 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.310
 Well listen everybody made 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.290
 glosses about michael's state of health 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.270
 schumacher which is very annoying very 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.070
 annoying and that makes me feel sorry for 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.930
 the great champion he was there is 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.430
 sabine kehm who speaks 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.770
 sabine kehm we started together 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.210
 almost in the press rooms she 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.860
 worked for various and his attached 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.660
 for a long time and she tells us 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.160
 gives news that are rather 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.100
 encouraging and that we can 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.690
 believe he has waking moments he has 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.310
 moments a little bit of consciousness 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.630
 so that's maybe going to go in 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.740
 improving in any case must cross 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.540
 fingers 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.840
 jean-louis to finish you have a small 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.940
 wink to switch to ducks more yes 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.220
 so look at the drees that appear 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.480
 and although it is on a Julian side 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.420
 febreau jacques villeneuve 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.600
 for commentators 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.370
 of the canal + f1 or geraldine and me 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.370
 not where jean-philippe geraldine and me 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.740
 the bus blog on my blog eh 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.020
 well we had a little parody 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.480
 very nice from duck more and 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.010
 who is quite funny and look at this link 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.690
 go from one end to the other of the six 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.050
 minutes it's very fun in all 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.050
 the situations
