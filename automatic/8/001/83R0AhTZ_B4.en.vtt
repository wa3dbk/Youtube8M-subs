the overdrive channel there's two

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
the overdrive channel there's two
channels<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.239> two<00:01:03.359> different<00:01:03.600> voicings

there's a gain and level for each one of
course<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.930> switch<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.320> each<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.650> as<00:01:07.770> well

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.789 

in<00:01:42.729> addition<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.179> have<00:01:43.210> three<00:01:44.020> bands<00:01:44.200> of<00:01:44.409> EQ

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
in addition you have three bands of EQ

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.399 
in addition you have three bands of EQ
bass<00:01:45.310> mid<00:01:45.759> and<00:01:45.880> treble<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.840> ISF<00:01:47.289> to

bass mid and treble and the ISF to

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.749 
bass mid and treble and the ISF to
control<00:01:47.649> which<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:47.799> very<00:01:47.920> important<00:01:48.429> of<00:01:48.549> black

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
control which is very important of black

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.209 
control which is very important of black
star<00:01:48.969> amplifiers<00:01:49.439> when<00:01:50.439> it's<00:01:50.560> rotated<00:01:50.920> to<00:01:51.069> the

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
star amplifiers when it's rotated to the

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.309 
star amplifiers when it's rotated to the
when<00:01:51.759> it's<00:01:51.880> counter<00:01:52.210> clockwise<00:01:52.509> or

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
when it's counter clockwise or

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.240 
when it's counter clockwise or
anti-clockwise

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
anti-clockwise

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.999 
anti-clockwise
it's<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.420> USA<00:01:55.810> direction<00:01:56.289> it<00:01:56.409> shifts<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.799> tone

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
it's the USA direction it shifts a tone

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.209 
it's the USA direction it shifts a tone
stack<00:01:57.789> so<00:01:58.060> it's<00:01:58.179> more<00:01:58.329> like<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.539> USA<00:01:59.530> type<00:02:00.069> of

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
stack so it's more like a USA type of

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.880 
stack so it's more like a USA type of
amplifier<00:02:00.369> when<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.880> goes<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.890> clockwise

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
amplifier when it goes to the clockwise

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.240 
amplifier when it goes to the clockwise
direction<00:02:03.729> it's<00:02:04.359> more<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:04.719> UK<00:02:05.020> style<00:02:05.349> so<00:02:05.770> the

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
direction it's more the UK style so the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.729 
direction it's more the UK style so the
mid<00:02:06.399> ranges<00:02:06.759> are<00:02:06.939> shifted<00:02:07.299> up<00:02:07.420> two<00:02:07.780> octaves<00:02:07.929> so

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
mid ranges are shifted up two octaves so

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.690 
mid ranges are shifted up two octaves so
it<00:02:08.799> makes<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.979> big<00:02:09.009> difference<00:02:09.129> so<00:02:09.519> if<00:02:09.610> I'm

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
it makes a big difference so if I'm

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.580 
it makes a big difference so if I'm
using<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.000> overdrive<00:02:10.390> again<00:02:10.660> and<00:02:11.049> I<00:02:11.170> let<00:02:11.379> Paul

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
using the overdrive again and I let Paul

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:28.200 
using the overdrive again and I let Paul
switch<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:12.400> ISF<00:02:13.000> from<00:02:13.239> anti-clockwise

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.570 

you

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.310 

we'll<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.640> right<00:02:32.790> along<00:02:33.030> we<00:02:33.570> have<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.990> reverb

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
we'll be right along we have the reverb

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.960

same sounds if you mics up the count a

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.990 
same sounds if you mics up the count a

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
really useful feature and what you're

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.610 
really useful feature and what you're
hearing<00:03:33.150> right<00:03:33.240> now<00:03:33.360> on<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.900> track<00:03:34.410> is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
hearing right now on the track is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.440 
hearing right now on the track is
actually<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.040> 412<00:03:35.520> voicing<00:03:35.910> as<00:03:36.209> Jay

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
actually the 412 voicing as Jay

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.760 
actually the 412 voicing as Jay
mentioned<00:03:36.480> earlier<00:03:37.080> there's<00:03:37.350> the<00:03:37.440> reverb

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
mentioned earlier there's the reverb

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.500 
mentioned earlier there's the reverb
dark<00:03:38.100> light<00:03:38.370> switch<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.300> switch

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
dark light switch so you can switch

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.090 
dark light switch so you can switch
between<00:03:39.660> two<00:03:39.990> different<00:03:40.170> voicings<00:03:40.740> on<00:03:40.980> the

reverb and is also a theory's effects
loop<00:03:44.310> as<00:03:44.520> well<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:44.940> can<00:03:45.030> add<00:03:45.150> additional

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
loop as well so you can add additional

during<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.420> demo<00:03:48.720> is<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.080> foot<00:03:49.260> switch

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
during the demo is the foot switch

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.050 
during the demo is the foot switch
pretty<00:03:50.130> straightforward<00:03:50.610> is<00:03:50.730> clean

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
pretty straightforward is clean

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.180 
pretty straightforward is clean
overdrive<00:03:51.660> one<00:03:51.900> overdrive<00:03:52.500> 2<00:03:52.740> and<00:03:52.980> then

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
overdrive one overdrive 2 and then

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.640 
overdrive one overdrive 2 and then
reverb<00:03:53.550> there's<00:03:54.540> also<00:03:54.750> one<00:03:55.020> more<00:03:55.170> switch<00:03:55.440> over

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
reverb there's also one more switch over

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.230 
reverb there's also one more switch over
here<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.830> can<00:03:55.920> plug<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.310> with<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.490> FS<00:03:57.000> for
