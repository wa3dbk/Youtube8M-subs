got a whole new mission yeah you're
absolutely<00:00:49.870> right<00:00:50.200> only<00:00:50.770> 30<00:00:51.160> minutes<00:00:51.370> away

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
absolutely right only 30 minutes away

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.979 
absolutely right only 30 minutes away
from<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.940> strip<00:00:52.210> we're<00:00:52.450> up<00:00:52.510> in<00:00:52.629> this<00:00:52.750> Alpine

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
from the strip we're up in this Alpine

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.200 
from the strip we're up in this Alpine
area<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:53.800> it<00:00:54.129> really<00:00:54.430> does<00:00:54.610> come<00:00:54.820> with<00:00:54.970> a<00:00:55.059> lot

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
area and it really does come with a lot

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.520 
area and it really does come with a lot
of<00:00:55.239> different<00:00:55.480> challenges<00:00:55.780> than<00:00:56.260> the<00:00:56.379> urban

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
of different challenges than the urban

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.280 
of different challenges than the urban
setting<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:57.730> wildland<00:00:58.210> interface<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:59.050> we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
setting the wildland interface is we

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.780 
setting the wildland interface is we
were<00:00:59.379> talking<00:00:59.739> earlier<00:00:59.860> is<00:01:00.190> kind<00:01:00.610> of<00:01:00.700> your

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
were talking earlier is kind of your

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.390 
were talking earlier is kind of your
main<00:01:00.970> challenge<00:01:01.480> up<00:01:01.629> here<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.100> we're<00:01:03.100> talking

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
main challenge up here and we're talking

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.359 
main challenge up here and we're talking
about<00:01:03.490> -<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.660> main<00:01:04.979> attack<00:01:05.979> mode<00:01:06.220> you

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
about - the the main attack mode you

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:07.800 
about - the the main attack mode you
have<00:01:06.430> your<00:01:06.729> mobile<00:01:06.940> attack<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:07.600> then<00:01:07.690> your

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
have your mobile attack and then your

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.540 
have your mobile attack and then your
hand<00:01:07.990> cruise<00:01:08.290> tell<00:01:08.890> me<00:01:09.009> about<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.280> mobile

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
hand cruise tell me about the mobile

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.020 
hand cruise tell me about the mobile
attack

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
attack

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.940 
attack
well<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.420> mobile<00:01:10.690> attack<00:01:10.960> is<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.259> rather

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
well the mobile attack is a rather

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.740 
well the mobile attack is a rather
simple<00:01:12.460> you<00:01:12.940> know<00:01:13.030> equip<00:01:13.360> wildland

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
simple you know equip wildland

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.359 
simple you know equip wildland
firefighters<00:01:14.380> with<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.619> vehicle<00:01:15.160> that<00:01:15.250> has

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
firefighters with a vehicle that has

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.249 
firefighters with a vehicle that has
pump<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.759> roll<00:01:15.880> capabilities<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:17.080> usually

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
pump and roll capabilities it's usually

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.520 
pump and roll capabilities it's usually
a<00:01:17.470> smaller<00:01:17.830> engine<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.310> type<00:01:18.550> 6<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:20.290> what<00:01:20.410> we

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
a smaller engine a type 6 it's what we

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.080 
a smaller engine a type 6 it's what we
typically<00:01:20.890> use<00:01:20.979> up<00:01:21.340> here<00:01:21.520> for<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.850> type<00:01:22.060> of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
typically use up here for that type of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.020 
typically use up here for that type of
operation<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:23.410> nozzle<00:01:23.860> Minh<00:01:23.979> stands<00:01:24.610> not<00:01:24.790> too

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
operation the nozzle Minh stands not too

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.180 
operation the nozzle Minh stands not too
far<00:01:25.270> off<00:01:25.300> of<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.660> front<00:01:25.840> bumper<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.290> envision

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
far off of the front bumper and envision

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.219 
far off of the front bumper and envision
of<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.550> driver<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.330> they<00:01:28.690> move<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.020> real

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
of the driver and they move it a real

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.290 
of the driver and they move it a real
slow<00:01:29.590> pace<00:01:29.890> with<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.250> coordinated<00:01:30.790> effort<00:01:30.880> and

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
slow pace with a coordinated effort and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.870 
slow pace with a coordinated effort and
they<00:01:31.810> suppress<00:01:32.170> fire<00:01:32.440> along<00:01:32.830> roadsides<00:01:33.250> or

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
they suppress fire along roadsides or

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.850 
they suppress fire along roadsides or
fire<00:01:34.210> breaks<00:01:34.479> things<00:01:34.690> like<00:01:34.900> that<00:01:35.110> all<00:01:35.710> right

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
fire breaks things like that all right

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.680 
fire breaks things like that all right
so<00:01:36.250> then<00:01:36.400> then<00:01:36.820> we<00:01:36.970> talk<00:01:37.120> about<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.450> hand

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
so then then we talk about the hand

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.170 
so then then we talk about the hand
crews<00:01:37.990> and<00:01:38.320> I'm<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:38.950> structural<00:01:39.310> guy<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:39.909> it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
crews and I'm a structural guy so it

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.480 
crews and I'm a structural guy so it
it's<00:01:40.900> kind<00:01:41.110> of<00:01:41.170> counterintuitive<00:01:41.710> for<00:01:42.370> me

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
it's kind of counterintuitive for me

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.760 
it's kind of counterintuitive for me
that<00:01:42.700> a<00:01:42.880> lot<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.810> what<00:01:43.930> these<00:01:44.020> guys<00:01:44.080> do<00:01:44.530> has

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
that a lot of what these guys do has

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.380 
that a lot of what these guys do has
nothing<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.159> do<00:01:45.340> with<00:01:45.430> putting<00:01:45.640> water<00:01:45.940> on<00:01:46.030> fire

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
nothing to do with putting water on fire

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.780 
nothing to do with putting water on fire
and<00:01:46.570> then<00:01:46.690> that's<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.080> hand<00:01:47.290> crews<00:01:47.790> you're

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
and then that's the hand crews you're

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.240 
and then that's the hand crews you're
right<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.330> hand<00:01:49.840> crews<00:01:50.080> essentially<00:01:50.860> remove

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
right the hand crews essentially remove

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.030 
right the hand crews essentially remove
fuel<00:01:51.549> putting<00:01:52.330> in<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.630> fuel<00:01:52.960> type<00:01:53.619> brakes

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
fuel putting in the fuel type brakes

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.910 
fuel putting in the fuel type brakes
what<00:01:54.610> we<00:01:54.729> call<00:01:54.940> fire<00:01:55.540> line<00:01:55.810> and<00:01:56.110> with<00:01:56.680> hand

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
what we call fire line and with hand

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.109 
what we call fire line and with hand
crews<00:01:57.040> do<00:01:57.250> we<00:01:57.430> call<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.729> hand<00:01:57.909> line

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
crews do we call it hand line

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.630 
crews do we call it hand line
essentially<00:01:58.840> it's<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.260> one<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.130> a<00:02:00.159> half<00:02:00.340> times

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
essentially it's a one and a half times

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.850 
essentially it's a one and a half times
the<00:02:00.760> height<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.119> fuel<00:02:01.420> fuel<00:02:02.200> brake<00:02:02.500> and<00:02:02.740> it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
the height of the fuel fuel brake and it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.530 
the height of the fuel fuel brake and it
removes<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.520> fuel<00:02:03.760> keeps<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.210> from<00:02:04.330> burning

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
removes the fuel keeps it from burning

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.719 
removes the fuel keeps it from burning
what<00:02:04.990> people<00:02:05.290> don't<00:02:05.470> often<00:02:05.710> realize<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.520> that

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
what people don't often realize is that

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.030 
what people don't often realize is that
hand<00:02:07.450> crews<00:02:07.810> are<00:02:08.140> kind<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.769> cornerstone

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
hand crews are kind of the cornerstone

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.490 
hand crews are kind of the cornerstone
putting<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.119> hand<00:02:10.390> line<00:02:10.630> that's<00:02:10.929> that's

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
putting in hand line that's that's

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.280 
putting in hand line that's that's
essentially<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.280> way<00:02:12.400> that<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:13.110> stop<00:02:14.110> the

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
essentially the way that we stop the

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.780 
essentially the way that we stop the
fires<00:02:14.500> from<00:02:14.680> growing<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.280> eventually<00:02:15.430> put

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
fires from growing and we eventually put

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.850 
fires from growing and we eventually put
them<00:02:15.880> out<00:02:16.000> watching<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.720> guys<00:02:16.900> work<00:02:17.200> today<00:02:17.500> it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
them out watching the guys work today it

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.070 
them out watching the guys work today it
kind<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.549> struck<00:02:18.820> me<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.180> everybody<00:02:19.720> had<00:02:20.049> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
kind of struck me that everybody had a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.350 
kind of struck me that everybody had a
specific<00:02:20.320> task<00:02:20.830> they<00:02:21.670> were<00:02:21.730> lined<00:02:22.000> up<00:02:22.150> they

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
specific task they were lined up they

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.970 
specific task they were lined up they
were<00:02:22.420> doing<00:02:22.780> their<00:02:22.930> thing<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.350> what's<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
were doing their thing and what's the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.009 
were doing their thing and what's the
different<00:02:24.280> tools<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.700> then<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
different tools and then the just the

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.569 
different tools and then the just the
juxtaposition<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.860> order<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.370> tool

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
juxtaposition of the order of the tool

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.970 
juxtaposition of the order of the tool
and<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.910> line<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.390> find<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.260> easiest<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.709> think

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
and the line I find it easiest to think

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.729 
and the line I find it easiest to think
of<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.370> sharpest<00:02:30.910> tools<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.480> front<00:02:31.959> going

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
of the sharpest tools up front going

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.979 
of the sharpest tools up front going
back<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.459> less<00:02:33.820> sharp<00:02:34.120> or<00:02:34.360> dollar<00:02:34.630> tools

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
back to the less sharp or dollar tools

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.270 
back to the less sharp or dollar tools
towards<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:35.950> rear<00:02:36.299> chainsaws

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
towards the rear chainsaws

Pulaski's<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.520> have<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.970> an<00:02:40.120> axe<00:02:40.360> like

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
Pulaski's that have like an axe like

Pulaski's that have like an axe like
head<00:02:40.930> on<00:02:41.080> them<00:02:41.230> for<00:02:41.770> cutting<00:02:41.980> there<00:02:42.610> they'd<00:02:42.880> be

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
head on them for cutting there they'd be

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.350 
head on them for cutting there they'd be
up

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
up

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.470 
up
the<00:02:43.420> front<00:02:43.750> they<00:02:43.990> be<00:02:44.050> taking<00:02:44.680> down<00:02:44.830> whatever

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the front they be taking down whatever

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.060 
the front they be taking down whatever
vegetation<00:02:46.480> needs<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.750> come<00:02:46.930> down<00:02:46.960> as<00:02:47.650> far<00:02:47.950> as

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
vegetation needs to come down as far as

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.250 
vegetation needs to come down as far as
cutting<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:49.000> work<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.330> way<00:02:49.360> back<00:02:49.690> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
cutting as you work your way back the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.650 
cutting as you work your way back the
shovels<00:02:50.800> maybe<00:02:51.460> even<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.760> combination<00:02:52.420> tool

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
shovels maybe even a combination tool

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.360 
shovels maybe even a combination tool
would<00:02:53.230> be<00:02:53.290> somewhere<00:02:53.740> in<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.890> middle<00:02:53.950> and

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
would be somewhere in the middle and

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.280 
would be somewhere in the middle and
then<00:02:54.730> eventually<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.210> scraping<00:02:55.600> type<00:02:55.960> tool

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
then eventually a scraping type tool

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.440 
then eventually a scraping type tool
like<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> McCloud<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.400> they're<00:02:58.000> literally

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
like the McCloud and they're literally

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.940 
like the McCloud and they're literally
just<00:02:58.660> scraping<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.320> fuel<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.710> getting<00:02:59.920> a

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
just scraping the fuel and getting a

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.570 
just scraping the fuel and getting a
nice<00:03:00.480> dirt<00:03:01.480> path<00:03:01.950> absolutely<00:03:02.950> down<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.340> good

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
nice dirt path absolutely down to good

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
a you know decomposed vegetation it's

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.730 
a you know decomposed vegetation it's
right<00:03:10.360> down<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.720> that<00:03:10.870> mineral<00:03:11.260> soil<00:03:11.530> that's

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
right down to that mineral soil that's

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.920 
right down to that mineral soil that's
the<00:03:11.890> best<00:03:12.130> line<00:03:12.280> the<00:03:12.640> other<00:03:12.670> thing<00:03:13.090> watching

got to be in good shape
you're<00:03:18.370> right<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:19.180> takes<00:03:19.450> sometimes<00:03:20.290> two

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
you're right it takes sometimes two

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.680 
you're right it takes sometimes two
