00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.120 

and<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:16.340> don't<00:01:16.760> have<00:01:17.090> one<00:01:17.120> but<00:01:17.630> if<00:01:17.870> you<00:01:18.110> do<00:01:18.410> try

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
and I don't have one but if you do try

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.970 
and I don't have one but if you do try
to<00:01:19.190> use<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:19.840> cookie<00:01:20.840> sheet<00:01:21.080> without<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.710> rims

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
to use a cookie sheet without the rims

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.280 
to use a cookie sheet without the rims
like<00:01:22.430> just<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.790> flat<00:01:23.030> ones<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:23.600> didn't<00:01:24.110> have

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
like just the flat ones I didn't have

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.530 
like just the flat ones I didn't have
any<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:24.830> got<00:01:25.190> a<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.670> know<00:01:25.790> work<00:01:26.210> with<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:26.510> I

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
any so I got a you know work with what I

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.900 
any so I got a you know work with what I
got<00:01:26.810> but<00:01:27.470> if<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:27.770> do<00:01:27.950> have<00:01:28.160> that<00:01:28.190> I<00:01:28.610> would

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
got but if you do have that I would

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.450 
got but if you do have that I would
definitely<00:01:29.390> suggest<00:01:29.630> using<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:30.860> instead<00:01:31.370> of

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
definitely suggest using that instead of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.600 
definitely suggest using that instead of
one<00:01:31.640> with<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:31.910> rims<00:01:32.890> so<00:01:33.890> I'm<00:01:34.130> just<00:01:34.370> very

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
one with the rims so I'm just very

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.420 
one with the rims so I'm just very
carefully<00:01:35.020> rolling<00:01:36.020> out<00:01:36.410> my<00:01:36.680> crescent<00:01:37.250> rolls

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
carefully rolling out my crescent rolls

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.540 
carefully rolling out my crescent rolls
to<00:01:37.670> form<00:01:37.910> an<00:01:38.030> even<00:01:38.270> at<00:01:38.570> layer<00:01:38.870> and<00:01:39.350> also<00:01:40.220> we're

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
to form an even at layer and also we're

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.480 
to form an even at layer and also we're
going<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:41.120> pinch<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.110> scenes<00:01:42.560> together<00:01:42.860> so

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
going to pinch the scenes together so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.380 
going to pinch the scenes together so
that<00:01:43.700> everything<00:01:44.120> is<00:01:44.330> together<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:47.240> could

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
that everything is together you could

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.900 
that everything is together you could
also<00:01:47.600> use<00:01:48.140> I<00:01:48.410> think<00:01:48.680> they<00:01:48.800> make<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.250> crescent

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
also use I think they make the crescent

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.690 
also use I think they make the crescent
roll<00:01:50.090> or<00:01:50.510> Pillsbury<00:01:51.229> makes<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.830> ones<00:01:52.370> where

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
roll or Pillsbury makes the ones where

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700 
roll or Pillsbury makes the ones where
it's<00:01:52.940> just<00:01:53.150> like<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.360> crust<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.170> it's<00:01:54.530> not

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's just like a crust and it's not

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.710 
it's just like a crust and it's not
crescent<00:01:55.160> rolls<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.030> could<00:01:56.240> also<00:01:56.420> use

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
crescent rolls so you could also use

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.500 
crescent rolls so you could also use
that<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.229> couldn't<00:01:57.560> find<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:58.010> so<00:01:58.330> you<00:01:59.330> know<00:01:59.450> you

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
that I couldn't find it so you know you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.560 
that I couldn't find it so you know you
just<00:01:59.690> gotta<00:01:59.960> use<00:02:00.170> what<00:02:00.410> you<00:02:00.560> got<00:02:02.020> okay<00:02:04.570> now

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
just gotta use what you got okay now

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.630 
just gotta use what you got okay now
what<00:02:05.900> I'm<00:02:05.990> gonna<00:02:06.140> do<00:02:06.440> is<00:02:06.740> stick<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.280> back

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
what I'm gonna do is stick this back

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.120 
what I'm gonna do is stick this back
into<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> fridge<00:02:08.450> while<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.869> melt<00:02:09.410> our<00:02:09.679> chart

into the fridge while we melt our chart

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.890 
into the fridge while we melt our chart

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
that you can kind of see where it's a

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.930 
that you can kind of see where it's a
cut<00:04:42.230> okay<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:44.280> after<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.640> make<00:04:44.760> your

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
cut okay so after you make your

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
indentions if you want to do that then

00:04:47.910 --> 00:05:02.799 
indentions if you want to do that then

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 
right over the top and like I said

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.670 
right over the top and like I said
earlier<00:07:16.920> I<00:07:17.160> got<00:07:17.430> this<00:07:17.730> in<00:07:18.060> the<00:07:18.420> cake<00:07:18.900> section

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
earlier I got this in the cake section

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.540 
earlier I got this in the cake section
the<00:07:20.040> box<00:07:20.250> cake<00:07:20.610> mixes<00:07:21.470> at<00:07:22.470> Walmart<00:07:22.920> so<00:07:23.250> it

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550 
the box cake mixes at Walmart so it

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.150 
the box cake mixes at Walmart so it
should<00:07:23.730> be<00:07:23.850> near<00:07:24.480> the<00:07:24.840> icings<00:07:25.350> and<00:07:25.650> stuff<00:07:26.010> like

should be near the icings and stuff like
that<00:07:26.310> and<00:07:26.610> I<00:07:27.390> think<00:07:27.600> they<00:07:27.690> also<00:07:27.900> have<00:07:28.050> like

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410
