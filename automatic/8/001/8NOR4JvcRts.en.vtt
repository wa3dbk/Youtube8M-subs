here's a good view at the 50 foot span
of<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.259> fence<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.740> we're<00:01:34.890> gonna<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> my

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
of this fence that we're gonna do and my

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
of this fence that we're gonna do and my
intention<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.079> we'll<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.500> five<00:01:37.890> feet<00:01:38.250> in

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
intention is that we'll go five feet in

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
intention is that we'll go five feet in
from<00:01:39.000> each<00:01:39.240> corner<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.320> plant<00:01:40.590> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
from each corner to plant the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.380 
from each corner to plant the
blueberries<00:01:41.280> that'll<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.790> end<00:01:42.060> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
blueberries that'll be on the end and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.960 
blueberries that'll be on the end and
then<00:01:42.960> from<00:01:43.590> those<00:01:43.890> two<00:01:44.189> points<00:01:44.460> we'll<00:01:44.790> find

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
then from those two points we'll find

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.179 
then from those two points we'll find
the<00:01:45.060> middle<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.689> 20<00:01:46.259> feet<00:01:46.530> at<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.740> point

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the middle so 20 feet at that point

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.149 
the middle so 20 feet at that point
between<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.960> plant<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.009> other

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
between the two and plant the other

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.510 
between the two and plant the other
blueberry<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.409> space<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> distance

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
blueberry and then to space the distance

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.149 
blueberry and then to space the distance
between<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.079> blueberries<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:55.950> go

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
between all the blueberries if we go

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.719 
between all the blueberries if we go
about<00:01:56.909> 6<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.570> 2/3<00:01:58.140> foot<00:01:58.619> we'll<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> able<00:01:59.549> to

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
about 6 and 2/3 foot we'll be able to

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.330 
about 6 and 2/3 foot we'll be able to
plant<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.450> raspberry<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.680> grapes<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
plant the raspberry and the grapes and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
plant the raspberry and the grapes and
that<00:02:02.399> way<00:02:02.759> each<00:02:02.969> plant<00:02:03.329> will<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.479> evenly

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that way each plant will be evenly

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:15.520 
that way each plant will be evenly
spaced<00:02:04.320> throughout<00:02:04.740> this

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.600 

okay<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.590> that's<00:02:16.860> gonna<00:02:16.980> be<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.280> end<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.490> this

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
okay so that's gonna be the end of this

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.790 
okay so that's gonna be the end of this
project<00:02:17.910> for<00:02:18.209> now<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.660> you<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.959> see<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.680> I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
project for now as you can see like I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.310 
project for now as you can see like I
said<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> first<00:02:20.670> plant<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.240> 5<00:02:21.510> foot<00:02:21.840> from<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
said the first plant is 5 foot from the

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.900 
said the first plant is 5 foot from the
edge<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.730> from<00:02:24.060> there<00:02:24.709> every<00:02:25.709> 6<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.280> 2/3

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
edge and then from there every 6 and 2/3

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.250 
edge and then from there every 6 and 2/3
feet<00:02:28.190> going<00:02:29.190> down<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.700> length<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.180> defense<00:02:31.580> as

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
feet going down the length of defense as

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.210 
feet going down the length of defense as
most<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.560> are<00:02:34.650> aware<00:02:34.740> they've<00:02:35.100> been

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
most of you are aware they've been

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.590 
most of you are aware they've been
following<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> channel<00:02:35.940> we<00:02:36.180> do<00:02:36.360> have

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
following the channel we do have

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.290 
following the channel we do have
free-range<00:02:37.200> rabbits<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.250> that's<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:39.120> you're

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
free-range rabbits so that's what you're

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.500 
free-range rabbits so that's what you're
noticing<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.989> with<00:02:40.140> these<00:02:40.230> cages<00:02:40.830> if<00:02:41.510> you

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
noticing here with these cages if you

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.240 
noticing here with these cages if you
did<00:02:42.750> not<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> concern<00:02:43.709> with<00:02:43.739> small

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
did not have a concern with small

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.250 
did not have a concern with small
animals<00:02:44.730> trying<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.209> take<00:02:45.540> out<00:02:45.720> your<00:02:45.900> plants

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
animals trying to take out your plants

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.600 
animals trying to take out your plants
that<00:02:46.380> are<00:02:46.500> developing<00:02:46.980> then<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.250> might<00:02:47.430> not

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
that are developing then you might not

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.330 
that are developing then you might not
have<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.940> take<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.270> extra<00:02:48.630> step<00:02:48.780> if<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.310> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
have to take that extra step if it was a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.820 
have to take that extra step if it was a
grapevine<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:51.900> fencing<00:02:52.290> material<00:02:52.410> on

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
grapevine we put fencing material on

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.550 
grapevine we put fencing material on
both<00:02:53.100> sides<00:02:53.520> if<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> raspberry<00:02:55.440> or

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
both sides if it is a raspberry or

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.440 
both sides if it is a raspberry or
blueberry<00:02:56.130> then<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.550> put<00:02:56.790> fencing<00:02:57.270> just

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
blueberry then we put fencing just

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.840 
blueberry then we put fencing just
around<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.959> entire<00:02:58.380> plant<00:02:58.830> because<00:02:59.519> we<00:02:59.640> feel

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
around the entire plant because we feel

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.820 
around the entire plant because we feel
we'll<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.150> able<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.420> take<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.870> fencing

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
we'll be able to take the fencing

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.540 
we'll be able to take the fencing
material<00:03:01.950> off<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.150> plant<00:03:04.280> before<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> gets

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
material off the plant before it gets

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.520 
material off the plant before it gets
too<00:03:05.880> big<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.630> plant<00:03:06.870> would<00:03:06.959> still<00:03:07.170> be<00:03:07.290> big

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
too big and the plant would still be big

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.000 
too big and the plant would still be big
enough<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.850> withstand<00:03:08.850> any<00:03:09.440> small<00:03:10.440> eating<00:03:10.860> off

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
enough to withstand any small eating off

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.620 
enough to withstand any small eating off
the<00:03:11.190> bottom<00:03:11.489> branches<00:03:11.880> by<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.720> rabbits<00:03:13.140> so

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
the bottom branches by the rabbits so

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.970 
the bottom branches by the rabbits so
we'll<00:03:15.630> let<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.930> know<00:03:16.019> how<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.320> progresses

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
we'll let you know how this progresses

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.430 
we'll let you know how this progresses
over<00:03:17.130> time<00:03:17.340> obviously<00:03:17.970> this<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> permanent

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
over time obviously this is a permanent

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.259 
over time obviously this is a permanent
planting<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.370> it'll<00:03:20.610> be<00:03:20.670> something<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.150> watch

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
planting so it'll be something to watch

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.420 
planting so it'll be something to watch
for<00:03:21.959> years<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.320> come<00:03:22.440> thank<00:03:23.160> y'all<00:03:23.310> for

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
for years to come thank y'all for

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.690 
for years to come thank y'all for
