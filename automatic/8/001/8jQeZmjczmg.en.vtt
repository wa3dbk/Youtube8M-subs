middle<00:02:12.890> bottom<00:02:15.320> top<00:02:16.320> centered<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.390> on

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
middle bottom top centered and so on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.350 
middle bottom top centered and so on
okay<00:02:19.620> I'm<00:02:19.710> going<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.920> go<00:02:20.040> back<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.280> top<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.910> can

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
okay I'm going to go back to top I can

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.460 
okay I'm going to go back to top I can
also<00:02:21.510> choose<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.960> text<00:02:22.730> direction<00:02:24.350> text<00:02:25.350> by

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
also choose the text direction text by

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.650 
also choose the text direction text by
default<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:25.980> horizontal<00:02:26.610> but<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.240> can<00:02:27.420> change

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
default is horizontal but I can change

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.680 
default is horizontal but I can change
it<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.930> rotate<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> by<00:02:29.370> 90<00:02:29.400> degrees<00:02:32.450> rotate<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
it to rotate it by 90 degrees rotate to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.580 
it to rotate it by 90 degrees rotate to
70<00:02:34.640> okay<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:36.390> won't<00:02:36.570> use<00:02:36.750> these<00:02:36.960> often<00:02:37.230> but

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
70 okay you won't use these often but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.620 
70 okay you won't use these often but
sometimes<00:02:38.100> especially<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.670> tables<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
sometimes especially on tables and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.770 
sometimes especially on tables and
charts<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.920> comes<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.370> handy<00:02:41.400> or<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.540> can<00:02:42.660> do

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
charts this comes in handy or you can do

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.320 
charts this comes in handy or you can do
something<00:02:42.990> called<00:02:43.140> stacking<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.250> text<00:02:44.670> now

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
something called stacking the text now

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860 
something called stacking the text now
in<00:02:45.690> an<00:02:45.810> example<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.320> I've<00:02:46.620> got<00:02:46.830> here<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:48.690> will

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
in an example like I've got here it will

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.410 
in an example like I've got here it will
be<00:02:48.990> hard<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.260> see<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.709> stacked<00:02:50.250> example<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.270> let

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
be hard to see a stacked example so let

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.970 
be hard to see a stacked example so let
me<00:02:51.510> create<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.870> new<00:02:51.990> slide<00:02:52.290> here<00:02:52.680> I'm<00:02:52.800> going<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
me create a new slide here I'm going to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.730 
me create a new slide here I'm going to
open<00:02:53.100> my<00:02:53.280> own<00:02:53.430> tab<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.480> create<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.050> new<00:02:55.290> blank

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
open my own tab and create a new blank

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.460 
open my own tab and create a new blank
slide<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.550> nothing<00:02:56.910> on<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.660> I'm<00:02:58.290> going

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
slide with nothing on it and I'm going

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.500 
slide with nothing on it and I'm going
to<00:02:58.560> use<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.709> shape<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.970> I'll<00:03:00.120> insert<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:01.430> shape

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
to use a shape so I'll insert a shape

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.740 
to use a shape so I'll insert a shape
let's<00:03:03.510> use<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.959> rounded<00:03:04.440> corner<00:03:04.950> rectangle

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
let's use the rounded corner rectangle

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.000 
let's use the rounded corner rectangle
and<00:03:06.750> I'll<00:03:07.050> just<00:03:07.260> type<00:03:07.470> some<00:03:07.740> text<00:03:07.770> on<00:03:08.340> here

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
and I'll just type some text on here

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.370 
and I'll just type some text on here
okay<00:03:11.010> that's<00:03:11.370> good<00:03:11.580> enough<00:03:11.660> now<00:03:12.660> let's<00:03:13.200> go

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
okay that's good enough now let's go

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.400 
okay that's good enough now let's go
ahead<00:03:13.650> select<00:03:14.160> this<00:03:14.519> container<00:03:15.000> go<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.930> text

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
ahead select this container go to text

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.600 
ahead select this container go to text
options<00:03:17.090> back<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.300> our<00:03:18.420> control<00:03:18.870> box<00:03:19.050> and<00:03:19.650> I'll

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
options back to our control box and I'll

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.470 
options back to our control box and I'll
show<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:20.850> what<00:03:21.090> stacked<00:03:21.450> text<00:03:22.019> looks<00:03:22.320> like

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
show you what stacked text looks like

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.360 
show you what stacked text looks like
okay<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:25.350> my<00:03:25.530> container<00:03:25.980> we're<00:03:26.190> big

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
okay and if my container we're big

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.340 
okay and if my container we're big
enough<00:03:26.580> it<00:03:27.360> would<00:03:27.480> be<00:03:27.660> stacked<00:03:27.959> horizontally

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
enough it would be stacked horizontally

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.340 
enough it would be stacked horizontally
like<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.690> okay<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:32.220> go<00:03:32.370> back<00:03:32.580> to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
like that okay I can go back to

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.380 
like that okay I can go back to
horizontal<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:35.040> that's<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:35.910> idea<00:03:36.180> with

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
horizontal and that's the idea with

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.500 
horizontal and that's the idea with
stacked<00:03:36.720> text<00:03:37.530> notice<00:03:38.489> also<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.120> control

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
stacked text notice also you can control

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.009 
stacked text notice also you can control
the<00:03:39.690> margins<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> text<00:03:41.190> here<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:42.019> also

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
the margins of the text here and also

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.960 
the margins of the text here and also
whether<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.590> wraps<00:03:43.890> or<00:03:44.190> not<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.820> can

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
whether it wraps or not and you can

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.390 
whether it wraps or not and you can
create<00:03:45.209> columns<00:03:45.959> on<00:03:46.290> objects<00:03:47.040> or<00:03:47.220> within

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
create columns on objects or within

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.320 
create columns on objects or within
containers

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
containers

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.740 
containers
use<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.930> all<00:03:49.110> with<00:03:49.350> using<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.799> text<00:03:50.459> box

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
use it all with using this text box

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.110 
use it all with using this text box
control<00:03:51.750> panel<00:03:52.320> okay<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.670> that's<00:03:53.850> just<00:03:54.030> a

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
control panel okay so that's just a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.380 
control panel okay so that's just a
quick<00:03:54.299> video<00:03:54.600> on<00:03:54.870> how<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.350> control<00:03:55.709> that

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
quick video on how to control that

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.800 
quick video on how to control that
thanks<00:03:57.390> for<00:03:57.420> listening
