00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 and if he really looks at it later 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.380
 television and it was not what I saw in the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.780
 court 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.360
 are the court is a very long pitch 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.360
 from behind half-court where the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.980
 ball seemed to be lost by the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.560
 background 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.980
 I see a mutual clash of hills with the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.449
 archer and randy to me what me too 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.020
 it confuses me is that none touch the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.050
 ball then as with much that 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.420
 normal but good it was not like that after 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.790
 unfortunately observing the image in 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.920
 television for me is the clear criminal 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.079
 Y 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.969
 and good are those things that we have in 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.980
 that fraction of a second to say and 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.690
 well there I had won when I see the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.680
 picture on television I see that pink 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.940
 I think it was more 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.130
 planted in the play and the one that arrives and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.410
 is to highlight this to be said because 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.239
 the work beyond the caves that to 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.520
 Sometimes they are clear and sometimes a little 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.710
 more doubtful is good too 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.540
 recognize us when you make a mistake 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.050
 it does not happen very often in you 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.510
 the referee german 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.960
 I do not know if it also serves a lot because 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.150
 Sometimes the same people stay with that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 one harmed him and he can not walk either 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.590
 leaving to apologize every time 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.570
 that there is a situation also for 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.330
 example was claimed a goal from outside the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.330
 game we cancel and we're seeing it now 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 we are seeing that there is from behind the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.620
 arch with a camera is that there not 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.960
 we are the body of wind 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:42.360
 is from the side profile is more 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:47.540
 forward is impossible either for good or 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 it is not the only way you can see 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.240
 there is nobody then there are exceptions that 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.940
 happens that same I'm not talking 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.190
 superclassic the plays were yes ni se 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.940
 see nothing but from the side where 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.790
 there is no there is not and there are and titanic 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:09.660
 maidana this one was coming back is almost from 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.209
 the corner or since it pink then 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.260
 they are very fine things and it is 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.260
 My situation is very 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.920
 unfortunately I believe that until the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.780
 same players on the court I think 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.050
 that it is something hill that felt the blow 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.910
 and I think it's passion for being an archer 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.400
 because in a moment they were 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 attending to do it I saw that it was 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.370
 half of court like asking him for a game 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.870
 that comes close I think that's your boat 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.940
 he understood that it was criminal and you can the rest 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.040
 not from the players because not because 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.470
 it really seems like a shock at the moment 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.150
 but not after clearly that which 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.680
 is closer to the hill of the ball and 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.600
 the one who is late 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.050
 it's good this is good for me that 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.760
 not only the referees every 20 big 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.890
 society when you commit a 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.540
 mistake is good to recognize more 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.570
 the head as it is and good reaches the 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.910
 rational people may not reach you 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.620
 this one but he talked about this play of the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.230
 superclassic and weaves a little 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.989
 superclÃ¡sico that you saw as to 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.470
 to the arbitration of pitana and the triple 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.390
 because they talk about that play of being 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.940
 lanzini ends in a corner kick 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.400
 up also from the forward position 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.450
 of teo on the first goal of river that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.069
 you saw under german not me 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.630
 maybe one is not very objective but to me 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.190
 I loved it 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.650
 in original work in superclassics 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.780
 I had the chance to see it whole that 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.750
 sometimes to one for family question it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.230
 they are complicated but are good to have 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.480
 some situation that are television 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.390
 millimeter as loteo is the speed 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.910
 of the game 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.090
 imperceptible recontra is more until there is 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.700
 an image that show that the ball 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.500
 when the for an image is not in the 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.890
 foot since the pass comes out but a 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.930
 little bit later and then she 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.930
 change from where the position is taken 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.810
 of theophilus and then I return to the same thing what 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.370
 of cornell like this nor perceptible 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.260
 it seems to me that this one is fine what it is 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.709
 what Augustine does also recognizing 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.359
 his mistake 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.669
 obviously he also feels like 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.430
 one surrounds and but but it is also done 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.180
 charge on your part that that's good and 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.400
 it also happened to me I feel that 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.479
 in the statement also from the people of 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.919
 racing 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.830
 for example the case of flies or 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.400
 valley that are also successful he says 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.110
 that we can not overcome and good not 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.090
 let's make sandra a goal but nothing more 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.590
 that just emphasizes it seems to me that 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.000
 it's fine after you talk about your team 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.030
 of the things that you have to correct that 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.460
 we have to keep working but we do not 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.840
 remark much more than that I think 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.930
 very well that they do well 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.910
 statements to focus 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.560
 only that you can an arbitration error 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.570
 but but there are other issues that 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.639
 you also have to analyze of course 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.130
 german thank you for serving us as 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:03.830
 It's always a pleasure to chat like kitty 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.070
 because this week 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.140
 it's really weekdays I'm 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.970
 appointed to the liberators cup so 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.610
 I'm going to chile a very nice shared 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:16.330
 with the ub chile with cruzeiro on Thursday 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.190
 very well so mentalized now 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:23.860
 after this bad drink this bad taste 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:29.120
 which unfortunately lasts because you 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:31.400
 think this happens but when 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.890
 it is all night machine costs you 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.780
 sleep see the play on Sunday at 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.200
 night the same because nothing copper because 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.670
 why do not I stop a little bit more 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.160
 cost to make the right decision 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.050
 then one works your head 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.630
 saying why because I think these 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.990
 mistakes as well as the one that I had to this 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.150
 level is you have to try not to have it 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.020
 they are rude after other things 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.870
 they are are acceptable but what I 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.060
 I feel that rude and good 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.190
 I hope I do not happen again because they are 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.800
 two timely and very clear plays and 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:10.390
 It hurts, it hurts a lot more than 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.390
 any other situation
