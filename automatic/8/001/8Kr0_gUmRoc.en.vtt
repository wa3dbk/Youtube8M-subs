a<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.220> intense<00:01:48.079> contraction<00:01:49.079> now<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:50.070> began

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
a really intense contraction now I began

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
a really intense contraction now I began
to<00:01:50.700> workout<00:01:51.000> with<00:01:51.030> dumbbell<00:01:51.750> flyes<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
to workout with dumbbell flyes not so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.039 
to workout with dumbbell flyes not so
much<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> way<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.329> pre-exhaust<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> pecs<00:01:54.810> as

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
much as a way to pre-exhaust the pecs as

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.389 
much as a way to pre-exhaust the pecs as
it<00:01:55.590> is<00:01:55.740> as<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.290> enhance<00:01:58.290> my<00:01:58.530> mind<00:01:58.829> muscle

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it is as a way to enhance my mind muscle

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.520 
it is as a way to enhance my mind muscle
connection<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.360> slowing<00:02:01.259> down

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
connection so I'm really slowing down

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.429 
connection so I'm really slowing down
the<00:02:01.740> tempo<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.430> want<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.790> feel<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:04.049> pecs

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
the tempo here I want to feel the pecs

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.389 
the tempo here I want to feel the pecs
stretching<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> way<00:02:05.700> down<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.180> really

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
stretching on the way down and really

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.160 
stretching on the way down and really
exaggerate<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> contraction<00:02:09.479> on<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.750> way<00:02:09.899> up

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
exaggerate the contraction on the way up

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.540 
exaggerate the contraction on the way up
so<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.190> using<00:02:11.670> this<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> get

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
so really just using this to get

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.790 
so really just using this to get
my<00:02:12.640> mind<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.480> muscle<00:02:13.780> carrying<00:02:14.350> over<00:02:14.500> to

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
my mind in the muscle carrying over to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.800 
my mind in the muscle carrying over to
these<00:02:14.920> next<00:02:15.250> exercises<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.420> now<00:02:16.570> we're<00:02:16.720> moving

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
these next exercises so now we're moving

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.230 
these next exercises so now we're moving
on<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.080> some<00:02:17.410> incline<00:02:17.830> chest<00:02:18.190> pressing<00:02:18.670> we're

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
on to some incline chest pressing we're

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.630 
on to some incline chest pressing we're

bars that we're pushing up this one has
two<00:02:33.640> different<00:02:33.820> grips<00:02:34.330> I'm<00:02:34.930> using<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.620> kind

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
two different grips I'm using this kind

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.030 
two different grips I'm using this kind
of<00:02:36.220> neutral<00:02:36.580> grip<00:02:37.060> for<00:02:37.270> the<00:02:37.300> first<00:02:37.690> set<00:02:38.200> I

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
of neutral grip for the first set I

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.770 
of neutral grip for the first set I
definitely<00:02:39.760> feel<00:02:39.910> that<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.240> takes<00:02:40.540> my

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
definitely feel that it takes my

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.950 
definitely feel that it takes my
shoulders<00:02:41.500> out<00:02:41.710> of<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.010> movement<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.550> if<00:02:42.850> you

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
shoulders out of the movement and if you

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.100 
shoulders out of the movement and if you
look<00:02:43.960> at<00:02:44.080> my<00:02:44.200> chest<00:02:44.470> here<00:02:44.710> it<00:02:44.830> looks<00:02:45.160> like<00:02:45.310> it's

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
look at my chest here it looks like it's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.270 
look at my chest here it looks like it's
contracting<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.260> little<00:02:47.500> bit<00:02:47.620> more<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.950> elbows

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
contracting a little bit more the elbows

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.520 
contracting a little bit more the elbows
are<00:02:48.310> staying<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.910> little<00:02:49.330> bit<00:02:49.480> closer<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
are staying a little bit closer to the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.080 
are staying a little bit closer to the
body<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.360> all<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.840> think<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.620> takes<00:02:53.920> my<00:02:54.700> my

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
body all in all I think it takes my my

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.270 
body all in all I think it takes my my
shoulders<00:02:55.600> out<00:02:55.840> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.230> movement<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.800> bit<00:02:57.100> more

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
shoulders out of the movement a bit more

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.600 
shoulders out of the movement a bit more
and<00:02:57.430> maybe<00:02:57.610> my<00:02:57.970> triceps<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.840> little<00:02:58.870> bit<00:02:59.610> over

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
and maybe my triceps a little bit over

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.390 
and maybe my triceps a little bit over
the<00:03:00.730> movement<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:01.450> well<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:02.770> really<00:03:03.220> liked

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
the movement as well so I really liked

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.010 
the movement as well so I really liked
it<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.670> liked<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:03.880> way<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.180> neutral<00:03:04.480> grip<00:03:04.630> felt

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
it I liked the way the neutral grip felt

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.730 
it I liked the way the neutral grip felt
and<00:03:05.290> then<00:03:05.980> after<00:03:06.640> resting<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.360> 90<00:03:08.050> seconds<00:03:08.530> I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
and then after resting for 90 seconds I

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.930 
and then after resting for 90 seconds I
used<00:03:09.100> the<00:03:09.520> wider<00:03:10.180> grip<00:03:10.960> or<00:03:11.610> palms<00:03:12.610> facing

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
used the wider grip or palms facing

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.680 
used the wider grip or palms facing
forward<00:03:13.120> here<00:03:13.960> and<00:03:14.220> I<00:03:15.220> feel<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.060> actually<00:03:16.360> I

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
forward here and I feel that actually I

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.570 
forward here and I feel that actually I
think<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.930> prefer<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.530> much<00:03:17.770> better<00:03:17.980> I<00:03:18.100> feel<00:03:18.370> a

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
think I prefer this much better I feel a

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.780 
think I prefer this much better I feel a
better<00:03:19.050> stretch<00:03:20.050> in<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.830> bottom<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.430> the

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
better stretch in the bottom and the

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.810 
better stretch in the bottom and the
contraction<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.630> still<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:24.130> pretty<00:03:24.459> intense

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
contraction is still it's pretty intense

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.640 
contraction is still it's pretty intense
so<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.090> think<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.690> stretch<00:03:25.959> is<00:03:26.110> better<00:03:26.290> here

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
so I think the stretch is better here

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.740 
so I think the stretch is better here
but<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.610> contraction<00:03:28.239> portion<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.690> the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
but the contraction portion of the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.360 
but the contraction portion of the
movement<00:03:28.900> felt<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.350> little<00:03:29.500> bit<00:03:29.680> better<00:03:29.860> with

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
movement felt a little bit better with

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.979 
movement felt a little bit better with
the<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.940> neutral<00:03:31.239> grip<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.600> I'm<00:03:31.720> still<00:03:31.959> a

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
the the neutral grip so I'm still a

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.510 
the the neutral grip so I'm still a
little<00:03:32.320> bit<00:03:32.500> undecided<00:03:32.860> I'm<00:03:33.220> gonna<00:03:33.340> play

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
little bit undecided I'm gonna play

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.760 
little bit undecided I'm gonna play
around<00:03:33.790> one<00:03:33.970> more<00:03:34.090> time<00:03:34.150> next<00:03:34.840> week<00:03:35.020> just<00:03:35.620> to

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
around one more time next week just to

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.030 
around one more time next week just to
feel<00:03:36.150> which<00:03:37.150> one<00:03:37.510> takes<00:03:37.870> my<00:03:38.020> triceps<00:03:38.650> out<00:03:38.890> of

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
feel which one takes my triceps out of

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.850 
feel which one takes my triceps out of
it<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.220> most<00:03:39.310> which<00:03:39.580> one<00:03:39.790> steers<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:41.230> my

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
it the most which one steers that my

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.590 
it the most which one steers that my
neural<00:03:42.220> Drive<00:03:42.520> towards<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.000> pecs<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.360> really

making me laugh that prick but this was
a<00:06:22.650> great<00:06:23.040> way<00:06:23.220> to<00:06:23.250> finish<00:06:23.490> off<00:06:23.730> this<00:06:23.910> is

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
a great way to finish off this is

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.900 
a great way to finish off this is
high-volume<00:06:25.140> and<00:06:25.590> I<00:06:25.650> mean<00:06:25.800> it's<00:06:26.070> it's<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.580> lot

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
high-volume and I mean it's it's a lot

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.820 
high-volume and I mean it's it's a lot

may<00:06:28.950> think<00:06:29.160> it's<00:06:29.280> overkill<00:06:29.820> we<00:06:30.600> don't<00:06:30.870> do<00:06:31.080> this

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
may think it's overkill we don't do this

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.530 
may think it's overkill we don't do this
too<00:06:31.620> often<00:06:31.980> this<00:06:32.400> kind<00:06:32.580> of<00:06:32.700> volume<00:06:32.940> and<00:06:33.270> it's<00:06:33.450> a
