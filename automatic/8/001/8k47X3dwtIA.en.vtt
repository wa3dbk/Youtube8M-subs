00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
seemed like they were gonna be a good

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.430 
seemed like they were gonna be a good
idea<00:01:13.760> when<00:01:14.060> I<00:01:14.120> got<00:01:14.300> them<00:01:14.480> they<00:01:14.630> were<00:01:14.720> cut<00:01:14.900> well

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
idea when I got them they were cut well

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.840 
idea when I got them they were cut well
they<00:01:15.590> were<00:01:15.680> very<00:01:15.860> tight<00:01:16.250> but<00:01:16.460> as<00:01:16.550> you<00:01:16.700> guys

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
they were very tight but as you guys

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.280 
they were very tight but as you guys
know<00:01:16.880> whenever<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.480> get<00:01:17.630> braids<00:01:17.930> they're

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
know whenever you get braids they're

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.530 
know whenever you get braids they're
always<00:01:18.440> tight<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.640> first<00:01:19.880> few<00:01:20.030> days<00:01:20.210> anyway

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
always tight the first few days anyway

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.800 
always tight the first few days anyway
so<00:01:21.160> I<00:01:22.160> figured<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.120> would<00:01:23.210> be<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.480> big<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.720> a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
so I figured that would be that big of a

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.440 
so I figured that would be that big of a
deal<00:01:24.190> so<00:01:25.190> when<00:01:25.370> I<00:01:25.430> went<00:01:25.610> on<00:01:25.670> vacation<00:01:26.270> we

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
deal so when I went on vacation we

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.590 
deal so when I went on vacation we
actually<00:01:26.780> went<00:01:26.900> on<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.080> charter<00:01:27.470> bus<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:28.600> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
actually went on a charter bus and the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.060 
actually went on a charter bus and the
first<00:01:29.840> regret<00:01:30.110> I<00:01:30.260> had<00:01:30.410> started<00:01:30.590> having<00:01:30.920> about

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
first regret I had started having about

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.580 
first regret I had started having about
the<00:01:31.220> Brady<00:01:31.460> who<00:01:31.640> said<00:01:31.820> they<00:01:31.910> were<00:01:32.030> very

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
the Brady who said they were very

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
the Brady who said they were very
uncomfortable<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.770> was<00:01:33.800> hard<00:01:34.100> for<00:01:34.250> me<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.490> get

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
uncomfortable it was hard for me to get

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.790 
uncomfortable it was hard for me to get
comfortable<00:01:35.030> hard<00:01:35.480> to<00:01:35.690> sleep<00:01:35.990> because<00:01:36.440> of<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
comfortable hard to sleep because of the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.680 
comfortable hard to sleep because of the
way<00:01:36.890> that<00:01:37.010> they<00:01:37.130> were<00:01:37.190> graded<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:38.210> was<00:01:38.420> tight

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
all either so those were the reason why

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.750

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
then when I took him out I really was

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.870

1,000<00:03:56.870> micrograms<00:03:59.050> right<00:04:00.050> here<00:04:00.230> or<00:04:00.530> 5,000

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
1,000 micrograms right here or 5,000

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.970 
1,000 micrograms right here or 5,000
micrograms<00:04:01.940> I<00:04:02.330> got<00:04:02.780> the<00:04:02.900> 1000<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.709> blitz

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
micrograms I got the 1000 a blitz

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.010 
micrograms I got the 1000 a blitz
because<00:04:04.370> with<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.209> can<00:04:05.240> either<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.870> can

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
because with this you can either you can

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.110 
because with this you can either you can
take<00:04:06.230> one<00:04:06.800> tablet<00:04:07.040> at<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.400> time<00:04:07.640> but<00:04:07.850> you<00:04:08.000> can

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
take one tablet at a time but you can

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.690 
take one tablet at a time but you can
take<00:04:08.270> it<00:04:08.480> between<00:04:09.350> one<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.920> five<00:04:10.130> times<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.550> day

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
take it between one to five times a day

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.350 
take it between one to five times a day
so<00:04:10.760> I<00:04:11.030> figured<00:04:11.980> my<00:04:12.980> hair<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:13.580> for<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.120> most

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
so I figured my hair it's for the most

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.300 
so I figured my hair it's for the most
part<00:04:14.510> still<00:04:14.780> healthy<00:04:15.080> so<00:04:15.800> I<00:04:15.860> didn't<00:04:16.100> think<00:04:16.190> I

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
part still healthy so I didn't think I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.030 
part still healthy so I didn't think I
really<00:04:16.549> needed<00:04:16.760> five<00:04:17.000> thousand<00:04:17.590> so<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.650> figure

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
really needed five thousand so I figure

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.570 
really needed five thousand so I figure
I<00:04:19.220> just<00:04:19.609> get<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.299> 1000<00:04:20.980> tablets<00:04:21.980> in<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.220> end<00:04:22.400> I

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
I just get the 1000 tablets in the end I

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.100 
I just get the 1000 tablets in the end I
could<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.150> take<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.450> up<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.630> five<00:04:23.780> times<00:04:23.810> a

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
could just take it up to five times a

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.870 
could just take it up to five times a
day<00:04:24.200> if<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.350> needed<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.710> but<00:04:25.340> right<00:04:25.520> now<00:04:25.640> I<00:04:25.670> take

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
day if I needed to but right now I take

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.250 
day if I needed to but right now I take
it<00:04:26.060> once<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.390> morning<00:04:26.690> once<00:04:26.840> at<00:04:26.930> night<00:04:26.990> so

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
it once the morning once at night so

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.200 
it once the morning once at night so
i'll<00:04:27.350> take<00:04:27.560> two<00:04:27.740> thousand<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.190> day<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.640> i<00:04:29.000> feel

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
i'll take two thousand a day and i feel

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.630 
i'll take two thousand a day and i feel
like<00:04:29.360> if<00:04:29.690> i<00:04:29.930> feel<00:04:30.710> like<00:04:30.800> i<00:04:30.919> need<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.250> increase

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
like if i feel like i need to increase

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.080 
like if i feel like i need to increase
it

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
it

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.700 
it
take<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.330> about<00:04:32.660> time<00:04:33.050> today<00:04:33.260> but<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.560> don't

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
take it about time today but I don't

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.250 
take it about time today but I don't
think<00:04:33.830> I<00:04:33.949> need<00:04:34.010> to<00:04:34.190> but<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> guess<00:04:35.419> if<00:04:35.690> you<00:04:36.050> have

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
think I need to but I guess if you have

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.470 
think I need to but I guess if you have
a<00:04:36.500> very<00:04:37.100> damaged<00:04:37.580> hair<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:37.970> could<00:04:38.090> take<00:04:38.300> the

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
a very damaged hair you could take the

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
a very damaged hair you could take the
five<00:04:38.810> thousand<00:04:39.550> microgram<00:04:41.169> tablets<00:04:42.169> once<00:04:42.380> a

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
five thousand microgram tablets once a

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.340 
five thousand microgram tablets once a
day<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:43.340> would<00:04:43.460> be<00:04:43.490> no<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.510> little<00:04:45.080> bit<00:04:45.199> I

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
day and it would be no a little bit I

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.080 
day and it would be no a little bit I
guess<00:04:45.410> more<00:04:45.800> faded<00:04:46.040> for<00:04:46.340> more<00:04:46.520> damaged<00:04:46.850> hair

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
guess more faded for more damaged hair

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.320 
guess more faded for more damaged hair
and<00:04:47.630> I've<00:04:47.720> been<00:04:47.840> taking<00:04:48.169> these<00:04:48.290> twice<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.770> day

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
and I've been taking these twice a day

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.400 
and I've been taking these twice a day
and<00:04:52.240> have<00:04:53.240> I<00:04:53.330> noticed<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.690> difference<00:04:53.900> in<00:04:54.260> my

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
and have I noticed a difference in my

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.300 
and have I noticed a difference in my
hair<00:04:54.710> um<00:04:56.110> not<00:04:57.110> really<00:04:57.169> right<00:04:57.770> now<00:04:57.830> because

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
hair um not really right now because

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.980

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
thing that I'm gonna get ready to start

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.629 
thing that I'm gonna get ready to start
back<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.200> I<00:05:27.470> don't<00:05:27.740> remember<00:05:27.979> if<00:05:28.220> I'm<00:05:28.310> talk<00:05:28.520> to

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
back and I don't remember if I'm talk to

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.029 
back and I don't remember if I'm talk to
y'all<00:05:28.820> about<00:05:29.120> this<00:05:29.539> before<00:05:29.960> or<00:05:29.990> not<00:05:30.260> but<00:05:30.590> when

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
y'all about this before or not but when

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.040 
y'all about this before or not but when
I<00:05:31.070> was<00:05:31.280> transitioning<00:05:31.729> I<00:05:32.180> will<00:05:32.720> use<00:05:32.900> the

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
I was transitioning I will use the

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.730 
I was transitioning I will use the
apogee<00:05:33.669> two-step<00:05:34.669> protein<00:05:35.330> treatment<00:05:35.960> like

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
apogee two-step protein treatment like

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.100 
apogee two-step protein treatment like
every<00:05:37.070> six<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.460> eight<00:05:37.669> weeks<00:05:37.700> on<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.900> same

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
every six to eight weeks on the same

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.740 
every six to eight weeks on the same
schedule<00:05:39.500> as<00:05:39.650> if<00:05:40.010> I<00:05:40.220> were<00:05:40.400> getting<00:05:40.940> a<00:05:41.180> relaxer

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
schedule as if I were getting a relaxer

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.629 
schedule as if I were getting a relaxer
but<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.470> would<00:05:42.620> do<00:05:42.710> that<00:05:42.740> instead<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.580> that

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
but I would do that instead and that

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.400 
but I would do that instead and that
really<00:05:44.060> helps<00:05:44.479> strengthen<00:05:44.750> my<00:05:45.020> hair<00:05:45.289> and

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
really helps strengthen my hair and

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.560 
really helps strengthen my hair and
helped<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:45.919> keep<00:05:46.490> it<00:05:46.639> from<00:05:46.820> breaking<00:05:47.000> because

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
helped to keep it from breaking because

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.610 
helped to keep it from breaking because
you<00:05:47.720> know<00:05:47.840> a<00:05:47.870> lot<00:05:48.110> of<00:05:48.139> times<00:05:48.349> when<00:05:48.470> you're

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
you know a lot of times when you're

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.050 
you know a lot of times when you're
transitioning<00:05:48.950> you<00:05:49.310> get<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.550> breakage<00:05:49.910> at

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
transitioning you get the breakage at

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.969 
transitioning you get the breakage at
the<00:05:50.180> DMark<00:05:50.539> light<00:05:50.840> of<00:05:50.990> demarcation<00:05:51.260> which<00:05:51.860> is

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
the DMark light of demarcation which is

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.670 
the DMark light of demarcation which is
where<00:05:52.160> the<00:05:52.280> butt<00:05:52.960> excuse<00:05:53.960> me<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.260> relaxed

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
where the butt excuse me the relaxed

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.430 
where the butt excuse me the relaxed
hair<00:05:54.830> meets<00:05:55.039> the<00:05:55.280> natural<00:05:56.150> hair<00:05:56.300> and<00:05:56.570> I<00:05:57.260> did

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
hair meets the natural hair and I did

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.900 
hair meets the natural hair and I did
that<00:05:57.620> those<00:05:58.010> treatments<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:58.490> I<00:05:58.520> never<00:05:58.729> really

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
that those treatments and I never really

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.120 
that those treatments and I never really
had<00:05:59.030> any<00:05:59.210> problems<00:05:59.539> with<00:05:59.620> breakage<00:06:00.620> it<00:06:00.889> really

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
had any problems with breakage it really

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.589 
had any problems with breakage it really
helped<00:06:01.400> with<00:06:01.430> shedding<00:06:02.030> I<00:06:02.150> never<00:06:02.360> really<00:06:02.570> had

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
helped with shedding I never really had

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.140 
helped with shedding I never really had
any<00:06:02.870> problems<00:06:03.229> when<00:06:03.440> I<00:06:03.470> was<00:06:03.680> transitioning<00:06:04.370> so

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
any problems when I was transitioning so

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.460 
any problems when I was transitioning so
I<00:06:05.210> figured<00:06:05.570> I<00:06:05.630> might<00:06:05.780> have<00:06:05.900> to<00:06:05.990> start<00:06:06.169> banging

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
I figured I might have to start banging

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.900 
I figured I might have to start banging
on<00:06:06.530> about<00:06:06.560> how<00:06:06.860> the<00:06:06.919> routine<00:06:07.400> of<00:06:07.430> doing<00:06:07.700> it

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
on about how the routine of doing it

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.390 
on about how the routine of doing it
right<00:06:08.060> like<00:06:08.270> every<00:06:08.330> eight<00:06:08.780> weeks<00:06:09.250> just<00:06:10.250> to

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
right like every eight weeks just to

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.790 
right like every eight weeks just to
keep<00:06:10.550> my<00:06:10.669> hair<00:06:10.880> healthy<00:06:11.320> so<00:06:12.320> this<00:06:12.530> right<00:06:12.740> here

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
keep my hair healthy so this right here

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.210 
keep my hair healthy so this right here
is<00:06:12.979> the<00:06:13.360> apogee<00:06:14.360> two-step<00:06:15.260> protein<00:06:15.740> treatment

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
is the apogee two-step protein treatment

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.190 
is the apogee two-step protein treatment
this<00:06:16.340> is<00:06:16.400> actually<00:06:16.940> the<00:06:17.090> actual<00:06:17.630> protein

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
this is actually the actual protein

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.930 
this is actually the actual protein
which<00:06:18.800> is<00:06:18.830> what<00:06:19.070> you<00:06:19.160> put<00:06:19.310> on<00:06:19.340> your<00:06:19.520> hair<00:06:19.729> first

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
which is what you put on your hair first

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:25.469 
which is what you put on your hair first
and<00:06:20.389> then<00:06:21.289> this<00:06:21.560> one<00:06:21.860> is<00:06:22.130> the<00:06:24.280> moisturizing

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 
and then this one is the moisturizing

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.089 
and then this one is the moisturizing
balancing<00:06:26.479> moisturizer<00:06:26.750> and<00:06:27.440> this<00:06:27.830> is<00:06:27.979> what

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
balancing moisturizer and this is what

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.080 
balancing moisturizer and this is what
you<00:06:28.190> put<00:06:28.370> on<00:06:28.400> after<00:06:28.669> the<00:06:29.539> protein<00:06:29.930> treatment

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
you put on after the protein treatment

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.150 
you put on after the protein treatment
you
