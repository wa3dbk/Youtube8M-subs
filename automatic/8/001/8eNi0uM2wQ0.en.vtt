kua<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.289> use<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> fast<00:01:02.339> turn<00:01:03.179> or

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
kua you can use that for a fast turn or

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.960 
kua you can use that for a fast turn or

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:07.980

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
I'm not leaning then I lose the energy

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.500 
I'm not leaning then I lose the energy
in<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.860> kua<00:03:30.070> have<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:30.490> tuck<00:03:30.760> my<00:03:30.940> pelvis<00:03:31.180> a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
little that will preserve the energy

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.210 
little that will preserve the energy
here<00:03:33.850> then<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.570> could<00:03:34.630> go<00:03:34.870> say<00:03:35.200> mono<00:03:35.650> into<00:03:36.010> an<00:03:36.100> L

here then I could go say mono into an L
stance<00:03:36.580> again<00:03:36.940> right<00:03:37.630> then<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.530> could<00:03:38.680> do

hurts and you'll feel it you can

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.399 
hurts and you'll feel it you can
actually

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
actually

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.199 
actually
it<00:04:32.589> preserves<00:04:32.889> a<00:04:33.159> lot<00:04:33.339> of<00:04:33.429> this<00:04:33.580> like<00:04:33.789> elastic

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:34.209 
it preserves a lot of this like elastic

00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:36.719 
it preserves a lot of this like elastic
power<00:04:34.809> in<00:04:35.169> there<00:04:35.409> you<00:04:35.979> can<00:04:36.159> also<00:04:36.339> do<00:04:36.610> it

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
power in there you can also do it

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.779 
power in there you can also do it
backward<00:04:37.179> twining<00:04:37.779> what<00:04:38.499> that<00:04:38.679> means<00:04:38.919> is<00:04:39.189> you

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
backward twining what that means is you

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.229 
backward twining what that means is you
take<00:04:39.819> your<00:04:40.239> foot<00:04:40.959> you<00:04:41.409> put<00:04:41.589> it<00:04:41.709> behind<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.489> so

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:43.239 
take your foot you put it behind you so

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:45.419 
take your foot you put it behind you so
you<00:04:43.269> put<00:04:43.509> it<00:04:43.629> maybe<00:04:43.839> next<00:04:44.469> to<00:04:44.769> the<00:04:44.919> inside<00:04:45.399> of

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:45.429 
you put it maybe next to the inside of

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:47.879 
you put it maybe next to the inside of
the<00:04:45.610> heel<00:04:46.059> or<00:04:46.360> sorry<00:04:46.869> next<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.229> the<00:04:47.319> outside<00:04:47.709> of

the heel or sorry next to the outside of

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.879 
the heel or sorry next to the outside of
the<00:04:47.979> heel<00:04:48.279> and<00:04:49.199> then<00:04:50.199> what<00:04:50.319> you're<00:04:50.469> gonna<00:04:50.559> do

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
the heel and then what you're gonna do

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.999 
the heel and then what you're gonna do
is<00:04:51.129> you're<00:04:51.639> gonna<00:04:51.699> rock<00:04:52.179> your<00:04:52.449> weight<00:04:53.009> down

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:54.009 
is you're gonna rock your weight down

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.829 
is you're gonna rock your weight down
onto<00:04:54.459> it<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.939> minute<00:04:55.209> you<00:04:55.300> start<00:04:55.629> putting

00:04:55.829 --> 00:04:55.839 
onto it the minute you start putting

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.559 
onto it the minute you start putting
weight<00:04:56.169> there<00:04:56.499> like<00:04:57.189> a<00:04:57.219> balance<00:04:57.729> scale<00:04:57.879> you've

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
weight there like a balance scale you've

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.529 
weight there like a balance scale you've
got<00:04:58.809> to<00:04:58.959> take<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.259> weight<00:04:59.409> off<00:04:59.439> of<00:04:59.800> here<00:05:00.129> and

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
got to take the weight off of here and

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.309 
got to take the weight off of here and
turn<00:05:02.099> alright<00:05:03.099> so<00:05:03.369> I<00:05:03.669> kind<00:05:04.149> of<00:05:04.209> put<00:05:04.419> this<00:05:04.599> right

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
turn alright so I kind of put this right

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.619 
turn alright so I kind of put this right
leg<00:05:05.529> to<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.889> right<00:05:06.159> angle<00:05:06.189> relative<00:05:07.089> to<00:05:07.419> the

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
leg to a right angle relative to the

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.329 
leg to a right angle relative to the
left<00:05:07.899> foot<00:05:08.789> sink<00:05:09.789> and<00:05:10.679> turn<00:05:11.679> keep<00:05:12.069> nice<00:05:12.309> and

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:12.339 
left foot sink and turn keep nice and

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.249 
left foot sink and turn keep nice and
straight<00:05:12.849> so<00:05:12.999> you<00:05:13.059> pirouette<00:05:13.599> straight<00:05:14.110> on

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
straight so you pirouette straight on

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.769 
straight so you pirouette straight on
your<00:05:14.409> axis<00:05:14.889> instead<00:05:15.519> of<00:05:15.879> letting<00:05:16.539> the<00:05:16.629> energy

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
your axis instead of letting the energy

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.229 
your axis instead of letting the energy
go<00:05:17.139> all<00:05:17.289> over<00:05:17.319> the<00:05:17.559> place<00:05:17.769> so<00:05:18.699> you<00:05:18.759> can<00:05:18.909> do<00:05:19.059> that

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:19.239 
go all over the place so you can do that

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:24.449 
go all over the place so you can do that
to<00:05:19.539> quickly<00:05:20.469> turn<00:05:20.800> around<00:05:23.129> okay<00:05:24.129> and<00:05:24.369> then

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:24.459 
to quickly turn around okay and then

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:27.359 
to quickly turn around okay and then
eventually<00:05:24.789> it<00:05:25.389> would<00:05:25.539> become<00:05:25.919> very<00:05:26.919> smooth

00:05:27.359 --> 00:05:27.369 
eventually it would become very smooth

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.069 
eventually it would become very smooth
and<00:05:27.579> very<00:05:27.699> quick<00:05:28.089> at<00:05:28.269> first<00:05:28.509> it's<00:05:28.719> gonna<00:05:28.779> feel

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:29.079 
and very quick at first it's gonna feel

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:30.949 
and very quick at first it's gonna feel
awkward<00:05:29.319> that's<00:05:30.279> okay

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:30.959 
awkward that's okay

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:34.829 
awkward that's okay
allow<00:05:31.959> it<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.379> just<00:05:32.619> accept<00:05:33.429> it<00:05:33.699> it's<00:05:34.539> no<00:05:34.659> big

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839

go now I'm in a empty step okay and then
from<00:05:51.249> here<00:05:51.669> I<00:05:51.990> could<00:05:52.990> twine<00:05:53.499> out<00:05:54.269> this<00:05:55.269> way

00:06:05.079 --> 00:06:06.569 
so you can do that over and over then
you<00:06:05.169> can<00:06:05.319> see<00:06:05.529> how<00:06:05.679> you<00:06:05.739> can<00:06:05.919> just<00:06:05.949> spin<00:06:06.429> around

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:06.579 
you can see how you can just spin around

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.989 
you can see how you can just spin around
in<00:06:06.909> a<00:06:06.999> tight<00:06:07.239> radius<00:06:07.529> very<00:06:08.529> quickly<00:06:08.919> and<00:06:09.369> if

00:06:09.989 --> 00:06:09.999 
in a tight radius very quickly and if

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.389 
in a tight radius very quickly and if
you<00:06:10.179> put<00:06:10.749> that<00:06:10.929> energy<00:06:11.110> there<00:06:11.589> you<00:06:12.069> can<00:06:12.249> also

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:12.399 
you put that energy there you can also

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:14.850 
you put that energy there you can also
turn<00:06:12.759> the<00:06:12.939> other<00:06:13.089> leg<00:06:13.329> into<00:06:13.569> a<00:06:13.959> kick<00:06:14.439> usually

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
turn the other leg into a kick usually

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.589 
turn the other leg into a kick usually
some<00:06:15.309> kind<00:06:15.339> of<00:06:15.519> a<00:06:15.639> roundhouse<00:06:15.939> kick<00:06:16.119> or

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
some kind of a roundhouse kick or

some kind of a roundhouse kick or
something<00:06:16.929> else<00:06:17.110> but<00:06:17.429> it's<00:06:18.429> very<00:06:18.699> easy<00:06:18.999> to

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:19.179 
something else but it's very easy to

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:21.479 
something else but it's very easy to
mess<00:06:19.539> up<00:06:19.839> a<00:06:20.079> lot<00:06:20.529> of<00:06:20.559> times<00:06:20.860> people<00:06:21.069> just<00:06:21.339> stay

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.049 
plant it tight see people are great on
staying<00:06:23.349> rooted<00:06:23.769> you<00:06:24.279> know<00:06:24.399> which<00:06:24.909> is

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:25.059 
staying rooted you know which is

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:26.369 
staying rooted you know which is
something<00:06:25.269> that<00:06:25.389> is<00:06:25.539> important<00:06:26.050> in<00:06:26.139> Tai<00:06:26.349> Chi

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
but again we don't want it so rooted

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.589 
but again we don't want it so rooted
that<00:06:29.349> it<00:06:29.469> becomes<00:06:29.769> imbalanced<00:06:30.489> and<00:06:30.999> overly<00:06:31.360> in

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
that it becomes imbalanced and overly in

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.739 
that it becomes imbalanced and overly in
so<00:06:31.989> you<00:06:32.050> don't<00:06:32.199> want<00:06:32.349> every<00:06:32.499> go<00:06:33.209> okay<00:06:34.209> I'm<00:06:34.389> here

so you don't want every go okay I'm here
now<00:06:35.259> I'm<00:06:35.289> gonna<00:06:35.499> twine<00:06:35.949> now<00:06:36.909> I'm<00:06:37.089> going<00:06:37.209> to

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:37.269 
now I'm gonna twine now I'm going to

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:39.629 
now I'm gonna twine now I'm going to
pick<00:06:37.479> up<00:06:37.629> my<00:06:37.779> foot<00:06:38.050> no<00:06:38.649> the<00:06:38.919> moment<00:06:39.429> it's<00:06:39.519> like

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
pick up my foot no the moment it's like

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.999 
pick up my foot no the moment it's like
a<00:06:39.669> balance<00:06:39.969> scale<00:06:40.329> the<00:06:41.019> moment<00:06:41.349> that<00:06:41.499> one<00:06:41.709> side

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
a balance scale the moment that one side

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.739 
a balance scale the moment that one side
tips<00:06:42.369> down<00:06:42.579> on<00:06:42.789> the<00:06:42.909> balance<00:06:43.300> scale<00:06:43.389> what

00:06:43.739 --> 00:06:43.749 
tips down on the balance scale what

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:45.390 
tips down on the balance scale what
happens<00:06:44.050> to<00:06:44.229> the<00:06:44.349> other<00:06:44.469> side

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
happens to the other side

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.129 
happens to the other side
you<00:06:45.759> know<00:06:45.880> what<00:06:46.000> happens<00:06:46.360> it<00:06:46.479> starts<00:06:46.750> to<00:06:46.930> tip

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
you know what happens it starts to tip

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.379 
you know what happens it starts to tip
so<00:06:47.410> imagine<00:06:48.190> it's<00:06:48.370> a<00:06:48.430> balance<00:06:48.850> scale<00:06:49.000> and<00:06:49.360> that

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:49.389 
so imagine it's a balance scale and that

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:53.340 
so imagine it's a balance scale and that
it's<00:06:49.930> turning<00:06:50.290> at<00:06:50.500> the<00:06:50.620> same<00:06:50.830> time<00:06:52.139> just<00:06:53.139> like

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
it's turning at the same time just like

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.010 
it's turning at the same time just like
that<00:06:53.590> okay<00:06:54.580> and<00:06:54.610> relax<00:06:55.000> and<00:06:55.600> you<00:06:55.750> can<00:06:55.930> do
