to stand below in the top Tromp head
that<00:00:17.380> we've<00:00:17.530> installed<00:00:17.950> to<00:00:18.610> build<00:00:18.820> a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
that we've installed to build a

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.300 
that we've installed to build a
combination<00:00:19.630> system<00:00:19.900> of<00:00:20.200> a<00:00:20.260> water<00:00:20.530> hammer<00:00:20.950> and

draw tubes going all the way down this
and<00:00:30.730> see<00:00:30.880> we've<00:00:31.029> got<00:00:31.180> three<00:00:31.509> copper<00:00:31.900> tubes

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
and see we've got three copper tubes

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.070 
and see we've got three copper tubes
drawn<00:00:32.710> air<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:34.000> three<00:00:34.270> holes<00:00:34.510> drilled<00:00:34.900> into

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
that's going down into our black pipe

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.790 
that's going down into our black pipe
here<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.329> as<00:00:40.810> long<00:00:40.960> as<00:00:41.079> we<00:00:41.170> got<00:00:41.290> that<00:00:41.470> in<00:00:41.650> there

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
here and as long as we got that in there

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.230 
here and as long as we got that in there
right<00:00:42.010> you<00:00:42.130> can<00:00:42.220> see<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.370> curvature<00:00:42.760> to<00:00:43.210> the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
right you can see the curvature to the

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.330 
right you can see the curvature to the
copper<00:00:43.810> to<00:00:44.260> make<00:00:44.440> sure<00:00:44.560> it<00:00:44.680> sticks<00:00:44.890> above<00:00:45.190> the

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
copper to make sure it sticks above the

copper to make sure it sticks above the
water<00:00:45.579> we're<00:00:46.180> going<00:00:46.270> to<00:00:46.360> draw<00:00:46.510> water<00:00:46.810> the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
water we're going to draw water the

water we're going to draw water the
water<00:00:47.320> passing<00:00:47.860> by<00:00:48.010> these<00:00:48.280> if<00:00:49.120> I<00:00:49.240> can<00:00:49.360> get<00:00:49.480> that

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
water passing by these if I can get that

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.600 
water passing by these if I can get that
to<00:00:49.720> turn<00:00:49.930> you<00:00:50.530> see<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.830> copper<00:00:51.160> pipes<00:00:51.370> in

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
to turn you see the copper pipes in

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.790 
to turn you see the copper pipes in
there<00:00:51.760> they<00:00:51.880> go<00:00:52.030> down<00:00:52.270> about<00:00:52.510> right<00:00:52.660> here<00:00:53.290> into

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
there they go down about right here into

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.770 
there they go down about right here into
the<00:00:54.070> tube<00:00:54.310> so<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.760> lot<00:00:55.000> of<00:00:55.030> water<00:00:55.330> per<00:00:55.540> draw

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
the tube so the lot of water per draw

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.990 
the tube so the lot of water per draw
has<00:00:56.020> to<00:00:56.050> go<00:00:56.290> by<00:00:56.500> them<00:00:56.680> before<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.670> starts

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
has to go by them before it starts

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.640 
has to go by them before it starts
pulling<00:00:58.240> a<00:00:58.480> draw<00:00:58.690> on<00:00:58.930> these<00:00:59.080> tubes<00:00:59.410> to<00:00:59.440> pull

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
pulling a draw on these tubes to pull

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.650 
pulling a draw on these tubes to pull
the<00:00:59.770> air<00:00:59.950> into<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.280> system<00:01:00.510> typically<00:01:01.510> with

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
the air into the system typically with

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.570 
the air into the system typically with
trumps<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.230> want<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.500> straight<00:01:02.890> down<00:01:03.160> fall

this<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.510> still<00:01:04.720> going<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:04.960> produce<00:01:05.140> quite<00:01:05.530> a

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
this is still going to produce quite a

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.810 
this is still going to produce quite a
bit<00:01:05.740> of<00:01:05.830> air<00:01:05.950> pressure<00:01:06.159> which<00:01:06.490> you'll<00:01:06.640> see

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
bit of air pressure which you'll see

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.280 
bit of air pressure which you'll see
here<00:01:07.000> in<00:01:07.090> a<00:01:07.150> moment<00:01:07.299> but<00:01:07.659> if<00:01:08.020> you're<00:01:08.110> going<00:01:08.200> to

here in a moment but if you're going to

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.050 
here in a moment but if you're going to
build<00:01:08.409> a<00:01:08.590> trompe<00:01:08.860> hammer<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:09.640> kind<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:09.909> want

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
build a trompe hammer you kind of want

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.880 
build a trompe hammer you kind of want
to<00:01:10.090> do<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.240> on<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.479> straight<00:01:11.049> down<00:01:11.320> vertical

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
drop it holds the air a lot better than

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.260 
drop it holds the air a lot better than
a<00:01:13.780> gradual<00:01:14.439> sloping<00:01:14.920> drop<00:01:15.189> we<00:01:16.060> should

a gradual sloping drop we should

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.270 
a gradual sloping drop we should
generate<00:01:16.659> quite<00:01:16.930> a<00:01:16.960> bit<00:01:17.140> of<00:01:17.200> psi<00:01:17.650> somewhere<00:01:18.159> up

generate quite a bit of psi somewhere up
in<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.520> 50<00:01:18.939> psi<00:01:19.450> range<00:01:19.810> or<00:01:19.990> if<00:01:20.079> not<00:01:20.259> higher<00:01:20.579> so

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
in the 50 psi range or if not higher so

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:22.919 
in the 50 psi range or if not higher so
let<00:01:21.670> me<00:01:21.759> go<00:01:21.850> ahead<00:01:21.880> now<00:01:22.179> and<00:01:22.210> reinstall<00:01:22.780> this

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
let me go ahead now and reinstall this

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.810 
let me go ahead now and reinstall this
into<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.289> creek<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:23.799> then<00:01:24.189> we'll<00:01:24.369> walk<00:01:24.579> down

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
into the creek and then we'll walk down

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.730 
into the creek and then we'll walk down
below<00:01:25.149> I<00:01:25.479> want<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.840> show<00:01:26.020> you<00:01:26.079> what's<00:01:26.259> going<00:01:26.590> on

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
below I want to show you what's going on

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.440 
below I want to show you what's going on
down<00:01:26.950> there<00:01:26.979> so<00:01:27.700> we've<00:01:27.909> got<00:01:28.090> all<00:01:28.270> together

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
down there so we've got all together

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.779 
down there so we've got all together
from<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.200> water<00:01:29.439> ram<00:01:29.740> all<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.219> way<00:01:30.340> up<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.450 
from the water ram all the way up to the
input<00:01:31.179> I'd<00:01:31.749> say<00:01:32.079> a<00:01:32.109> good<00:01:32.439> eight<00:01:32.679> feet<00:01:33.100> of<00:01:33.249> head

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
input I'd say a good eight feet of head

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.980

here folks we're going to need to run a
longer<00:01:35.409> pipe<00:01:35.619> but<00:01:35.920> that<00:01:36.100> will<00:01:36.249> end<00:01:36.429> up<00:01:36.609> being

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
longer pipe but that will end up being

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.929 
longer pipe but that will end up being
probably<00:01:37.600> about<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.899> maybe<00:01:38.799> twenty<00:01:39.369> five<00:01:39.609> foot

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
probably about a maybe twenty five foot

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.489 
probably about a maybe twenty five foot
of<00:01:40.090> head<00:01:40.299> altogether<00:01:40.869> when<00:01:41.079> we're<00:01:41.229> done<00:01:41.350> with

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:41.499 
of head altogether when we're done with

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:43.529 
of head altogether when we're done with
this<00:01:41.590> project<00:01:41.859> here<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.340> Montana<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:42.999> right

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
this project here in Montana so right

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.870 
this project here in Montana so right
now<00:01:43.689> I've<00:01:43.869> got<00:01:44.079> a<00:01:44.109> PSI<00:01:44.710> gage<00:01:44.979> up<00:01:45.219> here<00:01:45.460> I'm

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
now I've got a PSI gage up here I'm

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.760 
now I've got a PSI gage up here I'm
going<00:01:45.999> to<00:01:46.060> walk<00:01:46.240> in<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.509> little<00:01:46.719> closer<00:01:46.899> show

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
going to walk in a little closer show

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.309 
going to walk in a little closer show
you<00:01:47.829> what<00:01:48.039> this<00:01:48.189> looks<00:01:48.369> like<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:50.170> it's

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
you what this looks like and it's

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.779 
you what this looks like and it's
building<00:01:50.679> up<00:01:50.770> pressure<00:01:50.950> as<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.460> speak<00:01:51.759> right

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
building up pressure as we speak right

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.809 
building up pressure as we speak right
now<00:01:52.170> we<00:01:53.170> can<00:01:53.380> see<00:01:53.590> here<00:01:54.039> if<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.249> zoom<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.670> on

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
now we can see here if you zoom in on

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.710 
now we can see here if you zoom in on
that<00:01:54.969> for<00:01:55.210> you<00:01:55.329> maybe<00:01:55.539> you<00:01:55.600> can<00:01:55.689> see<00:01:55.899> it

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
that for you maybe you can see it

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.940 
that for you maybe you can see it
we're<00:01:58.200> getting<00:01:58.470> towards<00:01:58.770> 50<00:01:58.980> psi<00:01:59.640> and

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
we're getting towards 50 psi and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.260 
we're getting towards 50 psi and
building<00:02:01.950> pressure<00:02:02.190> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.910> new<00:02:03.090> design

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
building pressure this is a new design

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.900 
building pressure this is a new design
folks<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> mixture<00:02:04.980> of<00:02:05.070> both<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.580> water

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
folks this is a mixture of both a water

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.900 
folks this is a mixture of both a water
hammer<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:07.080> trough<00:02:07.440> which<00:02:08.070> is<00:02:08.220> Trump<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
hammer and a trough which is Trump is a

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.609 
hammer and a trough which is Trump is a
water<00:02:09.240> powered<00:02:09.750> air<00:02:09.900> compressing<00:02:10.500> unit

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
water powered air compressing unit

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.250 
water powered air compressing unit
that's<00:02:11.220> why<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.460> put<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> big<00:02:12.120> giant<00:02:12.630> column<00:02:13.110> on

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
that's why I put the big giant column on

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.440 
that's why I put the big giant column on
top<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.680> my<00:02:13.830> water<00:02:14.100> Ram<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.180> able<00:02:15.270> to

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
top of my water Ram is to be able to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.750 
top of my water Ram is to be able to
store<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.810> lot<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.440> compressed<00:02:16.920> air<00:02:17.160> from

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
store a lot of that compressed air from

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.580 
store a lot of that compressed air from
the<00:02:17.880> beginning<00:02:18.360> Trump<00:02:18.690> section<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.440> this

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the beginning Trump section of this

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.790 
the beginning Trump section of this
which<00:02:20.070> I've<00:02:20.250> already<00:02:20.430> showed<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> we're

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
which I've already showed you so we're

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.050 
which I've already showed you so we're
going<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.980> keep<00:02:23.130> letting<00:02:23.460> this<00:02:23.520> thing<00:02:23.580> build

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
going to keep letting this thing build

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.600 
going to keep letting this thing build
up<00:02:24.240> this<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.290> not<00:02:25.470> too<00:02:25.680> bad<00:02:25.830> folks<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.430> only

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
up this is not too bad folks for only

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.820 
up this is not too bad folks for only
about<00:02:26.910> eight<00:02:27.180> foot<00:02:27.420> ahead<00:02:27.750> here<00:02:28.080> let<00:02:28.620> me<00:02:28.710> go

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
about eight foot ahead here let me go

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.330 
about eight foot ahead here let me go
ahead<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.040> zoom<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.520> show<00:02:29.820> you<00:02:29.850> our<00:02:30.090> psi<00:02:31.340> we're

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
ahead and zoom in show you our psi we're

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.590 
ahead and zoom in show you our psi we're
now<00:02:32.460> jumping<00:02:33.090> up<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.360> little<00:02:33.540> bit<00:02:33.720> more<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:36.510> a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
now jumping up a little bit more it's a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.050 
now jumping up a little bit more it's a
slow<00:02:36.840> process<00:02:37.080> past<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.860> 50<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.340> gets<00:02:38.520> to<00:02:38.670> 50

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
slow process past the 50 it gets to 50

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.440 
slow process past the 50 it gets to 50
51<00:02:39.810> somewhere<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:40.680> there<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.640> really<00:02:42.000> fast

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
51 somewhere in there really really fast

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.810 
51 somewhere in there really really fast
and<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.410> really<00:02:43.770> slow<00:02:44.190> right<00:02:44.490> now<00:02:44.520> it's

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
and it's really slow right now it's

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.340 
and it's really slow right now it's
taking<00:02:45.090> about<00:02:45.300> four<00:02:45.600> minutes<00:02:45.810> since<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.320> last

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
taking about four minutes since the last

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.950 
taking about four minutes since the last
shot<00:02:46.800> to<00:02:47.520> gain<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.910> much<00:02:47.970> psi<00:02:50.750> alright<00:02:51.750> folks

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
shot to gain that much psi alright folks

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.540 
shot to gain that much psi alright folks
well<00:02:52.200> I've<00:02:52.260> let<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:52.590> run<00:02:52.830> for<00:02:52.860> long<00:02:53.280> enough

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
well I've let this run for long enough

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.540 
well I've let this run for long enough
to<00:02:53.670> know<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.850> that's<00:02:54.210> our<00:02:54.420> max<00:02:54.840> psi<00:02:55.490> let<00:02:56.490> me

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
to know that that's our max psi let me

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.950 
to know that that's our max psi let me
go<00:02:56.700> ahead<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.030> get<00:02:57.150> up<00:02:57.240> close<00:02:57.270> enough<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.900> you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
go ahead and get up close enough so you

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.530 
go ahead and get up close enough so you
can<00:02:58.110> see<00:02:58.290> what<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.590> ended<00:02:58.890> up<00:02:59.040> at<00:02:59.540> just

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
can see what it ended up at just

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.710 
can see what it ended up at just
slightly<00:03:00.870> over<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.980> 60<00:03:02.370> psi<00:03:02.850> are<00:03:03.030> right<00:03:03.209> at<00:03:03.390> 60

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
slightly over the 60 psi are right at 60

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.860 
slightly over the 60 psi are right at 60
psi<00:03:03.989> right<00:03:04.590> there
