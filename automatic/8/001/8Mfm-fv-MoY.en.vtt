00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
otherwise if the gaskets dry the engine

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:34.830 
otherwise if the gaskets dry the engine
block<00:02:33.700> heats<00:02:33.970> up<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.269> it<00:02:34.360> could<00:02:34.480> actually

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
block heats up and it could actually

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.740 
block heats up and it could actually

bake that gasket on to the engine block

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.530 
bake that gasket on to the engine block
you<00:02:38.290> don't<00:02:38.440> want<00:02:38.709> that<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.010> happen<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:39.540> make

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
you don't want that to happen so make

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.360

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
if you try this you'll see what I mean

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.390 
if you try this you'll see what I mean
later<00:03:30.310> on<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:32.049> usually<00:03:32.350> put<00:03:32.739> in<00:03:32.829> about<00:03:33.069> four

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
later on but I usually put in about four

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.440 
later on but I usually put in about four
quarts<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.090> then<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.780> check<00:03:35.650> the<00:03:35.829> dipstick

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
quarts and then I check the dipstick

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.819 
quarts and then I check the dipstick
because<00:03:37.450> if<00:03:37.569> you<00:03:37.690> put<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:37.989> five<00:03:38.290> quarts<00:03:38.680> you

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
because if you put in five quarts you

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.580 
because if you put in five quarts you
put<00:03:39.040> in<00:03:39.160> too<00:03:39.340> much<00:03:39.519> oil<00:03:39.760> in<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.120> engine<00:03:40.590> maybe

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
put in too much oil in this engine maybe

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.140 
put in too much oil in this engine maybe
someone<00:03:41.950> in<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.130> comments<00:03:42.310> can<00:03:42.609> tell<00:03:43.000> me
