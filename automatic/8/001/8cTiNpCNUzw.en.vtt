level and high percentage on myself and

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.660 
level and high percentage on myself and

exciting<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.409> great<00:01:46.710> thing<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> us

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
exciting and it's great thing all of us

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.880 
exciting and it's great thing all of us
getting<00:01:48.060> through<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.649> are<00:01:49.680> all

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
getting through and actually we are all

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.289 
getting through and actually we are all
in<00:01:50.040> different<00:01:50.340> parts<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.820> draw<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.149> we

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
in different parts of the draw so we

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.139 
in different parts of the draw so we
have<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.380> far<00:01:53.070> away<00:01:53.100> without<00:01:53.670> playing<00:01:53.939> each

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
have to go far away without playing each

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.350 
have to go far away without playing each
other<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.140> amazing
