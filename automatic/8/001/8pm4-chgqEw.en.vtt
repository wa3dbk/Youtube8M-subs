 video well be the review of iphone max 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.599
 is really the phone that has most 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.460
 liked that I've tried in the past 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.990
 months mostly because of their relationship 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.370
 quality-price since we 're going to have some 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.049
 pieces of features in a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.490
 phone with a very cool design voucher 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.949
 as you are seeing and for a price 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.210
 amazing assigned also have things 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.500
 very interesting that we are going to see 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.789
 throughout the video but the most 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.529
 important that the final truth because 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.050
 I will comment with one to comment one 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.240
 sure thing that you will like very much so 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 that nothing will start 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.320
 good to start we're just going to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.940
 see the phone we're going to take it out of the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.829
 box that I have it out but let's 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.180
 see what it contains so I'll show you if 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.430
 a small view of the phone then 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 let's go more detail with your design 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 and this is the box of a very cool box 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.739
 very well designed is very colorful where 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.300
 the truth because it represents very well the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 phone but well let's see how it 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.050
 open and what do we have inside as 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.239
 you will see this is what is open 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.180
 we have in here we do not have anything else 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.100
 ok here would come the phone tucked me 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.040
 I've already taken it out so we're going to take it out 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.870
 this here is worth carefully and 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880
 we have here a thing that puts color 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.650
 crisis well here where will it come then 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.990
 more information about the device and 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.460
 the things that undoubtedly because it does it very 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 striking this phone the housings 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.600
 interchangeable we have for behind 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 so we have the manual here as 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.530
 we'll see what else we have, let's go to what 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.080
 importantly they also have their 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.280
 stickers have another manual and have the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.810
 housings is what to us 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 so we can take our 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.070
 devices and change the housing to 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.350
 black color such as color 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.270
 yellow and every day can change and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.659
 have the personalized phone as we 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.700
 fancy 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.380
 so out there we do not have much more 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.299
 information so clear that we have more 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.799
 we have the screen saver that already 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.850
 is included with our 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.770
 device so we do not have to 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.929
 complicate us because it already comes with everything 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.060
 all included and our stickers 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.770
 we have here our as they come very 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.709
 well-designed is worth what else we have 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.329
 let's get it out here all of the pull and 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.229
 we have what they sell they want from the 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.119
 drums 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.429
 here they have what is the cable and comes 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.049
 the charger here will take us all out for now 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.969
 you imagine it but good as digits 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.590
 come with a design very good so 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.869
 we have a phone in 5 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.799
 inches with resolution hd this 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.079
 Resolution is 1280 x 720p 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.239
 the device as you see has a design 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.310
 very similar to those of the nexus vale 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.110
 they have the touch buttons here here 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.569
 below and in addition to what was 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.220
 commenting before the back that is 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.930
 as a material that makes us 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.459
 grip and also a very very material 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.620
 Suddenly we're sure we'll like it a lot 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.420
 to touch so here for example let's 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.970
 take away this stage from behind that in the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.730
 that I already had put so you see is very 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.720
 simple ok we press and we can 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.310
 put it where we want 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.390
 now we do if we want 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.090
 we can put the yellow and we have 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.459
 our phone as you see 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.170
 perfectly already customized with 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.930
 our color cap that we 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.640
 We want the phone weighs 167 grams 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.739
 as I say on the screen it looks great 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.630
 arlo you are going to see you are going to see videos of me 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.130
 testing the phone and as you see then 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.780
 It has a pretty good quality and it's 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.940
 no doubt about the latest phones that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.769
 I liked it more and we have more 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.940
 This device as I enrico is a 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.260
 device that is very well made 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.260
 It has some very good frames 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.819
 for this we have a 4 processor 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.180
 nuclei to 13 gigahertz and a gpu it 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.489
 called a gpu mali 400 bar so 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.159
 We have an internal memory of 8 gigs 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.810
 that also have expandable to 64 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:36.010
 gigas in the operating system part 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.530
 which is the part of us that most 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.599
 It is interesting to have the 4.4 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.640
 to say that it is pure and in addition to being pure 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.530
 They include a few applications 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.269
 of more applications that would be very 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.340
 interesting they have a camera of their own 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.900
 Okay, well, let's review, it has a 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.220
 device manager in case 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.470
 we lose and some other applications 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.480
 that do not make the device so it 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.040
 have many applications however 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.170
 have added some to customize it 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.519
 a little bit more and the truth is that it does not come 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.470
 it's never better to have these applications 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.569
 to complement a little what comes to 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.549
 be the pure android that we have the most 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.620
 inside we also have a ram gb that 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.390
 makes all applications 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.190
 run 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.840
 then they make all the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.850
 applications can work 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.440
 run perfectly without any kind of 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.090
 problem so with regards to the 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.950
 fluidity of the device because it would have 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.600
 give it a 10 because it is that we never have 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.310
 a problem neither when loading a video nor to 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.410
 play a game on opening any kind of 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.000
 application so that's what we have 8 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.250
 gigabytes of internal memory and we can 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.930
 expand until 64 so in the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.460
 section of the camera that is one of the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.410
 sections that I like the most about this 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.260
 device we have eight megapixels 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.900
 behind with his led flash important 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.270
 we have 5 megapixels in front with its 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.310
 flash led so now you are going to see them 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.290
 we are going to be able to become the fis with the 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.210
 screen or with the front camera 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.040
 and above we are going to be able to do 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.510
 with flash either party at night and 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.700
 over another thing that brings this very good 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.310
 phone for the front camera is that 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.530
 brings a wide angle with which it is worth 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.390
 we are going to be able to make ourselves a self and over 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.610
 with flash and we will be able to leave all 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.470
 the friends because it captures go very wide 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.270
 bullets and that for the purpose comes divine 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.480
 or poison corner tests of how it would be 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.920
 the flash and I'm sure you'll like it that way 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.090
 what 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.090
 here to the camera 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.110
 and here you have a picture made and nothing 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.210
 guys this would be part of the camera 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.770
 as I say I'm testing it and I 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.570
 It seems pretty good at 8 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.520
 megapixels behave very well 5 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.040
 megapixels in front I love how 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.350
 make them selfish with the flash everything 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.360
 It seems to be a success so it's very 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.550
 recommended for you do not include 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.590
 much more options or many more modes 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.020
 worth the camera in regards to 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.520
 software so we will not have much 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.050
 more out there but without doubt the quality of 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.820
 the camera can be pretty good 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.470
 apart from this in connections that 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.760
 we keep then we have 3g connection me 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.830
 I would have liked the phone to have 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.630
 4g pérez for this price as it is a 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.760
 phone that with this feature is 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:57.090
 which is pretty good has wifi n 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.820
 Bluetooth 4.0 also has also 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.199
 slot for the double sim without anything like 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.300
 see if we have a very very telephone 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:05.100
 complete that most stand out from this 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.410
 device that has a 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.360
 2000000 battery amps for 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.160
 this device is very good and 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.289
 so undoubtedly enduring a whole day 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.699
 so nothing guys this has been the 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.860
 review is a phone that I liked 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.180
 very much above all well how well 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.620
 the phone is taken care of from the 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.520
 section of the waterfall from energy 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.069
 system 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.509
 they offer a pretty good guarantee the 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.639
 phone that is very fluent 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.919
 awesome we will not have problems 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.229
 neither games and applications nor of any 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.580
 guy so nothing guys on phones is 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.169
 very very well at hand like you 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.210
 you have seen we can put it here in 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.590
 We can use one hand with two 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.300
 hands and landscape and is left 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.319
 perfect the phone we do not have nor in 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.240
 big phones or phones 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:44.430
 little ones do not make us uncomfortable and 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.289
 Also as I say around here it is very comfortable 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.530
 because it is made of such material 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:51.300
 like gummy is like the nexus so 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.039
 minus the nexus 4 here over here that is 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.940
 like it's a rubber band so it makes
