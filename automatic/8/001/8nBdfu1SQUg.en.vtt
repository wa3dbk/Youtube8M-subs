 Hello dear people are yes again and 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 today we are doing really delicious 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.359
 great kids country itself and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.189
 at that time already have the video 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.660
 seen that is also easily yourself 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.820
 to make that again here the case 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.560
 and I had thought the video show 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.660
 I'll see you once and when he sees me 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.099
 what did you want me to do after 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.710
 Again, just stay tuned and totally 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.160
 importantly shares the video and then start 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.610
 we now 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.989
 we start with peter couverture 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.300
 but you can also friendly quarters 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.500
 take for the kids coaches I suppose 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.840
 now bitter it is not quite there 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.350
 so sweet because the white chocolate 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.450
 Here is something sweeter and then we have 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.489
 a bit that balanced 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.090
 we start to pour and ours 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.340
 hollow body with this white chocolate 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.239
 with this black chocolate here and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.079
 is there we will than others 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 chop it a bit 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.149
 we 'll need you all about 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 100 grams are enough and you take please 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.869
 that amount of drawer for her 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.950
 want to do 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.260
 I'll give the exact quantities 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.510
 as always linked to an infobox 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.010
 my blog 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 and then I'm going to weaver that now 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.640
 here in a mold to melt the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.310
 black chocolate 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.720
 you need two forms one for the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 white chocolate to melt and one 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.159
 for the dark here and for the dark 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.840
 I'll just take a box shape 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.520
 and from a hot water bath 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.930
 or a sink with right 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.930
 hot water and because of the here 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.759
 Sheet metal is the guide to the heat of the picture 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 drawer melt in here, too, if 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.070
 which ditch secretly for fees only 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.799
 times as a tip on the edge and on the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.579
 I have a herd already 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.520
 marie so here is a melting chocolate 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.420
 round ball thing without we had now 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 again the white chocolate at the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.890
 namely white chocolate once the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.799
 complete 200 grams 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.350
 because we have a thicker white chocolate 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.950
 He sends him a clean signature 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.479
 built up 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.770
 even if we are still a bit tough 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.310
 give the rhine but I always do 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.470
 more than too little and if necessary could 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.379
 your rest hole for example as a dessert 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.099
 stir in a bit of red 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.260
 Example anamnesis hollow body form 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.760
 taken care of, I also link an infobox 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.440
 get on the scenario, it is not 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:35.340
 so expensive and I will now again the 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.790
 chocolate pour in like this 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:43.050
 where you have filled that I have you 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.790
 shown he goes with a brush and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.610
 it wipes out this way and that is 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.120
 now so funny looks like this 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.530
 a bit unstructured or a few 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.840
 raises fold and stuff does not matter 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.819
 So far, the inside of which is distributed 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.670
 evenly so here not too much 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.769
 chocolate in the cool inside is that 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.239
 my now we have this here or there 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.860
 Let's face it once and no vision 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.560
 The edges from folded so he does not 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.760
 your things are messed up the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.950
 I have chocolate game here 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.290
 Once cereal-that's the bid of 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.090
 quinoa but you get every dm you have 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.239
 but not necessarily if so 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.470
 or if he wants it right away 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.780
 but could on these kellogg's smacks 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.629
 could take everything mix of several 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.010
 Do cereals in it for oatmeal 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.510
 I did not just decide that 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.069
 because they are so small you see her 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.049
 his here is such a little tested 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.629
 small grains and the canucks with these 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.810
 so big and I do not want one 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.700
 Giant fat kids countries would be me 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.340
 you just know how to draw for it 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.920
 Drawer conceited not say flat 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.659
 hot and that's why I just have 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.519
 But as you said, you can turn this 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:53.610
 Use everything you like 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:58.890
 Now we have our form december 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:04.379
 Here we have our chocolate ours 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:08.790
 cereals and I go first 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:11.909
 put a tablespoon in here and let's listen 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.040
 that would simply be under principle 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.470
 it's enough 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.060
 Let's go and keep it up 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.289
 just clean as much as you want 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:28.949
 and then we go and distribute 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:33.330
 something of the mass here on ours 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.470
 Hard dark chocolate and turn and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.180
 it pans a bit with them 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.539
 mass runs nicely into the whole crevices 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:43.650
 you see that here 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:46.410
 then that knocked a bit that all 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.460
 Smooth you have seen the other 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:53.520
 side make that here again and 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.199
 then we are almost done when you are 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.280
 tip as resteverwerter yes only one 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.199
 a bit you but you can see her here 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:07.199
 and that just comes in now 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.460
 a praline form because then wasted 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.789
 you can not just do it like that 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.180
 Express cold eating to the tablets 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:17.789
 Now I have the finished one here 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.370
 children's coaching course that bigger 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.110
 will come children can you namely 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.960
 part 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.860
 you would have been four pieces 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.870
 got rid of it 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.340
 We have our points plan on 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.409
 you melted 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.199
 ultimately we are just above that 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:45.300
 over it you can rausholen so 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:48.240
 but planned I find the better are 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.220
 Here are my delicious kids countries 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.289
 finished and I start to solve her 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.720
 do you see the advantage of silicon very much 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:59.639
 flexible can be a billion times 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:03.620
 insert and here is very nice solve 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:06.810
 and everything you peel off flake off 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.340
 because we want to have the latte tables 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.909
 then we can not always only with 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.500
 a little bit after cut and knife 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:16.020
 I need the camera for you 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.750
 and then have here now and ethical 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:23.770
 and then we just become like that 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:27.160
 pushed out because maybe I am on the 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.500
 corners a little bit of chocolate videos 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.100
 You see, this is one 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.750
 is slightly marbled but is 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.640
 it does not matter 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:39.040
 Here you will be so beautiful that is the 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.420
 a tug I would say that 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.800
 do not whip up so much 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.710
 structure is destroyed or something 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.740
 we are impressed by churches with knives 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:54.030
 and cut off the edge once 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:57.600
 You see it so wonderful here 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:07:00.790
 wonderful beautiful panels are here 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.370
 and then they will hope for once 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:06.910
 I like you now and once 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:09.070
 share the video very important and we 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.510
 out sony has barely seen children themselves 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.010
 It's really easy when he does 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.990
 this pattern of these kids is buying 

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.100
 wanted to make himself the chocolate 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.780
 occurred and then one buys one 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.410
 silicone mold I link you one 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.690
 infobox 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.610
 otherwise just make this easy 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.810
 a plate or something and then you can 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.080
 you tailor it as you do 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.820
 I also want every case yes and who 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.729
 first after has sent me 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:33.370
 your photos on facebook in the facebook 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:35.740
 pin board or for example on instagram 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.150
 and of course there is delicious and yes 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.380
 I'm out: what hope 

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.380
