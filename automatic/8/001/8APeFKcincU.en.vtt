00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
in our next Call of Duty game so the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.910 
in our next Call of Duty game so the
number<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.360> thing<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.140> think<00:00:37.469> about<00:00:37.559> when<00:00:37.890> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
number one thing I think about when I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
number one thing I think about when I
think<00:00:38.160> about<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.149> firing<00:00:39.450> range<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
think about this is the firing range I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.389 
think about this is the firing range I
think<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.320> firing<00:00:40.590> range<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.920> by<00:00:41.100> far<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
think the firing range is by far the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.910 
think the firing range is by far the
best<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.090> coolest<00:00:42.480> innovation<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.350> sledge

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
best and coolest innovation that sledge

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.590 
best and coolest innovation that sledge
hammer<00:00:44.160> brought<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> table<00:00:45.149> with

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
hammer brought to the table with

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.810 
hammer brought to the table with
advanced<00:00:46.110> warfare<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:46.950> such<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> simple

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
advanced warfare it's such a simple

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.569 
advanced warfare it's such a simple
feature<00:00:48.059> but<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.780> was<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.200> nice<00:00:49.680> before<00:00:50.370> in

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
feature but it was so nice before in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.680

fire<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> game<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.659> thought<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> was

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
fire in game I just I thought it was

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.510 
fire in game I just I thought it was
really<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.530> cool<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.920> actually<00:01:26.100> used<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
quite a bit I think it was particularly

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.679 
quite a bit I think it was particularly
useful<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:30.030> able<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> test<00:01:30.479> out<00:01:30.659> new

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.449 
different lutes and stuff like that and
then<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.930> also<00:03:04.139> liked<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.739> weapon<00:03:05.040> variants

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
now some people didn't like weapon

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.750 
now some people didn't like weapon
variants<00:03:07.139> because<00:03:07.379> yes<00:03:07.620> some<00:03:07.859> variants<00:03:08.549> were

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
variants because yes some variants were

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.550 
variants because yes some variants were
better<00:03:09.030> than<00:03:09.209> others<00:03:09.540> how<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:09.959> think<00:03:10.379> they

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
better than others how I think they

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.229 
better than others how I think they
could<00:03:10.799> have<00:03:10.829> done<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.459> could<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:11.939> could<00:03:12.120> be

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
could have done it and could it could be

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.209 
could have done it and could it could be
done<00:03:12.419> next<00:03:12.750> time<00:03:12.900> around<00:03:13.049> is<00:03:13.349> have<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.859> weapon

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219 
done next time around is have a weapon

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.250 
done next time around is have a weapon
variants<00:03:14.609> that<00:03:14.669> are<00:03:14.849> strictly<00:03:15.180> cosmetic<00:03:16.049> they

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
variants that are strictly cosmetic they

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.409 
variants that are strictly cosmetic they
don't<00:03:16.530> change<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.129> damages<00:03:17.760> or<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:17.970> values

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
don't change the damages or the values

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.390 
don't change the damages or the values
of<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.690> weapons<00:03:19.049> they<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.799> changed<00:03:20.159> the<00:03:20.280> way

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
of the weapons they just changed the way

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.240 
of the weapons they just changed the way
they<00:03:20.579> look<00:03:20.849> aka<00:03:21.840> counter-strike<00:03:22.709> go<00:03:22.949> like<00:03:23.220> a

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
they look aka counter-strike go like a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.680 
they look aka counter-strike go like a
Counter<00:03:23.609> Strike<00:03:23.639> is<00:03:23.909> obviously<00:03:24.299> very<00:03:24.389> very

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
Counter Strike is obviously very very

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.839 
Counter Strike is obviously very very
successful<00:03:25.409> with<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.650> so<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:26.069> would<00:03:26.459> like<00:03:26.669> to

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
successful with that so I would like to

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.729 
successful with that so I would like to
see<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.239> in<00:03:27.629> some<00:03:28.019> way<00:03:28.260> shape<00:03:28.290> or<00:03:28.680> form

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
see that in some way shape or form

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.559 
see that in some way shape or form
although<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.189> don't<00:03:29.280> think<00:03:29.639> supply<00:03:30.150> drops<00:03:30.419> are

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
although I don't think supply drops are

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.539 
although I don't think supply drops are
coming<00:03:30.840> back<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.590> black<00:03:31.859> ops<00:03:32.069> 3<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.370> think

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
coming back to black ops 3 I think

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.589 
coming back to black ops 3 I think
that's<00:03:32.699> already<00:03:32.879> been<00:03:33.060> confirmed<00:03:33.389> to<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
that's already been confirmed to the

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.449 
that's already been confirmed to the
press<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.049> stuff<00:03:34.109> like<00:03:34.379> that<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.799> that's<00:03:34.979> just

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
press and stuff like that so that's just

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.649 
press and stuff like that so that's just
like<00:03:35.639> that's<00:03:35.939> not<00:03:36.120> my<00:03:36.239> thought<00:03:36.419> they<00:03:36.510> did

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
like that's not my thought they did

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.819 
like that's not my thought they did
right<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.870> would<00:03:37.109> have<00:03:37.199> liked<00:03:37.409> to<00:03:37.500> see<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.739> the

right I would have liked to see in the

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.170 
right I would have liked to see in the
game<00:03:37.979> but<00:03:38.370> it's<00:03:38.489> probably<00:03:38.729> not<00:03:38.939> gonna<00:03:39.090> be

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:56.009 
energy weapons we had the railgun

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.819 
energy weapons we had the railgun
snipers<00:03:56.729> we<00:03:56.909> had<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:57.870> EP<00:03:58.139> m3<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.650> shot

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
snipers we had the the EP m3 that shot

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.289 
snipers we had the the EP m3 that shot
the<00:03:58.949> direct<00:03:59.189> energy<00:03:59.340> we<00:03:59.639> have<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.939> new<00:04:00.090> you

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
the direct energy we have the new you

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.360 
the direct energy we have the new you
know<00:04:00.419> Magnum<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:01.109> shoots<00:04:01.349> like<00:04:01.680> super<00:04:02.220> super

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
know Magnum that shoots like super super

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.039 
know Magnum that shoots like super super
fast<00:04:02.699> like<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.419> I<00:04:03.509> feel<00:04:03.689> like<00:04:03.750> there's<00:04:03.989> a

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
fast like I just I feel like there's a

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.259 
fast like I just I feel like there's a
good<00:04:04.259> mix<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.889> weapons<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.430> advanced<00:04:05.879> warfare

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
good mix of weapons and advanced warfare

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.580 
good mix of weapons and advanced warfare
I<00:04:06.299> feel<00:04:06.509> like<00:04:06.629> there's<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.870> lot<00:04:07.079> of<00:04:07.229> different

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
I feel like there's a lot of different

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.990 
I feel like there's a lot of different
ones<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.769> can<00:04:07.829> use<00:04:07.949> I<00:04:08.250> think<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.609> general<00:04:08.790> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
ones you can use I think in general the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.580 
ones you can use I think in general the
weapon<00:04:09.419> balance<00:04:09.720> has<00:04:09.810> been<00:04:09.840> pretty<00:04:10.199> good<00:04:10.439> it

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
weapon balance has been pretty good it

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.170 
weapon balance has been pretty good it
started<00:04:10.919> off<00:04:11.009> you<00:04:11.370> know<00:04:11.489> kind<00:04:11.699> of<00:04:11.729> iffy<00:04:12.060> with

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
started off you know kind of iffy with

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.890 
started off you know kind of iffy with
the<00:04:12.269> asm1

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
the asm1

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.990 
the asm1
and<00:04:13.079> the<00:04:13.650> bal-27<00:04:13.979> those<00:04:14.430> are<00:04:14.549> still<00:04:14.699> probably

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
and the bal-27 those are still probably

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.879 
and the bal-27 those are still probably
the<00:04:15.060> two<00:04:15.209> best<00:04:15.419> but<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:16.259> know<00:04:16.380> you're<00:04:16.709> always

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
the two best but you know you're always

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.710 
the two best but you know you're always
gonna<00:04:17.070> have<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.310> best<00:04:17.549> weapon<00:04:18.060> there<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.509> can't

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
gonna have a best weapon there you can't

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.330 
gonna have a best weapon there you can't
avoid<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.259> think<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.859> all<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.220> other

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
avoid that I think that all the other

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.649 
avoid that I think that all the other
weapons<00:04:20.519> in<00:04:20.759> the<00:04:20.820> game<00:04:20.970> are<00:04:21.150> relatively

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
weapons in the game are relatively

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.930 
weapons in the game are relatively
usable<00:04:22.200> except<00:04:22.740> for<00:04:22.889> like<00:04:23.039> maybe<00:04:23.190> two<00:04:23.279> ep<00:04:23.610> m3

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
usable except for like maybe two ep m3

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.540 
usable except for like maybe two ep m3
the<00:04:24.060> MK<00:04:24.330> 14<00:04:24.750> stuff<00:04:24.990> like<00:04:25.169> that<00:04:25.349> but<00:04:25.919> yeah<00:04:26.520> I

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
the MK 14 stuff like that but yeah I

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.440 
the MK 14 stuff like that but yeah I
just<00:04:26.760> I

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
just I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.700 
just I
like<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.720> variety<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:28.140> weapons<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.560> was

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
like the variety of weapons that was

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.500 
like the variety of weapons that was
available<00:04:28.950> in<00:04:29.250> advanced<00:04:29.670> warfare<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.300> I

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
available in advanced warfare and I

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.580 
available in advanced warfare and I
think<00:04:30.660> we're<00:04:30.780> all<00:04:30.900> really<00:04:31.050> excited<00:04:31.440> when<00:04:31.560> we

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
think we're all really excited when we

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.050 
think we're all really excited when we
first<00:04:31.860> saw<00:04:32.010> like<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.280> em1<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.820> shot<00:04:32.970> the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
first saw like the em1 that shot the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.490 
first saw like the em1 that shot the
lasers<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.510> stuff<00:04:33.570> like<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.080> so<00:04:34.230> I'd<00:04:34.350> like

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
lasers and stuff like that so I'd like

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.160 
lasers and stuff like that so I'd like
to<00:04:34.680> see<00:04:34.830> some<00:04:35.130> sort<00:04:35.370> of<00:04:35.550> weapon<00:04:35.790> variation<00:04:36.660> in

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
to see some sort of weapon variation in

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.140 
to see some sort of weapon variation in
the<00:04:37.350> game<00:04:37.530> not<00:04:37.890> necessarily<00:04:38.490> lasers<00:04:39.000> and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
the game not necessarily lasers and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.910 
the game not necessarily lasers and
direct<00:04:39.420> energy<00:04:39.570> but<00:04:39.930> just<00:04:40.110> like<00:04:40.260> stuff<00:04:40.890> that's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
direct energy but just like stuff that's

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.350 
direct energy but just like stuff that's
a<00:04:41.190> little<00:04:41.370> bit<00:04:41.520> different<00:04:41.730> you<00:04:42.030> know<00:04:42.120> kind<00:04:42.330> of

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
a little bit different you know kind of

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.690 
a little bit different you know kind of
like<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:43.050> hybrid<00:04:43.380> weapons<00:04:43.920> or<00:04:44.130> the<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.640> know

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
like the hybrid weapons or the you know

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.880 
like the hybrid weapons or the you know
the<00:04:44.760> new<00:04:44.970> m1<00:04:45.180> iron<00:04:45.450> stuff<00:04:45.780> like<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.140> a<00:04:46.350> next

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
the new m1 iron stuff like that a next

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.160 
the new m1 iron stuff like that a next
step<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.940> fourth<00:04:48.210> thing<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.690> I<00:04:48.840> really

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
step the fourth thing that I really

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.020 
step the fourth thing that I really
liked<00:04:49.350> out<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.620> advanced<00:04:49.980> warfare<00:04:50.400> was<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
liked out of advanced warfare was the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.940 
liked out of advanced warfare was the
introduction<00:04:51.630> of<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.930> game<00:04:52.140> mode<00:04:52.320> uplink

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
introduction of the game mode uplink

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.590 
introduction of the game mode uplink
I<00:04:53.010> think<00:04:53.310> uplink<00:04:53.670> is<00:04:53.850> an<00:04:53.970> absolutely<00:04:54.420> amazing

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
I think uplink is an absolutely amazing

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.930 
I think uplink is an absolutely amazing
game<00:04:55.290> both<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.800> play<00:04:55.980> as<00:04:56.280> well<00:04:56.520> as<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.760> watch

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
game both to play as well as to watch

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.970 
game both to play as well as to watch
through<00:04:57.360> competitive<00:04:57.630> I<00:04:57.990> just<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.470> think<00:04:58.680> it's

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
through competitive I just I think it's

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.470 
through competitive I just I think it's
a<00:04:59.070> really<00:04:59.370> sweet<00:04:59.610> game<00:04:59.820> mode<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.120> I<00:05:00.270> think

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
a really sweet game mode and I think

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.550 
a really sweet game mode and I think
it's<00:05:00.600> something<00:05:00.780> we<00:05:00.900> haven't<00:05:01.260> really<00:05:01.350> seen

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
it's something we haven't really seen

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.020 
it's something we haven't really seen
before<00:05:01.890> I<00:05:01.920> would<00:05:02.220> love<00:05:02.460> to<00:05:02.610> see<00:05:02.760> something

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
before I would love to see something

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.480 
before I would love to see something
like<00:05:03.300> that<00:05:03.540> return<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:04.410> black<00:05:04.650> ops<00:05:04.860> 3<00:05:05.130> if<00:05:05.250> not

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
like that return to black ops 3 if not

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.220 
like that return to black ops 3 if not
uplink<00:05:06.000> just<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.330> itself<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.840> guy<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:06.990> would

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
uplink just in itself the guy I would

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.110 
uplink just in itself the guy I would
love<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.530> see<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.650> thing<00:05:07.920> come<00:05:08.100> back<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.520> and

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
love to see that thing come back and and

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.000 
love to see that thing come back and and
another<00:05:09.360> game<00:05:09.570> what<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:09.780> liked<00:05:09.990> was<00:05:10.110> was<00:05:10.770> one

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
another game what I liked was was one

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.320 
another game what I liked was was one
shot<00:05:11.280> no<00:05:11.490> grinning<00:05:11.790> this<00:05:11.910> wasn't<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.210> game

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
shot no grinning this wasn't the game

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.700 
shot no grinning this wasn't the game
right<00:05:12.600> when<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.870> first<00:05:13.050> came<00:05:13.260> out<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.440> thought

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
right when it first came out I thought

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.980

so like you're playing domination

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
so like you're playing domination
against<00:05:36.450> people<00:05:36.720> were<00:05:36.780> actually<00:05:36.960> playing

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:37.230 
against people were actually playing

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.570 
against people were actually playing
domination<00:05:37.800> not<00:05:37.830> sit<00:05:38.160> in<00:05:38.220> the<00:05:38.280> back<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.520> the

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
domination not sit in the back of the

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.730 
domination not sit in the back of the
map<00:05:38.700> trying<00:05:38.940> to<00:05:39.000> get<00:05:39.090> quick<00:05:39.270> scoped<00:05:39.510> so<00:05:39.780> no<00:05:40.560> I

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
map trying to get quick scoped so no I

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.840 
map trying to get quick scoped so no I
just<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.950> thought<00:05:41.250> that<00:05:41.370> was<00:05:41.460> kind<00:05:41.580> of<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.700> cool

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
just I thought that was kind of a cool

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.060 
just I thought that was kind of a cool
one<00:05:42.030> and<00:05:42.540> added<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.050> kind<00:05:43.230> of<00:05:43.290> the<00:05:43.470> kind<00:05:43.980> of

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
one and added to the kind of the kind of

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.620 
one and added to the kind of the kind of
diversity<00:05:44.400> of<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:44.970> game<00:05:45.150> modes<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.480> guess

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
diversity of the game modes I guess

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.190 
diversity of the game modes I guess
could<00:05:45.810> say<00:05:45.960> so

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
could say so

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.840 
could say so
