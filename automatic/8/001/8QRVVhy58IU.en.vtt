00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.800 

yeah<00:00:20.699> my<00:00:20.939> factories<00:00:21.570> on<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:23.390> my<00:00:24.390> units

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
yeah my factories on one and my units

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.720 
yeah my factories on one and my units
are<00:00:24.960> iron<00:00:25.320> two<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.160> three

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
are iron two and three

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.599 
are iron two and three
and<00:00:26.820> yes<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.960> trying<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.500> contain<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> root

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and yes it's trying to contain the root

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.280 
and yes it's trying to contain the root
locus<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.359> that's<00:00:31.759> not<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> big<00:00:33.030> deal<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.329> me

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.020 

because<00:00:37.290> those<00:00:37.440> tanks<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.160> raped<00:00:38.520> lurkers

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
because those tanks really raped lurkers

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.720 
because those tanks really raped lurkers
and<00:00:39.059> when<00:00:39.360> your<00:00:39.510> circ<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.590> don't<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.280> do

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
and when your circ you don't want to do

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540 
and when your circ you don't want to do
lurkers<00:00:42.270> against<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.809> metal<00:00:43.379> bills<00:00:43.649> because

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
lurkers against the metal bills because

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
lurkers against the metal bills because
they<00:00:44.700> suck<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.570> versus<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> metal<00:00:46.590> field<00:00:48.379> you

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
they suck it up versus a metal field you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.549 
they suck it up versus a metal field you
actually<00:00:49.710> should<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.629> many<00:00:51.629> high<00:00:51.870> risks<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
actually should do many high risks and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.389 
actually should do many high risks and
with<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:53.010> good<00:00:53.219> micro<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.660> can<00:00:55.399> do

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
with some good micro you can you can do

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.750 
with some good micro you can you can do
serious<00:00:56.910> damage<00:00:57.180> against<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> Terran<00:00:59.010> with

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
serious damage against a Terran with

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.229 
serious damage against a Terran with
this<00:00:59.969> metal<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.719> metal<00:01:01.079> field<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
this metal with this metal field so you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
this metal with this metal field so you
see<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.320> hard<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.739> counter<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> this

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
see it's really hard to counter the this

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.410 
see it's really hard to counter the this
build<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.189> don't<00:01:08.430> need<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:09.000> micro

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
build and you don't need so much micro

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.530 
build and you don't need so much micro
so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:10.189> advise<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> every<00:01:11.700> noob<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.210> every

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
so I advise to every noob and every

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
so I advise to every noob and every
average<00:01:13.320> player<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.040> should<00:01:14.220> do<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
average player that you should do the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.050 
average player that you should do the
metal<00:01:15.180> build<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.720> stand<00:01:15.990> instead<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
metal build in stand instead of the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.340 
metal build in stand instead of the
Marines<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.450> medic<00:01:19.290> built

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.470 

yeah<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:24.710> holes<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.460> also<00:01:25.700> always<00:01:26.060> want

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
yeah and the holes you also always want

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.290 
yeah and the holes you also always want
to<00:01:26.590> want<00:01:27.590> your<00:01:27.830> tanks<00:01:28.280> each<00:01:28.520> because<00:01:29.000> if

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
to want your tanks each because if

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.420 
to want your tanks each because if
you're<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.470> don't<00:01:30.650> want<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:31.040> enemy<00:01:31.220> to

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
you're you don't want the enemy to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.700 
you're you don't want the enemy to
surprise<00:01:32.060> you<00:01:32.390> while<00:01:32.840> you're<00:01:33.050> unsearched<00:01:33.470> and

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
surprise you while you're unsearched and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.890 
surprise you while you're unsearched and
then<00:01:33.890> that's<00:01:34.460> his<00:01:34.610> chance<00:01:34.970> when<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.330> when

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
then that's his chance when you when

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.440 
then that's his chance when you when
your<00:01:36.110> mini<00:01:36.890> tanks<00:01:37.430> are<00:01:37.610> not<00:01:37.760> siege<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.300> you

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
your mini tanks are not siege so you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.130 
your mini tanks are not siege so you
should<00:01:38.750> always<00:01:38.990> see<00:01:39.770> some<00:01:40.100> things<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:41.600> always

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
should always see some things and always

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.580 
should always see some things and always
you<00:01:42.740> should<00:01:42.770> always<00:01:43.070> know<00:01:43.220> where<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:45.200> enemy's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
you should always know where the enemy's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.990 
you should always know where the enemy's
army<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:46.540> because<00:01:47.540> you<00:01:47.660> don't<00:01:47.960> want<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.380> be<00:01:49.000> to

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
army is because you don't want to be to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.160 
army is because you don't want to be to
be<00:01:50.150> surprised<00:01:50.570> because<00:01:51.550> that's<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.910> Sox<00:01:53.750> only

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
be surprised because that's the Sox only

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.940 
be surprised because that's the Sox only
chance<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:58.790> don't<00:01:59.120> need<00:01:59.300> to<00:01:59.480> teach<00:02:00.410> my<00:02:00.620> tanks

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
chance I don't need to teach my tanks

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.640 
chance I don't need to teach my tanks
there<00:02:01.130> those<00:02:01.460> metal<00:02:02.150> source<00:02:02.810> metal<00:02:03.230> units

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
there those metal source metal units

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.370 
there those metal source metal units
rape<00:02:04.490> those<00:02:04.730> workers<00:02:08.140> yeah<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:09.230> they're

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
rape those workers yeah and they're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.110 
rape those workers yeah and they're
building<00:02:09.560> more<00:02:09.710> factories<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.369> have<00:02:10.640> some<00:02:10.850> over

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
building more factories I have some over

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300 
building more factories I have some over
minerals<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:11.690> includes<00:02:12.050> often<00:02:12.380> more<00:02:12.980> even

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
minerals so includes often more even

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.370 
minerals so includes often more even
more<00:02:13.340> factories<00:02:13.940> now<00:02:14.720> I'm<00:02:14.780> doing<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.080> Science

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
more factories now I'm doing a Science

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.650 
more factories now I'm doing a Science
Vessel<00:02:15.440> just<00:02:16.400> in<00:02:16.520> case<00:02:16.730> my<00:02:17.020> skin<00:02:18.340> will<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.490> out

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.230 

you'll<00:02:23.660> never<00:02:23.930> forget<00:02:24.260> for<00:02:24.470> supply<00:02:24.830> depots<00:02:25.310> if

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
you'll never forget for supply depots if

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.880 
you'll never forget for supply depots if
you<00:02:26.420> think<00:02:26.660> that<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.110> might<00:02:27.260> forget<00:02:27.650> them

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
you think that you might forget them

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.830 
you think that you might forget them
just<00:02:28.160> build<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:28.970> over<00:02:29.150> minerals<00:02:29.600> 10

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
just build and you have over minerals 10

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.440 
just build and you have over minerals 10
kills<00:02:30.160> three<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.340> them<00:02:31.550> at<00:02:31.850> once<00:02:34.330> because<00:02:35.330> if

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
kills three of them at once because if

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.479 
kills three of them at once because if
you<00:02:35.540> have<00:02:35.630> over<00:02:36.380> minerals<00:02:36.770> and<00:02:36.950> no<00:02:37.100> supply

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
you have over minerals and no supply

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.960 
you have over minerals and no supply
this<00:02:37.550> can<00:02:37.940> really<00:02:38.320> kill<00:02:39.320> your<00:02:39.500> macro<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.220> I've

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
this can really kill your macro and I've

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.770 
this can really kill your macro and I've
overseen<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.750> locker<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.410> get<00:02:42.620> some<00:02:42.830> damage

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
overseen this locker and get some damage

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.720 
overseen this locker and get some damage
but<00:02:47.110> that's<00:02:48.110> not<00:02:48.380> such<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.620> big<00:02:48.920> deal<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.460> their

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
but that's not such a big deal and their

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.050 
but that's not such a big deal and their
sales<00:02:50.120> coaches<00:02:50.690> come<00:02:51.340> he<00:02:52.340> already<00:02:52.550> knows<00:02:52.850> that

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
sales coaches come he already knows that

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.560 
sales coaches come he already knows that
I'm<00:02:53.210> doing<00:02:53.390> science<00:02:53.780> with<00:02:53.990> science<00:02:54.650> vessels

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
I'm doing science with science vessels

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.890 
I'm doing science with science vessels
it's<00:02:56.570> obviously<00:02:57.230> too<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:58.430> I'm<00:02:58.700> building<00:02:59.150> more

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's obviously too and I'm building more

it's obviously too and I'm building more
factors<00:03:00.290> having<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.710> have<00:03:00.980> some<00:03:01.160> trouble<00:03:01.490> with

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
factors having I have some trouble with

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.699 
factors having I have some trouble with
the<00:03:01.820> placement<00:03:02.600> because<00:03:03.260> there's<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:05.709> bad

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
the placement because there's it's a bad

the placement because there's it's a bad
building<00:03:07.220> placement<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:08.060> there

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
building placement and there

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.850 
building placement and there
yes<00:03:09.410> got<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:10.010> lockers<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:12.320> it's<00:03:12.500> building

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
yes got the lockers and it's building

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:22.170 
yes got the lockers and it's building
more<00:03:16.330> just<00:03:17.330> totally<00:03:17.810> commits<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.410> like<00:03:18.680> us<00:03:18.830> but

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.010 

okay<00:03:23.290> but<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.410> tanks<00:03:24.770> so<00:03:25.700> kill<00:03:26.300> them<00:03:26.450> now<00:03:26.660> and

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
okay but the tanks so kill them now and

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.040 
okay but the tanks so kill them now and
the<00:03:27.290> second<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.860> then<00:03:28.760> he<00:03:28.910> his<00:03:29.360> expansion<00:03:29.959> is

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
the second to then he his expansion is

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.670 
the second to then he his expansion is
defenseless

I'm<00:03:30.890> not<00:03:31.130> sure<00:03:31.310> yes<00:03:31.670> another<00:03:32.480> expansion<00:03:33.040> but

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
I'm not sure yes another expansion but

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.290 
I'm not sure yes another expansion but
it<00:03:34.250> won't<00:03:34.910> help<00:03:35.120> him<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:36.080> much<00:03:36.880> how<00:03:37.880> aspire

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
it won't help him so much how aspire

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.470 
it won't help him so much how aspire
will<00:03:38.630> be<00:03:38.750> down<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:40.160> I'm<00:03:40.340> still<00:03:40.610> McLean<00:03:41.090> just

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
will be down and I'm still McLean just

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.670 
will be down and I'm still McLean just
in<00:03:41.600> cases<00:03:41.989> if<00:03:42.440> he's<00:03:42.650> trying<00:03:42.980> any<00:03:44.680> surprising

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
in cases if he's trying any surprising

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.979 

and<00:03:59.090> if<00:03:59.900> you<00:04:00.050> do<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.319> build<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:00.980> will<00:04:01.989> lack

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
and if you do this build you will lack

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.350 
and if you do this build you will lack
of<00:04:03.319> gas

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
most of the tunnels so build many

most of the tunnels so build many
collide<00:04:08.090> so<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:08.569> you<00:04:08.750> have<00:04:09.080> really<00:04:09.290> no<00:04:09.590> gas<00:04:09.860> you

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
it to build open so many things because

it to build open so many things because

you don't have enough enough gas if you

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.760 
you don't have enough enough gas if you

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
aren't to expenses and it's also very

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.100 
aren't to expenses and it's also very
risky<00:04:30.979> to<00:04:31.400> expand<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:33.020> third<00:04:33.590> time<00:04:33.889> as<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.160> sir

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
risky to expand a third time as a sir

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.290 
risky to expand a third time as a sir
because<00:04:36.110> it's<00:04:36.290> hard<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.530> defend<00:04:37.300> two

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
because it's hard to defend two

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.920 
because it's hard to defend two
expansions<00:04:39.020> at<00:04:39.770> once<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:41.270> you're<00:04:41.450> quite<00:04:41.660> safe

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
expansions at once so you're quite safe

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.780 
expansions at once so you're quite safe
and<00:04:42.139> if<00:04:42.410> you<00:04:42.800> have<00:04:42.889> your<00:04:43.100> main<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.490> one

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790

and if you have your main and one
expansion<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.280> can<00:04:46.460> stay<00:04:46.669> there<00:04:46.880> and

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
expansion and you can stay there and

macro<00:04:48.050> units<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:49.100> then<00:04:49.340> you<00:04:49.490> can<00:04:50.470> go<00:04:51.470> out<00:04:51.500> and

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
macro units and then you can go out and

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.879 
macro units and then you can go out and
kill<00:04:52.430> your<00:04:53.090> enemy

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889

him and he's trying some desperate

him and he's trying some desperate
