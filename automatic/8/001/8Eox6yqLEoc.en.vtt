00:00:08.659 --> 00:00:11.659
 4 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.189
 there 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.069
 we have a good tournament and this one so that you feel comfortable here 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.530
 it should be a given 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.479
 it will become important 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.550
 as unique too 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.860
 but it should not be that people say okay now I want for that 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.450
 was treatment advised there is not with us it is so that people themselves 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.630
 lie down to sleep 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.630
 the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.950
 4 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.490
 who quite deliberately come to see the elected representatives of the world 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.040
 In this case, it will be perfect that we are not too 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.079
 So I'll probably be with the city 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.909
 Berlinale takes place in the middle class 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.589
 Aaron, that's why we are very central but I think it's not that 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.100
 Reason why people come to us 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.810
 we are now looking forward to evaluation 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.810
 the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.740
 but you should not enforce it is one of the most 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.560
 because they realize how big his models of the world call their word 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.579
 that is especially difficult to get the head 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.320
 The pale models had to introduce the Fortunen Bundeswehr the photos again 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.250
 shopping 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 and then you have the name below and the right professions that way 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.140
 Well it is in any case worth of course again a railing with 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.530
 Help this year 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.900
 again a little lottery inserted there it is a bit more 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.119
 Harvard flowers are deliberately artificial 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.439
 unlike so far 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.700
 we want to have this dollish to have more than hitherto almost has the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.600
 Fish that should be like that I did not want to hide them that there are no dead ones 

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.370
 it is all a bit to be settled but the bishop very interesting 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.810
 it is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.009
 So it's not easy as people imagine 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.399
 It was very difficult but there are also very nice 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.089
 St that had to work well I would now say no say
