in<00:00:14.480> this<00:00:14.690> video<00:00:15.080> we'll<00:00:15.290> look<00:00:15.320> at<00:00:15.500> cold<00:00:15.799> high

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
in this video we'll look at cold high

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.920 
in this video we'll look at cold high
pressures<00:00:16.550> and<00:00:16.910> why<00:00:17.090> is<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:17.420> important<00:00:17.900> for

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
pressures and why is so important for

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.440 
pressures and why is so important for
you<00:00:18.080> by<00:00:18.279> firstly<00:00:19.279> you<00:00:19.640> hopefully<00:00:20.060> know<00:00:20.240> what

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:20.450 
you by firstly you hopefully know what

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.760 
you by firstly you hopefully know what
pressures<00:00:20.810> your<00:00:20.990> front<00:00:21.259> and<00:00:21.380> rear<00:00:21.439> tires

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
pressures your front and rear tires

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.859 
pressures your front and rear tires
require<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:22.700> hopefully<00:00:23.360> you<00:00:23.450> know<00:00:23.599> that<00:00:23.630> the

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
require and hopefully you know that the

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.359 
require and hopefully you know that the
correct<00:00:24.170> pressure<00:00:24.439> is<00:00:24.650> not<00:00:24.830> listed<00:00:25.250> on<00:00:25.310> the

because of science
you<00:00:40.340> see<00:00:40.579> air<00:00:41.090> is<00:00:41.329> made<00:00:41.540> of<00:00:41.690> gases<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.410> gases

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
you see air is made of gases and gases

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.130 
you see air is made of gases and gases
expand<00:00:43.340> when<00:00:43.460> heated<00:00:43.570> so<00:00:44.570> once<00:00:44.780> you<00:00:44.870> start

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
expand when heated so once you start

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.750 
expand when heated so once you start
writing<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:46.010> actual<00:00:46.310> pressure<00:00:46.520> in<00:00:46.730> your

writing the actual pressure in your

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
tires will increase the manufactures

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.860 
tires will increase the manufactures
therefore<00:00:49.460> base<00:00:49.700> their<00:00:49.970> recommendations<00:00:50.720> on

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
therefore base their recommendations on

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.990 
therefore base their recommendations on
