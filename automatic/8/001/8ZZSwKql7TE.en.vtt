00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.590 
a thing um the reason I'm disappointed
is<00:05:35.110> because<00:05:35.770> I<00:05:35.920> was<00:05:36.190> actually<00:05:36.430> hoping<00:05:36.850> that

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
is because I was actually hoping that

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600 
is because I was actually hoping that
they<00:05:37.720> wouldn't<00:05:38.110> show<00:05:38.170> a<00:05:38.350> smog<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:38.980> that<00:05:39.460> he

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
they wouldn't show a smog and that he

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.150 
they wouldn't show a smog and that he
would<00:05:39.700> be<00:05:39.850> one<00:05:40.120> hundred<00:05:40.330> percent<00:05:40.890> secret<00:05:41.890> and

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
would be one hundred percent secret and

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.850 
would be one hundred percent secret and
that<00:05:42.190> we<00:05:42.850> wouldn't<00:05:43.090> know<00:05:43.600> what<00:05:44.500> he<00:05:44.590> looked

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
that we wouldn't know what he looked

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.159 
that we wouldn't know what he looked
like<00:05:44.980> or<00:05:45.490> anything<00:05:46.419> because<00:05:46.540> you<00:05:46.870> know<00:05:46.990> that
