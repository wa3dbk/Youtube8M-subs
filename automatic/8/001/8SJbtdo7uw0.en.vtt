00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
nowadays and keep it the way it is a

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.830 
nowadays and keep it the way it is a
another<00:02:23.799> thing<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.130> like<00:02:24.310> them<00:02:24.549> like<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.510> what

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
another thing I like them like is what

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.000 
another thing I like them like is what
you<00:02:25.930> saw<00:02:26.109> from<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.380> beginning<00:02:26.739> of<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:26.920> video

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
you saw from the beginning of the video

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.190 
you saw from the beginning of the video
when<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> stepped<00:02:27.790> off<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.120> boat<00:02:28.269> one<00:02:28.930> shot

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
when I stepped off the boat one shot

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.849 
when I stepped off the boat one shot
sniper<00:02:29.470> rifle<00:02:29.769> kills<00:02:29.950> good<00:02:30.609> job<00:02:31.000> dice<00:02:31.859> clap

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
sniper rifle kills good job dice clap

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.670 
sniper rifle kills good job dice clap
off<00:02:33.070> dance<00:02:33.690> okay<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:34.750> apparently<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.470> way<00:02:35.560> it

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
off dance okay so apparently the way it

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.890 
off dance okay so apparently the way it
works<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:36.100> certain<00:02:37.090> separate<00:02:37.390> rifles<00:02:37.690> has<00:02:37.870> a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
works is certain separate rifles has a

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.449 
works is certain separate rifles has a
chance<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.320> one<00:02:38.500> shot<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.859> as<00:02:39.040> certain

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
chance of one shot you as certain

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:40.200 
chance of one shot you as certain
distances

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
distances

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.540 
distances
so<00:02:40.810> if<00:02:41.140> you're<00:02:41.260> at<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> closer<00:02:41.800> range<00:02:42.220> or<00:02:42.460> you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
so if you're at a closer range or you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.890 
so if you're at a closer range or you
shoot<00:02:42.730> somebody<00:02:42.880> with<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.180> separate<00:02:43.540> fool<00:02:43.750> it's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
shoot somebody with a separate fool it's

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500 
shoot somebody with a separate fool it's
a<00:02:43.990> good<00:02:44.170> chance<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.560> die<00:02:44.800> off<00:02:44.950> one<00:02:45.190> bullet<00:02:45.510> and

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
a good chance to die off one bullet and

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.670 
a good chance to die off one bullet and
I<00:02:46.720> think<00:02:46.930> it<00:02:46.990> depends<00:02:47.230> on<00:02:47.290> what<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.500> shoot

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
I think it depends on what you shoot

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.070 
I think it depends on what you shoot
which<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.430> good<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.820> understand<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:49.960> if

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
which is good I understand that if

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.300 
which is good I understand that if
you're<00:02:50.260> at<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.380> distance<00:02:50.800> where<00:02:50.890> certain<00:02:51.070> was

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
you're at a distance where certain was

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.860 
you're at a distance where certain was
that<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.580> doesn't<00:02:52.000> drop<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.270> Wesley<00:02:52.570> because

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
that it doesn't drop you Wesley because

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.750 
that it doesn't drop you Wesley because
they<00:02:53.320> don't<00:02:53.470> work<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.860> get<00:02:54.040> do<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.550> to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
they don't work that we get do to to

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.030 
they don't work that we get do to to
defect<00:02:55.300> it<00:02:55.930> doesn't<00:02:56.470> work<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.590> way<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
defect it doesn't work that way on the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.550 
defect it doesn't work that way on the
top<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.180> a<00:02:58.210> good<00:02:58.450> move<00:02:58.660> i<00:02:58.870> dice<00:02:59.110> I<00:02:59.320> like

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
top so that is a good move i dice I like

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.440 
top so that is a good move i dice I like
that<00:02:59.590> do<00:02:59.950> not<00:03:00.100> nerve<00:03:00.400> sniper<00:03:00.760> rifles<00:03:01.210> like<00:03:01.300> you

this<00:05:35.050> what<00:05:35.230> I<00:05:35.260> couldn't<00:05:35.590> do<00:05:35.680> it<00:05:35.710> on

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
this what I couldn't do it on

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.910 
this what I couldn't do it on
battlefield<00:05:36.310> 3<00:05:36.610> they<00:05:37.540> made<00:05:37.720> it<00:05:37.840> sort<00:05:38.050> of<00:05:38.140> the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
battlefield 3 they made it sort of the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.070 
battlefield 3 they made it sort of the
shade<00:05:39.190> gun<00:05:39.460> has<00:05:39.700> a<00:05:39.730> bigger<00:05:40.090> hit<00:05:40.360> box<00:05:40.660> on<00:05:40.870> there

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
shade gun has a bigger hit box on there

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.990 
shade gun has a bigger hit box on there

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
so it actually hits it doesn't miss when

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.480 
so it actually hits it doesn't miss when
you<00:05:43.030> shooting<00:05:43.420> right<00:05:43.570> at<00:05:43.600> people<00:05:43.840> so<00:05:44.770> good<00:05:45.280> job

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 
around a corner because all it is is

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.409 
around a corner because all it is is
still<00:06:12.280> just<00:06:12.520> getting<00:06:12.700> chipped<00:06:13.060> away<00:06:13.120> it's

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
still not around the corner so will it

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.690 
still not around the corner so will it
be<00:06:15.130> late<00:06:15.370> now<00:06:16.360> or<00:06:16.720> the<00:06:16.870> xbox<00:06:17.680> one<00:06:17.980> this<00:06:18.460> is<00:06:18.580> why

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
be late now or the xbox one this is why

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.370 
be late now or the xbox one this is why
i<00:06:18.730> say<00:06:19.030> that<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.540> controls<00:06:19.810> are<00:06:20.050> better<00:06:20.230> or

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.380 
i say that the controls are better or

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.250 
i say that the controls are better or
that<00:06:20.410> because<00:06:20.800> the<00:06:20.980> connect<00:06:21.370> itself<00:06:21.790> actually

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
that because the connect itself actually

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.360 
that because the connect itself actually
corresponds<00:06:23.260> to<00:06:23.440> your<00:06:23.500> movie<00:06:23.680> so<00:06:23.890> i<00:06:23.950> can<00:06:24.190> look

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370

play battlefield 3 decor controls or

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.360

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370 
a little bit compared to battlefield 3

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.100 
a little bit compared to battlefield 3
so<00:07:16.580> it<00:07:16.700> does<00:07:16.880> feel<00:07:17.180> a<00:07:17.210> little<00:07:17.300> bit<00:07:17.630> better<00:07:17.840> but

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.870 
so it does feel a little bit better but
it<00:07:18.260> still<00:07:18.560> feels<00:07:18.919> like<00:07:19.070> battlefield<00:07:19.580> 3<00:07:19.730> if<00:07:19.820> you
