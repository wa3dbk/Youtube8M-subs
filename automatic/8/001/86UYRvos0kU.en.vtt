is doing that and this thing is not
showing<00:02:49.470> up<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.070> let's<00:02:50.280> do<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> run<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.730> this

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
showing up so let's do a run on this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.990 
showing up so let's do a run on this
stealth<00:02:51.360> thing<00:02:51.830> let's<00:02:52.830> find<00:02:53.100> our<00:02:53.280> armor<00:02:53.700> that

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
stealth thing let's find our armor that

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.800 
stealth thing let's find our armor that
the<00:02:54.120> one<00:02:54.300> we<00:02:54.420> just<00:02:54.450> got<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:55.080> bullet<00:02:55.680> proof

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
the one we just got the bullet proof

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:06.320 
the one we just got the bullet proof
spider<00:02:57.810> armor<00:02:59.900> put<00:03:00.900> some<00:03:01.080> guys<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.730> let's

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
spider armor put some guys in and let's

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.790 
spider armor put some guys in and let's
specify<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.750> go<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.940> all<00:03:08.940> right<00:03:09.000> so<00:03:09.239> here<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.569> is

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
specify to go in all right so here it is

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.850 
specify to go in all right so here it is
and<00:03:10.800> we're<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.280> gonna<00:03:11.459> start<00:03:11.880> running

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.830 

so<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.459> bulletproof<00:03:19.970> spider<00:03:20.540> armor

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
so this is the bulletproof spider armor

and up towards his shoulder as well as
down<00:04:12.920> his<00:04:13.310> arms<00:04:14.889> let's<00:04:15.889> see<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.489> design<00:04:16.729> of

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
down his arms let's see the design of

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.360 
down his arms let's see the design of
the<00:04:17.120> spider<00:04:17.449> armor<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.169> doesn't<00:04:18.560> looks<00:04:19.250> of

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
the spider armor and it doesn't looks of

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.909 
the spider armor and it doesn't looks of
rubbery<00:04:19.729> I<00:04:20.079> mean<00:04:21.079> I<00:04:21.109> guess<00:04:21.320> it's<00:04:21.530> made<00:04:21.680> out<00:04:21.889> of

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
rubbery I mean I guess it's made out of

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.680 
rubbery I mean I guess it's made out of
some<00:04:22.190> sort<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.520> material<00:04:23.120> that's<00:04:23.300> why<00:04:25.690> also

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
some sort of material that's why also

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.320 
some sort of material that's why also
