contemplating changing my macbook air
and<00:00:58.590> maybe<00:00:59.520> switching<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.329> us<00:01:00.449> something

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and maybe switching to us something

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.080 
and maybe switching to us something
smaller<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.440> realized<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.760> could<00:01:03.059> actually

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
smaller I realized that I could actually

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.130 
smaller I realized that I could actually
try<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.870> use<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.799> device<00:01:05.430> like<00:01:06.270> an<00:01:06.420> iPad<00:01:06.510> which

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
try to use a device like an iPad which

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
try to use a device like an iPad which
is<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.560> lot<00:01:08.159> smaller<00:01:08.430> than<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.270> MacBook<00:01:09.450> Air

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
is a lot smaller than the MacBook Air

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.590 
is a lot smaller than the MacBook Air
but<00:01:10.080> still<00:01:10.979> has<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> pretty<00:01:11.850> massive<00:01:12.060> 10-inch

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
but still has a pretty massive 10-inch

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.050 
but still has a pretty massive 10-inch
screen<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.040> did<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.490> gonna<00:01:14.820> switch

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
screen so what I did I'm gonna switch

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.510 
screen so what I did I'm gonna switch
two<00:01:15.420> years<00:01:15.600> ago<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.170> when<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.799> discovered<00:01:17.280> were

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
two years ago and when I discovered were

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.550 
two years ago and when I discovered were
three<00:01:17.880> things<00:01:18.299> first<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:18.990> portability

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
three things first of all portability

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
three things first of all portability
battery<00:01:19.860> life<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.549> even<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.689> best

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
battery life you know even here the best

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.380 
battery life you know even here the best
part<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.439> power<00:01:22.860> indicator<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.180> says

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
part is the power indicator if it says

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.960 
part is the power indicator if it says
20%<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.890> doesn't<00:01:26.130> mean<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> look<00:01:26.670> for<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
20% it doesn't mean I have to look for a

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
20% it doesn't mean I have to look for a
power<00:01:27.210> outlet<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.659> means<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.470> still<00:01:28.770> two

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
power outlet it means I have still two

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.929 
power outlet it means I have still two
hours<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.670> choose<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.450> work<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.170> machine

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
hours of choose to work on this machine

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.210 
hours of choose to work on this machine
second<00:01:32.939> thing<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.600> keyboard<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.439> optional<00:01:34.860> as

can<00:02:15.440> do<00:02:15.500> all<00:02:15.620> these<00:02:15.740> things<00:02:15.800> without<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
can do all these things without the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.980 
can do all these things without the
keyboard<00:02:16.850> we<00:02:16.970> don't<00:02:17.210> need<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.570> keyboard<00:02:17.720> all

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
to the apps first and then these apps

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.170 
to the apps first and then these apps
are<00:04:06.320> handling<00:04:06.890> all<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.160> objects<00:04:07.610> and<00:04:07.760> now

with the iOS 8 is going to be even
better<00:04:10.070> because<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.730> apps<00:04:10.910> will<00:04:11.180> talk<00:04:11.540> to

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
better because the apps will talk to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.539 
better because the apps will talk to
each<00:04:11.720> other<00:04:11.900> anymore<00:04:12.049> so<00:04:12.769> it's<00:04:12.920> gonna<00:04:13.010> be<00:04:13.220> you

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
together they I have access to the same

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.320 
together they I have access to the same
data<00:05:23.010> the<00:05:23.610> same<00:05:23.760> I<00:05:23.910> thought<00:05:24.120> they'd<00:05:24.300> have

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
data the same I thought they'd have

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.000 
data the same I thought they'd have
Dropbox<00:05:24.660> a<00:05:24.930> forever<00:05:25.229> a<00:05:25.320> bit<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:25.530> lost<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.889> data

Dropbox a forever a bit I lost the data
so<00:05:26.520> I<00:05:26.729> can<00:05:26.940> only<00:05:27.060> use<00:05:27.419> them<00:05:27.630> as<00:05:27.840> two<00:05:28.020> screens

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
so I can only use them as two screens

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.110 
so I can only use them as two screens
and<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.620> can<00:05:28.800> work<00:05:28.919> work<00:05:29.340> work<00:05:29.520> with<00:05:29.700> them<00:05:29.850> and

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
computers together you know compared to
