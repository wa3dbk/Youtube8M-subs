I<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.729> necessarily<00:01:21.420> believe<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> was

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
I don't necessarily believe that it was

I don't necessarily believe that it was
as<00:01:22.830> bad<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> final<00:01:23.970> result<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.780> ice

as bad as the final result on the ice

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.310 
as bad as the final result on the ice
appears<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> eye<00:01:26.939> because<00:01:27.600> at<00:01:27.900> the

appears to be to the eye because at the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.620 
appears to be to the eye because at the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.840 
hit his face into the glass was on a
very<00:01:33.299> rare<00:01:33.659> part<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:35.009> glass<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
very rare part of the glass and the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.399 
very rare part of the glass and the
boards<00:01:36.210> which<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> turnbuckle<00:01:37.320> on

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
boards which was in the turnbuckle on

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
boards which was in the turnbuckle on
the<00:01:37.530> end<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.340> Bruins<00:01:38.670> bench<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.000> mean<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the end of the Bruins bench I mean the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.520 
the end of the Bruins bench I mean the
odds<00:01:39.390> of<00:01:39.659> someone<00:01:39.840> getting<00:01:40.049> killed<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
odds of someone getting killed at that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.800 
odds of someone getting killed at that
spot<00:01:40.799> are<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.189> slim<00:01:41.610> it's<00:01:41.880> absolutely<00:01:42.360> absurd

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
spot are so slim it's absolutely absurd

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810 
spot are so slim it's absolutely absurd
but<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.380> guess<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.920> there<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.520> does

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
but I guess it is there and it does

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.420 
but I guess it is there and it does
happen<00:01:45.060> once<00:01:45.479> every<00:01:45.689> five<00:01:46.560> six<00:01:46.920> seven<00:01:47.100> ten

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
happen once every five six seven ten

I'm gonna give him the benefit of the
doubt<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.000> look<00:02:33.240> at<00:02:33.390> where<00:02:33.540> he<00:02:33.750> hid<00:02:33.990> it

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140

doubt it but you look at where he hid it
it<00:02:34.530> appeared<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.220> he<00:02:35.340> was<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.670> short<00:02:35.910> of

shoving them a little bit his goals

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.229 
shoving them a little bit his goals
probably<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.459> him<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> boards<00:02:39.060> right

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239

the motion of the both going forward and
skated<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.250> believe<00:02:59.580> was<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.760> predominant

reason<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.350> see<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.709> aftermath<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.370> his

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
reason that we see the aftermath of his

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.310 
reason that we see the aftermath of his
face<00:03:02.790> hitting<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.209> glass<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.690> fall<00:03:03.930> into<00:03:04.200> the

face hitting the glass and fall into the
ice<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.250> right<00:03:05.580> then<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.150> don't

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
ice so right then and there I don't

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.600 
ice so right then and there I don't
think<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.780> say<00:03:06.959> oh<00:03:06.989> as<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.440> dirty<00:03:07.769> shot<00:03:08.370> by

20 games find a half a billion dollars
like<00:03:15.209> I've<00:03:15.360> said<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.750> past<00:03:15.810> brother<00:03:16.350> guys

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
like I've said in the past brother guys

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.350 
like I've said in the past brother guys
I<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.549> little<00:03:17.670> bit<00:03:17.820> different<00:03:18.209> of<00:03:18.239> a

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
I think it's a little bit different of a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.569 
I think it's a little bit different of a
circumstance<00:03:19.019> here<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.890> you<00:03:20.070> just<00:03:20.250> didn't

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
circumstance here and if you just didn't

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.190 
circumstance here and if you just didn't
him<00:03:20.670> on<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> boards<00:03:21.209> he<00:03:21.329> never<00:03:21.570> felt<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.140> way

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
him on the boards he never felt that way

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.350 
him on the boards he never felt that way
I<00:03:22.380> bet<00:03:22.769> you<00:03:22.890> he<00:03:23.040> wouldn't<00:03:23.250> even<00:03:23.370> receive<00:03:23.820> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
I bet you he wouldn't even receive the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.030 
I bet you he wouldn't even receive the
odd<00:03:24.600> game<00:03:24.840> suspension<00:03:25.530> might<00:03:25.709> have<00:03:25.829> got<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
odd game suspension might have got a

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.920 
odd game suspension might have got a
two-minute<00:03:26.549> boarding<00:03:26.910> penalty<00:03:27.570> or

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
two-minute boarding penalty or

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.509 
two-minute boarding penalty or
five-minute<00:03:28.290> major<00:03:28.560> it's<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.100> because<00:03:29.400> of

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
five-minute major it's just because of

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.280 
five-minute major it's just because of
the<00:03:29.579> fact<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.090> way<00:03:30.269> he<00:03:30.480> fell<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
the fact that the way he fell and the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.259 
the fact that the way he fell and the
allusion<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.829> the<00:03:31.950> referees<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.670> often

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
allusion to the referees I often

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.789 
allusion to the referees I often
dictates<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.959> way<00:03:34.260> they're<00:03:34.440> going<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.620> call

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
dictates the way they're going to call

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.470 
dictates the way they're going to call
the<00:03:34.980> game<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.610> can't<00:03:35.910> necessarily<00:03:36.060> even

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
the game and you can't necessarily even

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.910 
the game and you can't necessarily even
blame<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.810> refs<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.079> mean<00:03:37.230> this<00:03:37.320> stuff<00:03:37.530> happens

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
blame the refs I mean this stuff happens

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.130 
blame the refs I mean this stuff happens
like<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.760> quick<00:03:39.120> second<00:03:39.660> they<00:03:39.840> don't

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
like that and a quick second they don't

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.080 
like that and a quick second they don't
exactly<00:03:40.620> have<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.100> time<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.579> start<00:03:42.030> thinking

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
exactly have the time to start thinking

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.030 
exactly have the time to start thinking
in<00:03:42.540> their<00:03:42.660> mind<00:03:42.720> about<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.350> intention<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.950> the

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
in their mind about the intention of the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.890 
in their mind about the intention of the
player<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:44.850> it's<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:45.060> lot<00:03:45.239> easier<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.600> make<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
player so it's a lot easier to make the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.630 
player so it's a lot easier to make the
judgment<00:03:46.350> call<00:03:46.500> based<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.920> what<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.130> see<00:03:47.430> on

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
judgment call based on what you see on

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.090 
judgment call based on what you see on
the<00:03:47.670> ice<00:03:47.970> after<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.840> fact<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.890> will<00:03:49.980> be

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
the ice after the fact so it will be

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.830 
the ice after the fact so it will be
very<00:03:50.250> interesting<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.850> see<00:03:51.120> here<00:03:51.420> I'm<00:03:51.630> going

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
very interesting to see here I'm going

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.509 
very interesting to see here I'm going
to<00:03:51.930> keep<00:03:52.049> my<00:03:52.200> mouth<00:03:52.380> shut<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.950> criticize

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
to keep my mouth shut and not criticize

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.580 
to keep my mouth shut and not criticize
the<00:03:53.549> NHL<00:03:54.180> here<00:03:54.480> because<00:03:55.079> at<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> end<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
the NHL here because at the end of the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.229 
the NHL here because at the end of the
day<00:03:55.739> it's<00:03:55.920> never<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.250> bad<00:03:56.280> thing<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.790> over

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
suspend somebody when it comes to hit

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.970 
suspend somebody when it comes to hit
that's<00:04:00.079> debatable<00:04:01.079> when<00:04:01.500> it<00:04:01.590> comes<00:04:01.829> to

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
that's debatable when it comes to

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.890 
that's debatable when it comes to
whether<00:04:02.160> or<00:04:02.250> not<00:04:02.310> cheap<00:04:02.790> and<00:04:03.030> it's<00:04:03.329> definitely

whether or not cheap and it's definitely

whether or not cheap and it's definitely
something<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.380> they've<00:04:05.160> never<00:04:05.280> really<00:04:05.670> done

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
something that they've never really done

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.520 
something that they've never really done
they've<00:04:06.120> always<00:04:06.239> taken<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.690> lenient<00:04:07.170> side<00:04:07.380> of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
they've always taken the lenient side of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.229 
they've always taken the lenient side of
things<00:04:07.680> here<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.100> if<00:04:08.160> he<00:04:08.280> gets<00:04:08.489> off<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.910> little

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
things here and if he gets off a little

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.400 
things here and if he gets off a little
bit<00:04:09.420> linear<00:04:09.780> I'm<00:04:09.900> not<00:04:10.079> going<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.320> be<00:04:10.380> that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
bit linear I'm not going to be that

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.439 
bit linear I'm not going to be that
pissed<00:04:10.799> off<00:04:10.980> about<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.430> because<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.970> don't

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
pissed off about it because I don't

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:14.150 
pissed off about it because I don't
really<00:04:12.600> think<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:13.230> because<00:04:13.560> all<00:04:13.680> that<00:04:13.859> dirty

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
really think that because all that dirty

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.500 
really think that because all that dirty
it<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:14.669> happened<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.480> timing

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
it just so happened that the timing

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.180 
it just so happened that the timing
spacing<00:04:17.020> of<00:04:17.140> it<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> size<00:04:17.770> and<00:04:18.100> you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
spacing of it and the size and you

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.130 
spacing of it and the size and you
factor<00:04:18.640> all<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.970> in<00:04:19.120> and<00:04:19.300> it<00:04:19.720> was<00:04:19.840> just<00:04:20.050> a

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
factor all that in and it was just a

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.190 
factor all that in and it was just a
very<00:04:20.170> strange<00:04:21.010> way<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.940> patriotic<00:04:22.630> face<00:04:22.900> fell

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
very strange way the patriotic face fell

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.010 
very strange way the patriotic face fell
in<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.400> ice<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.700> on<00:04:24.850> into<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.570> glass
