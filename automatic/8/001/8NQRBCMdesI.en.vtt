00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.600
 coleman hooligan 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.830
 it is important to note that currently the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.889
 Street is sold in three sizes 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.710
 different hooligan 2 she does not have to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.920
 three and four have an area of 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.950
 advance in this video I'll show you the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.680
 hooligan 3 but hooligan 4 is very 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.750
 seemed just a little bigger 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.530
 as always always the glue stalls 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.590
 Come on in small shots this is a tent to 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.590
 you in the car field with the family at 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.970
 the inside of the package with 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.500
 already extending the passenger compartment in the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.829
 floor you can see that a very 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.329
 space the support rods have 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.489
 a very good thickness 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.960
 What's interesting is that the tent 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.760
 holds and strong winds 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.360
 and these bags do not touch during 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.770
 wind as any booth of blu a 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.819
 rod assembly 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:12.350
 it's very simple a very large tent 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.350
 You will need help to vote. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.810
 fit the support rods in the 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.830
 the ends of the tent this value 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.830
 also fair 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.930
 here you can get an idea of ​​the size 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.040
 of the height tent 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.040
 remembering that the one I 'm showing is 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.990
 hooligan 3 to 4 a little bigger 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.710
 a tent with a large area of 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.420
 very good ventilation for hot climates 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.220
 with the street lamenha small rod for 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.220
 you set up a ventilation area 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.720
 fitting the area of dipstick 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.720
 ventilation 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:08.100
 Now I'm going to start assembling the 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.100
 advance 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:25.120
 as always the coleman steel stakes 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:26.950
 are of good quality and are resistant to 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.170
 As you went riding the tent 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.820
 that is, he places the stakes because 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.959
 if the wind starts 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.959
 you will not have any problems 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.630
 the ends on the ceiling as well as the 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.890
 plastic parts to fit into the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.050
 rings here 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.530
 this speeds up the process of 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:57.940
 assembly of the cast coming together on 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.120

 usually from about up to more 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.739
 boring 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.549
 Okay, the tent with the morning dew. 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.319
 I did not arrive at all because 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.099
 I 'm in the dry season here I am 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.290
 shooting 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.650
 and the weather is very calm without 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.049
 winds and rain to fit the rods 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.239
 are you going to need to do 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.650
 some force that is needed one 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.989
 second person is making adjustments 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.629
 required in the passenger compartment so that you 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.200
 can correctly fit the rods 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.599
 without damaging them this tent has many 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.459
 details designed for the air to heal 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.909
 so that the air between more easily 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.920
 see the size of this air inlet 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.810
 side 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.829
 this type of construction is of the two 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.829
 sides of the tent 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.260

 there are several points with 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:53.950
 where the derailleur rod should be 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:56.290
