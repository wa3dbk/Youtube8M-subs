00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
thank you very much for watching this

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.940 
thank you very much for watching this
video<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.870> I<00:04:41.900> decided<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.440> know<00:04:42.530> let's<00:04:42.590> just

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
video so I decided you know let's just

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.400 
video so I decided you know let's just
jump<00:04:43.130> across<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.820> I<00:04:44.270> think<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.229> is<00:04:45.320> the

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
jump across and I think this is the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.500 
jump across and I think this is the
safest<00:04:45.590> way<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.889> approach<00:04:46.250> this<00:04:46.520> watch<00:04:47.300> out

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
safest way to approach this watch out

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.300 
safest way to approach this watch out
for<00:04:47.660> those<00:04:47.750> swipes<00:04:48.020> if<00:04:48.200> you<00:04:48.320> run<00:04:48.530> right<00:04:48.800> here

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
for those swipes if you run right here

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.190 
for those swipes if you run right here
and<00:04:49.550> jump<00:04:49.789> this<00:04:50.030> is<00:04:50.180> hard<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.450> do<00:04:50.570> just<00:04:51.050> trust

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
and jump this is hard to do just trust

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.870 
and jump this is hard to do just trust
me<00:04:51.350> this<00:04:51.470> is<00:04:51.560> really<00:04:51.740> hard<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:51.979> do<00:04:52.160> you<00:04:52.669> get<00:04:52.789> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
me this is really hard to do you get the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.550 
me this is really hard to do you get the
