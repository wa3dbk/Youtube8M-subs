00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
show you the difference in size between

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.040 
show you the difference in size between
a<00:00:06.660> 2.2<00:00:07.620> boogie<00:00:07.950> tire<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:09.210> short<00:00:09.750> course

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
a 2.2 boogie tire and a short course

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.919 
a 2.2 boogie tire and a short course

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
truck tire here we got D anaconda a rear

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.810 
truck tire here we got D anaconda a rear
tire<00:00:16.320> for<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.369> Bandit<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.470> D<00:00:21.140> slash<00:00:22.140> tire<00:00:22.949> as

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
tire for my Bandit and D slash tire as

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.179 
tire for my Bandit and D slash tire as
you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.869> see<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> difference<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.769> diameter

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
you can see the difference in diameter

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.089 
you can see the difference in diameter
is<00:00:26.880> huge<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.960> mean<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.740> tell<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
is huge I mean you can tell the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.910 
is huge I mean you can tell the
difference<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:30.420> when<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.990> take<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> look<00:00:31.619> from

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
difference but when we take a look from

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.920 
difference but when we take a look from
above<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.380> see<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:35.660> basically<00:00:36.660> there's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
above you can see the basically there's

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.229 
above you can see the basically there's
no<00:00:37.140> difference<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.980> width

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
no difference in width

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.290 
no difference in width
that's<00:00:40.020> why<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.230> can<00:00:40.559> put<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:40.950> tires<00:00:41.309> into

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that's why you can put these tires into

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.639 
that's why you can put these tires into
the<00:00:42.540> Vandal<00:00:42.899> without<00:00:43.230> any<00:00:43.440> modifications<00:00:45.649> now

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the Vandal without any modifications now

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.840 
the Vandal without any modifications now
I<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> say<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:50.430> band<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
I do have to say that the my band it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.459 
I do have to say that the my band it
handles<00:00:51.329> better<00:00:51.710> with<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.010> anaconda<00:00:54.469> because

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
handles better with the anaconda because

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.240 
handles better with the anaconda because
you<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.010> take<00:00:56.190> turns<00:00:56.579> at<00:00:57.030> high<00:00:57.090> speed<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.250> it

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you can take turns at high speed and it

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.770 
you can take turns at high speed and it
won't<00:00:59.609> flip<00:00:59.910> over<00:01:00.980> but<00:01:01.980> when<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.579> take<00:01:02.879> tight

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
won't flip over but when you take tight

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.810 
won't flip over but when you take tight
turns<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.010> slash<00:01:05.790> tire<00:01:06.470> you<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:08.400> flip

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
turns with the slash tire you will flip

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.990 
turns with the slash tire you will flip
over<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.600> mean<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.740> problem<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.400> never<00:01:11.700> had

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
over I mean that's a problem I never had

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.890 
over I mean that's a problem I never had
before<00:01:13.280> bogies<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.549> well<00:01:14.850> known<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.479> for

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
before bogies are well known for for

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.890 
before bogies are well known for for
handling<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.619> stability<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:18.119> once<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.689> put

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
handling and stability but once you put

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.490 
handling and stability but once you put
this<00:01:19.229> big<00:01:19.560> tire<00:01:21.080> it<00:01:22.080> will<00:01:22.320> start<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.920> flip<00:01:23.159> over

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
this big tire it will start to flip over

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
this big tire it will start to flip over
the<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:26.520> huge<00:01:27.170> advantage<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.380> these<00:01:28.619> used

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the the huge advantage of these used

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.569 
the the huge advantage of these used
huge<00:01:29.640> tires<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.619> when<00:01:31.619> you're<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:32.100> over
