00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
want to pull it across like this and see

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.149 
want to pull it across like this and see
if<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.159> trap<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> bubble<00:01:45.000> inside<00:01:45.860> if<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:47.009> can

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
if I can trap the bubble inside if I can

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.130 
if I can trap the bubble inside if I can
pull<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.430> across<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.090> give<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:48.720> trap

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
pull it across and give a little trap

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.440 
pull it across and give a little trap
that's<00:01:49.409> inside<00:01:49.850> see<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.149> put<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
that's inside see if you can put a

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.899 
that's inside see if you can put a
little<00:01:51.750> trap<00:01:52.110> that's<00:01:52.350> over<00:01:52.619> there's<00:01:53.220> one<00:01:53.579> for

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
little trap that's over there's one for

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.950 
little trap that's over there's one for
us<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.270> that's<00:01:54.450> kind<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:54.810> we're

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
us and so that's kind of what we're

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.550 
us and so that's kind of what we're
looking<00:01:55.079> for

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
looking for

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.859 
looking for
got<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.250> so<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> notice<00:01:57.119> how<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> traps<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
got it so you notice how it traps the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.959 
got it so you notice how it traps the
carbon<00:01:58.170> dioxide<00:01:58.710> inside<00:01:59.100> that's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.640> one

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
carbon dioxide inside that's a good one

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.609 
carbon dioxide inside that's a good one
it's<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.360> IQ<00:02:00.689> test<00:02:00.719> where<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.469> can

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it's not an IQ test where you can

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's not an IQ test where you can
actually<00:02:01.740> buy<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.070> perfect<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.880> watch<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
actually buy the perfect now watch this

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.550 
actually buy the perfect now watch this
it<00:02:03.329> gets<00:02:03.420> heavier<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.990> heavier<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.409> heavier

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
it gets heavier and heavier and heavier

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160 
it gets heavier and heavier and heavier
and<00:02:04.890> watch<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.280> find<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.579> fall<00:02:05.820> it'll<00:02:06.119> pop<00:02:06.420> oh<00:02:06.659> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and watch it find a fall it'll pop oh it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.900 
and watch it find a fall it'll pop oh it
goes<00:02:07.439> everywhere<00:02:07.860> good<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.550> let<00:02:08.729> me<00:02:08.789> give
