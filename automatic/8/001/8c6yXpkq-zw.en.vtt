camera in After Effects this will be

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.210 
camera in After Effects this will be
pretty<00:00:20.850> short<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.630> pretty<00:00:21.750> basic<00:00:22.230> tutorial

Effects making new comp and add a new
layer<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:46.320> will<00:00:46.770> use<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> text<00:00:47.550> layer<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:49.070> type<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
layer I will use a text layer I type in

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:59.330 
layer I will use a text layer I type in
tutorial<00:00:53.180> ok<00:00:55.940> and<00:00:57.079> now<00:00:58.079> we<00:00:58.140> need<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> new<00:00:59.070> layer

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
tutorial ok and now we need a new layer

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.740 
tutorial ok and now we need a new layer
and<00:00:59.989> add<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.320> camera<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> can

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and add the camera but here you can

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
and add the camera but here you can
change<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.769> camera<00:01:04.979> settings<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.000> can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
change the camera settings but you can

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.170 
change the camera settings but you can
also<00:01:06.630> change<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.350> later<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.850> keep<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
also change this later on so just keep a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.539 
also change this later on so just keep a
default<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.930> okay<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.600> yeah<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:14.159> here

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
default it okay and yeah so right here

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.240 
default it okay and yeah so right here
we<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.420> super<00:01:15.960> awesome<00:01:16.200> camera<00:01:17.009> tool

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
we have this super awesome camera tool

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.219 
we have this super awesome camera tool
which<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.909> pretty<00:01:18.150> useful<00:01:18.390> because<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:19.200> can

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
which is pretty useful because we can

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.140 
which is pretty useful because we can
rotate<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.159> camera<00:01:20.689> or<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.740> move<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.909> from

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
rotate the camera or we can move it from

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.929 
rotate the camera or we can move it from
left<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.630> right<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> down<00:01:25.790> or<00:01:26.790> actually

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
left to right or up and down or actually

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.960 
left to right or up and down or actually
move<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.990> Z<00:01:28.200> direction<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.549> as<00:01:29.850> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
move it in the Z direction but as you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
move it in the Z direction but as you
can<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.310> text<00:01:32.759> coming<00:01:33.560> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
can see we don't see the text coming a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.249 
can see we don't see the text coming a
closer<00:01:35.340> or<00:01:35.880> anything<00:01:36.210> when<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> move<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> Z

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
closer or anything when I move the Z

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.240 
closer or anything when I move the Z
direction<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.280> camera<00:01:38.759> doesn't<00:01:39.270> rotate

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
direction the camera doesn't rotate

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.649 
direction the camera doesn't rotate
doesn't<00:01:41.250> move<00:01:41.369> from<00:01:41.610> left<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.970> right<00:01:42.210> or<00:01:42.390> up<00:01:42.479> or

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
doesn't move from left to right or up or

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:50.210 
doesn't move from left to right or up or
down<00:01:44.750> that's<00:01:45.750> because<00:01:48.290> this<00:01:49.290> text<00:01:49.740> layer<00:01:49.829> has

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
down that's because this text layer has

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.399 
down that's because this text layer has
to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.850> 3d<00:01:51.810> layer<00:01:52.100> so<00:01:53.100> make<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.640> 3d<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.420> when

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to be a 3d layer so make it 3d and when

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.310 
to be a 3d layer so make it 3d and when
I<00:01:55.439> rotate<00:01:56.009> my<00:01:56.040> camera<00:01:56.610> right<00:01:56.820> now<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.020> see

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I rotate my camera right now you can see

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.090 
I rotate my camera right now you can see
the<00:01:58.710> text<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.070> also<00:01:59.549> rotating<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:01.070> when<00:02:02.070> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the text is also rotating and when I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.730 
the text is also rotating and when I
move<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> Z<00:02:03.030> direction<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.899> can<00:02:04.110> see<00:02:04.140> I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
move it in the Z direction you can see I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.440 
move it in the Z direction you can see I
get<00:02:05.399> closer<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> text<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.840> all

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
get closer to the text and all

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.290 
get closer to the text and all
stuff<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:09.280> left<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.550> right<00:02:09.729> up<00:02:09.759> dog

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
stuff and from left to right up dog

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.440 
stuff and from left to right up dog
whatever<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.560> want<00:02:13.590> okay<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.069> this<00:02:15.910> these<00:02:16.420> are

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
whatever you want okay so this these are

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.790 
whatever you want okay so this these are
the<00:02:16.900> transformation<00:02:17.860> settings<00:02:18.930> z-rotation<00:02:19.930> Y

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
the transformation settings z-rotation Y

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.000 
the transformation settings z-rotation Y
Direction<00:02:21.340> X<00:02:21.550> rotation<00:02:22.650> position<00:02:23.650> all<00:02:23.830> that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
Direction X rotation position all that

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.140 
Direction X rotation position all that
stuff<00:02:25.200> what<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.319> quite<00:02:26.800> a<00:02:27.660> what<00:02:28.660> what<00:02:30.150> makes

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
stuff what is quite a what what makes

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.140 
stuff what is quite a what what makes
you<00:02:31.330> get<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.870> super<00:02:32.650> super<00:02:33.610> cool<00:02:33.790> camera

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
you get in the super super cool camera

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.030 
you get in the super super cool camera
look<00:02:34.540> with<00:02:34.750> depth<00:02:35.049> of<00:02:35.170> field<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.560> stuff

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
look with depth of field and stuff

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.580 
look with depth of field and stuff
therefore<00:02:36.970> we<00:02:37.060> need<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.629> camera<00:02:38.140> options

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
therefore we need this camera options

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.490 
therefore we need this camera options
like<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:41.349> don't<00:02:42.190> know<00:02:42.400> what<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:43.060> English<00:02:43.500> well

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
like I don't know what in English well

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.190 
like I don't know what in English well
depth<00:02:44.860> of<00:02:44.980> field<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.370> course<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:46.780> needs<00:02:47.110> to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
depth of field of course this needs to

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.470 
depth of field of course this needs to
be<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.530> but<00:02:47.890> we<00:02:48.130> don't<00:02:48.310> see<00:02:48.489> any<00:02:48.760> changes<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.420> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
be on but we don't see any changes so I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.589 
be on but we don't see any changes so I
will<00:02:49.690> get<00:02:49.920> get<00:02:50.920> closer<00:02:51.310> with<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> camera<00:02:52.299> and

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
will get get closer with the camera and

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:05.400 
will get get closer with the camera and
maybe<00:02:53.400> rotated<00:02:54.400> a<00:02:54.489> little<00:02:54.519> bit<00:03:03.959> yeah<00:03:04.959> this

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
maybe rotated a little bit yeah this

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.460 
maybe rotated a little bit yeah this
should<00:03:05.560> be<00:03:05.739> working<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.989> what<00:03:07.989> we<00:03:08.110> can<00:03:08.260> see

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
should be working so what we can see

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.430 
should be working so what we can see
right<00:03:08.620> now<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.849> front<00:03:10.269> of<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.810> text<00:03:11.260> is

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
right now that the front of the text is

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.940 
right now that the front of the text is
quite<00:03:11.650> blurred<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:13.480> back<00:03:13.720> it<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.049> more

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
quite blurred and the back it is more

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.069 
quite blurred and the back it is more
sharp<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:18.310> focus<00:03:18.790> distance<00:03:19.090> or<00:03:19.660> I

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
sharp so this is the focus distance or I

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.140 
sharp so this is the focus distance or I
don't<00:03:20.680> know<00:03:20.739> what's<00:03:20.950> in<00:03:21.160> English<00:03:21.430> but<00:03:21.639> I<00:03:21.819> guess

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
don't know what's in English but I guess

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.750 
don't know what's in English but I guess
the<00:03:22.389> focus<00:03:22.690> distance<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.950> can<00:03:24.130> change<00:03:24.430> this

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
the focus distance you can change this

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.900 
the focus distance you can change this
and<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:25.620> if<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.150> shrink<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.420> down<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:30.549> let's

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
and so if you shrink that down to let's

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:39.590 
and so if you shrink that down to let's
see<00:03:31.120> I<00:03:31.150> will<00:03:31.480> make<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.109> 200<00:03:34.560> let's<00:03:35.560> do<00:03:35.799> too<00:03:36.100> much

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.230 

yes

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.110 

so<00:03:47.240> what<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.260> can<00:03:48.380> see<00:03:48.560> right<00:03:48.710> now<00:03:48.770> that<00:03:49.120> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
so what you can see right now that the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.050 
so what you can see right now that the
front<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.810> sharp<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.310> back<00:03:52.520> is<00:03:52.760> blurred

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
front is sharp and the back is blurred

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.990 
front is sharp and the back is blurred
because<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:54.650> focus<00:03:55.040> distance<00:03:55.220> isn't<00:03:55.880> that

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
because the focus distance isn't that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.920 
because the focus distance isn't that
isn't<00:03:59.000> that<00:03:59.300> big<00:03:59.540> anymore<00:03:59.930> and<00:04:00.410> if<00:04:00.710> you

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
isn't that big anymore and if you

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.850 
isn't that big anymore and if you
increase<00:04:02.930> this<00:04:03.760> value<00:04:04.780> you<00:04:05.780> can<00:04:05.990> see<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.590> the

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
increase this value you can see that the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.040 
increase this value you can see that the
sharp<00:04:07.220> part<00:04:07.550> is<00:04:08.320> going<00:04:09.880> more<00:04:10.880> back<00:04:11.270> in<00:04:11.480> the<00:04:11.690> Z

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
sharp part is going more back in the Z

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.920 
sharp part is going more back in the Z
direction<00:04:12.590> because<00:04:13.190> this<00:04:13.850> is<00:04:14.000> more<00:04:14.240> way<00:04:14.600> than

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
direction because this is more way than

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.110 
direction because this is more way than
then<00:04:15.530> this<00:04:15.950> part<00:04:16.250> okay<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:18.850> this<00:04:19.850> should<00:04:20.090> be

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
then this part okay so this should be

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.849 
then this part okay so this should be
easy<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.630> understand<00:04:21.230> you<00:04:21.320> have<00:04:21.440> to<00:04:21.500> try<00:04:21.799> this

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
easy to understand you have to try this

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.270 
easy to understand you have to try this
out<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.880> get<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.060> feeling<00:04:23.450> for<00:04:23.720> how<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:25.070> works

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
out to get a feeling for how it works

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.780 
out to get a feeling for how it works
and<00:04:25.550> all<00:04:25.669> that<00:04:25.820> stuff

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
and all that stuff

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:37.000 
and all that stuff
you<00:04:28.790> can<00:04:29.060> increase<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:31.840> lens<00:04:33.940> size<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:36.010> this

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
you can increase the lens size and this

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.110 
you can increase the lens size and this
will<00:04:37.220> actually<00:04:39.010> this<00:04:40.010> will<00:04:40.250> change<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.790> part

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
will actually this will change the part

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.890 
will actually this will change the part
that<00:04:41.419> will<00:04:41.630> be<00:04:41.660> blurred<00:04:42.169> and<00:04:42.590> sharp<00:04:43.430> so<00:04:43.900> it's

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
that will be blurred and sharp so it's

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.750 
that will be blurred and sharp so it's
not<00:04:45.140> that<00:04:45.350> smooth<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.070> transition<00:04:46.640> between

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
not that smooth the transition between

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.060 
not that smooth the transition between
sharp<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:47.570> blurred<00:04:48.230> book<00:04:48.500> won't<00:04:48.770> be<00:04:48.890> that

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
sharp and blurred book won't be that

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.020 
sharp and blurred book won't be that
moves<00:04:49.850> anymore<00:04:50.150> okay<00:04:50.540> so<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:52.340> can<00:04:52.550> make<00:04:52.820> this

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
moves anymore okay so you can make this

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.380 
moves anymore okay so you can make this
pretty<00:04:53.330> big<00:04:53.600> so<00:04:54.590> you<00:04:54.620> can<00:04:54.740> see<00:04:55.100> that<00:04:55.370> only<00:04:55.729> this

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
pretty big so you can see that only this

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.150 
pretty big so you can see that only this
is<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.720> Potter's<00:04:57.080> job<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.530> then<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.740> already

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
is a Potter's job and then it already

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.659 
is a Potter's job and then it already
starts<00:04:58.669> getting<00:04:58.970> blurred<00:04:59.300> this<00:05:00.260> is<00:05:00.669> actually

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
starts getting blurred this is actually

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:07.450 
starts getting blurred this is actually
too<00:05:01.820> much<00:05:02.530> so<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.950> can<00:05:05.830> you<00:05:06.830> better<00:05:07.040> keep<00:05:07.310> it

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
too much so you can you better keep it

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.680 
too much so you can you better keep it
small<00:05:07.940> for<00:05:08.870> text<00:05:09.290> because<00:05:10.210> if<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.330> want<00:05:11.540> to

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
small for text because if you want to

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.400 
small for text because if you want to
read<00:05:12.500> the<00:05:12.680> text<00:05:12.710> then<00:05:13.190> it's<00:05:13.340> better<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:14.380> have<00:05:15.380> a

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
read the text then it's better to have a

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:23.380 
read the text then it's better to have a
smaller<00:05:15.860> lens<00:05:16.190> just<00:05:16.660> like<00:05:17.660> this<00:05:18.050> and<00:05:19.750> yeah<00:05:22.390> the

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
smaller lens just like this and yeah the

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.659 
smaller lens just like this and yeah the
moving<00:05:23.930> of<00:05:24.050> the<00:05:24.110> camera<00:05:24.530> works<00:05:24.800> actually<00:05:25.040> like

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.790 

any<00:05:28.669> other<00:05:28.970> motion<00:05:29.450> and<00:05:29.660> after<00:05:30.080> effects<00:05:30.590> you

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
any other motion and after effects you

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.140 
any other motion and after effects you
make<00:05:31.310> keyframes<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:33.580> then<00:05:34.580> you<00:05:34.700> go<00:05:34.850> further

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
make keyframes and then you go further

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.290 
make keyframes and then you go further
further<00:05:36.020> and<00:05:36.790> actually<00:05:37.790> change<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:40.490> position

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
further and actually change the position

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.940 
further and actually change the position
of<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.570> camera

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:54.010 

let's<00:05:46.640> see<00:05:50.620> now<00:05:51.620> I<00:05:51.920> think<00:05:52.640> this<00:05:53.330> looks<00:05:53.690> pretty

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
let's see now I think this looks pretty

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.020 
let's see now I think this looks pretty
interesting<00:05:54.860> sometimes<00:05:57.400> you<00:05:58.400> see<00:05:58.580> this<00:05:58.790> in<00:05:58.940> a

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
interesting sometimes you see this in a

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.350 
interesting sometimes you see this in a
lot<00:05:59.150> of<00:05:59.210> intros<00:05:59.690> and<00:05:59.930> stuff<00:06:01.150> it's<00:06:02.150> pretty

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
lot of intros and stuff it's pretty

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.320 
lot of intros and stuff it's pretty
useful<00:06:02.990> and<00:06:05.590> yeah<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:06.800> hope<00:06:07.130> this<00:06:07.610> was<00:06:07.850> kind<00:06:08.240> of
