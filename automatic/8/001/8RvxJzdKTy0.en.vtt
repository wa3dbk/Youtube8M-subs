00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.660

 my friend to the ground before 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.849

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.350
 two 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.750
 the problem with this is that how can 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.190
 bring advantages to get scavenger 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.690
 I just very quickly because the bands 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.690

 let's forget about the camper rats and 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 champions 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.950
 magnetic has the goal that you do not 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.540
 you die because you are not shot 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.980
 they enjoy dead 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.980
 they have to be on the ride 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.590
 what comes 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.530
 tight 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.479
 If you have moved what 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.470
 comrades if you take a burst 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.740
 uncle 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.740
 look at it 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.280
 the pear 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.920
 by means and I think they have to ting 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 assaults through 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.299

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.310

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.860

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.860
 therefore it gave me another version 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 get out of there 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.080
 it's worth 2 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.460
 they do not die 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.400
 you have to save the kitchen 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.700
 cuddle for your fucking mother I've 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.700
 removed not 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.090
 good if the place when you take a 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.090
 bloodthirsty 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.989
 that's how it was before you know 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.650
 damn 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.599
 by the back 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.770
 I entered 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.770
 I love it well 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.530
 I do not see I do not see 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.530
 they have to be through 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.730
 but nobody who comes out to discover it 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.590
 with a pistolita minus the santa and 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.660
 you 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:56.300
 of death and eight bullets swims on shoulders 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.300
 you're your first slumps operating 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.989
 this is the typical complaint air 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.989
 besides the terrible 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.069
 two 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.670
 and each one 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:20.890
 to the right 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.890
 my mother what I've done to her 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.460
 wright 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.870
 I choose baby davis lived line of 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.930
 villalon and online 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.240
 to the people 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.400
 it's worth 1 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.470
 no no 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.330
 not because no longer 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.330
 if it does not answer correctly here 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.449
 good is that if it jumps then there 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.800
 a double low more than the double low 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.370
 I do not have all the challenge 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.790
 the revenge 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.790
 in loves 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.419
 there is another greek 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.200
 the real fuck the response 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.940
 I hope so 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.410
 because as if it were the response a 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.410
 mountain would do nothing call of duty 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:27.279
 well that exalted me 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.940
 I think a bloodthirsty dono 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.940
 ace 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.190
 little companions 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:47.060
 the hunter and I had June 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.060
 to pass it 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:13.399
 but if you go to shock load good 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:15.339
 discounted bloodthirsty in the end is not 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:19.110
 good is good is good is good 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:21.900
 nobody notepad notes 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.009
 look if I had that weapon and if I 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.229
 I had weapons of this 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.759
 do not exhaust broken goal of the mmc because 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.150
 the game is over and if it did not 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.399
 but she had two good days 26 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.809
 low is pretty good I think these 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:36.460
 two or three bloodthirsty we would end 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:38.740
 with the low doubles when I'm done 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.839
 in the previous division if I remember correctly 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.860
 so let's take a look at it two 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:46.580
 bloodthirsty 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.260
 revenge 3 so it's not bad we go 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.890
 to see what we have 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:55.409
 We have 16 casualties left that is done in 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.689
 an episode 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:59.789
 well we can finish perfectly 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:01.709
 the time with him if in this episode in the 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.909
 next so we do not like the 

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:04.619
 video always agreed to vote the 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.019
 favorite survey we are left with a 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:08.429
 episode like a lot 2 finally it's over 

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:09.539
 so we liked it as I say vote 

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:12.499
 the many favorites and in the deep 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:12.499
 is close to them
