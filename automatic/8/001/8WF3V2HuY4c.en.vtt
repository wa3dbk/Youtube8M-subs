 this video did not happen through 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.029
 daily share 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.240
 hey people today xd my name is luc 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.669
 hello i am i am with colleague loo and 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.039
 today we are going to do something nice for you 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:23.800
 we do go into simon 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:26.289
 how to build a game car how the game 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.730
 for that matter, wood is very difficult 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.089
 as for making cars 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.890
 so about their no I am not one myself 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.790
 problem but what is it so that we 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.960
 in these games with a lot of technology 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.510
 can build a car 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.950
 and I tried some darkness that was 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.300
 not really a very success but me 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.610
 thought of a battle against collin must 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.640
 can guest is colleen 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.739
 meter ready for your customer's thumb 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.149
 Then say go stand in your side 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.590
 when we got one 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.579
 and then I'll see you for about 5 minutes 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:02.010
 exactly and then we will build a car 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.360
 and whoever wins gets a cake yet 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.400
 just not on those two people behind it 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 I don't know what happened and what 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:13.320
 that's not going on, either 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:21.300
 well let's say i go photo 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.300
 bullshit thick tuned ran away from 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.870
 that line of people 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:35.490
 oh shit okay then myne rides in everyone 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:40.369

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.369
 about my car my car is a lot of fat 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.500

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.399
 look for a door that you think is incorrect 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.399
 those wheels care pack 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.539
 take my old jed not seen my car 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:08.179
 had to come and watch 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:16.859
 no when you go crazy because what 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:19.549
 for even in my car then something goes 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:25.140
 not quite right no but he said anyway 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:32.790
 what the fuck are 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:34.470

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.880

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.410
 experienced was a really fun game on 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.870
 you might want to have someone 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.410
 he stands in the steam store for one 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.200
 ten 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.530
 if you are smart then download immediately 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 the tanks with counter-strike then 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.160

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.160
 sorry about five euros 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.590
 and then you immediately have certain extras 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.090
 nets round to go online what if you 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.030
 I already have someone in flatland

 yes you can do that very much yes you can 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.970
 but it's just very small 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.359
 god you can do because when you go online 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.340
 at the point then you have a lot of maps 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.049
 yes that is unimportant if you are really real 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.269
