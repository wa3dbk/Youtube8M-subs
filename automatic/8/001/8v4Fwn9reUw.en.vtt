00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.059
 we follow the sports link and let's talk 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.419
 now of the sub-15 directed selection 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.029
 by juan josÃ© pray that he had a very 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.910
 outstanding performance in this South American 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.130
 that this selection was made in Bolivia 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.710
 that has to be said, it went quietly 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
 he was not paid much attention 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.310
 obviously there was for example the 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.650
 participation of the sub-18 in the games 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.870
 Bolivarians this team was 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.940
 working with some time of 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.430
 anticipation under the gaze we repeat of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:43.290
 jj did a very good campaign they won 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.920
 five matches and equaled only one with 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.790
 Argentina scoring 14 goals and receiving 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.340
 only 5 in the final not the team defeated 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.310
 for the minimum difference 1-0 to Colombia 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.250
 and this way has classified the 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.260
 Youth Olympic Games to be 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.130
 they will develop in Chinese nankin in the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.930
 2014 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.920
 it must be said of this equipment only 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.409
 one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.439
 players will be able to participate in these 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.659
 games basically by age the only 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.540
 goal of the game the goal that the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.939
 Peruvian triumph was Iberian LuÃ­s 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.799
 eye with this front center that was the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.600
 scorer of this South American scored 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.840
 seven goals he's a player 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.930
 san martÃ­n university so you have to 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.600
 look at it very carefully but 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.130
 listen to the manager's words without 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.740
 doubt this new process juan josÃ© ore 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.539
 when we play with an equator we put 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.399
 three goals when I eat with Uruguay 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.640
 we omit three goals when we play with 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.590
 Chile - three goals and good and one more 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.570
 or less is realizing saving a 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.979
 idea of what the team has and logical 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.159
 always reinforcing the defensive part 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.450
 What is better to be better in the brand? 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.880
 so there is a balance between 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.360
 defense and attack because we 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.729
 we elaborate a lot and good and apart that has 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.490
 been the temperament of these boys 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.170
 in each game he gives us a ball for 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.849
 lost fought each ball each ball 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.370
 and then when we had the ball 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:21.580
 we worked out then we saw a team 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.950
 in that very fine sense of the head with 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.780
 Many win with a lot of attitude 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.360
 temperament 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.600
 so it 's good and it's been I think 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.920
 the success of american treasure and we are 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 I always told them also about 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.970
 that it is important to start earning a 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.220
 tournament as short as the South American and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.280
 good thanks to god that's how we went 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.470
 mentalizing more and more and there we go 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.440
 only to see what happened but to win the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.209
 matches and well and so it happened with 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.530
 Argentines also in a very team 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.239
 strong especially physically great and 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.390
 this what we had not seen in the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.459
 previous also in the same tournament in 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.260
 those first matches that never 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.150
 We were with the core against and with 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.220
 Argentina and we were in several 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.180
 moments and we knew how to overcome what we went up 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.300
 get ahead and then when 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.610
 they won 4 to 3 and a few minutes were missing 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:18.850
 we could tie it with a player less 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.239
 so that gives me an idea that this 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.239
 team does not give up without thinking 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.330
 a lot and then good when we go to 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.810
 the second to second round and to play with 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.510
 Chile 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.840
 we knew that also that chile 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.189
 although it is true they called her 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.459
 friendly match we knew it was 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:43.209
 difficult and had also classified 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.040
 I had still taken it to Brazil and 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.930
 then from good but the guys 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.510
 they had height they got played and 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.440
 we could beat him 2 to 0 too and well 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.420
 with another colombia another team that very 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.359
 compact in all its lines very team 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.709
 physically strong also this one we knew 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.709
 that makes it difficult but we knew 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.650
 counter what we learned to endure what 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.560
 We knew how to play until good 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.659
 last minutes we can score the goal 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.190
 a tremendous joy not to be ambitious not 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.849
 we have felt the word is not true and 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.680
 but and calmly not knowing that always 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.350
 all parties that plan what 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.270
 each opponent is different than each match 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.720
 and different but with that mentality 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.510
 winner who has this group not good 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.200
 that if they really want 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.480
 That big one wants to get ahead 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.230
 you have to work hard, persevere 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.060
 before since I was disciplined and have that 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.940
 courage is temper to be able 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.280
 always achieve your dreams your goals your 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.650
 objectives as they are doing these 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.600
 boys and this these guys are 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.670
 leaving a message for for the guys 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.890
 that come back because they can do what 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.190
 It is also a matter of attitude of 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.170
 desire and of each one that they have to do 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.080
 that's not the asset has been very early 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.820
 but I think that more people would have gone 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.260
 Well now you can see all the way that 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.470
 we have come hi but to the people passing 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.640
 in a ball that did not recognize him and good 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.790
 and that's what I feel calm 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:16.620
 because we are giving a joy to everything 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.620
 the peru who are so eager for triumphs 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.570
 ah
