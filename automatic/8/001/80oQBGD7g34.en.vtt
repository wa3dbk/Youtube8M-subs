as<00:03:01.140> explained<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.800> previous<00:03:02.010> video<00:03:02.459> this

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
as explained in the previous video this

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.160 
as explained in the previous video this
means<00:03:02.850> that<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> gas<00:03:03.360> dwarf<00:03:03.780> will<00:03:03.959> likely

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
means that the gas dwarf will likely

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.780 
means that the gas dwarf will likely
follow<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.620> generic<00:03:05.130> mass<00:03:05.370> radius

follow a generic mass radius

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.850 
follow a generic mass radius
relationship<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:06.959> use<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.500> graph<00:03:07.740> to

relationship so we can use this graph to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.740

get<00:03:08.220> realistic<00:03:08.610> mass<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.330> radius<00:03:09.510> values

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
get realistic mass and radius values

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.230 
get realistic mass and radius values
here's<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.680> -<00:03:10.860> radius<00:03:11.250> line<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:11.760> everything

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
here's the - radius line so everything

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.480

so<00:03:39.600> that's<00:03:39.750> how<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.930> build<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.290> various

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
so that's how you build the various

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.820 
so that's how you build the various
types<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.950> giant<00:03:41.310> planet

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830
