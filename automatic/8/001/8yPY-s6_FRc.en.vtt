00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.699
 the rights of the series of gears of war 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.890
 previously it was owned by epic 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.140
 games also reported that the next 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.990
 game of the series will develop it black 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.790
 your studies the best thing is that the bot 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.090
 perversion former production director 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.270
 epic games will be back in the series 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.830
 now just waiting for ib3 2014 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.510
 to see what they say in 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.870
 television one of those new chips for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.360
 the 2015 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.890
 good happening to the other news circulates 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.750
 by the network four images that 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.000
 supposedly they are filtered images of 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.890
 the five or halo for xbox one 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.220
 this is the first one that can be seen with 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.850
 a plain with river 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.730
 and trees that does not say anything about the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.920
 new halo in this one can appreciate a 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:13.720
 phantom that flies over a forest and she 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.720
 in the distance another phantom 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.320
 in this one you can see another phantom more 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.150
 nature and trees then from the side 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.790
 right can be seen as a buildings 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.280
 are the ones that I think look 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.409
 as the axis and the contingency if not 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.850
 they know what or what is that contingency 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.690
 they are left in the description so that 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.690
 give him a look 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.820
 in this you can see that the spartan 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.610
 load a covenant carbine 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.720
 that is pointing to the phantom is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.820
 can see that the h 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.690
 looks similar to turn 4 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.220
 well these are the four images that 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.220
 they are not from a reliable place and the truth 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.210
 I do not think they're real, so I do not know 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.490
 trust 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.320
 we have to wait like this until the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.360
 e3 to see what they say about the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.360
 new halo that comes out this year 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.510
 in the following is a supposed rumor of 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.820
 a public beta of tight end fall 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:10.160
 although in electronics and respawn it 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.840
 have confirmed a French store that 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.880
 belongs to the gamestop chain 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.180
 published a couple of images that point 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.970
 that between 14 and 19 February respawn 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.530
 will perform the beta previously 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.239
 director of the respawn community 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.209
 He advanced that the study considers 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.090
 possibility considers the possibility of 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.050
 perform a beta although we do not know what 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.090
 day will be 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.280
 or when will it be to see what they say 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.010
 respawn and the electronic arts 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.390
 well that would be all for my part I hope 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.100
 let them like their subscribe 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.709
