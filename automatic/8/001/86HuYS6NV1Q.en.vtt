00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 I'm having trouble writing 2? 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 Here are some tips to help you write better 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hi 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.160
 Are you preparing for the next IELTS test? 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.200
 Each of us has strengths and weaknesses in English 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.000
 Some of you have asked for guidance 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.060
 How to improve the performance of a write task 2. 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.040
 So I'll share some personal tips. 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.160
 Plans for writing style. 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.140
 It is very simple, but during the same test 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.200
 You will not have enough time so it is very easy to overlook it. 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.100
 After reading the question 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.100
 Spend a few seconds explaining your main points before you start typing 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.200
 You'll be amazed at how easy this step can improve your score. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.100
 Explain your position or opinion as much as possible. 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.180
 The task of Writing 2 test your ability to express your opinion in English clearly 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
 Not your knowledge of the subject. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.140
 The best you can remember is that your answer is relevant 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.120
 And to express your opinion in the best way. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.100
 Treat the entire task. 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.060
 You have to answer all parts of the question 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.200
 Until you understand your written guidance. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.040
 Here's an example: 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.100
 You should spend about 40 minutes completing this task. 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.220
 Write on the following topic: 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.200
 Some say that to college students 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200
 Pay their full tuition. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.200
 While others believe that university education should be free. 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.000
 Discuss both opinions and express your personal opinion on the subject. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.100
 Give reasons for your answer 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.200
 Include any relevant examples of your experiences and personal knowledge. 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.100
 Write at least 250 words. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 Here we can note three things: 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 The view that university students should pay fees 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.100
 Which cover the cost of their entire education; 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.000
 The view that university students should study for free; 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.180
 And you saw your personal. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.000
 In this case you have to write about the three things mentioned in this question 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 Otherwise you will get lower scores. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.100
 Summarize your main points. 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.200
 Do not forget the last paragraph that should summarize all your main arguments. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.280
 I hope these tips will help you in improving your writing task 2.
