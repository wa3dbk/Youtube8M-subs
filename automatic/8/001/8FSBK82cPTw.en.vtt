 wealth financial crises collapses and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.590
 the ups of the currencies of war are all elements

 their massive financial game 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.010
 parts of a global plan which 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.560
 consistently implemented on 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.970
 over the past 100 years history 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.740
 of this world domination 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.590
 started with a secret meeting of chapters

 family agreement was signed and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.739
 developed a plan to establish 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 total financial control over 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.570
 humanity on the nearest weight of all 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.670
 after 18 years the government of the greatest 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.370
 states have become puppets in their hands 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 for receiving super profits from deliveries 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.719
 food and weapons of medicines 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 World War II was unleashed 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.800
 why stop the war of all 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 in a few years if you can 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.340
 was preying 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.880
 for decades it's a matter of breton woods 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.960
 conference held in July 1944 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.970
 in her course 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.100
 puppet rulers of world powers 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.350
 recognized the us dollar as the world monetary 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 standards as gold is truly 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 grand layouts world economy 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.590
 began to become virtual 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.990
 actually based in 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.909
 the only person to realize complete 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.009
 the madness of a similar system was the president 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.109
 france charles de goll he demanded 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.750
 us exchange one and a half billion dollars 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.390
 for gold usa had to accept and 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.119
 the taiga brought more than 3000 out of Fort Knox 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.039
 tons of pure gold 8 families of managers 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.869
 world economy could not come to terms with 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.549
 so that countries can at any time 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.560
 exchange in reality nothing 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.450
 reinforced green paper on the living 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.140
 whose gold reserves are on the planet 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.819
 limited in 1971 through and through 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.649
 corrupt and hated and 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.929
 Americans president nixon held 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.229
 reform of the elms Shui dollar from gold but 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.549
 retained the status of world currency 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.439
 fantastic scam but she was 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.509
 effected from now on 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.640
 money became unsupported with 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.379
 with the same success mankind could 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.390
 start calculating with ordinary stones 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.569
 pretend that they are really something 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.010
 worth the world economy has become completely 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.019
 virtual bankers 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.060
 inventing more sophisticated schemes 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.530
 manufacturing money out of thin air, and that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.480
 led eventually to a grand 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.099
 financial crisis at the very beginning 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.950
 the second wave of which we are now and 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.500
 we are 8 families have ceased to understand how 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.540
 the system they themselves created works in 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.670
 the result we live in a world of paradoxes 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.680
 where there are both deficits and 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.970
 overproduction of goods produced 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.500
 more than necessary 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.660
 this is evidenced by a growing level 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.489
 unemployment but people can not them 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.440
 consume everything rests on the very 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.889
 virtual money which is nothing 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.959
 are standing 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.450
 half of humanity sticks like 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.519
 damn other looking for work and all 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.200
 at the same time running for new but fast 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.760
 aging goods like a donkey behind 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.709
 carrot 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.750
 is there an alternative to the existing one 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.450
 financial system or civilized 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.569
 economic relations come to an end 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.489
 recently 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.459
 astrologer tamara globa predicted 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.439
 appearance in 2012 of a new e 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.840
 financial systems are not based on 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.360
 money and on some units tied 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.549
 to people the phenomenon of enterprises and goods 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.829
 perhaps the birth of this system we 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.269
 are watching right now go founders 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.340
 argue that carefully 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.319
 analyzed the shortcomings of the existing 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.870
 global financial system and in its 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.609
 their community will not allow the function of money 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.159
 in it perform some conditional 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.209
 personal course units which are hard 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.129
 tied to gold 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.200
 difference of personal units from 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.909
 existing currencies is that 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.340
 releases them non federal reserve 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.739
 the system is not a state and not a bank 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.319
 ordinary people as a unit of account when 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.879
 exchange operations in your community 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.889
 Now every member can get in 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:47.810
 your computer personal units in 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.220
 exchange for money and community money 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.900
 invests in bulk purchases 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.150
 quality goods and services for 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.629
 participants goods are distributed without 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.220
 markups 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.349
 for the benefit of the participants for these 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.540
 personal units besides 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.099
 community intends to invest money 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.079
 in advanced resource saving 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.910
 technologies that have enormous 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.889
 potential and technology which 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.790
 provide environmentally friendly environment 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.379
 habitat 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.689
 obviously first of all for 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.079
 participants but the community is open to 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.939
 of all 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.310
 and intends to develop encompassing 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.989
 ideal all of humanity is now in our 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.880
 the world, such technologies cannot 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.250
 evolve because existing 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.710
 financial system in the basis of motivation 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.330
 any person or organization puts 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.370
 non-resource development 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.270
 prosperity a constantly growing 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.120
 cash income 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.740
 that's why oil companies are buying up 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.520
 patents for alternative sources 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.979
 energy 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.380
 declaring them to be low effective and hiding 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.150
 from the general public that's why 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.960
 when developing a new product in his 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.270
 specifications 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.580
 necessarily laid wear 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.050
 and aging but how else if things 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.360
 will not wear out for a long time 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.120
 People will rarely buy new meaning 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.740
 manufacturer's income will decrease 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.060
 community founders claim that 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.800
 transition to the use of personal 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.449
 units for goods 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.940
 allows each participant to receive 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.310
 income up to 30 percent per month 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.680
 is it possible in principle what is it 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.539
 a new round of civilization or 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.669
 another great economic 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.889
