00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.320
 the easy change head travel system and 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.330
 to provide the esi change pillow system 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.580
 together a complete solution for the 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.800
 Saddle adaptation for the absolute 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.980
 comfort and optimal performances of 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.019
 Horse and rider fit their 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.640
 Saddles can be reached in a matter of minutes 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.400
 changing back form of her 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.470
 horses are adjusted 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.319
 all changes are measurably symmetrical 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.849
 and completely reversible in principle 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:34.160
 we recommend the saddle of one 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.109
 Saddler adjust however 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.030
 she supports this video the 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.670
 passform their saddles himself to 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.129
 check and judge if one 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.170
 new adaptation is needed before you 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.320
 We recommend ours 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.789
 to watch other videos 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.890
 please make sure you too 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.499
 already the correct head iron for the 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.050
 saddle tree further selected and in her 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:57.859
 saddle attached 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.079
 Make sure your horse 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.960
 evenly on all legs on level 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.090
 Floor stands around chamber freedom pad 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.250
 and balance the saddle to test 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.660
 It is important that the saddle first 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.180
 is positioned correctly 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.280
 put the saddle in the position 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.740
 the back of her horse so that the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.520
 saddle nail circa three fingers wide in 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 the horse's shoulder lies 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.090
 sufficient chamber clearance along the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.180
 spine and above the neither rest 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.980
 should always be given 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.260
 check this from the front as well 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.520
 also from behind on both sides of the 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.530
 horses should continue the saddle 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.370
 evenly on the back of the horse 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.100
 lie 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.320
 Check this by your hand 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.390
 swipe along the back of the horse and 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.040
 pay attention to pressure differences he is 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.440
 Collect with the guy airbag system 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 equipped it is important that the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.080
 rider sits in the saddle 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.940
 without a pressure load can the 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.030
 Do not breathe the surface on it 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.010
 hangs up adjust to balance 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.990
 Make sure you make sure of that 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:13.110
 lowest point of the saddle is central 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:15.300
 and just the front zwiesel is too high 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.650
 The rider in the saddle becomes too far behind 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.570
 He is positioned in front of that 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.030
 The rider in the meadow is too low 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.030
 saddle positioned so far forward 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.380
 Now check the chamber clearance 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.830
 pad and balance with one 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.030
 Rider in the saddle and watching quoted 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.390
 position and your fit 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.310
 in a short training phase one 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.530
 Checking your saddle adjustment can 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.060
 better done without a saddle blanket 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.320
 become 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.360
 however , the rider has to do it himself 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.370
 Not every horse decides without it 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.370
 a thing blanket can be ridden 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.140
 if an adjustment of the chamber freedom 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.970
 pad or balance necessary 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.350
 is this you can do with the risks 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.269
 Pillow problems will be the pillows in 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.519
 one felt used in saddle 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.820
 The shape of the saddle tree is changed 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.820
 so the pillow on the back of the horse 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.820
 align 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.930
 this is not the case with the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.519
 basement air cushion system itself the 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.980
 evenly in the back of the horse 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.720
 adjusts 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.519
 when inserts the pillow is only 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.650
 the chamber freedom over the back 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.700
 adjusted and the saddle in 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.989
 Balance and balance brought 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.640
 We also recommend that the 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.000
 Medium pillows only for horses with 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.829
 A steak bridges are used around 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.560
 An adaptation in the saddle with the easy 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.790
 change pillow system 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.930
 we recommend our others 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.070
 videos with a detailed
