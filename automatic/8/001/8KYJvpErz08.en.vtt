 i 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.670
 [Music] 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.410
 them what they are and 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.969
 subscribers their demanding floor of 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.940
 youtube that are going through this 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.559
 nice 010 drum channel and good in the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.720
 today's video we're going to see the revised of 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.490
 an excellent application and good this 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.770
 application more than anything is going to be very 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.169
 useful and very productive for all 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.179
 those people who go to the 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.909
 school like they go to this school of 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.710
 administration or something like that and 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.290
 good also for and why not also to 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.230
 kids like they're going from primary 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.940
 study until the last grade school does not 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.010
 and good is also going to be useful for 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.500
 people who work in offices or 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.230
 doctors or in countless other things 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.300
 will serve this great application 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.629
 we are going to do a review how good 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.359
 is going to turn us into a scanner is not 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.940
 our camera from our iphone ipod or 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:57.579
 ipad so is this this application that 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.140
 we can see here it's called tiny scan we 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.559
 will convert the camera of our 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.629
 iphone ipod or ipad in a scanner with 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.300
 just take a picture of the document 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.950
 will not convert them this is not going to 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.470
 give three options to convert it to 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.100
 what is this color to convert the image 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.979
 nothing 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.320
 of grays or black and white and we can 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.540
 adjust some small adjustments there 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.850
 obviously in what is the image for 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.979
 that is our way and our 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.560
 good taste and therefore to start using 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.170
 this great application simply 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.430
 this we have to give in the little camera that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.289
 is in this part where is 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.270
 but before selecting start 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.770
 explain this let's go to an east 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.799
 reviewed of what is the bottom 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.049
 that is in this bar that is where it is 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.759
 so to speak where the focus is 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.590
 application and good at the bottom 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.259
 of this right we have what are the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.270
 adjustments and equipment that we can put here 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.729
 what is this the one with a page 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.770
 by default that in this case I the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.619
 I have in the 4 that then usually 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.289
 they always put that and good in passes code 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.869
 is to put a this as a contrast 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.479
 in the application on wifi drive then 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.119
 they just give him in the drive and already there 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.920
 they leave it just as it is in its x 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.940
 Well you are good if you want to write 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.790
 a revised or inferior to this one or they sent 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.850
 this one feedback and we're going to 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.120
 give in done and good here in the spa 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.730
 order it by this pore date or by this 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.460
 alphabetical order here this is for 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.470
 order it by rows or by images in the 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.060
 option of the magnifying glass because this is because 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.370
 we have many images if we want 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.530
 and seek especially good now yes 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.050
 here we are going to be able to start with what 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.790
 that is the camera simply here they 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.680
 I'm going to leave some images as it serves 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.080
 the application is going to close the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.000
 recording and we will not be able to record a 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.860
 once we go with the next image and 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.450
 he explained them well once 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.920
 we select what the camera is and it is 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.870
 the first step is going to be what it is 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.610
 take the photo the document we want 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.290
 scan once the picture is taken we 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.670
 let's go to the next image very 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.230
 well once we take the picture 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.940
 we will get out of this little box 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.620
 white that we have next and 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.320
 well we're just going to drag the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.600
 tips white circles 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.850
 whites to the area that we want to scan 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.280
 we simply adjust what is the form 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.080
 and we give you where to move once 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.490
 we keep the following this image here 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.380
 will give us three options which 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.270
 we can configure the image if the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.430
 we want to put in what is in color or 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.170
 obvious grayscale in black and white 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.940
 sell in the next section then 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.290
 well here we are simply going to be able to 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.030
 what is the brightness and what is the 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.860
 contrast once the steps are done 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.780
 we will give you in save 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.280
 save and simply in the next 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.720
 section we are going to give you the name that 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 we want very well once 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.960
 it completely keeps us what it was 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.490
 the image will appear this small 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.680
 menu with the title that we give you 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.480
 We put in and good to share the image 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.370
 in what is this what if or if 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.100
 we want to save the image simply 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.050
 we have to go to the picture with the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.130
 little arrow that is on the bottom 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.740
 right 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.450
 in that little box with the little arrow that is 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.210
 pointing to the right we will be able to 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.330
 share it or upload it to what is 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.910
 dropbox evernote social networks and 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.710
 other social networks and fine from there 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.990
 we can manipulate what is the 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.940
 gala to share the image not well 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.620
 we can save on the reel and already 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.780
 then this copy in our 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.460
 computer had all these all 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.799
 steps because we are going to have the image 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.230
 available here and now we are going to be able to 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.300
 enjoy the great advantages of 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.760
 this application that has a cost 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.800
 free there is a free version and one that 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.290
 it costs as in this case that is the pro 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.969
 is the pro version that costs seems 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.110
 about 12 pesos 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.149
 can be placed here below in the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.319
