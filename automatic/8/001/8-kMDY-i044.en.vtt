paper and a picture of a baseball bat

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.379 
paper and a picture of a baseball bat
instead<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.889> that<00:04:44.160> was<00:04:44.250> pretty<00:04:44.430> funny<00:04:44.760> but<00:04:44.910> you

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
instead so that was pretty funny but you

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:46.969 
instead so that was pretty funny but you
know<00:04:45.510> it<00:04:45.660> wasn't<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.020> same<00:04:46.050> thing<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:46.800> I'm

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
know it wasn't the same thing so I'm

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.310 
know it wasn't the same thing so I'm
hoping<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.240> isn't<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.720> case<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.199> I'm

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
hoping that that isn't the case but I'm

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.780 
hoping that that isn't the case but I'm
guessing<00:04:49.560> that's<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.979> case<00:04:50.190> but<00:04:50.400> I'm<00:04:50.550> really

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
guessing that's the case but I'm really

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.480 
guessing that's the case but I'm really
like<00:04:51.060> I<00:04:51.240> have<00:04:51.479> no<00:04:51.750> idea<00:04:51.960> actually<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:53.190> really
