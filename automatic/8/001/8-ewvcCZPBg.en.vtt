with just to sum this sum of these two

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.630 
with just to sum this sum of these two
sounds<00:03:17.860> right<00:03:17.950> here<00:03:18.040> then<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.190> light<00:03:18.400> up<00:03:18.430> a

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
sounds right here then I light up a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.130 
sounds right here then I light up a
camera<00:03:18.880> for<00:03:19.120> dust<00:03:19.420> with<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.660> last<00:03:19.840> one<00:03:20.019> I

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
camera for dust with the last one I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.140 
camera for dust with the last one I
blessed<00:03:20.350> right<00:03:20.530> now<00:03:20.590> one<00:03:21.340> ain't<00:03:21.489> for<00:03:21.790> I'm<00:03:22.000> not

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
blessed right now one ain't for I'm not

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.360 
blessed right now one ain't for I'm not
sure<00:03:22.209> what<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.470> think<00:03:23.799> it's<00:03:24.070> just<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.340> a

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
sure what it is I think it's just like a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.890 
sure what it is I think it's just like a
pager<00:03:24.760> light<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.420> thing<00:03:25.600> but<00:03:27.570> did<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.690> heard

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
pager light and thing but did you heard

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.190 
pager light and thing but did you heard
that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
that

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.380 
that
don't<00:03:29.500> say<00:03:29.709> you<00:03:30.280> do<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.610> again<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.150> makes<00:03:31.329> a

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
don't say you do it again and it makes a

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.090 
don't say you do it again and it makes a
little<00:03:31.450> different<00:03:31.780> sound<00:03:31.959> no<00:03:32.530> see<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:33.010> don't

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
little different sound no see I don't

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.500 
little different sound no see I don't
know<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.280> think<00:03:33.489> it's<00:03:33.610> just<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.850> pager<00:03:34.060> button

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
know I think it's just a pager button

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.180 
know I think it's just a pager button
but<00:03:35.079> now<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.320> need<00:03:35.440> typing<00:03:35.769> these<00:03:35.860> sounds

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
but now we need typing these sounds

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.270 
but now we need typing these sounds
these<00:03:36.579> I<00:03:37.060> don't<00:03:38.049> think<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.500> eyes<00:03:38.620> light<00:03:38.950> up<00:03:38.980> I

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
these I don't think the eyes light up I

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.190 
these I don't think the eyes light up I
don't<00:03:39.370> never<00:03:40.150> see<00:03:40.510> them<00:03:40.630> light<00:03:40.780> up<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.049> thought

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
don't never see them light up I thought

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.020 
don't never see them light up I thought
they<00:03:41.350> did<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:42.160> it's<00:03:42.280> just<00:03:42.370> mostly<00:03:42.670> when<00:03:42.940> we

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
they did but it's just mostly when we

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.470 
they did but it's just mostly when we
call<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:44.110> transport<00:03:44.769> anymore<00:03:45.280> now<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.180> would

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
call and transport anymore now I would

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.120 
call and transport anymore now I would
also<00:03:46.630> get<00:03:46.840> more<00:03:47.049> from<00:03:47.260> either<00:03:47.530> 4<00:03:47.769> out<00:03:47.860> of<00:03:47.920> 5

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
also get more from either 4 out of 5
