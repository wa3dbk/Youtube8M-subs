way<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> small<00:02:25.650> solid<00:02:25.920> game<00:02:26.040> we've<00:02:26.190> sort

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
way with a small solid game we've sort

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.650 
way with a small solid game we've sort
of<00:02:26.489> wrapped<00:02:26.670> it<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:26.850> all<00:02:27.060> together<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.600> then

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
of wrapped it up all together and then

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.750 
of wrapped it up all together and then
worked<00:02:28.049> on<00:02:28.260> pressing<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.769> the<00:02:28.830> final<00:02:29.190> third<00:02:29.370> so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
worked on pressing in the final third so

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.460 
worked on pressing in the final third so
we<00:02:30.330> couldn't<00:02:30.570> get<00:02:30.660> pressure<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.200> ball<00:02:31.290> let

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
we couldn't get pressure on the ball let

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.660 
we couldn't get pressure on the ball let
them<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.769> in<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.040> third<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.310> drop

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
them have it in that third and drop

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.430 
them have it in that third and drop
right<00:02:32.880> off<00:02:32.910> but<00:02:33.660> then<00:02:33.780> when<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.049> could<00:02:34.290> get

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
right off but then when we could get

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.140 
right off but then when we could get
pressure<00:02:34.769> than<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.190> squeezed<00:02:35.519> in<00:02:35.700> as<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> team

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
pressure than we squeezed in as a team

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.699 
pressure than we squeezed in as a team
and<00:02:36.330> we're<00:02:36.840> looking<00:02:36.959> at<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.290> cues<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
and we're looking at the cues and the

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.100 
and we're looking at the cues and the
triggers<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.100> say<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> bad<00:02:38.670> touch<00:02:38.970> side<00:02:39.870> would

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
triggers of say a bad touch side would

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.930 
triggers of say a bad touch side would
pass<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.739> was<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.920> sloppy<00:02:41.220> pass<00:02:41.519> then<00:02:41.730> we<00:02:41.820> could

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
pass it was a sloppy pass then we could

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.789 
pass it was a sloppy pass then we could
go<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.330> really<00:02:42.480> get<00:02:42.720> tight<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.170> work

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
go in and really get tight and work

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.170 
go in and really get tight and work
together<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.310> team<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.730> stop<00:02:44.940> him<00:02:45.090> from

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
together as a team and stop him from

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.509 
together as a team and stop him from
playing<00:02:45.390> forward<00:02:45.959> or<00:02:46.080> hopefully<00:02:47.010> sideways

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
playing forward or hopefully sideways

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.759 
playing forward or hopefully sideways
and<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:47.910> maybe<00:02:48.420> winning<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> ball<00:02:48.959> what<00:02:49.709> I

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
and then maybe winning the ball what I

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.289 
and then maybe winning the ball what I
want<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.950> do<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.190> take<00:02:50.370> these<00:02:50.549> two<00:02:50.790> players<00:02:51.030> out

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
want to do is take these two players out

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.100 
want to do is take these two players out
now<00:02:51.680> one<00:02:52.680> go<00:02:52.890> blue<00:02:53.130> one<00:02:53.370> go<00:02:53.519> green<00:02:53.900> normal<00:02:54.900> game

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
now one go blue one go green normal game

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.170 
now one go blue one go green normal game
still<00:02:55.739> doing<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.100> same<00:02:56.250> principle<00:02:56.820> so<00:02:56.970> if<00:02:57.060> the

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
still doing the same principle so if the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.550 
still doing the same principle so if the
ball<00:02:57.360> goes<00:02:57.540> out<00:02:57.780> though<00:02:57.959> it<00:02:58.110> goes<00:02:58.260> from<00:02:58.410> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
ball goes out though it goes from the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.590 
ball goes out though it goes from the
keeper<00:02:58.820> looking<00:02:59.820> at<00:02:59.910> those<00:03:00.090> cues<00:03:00.450> and

have<00:03:15.690> a<00:03:15.750> look<00:03:15.810> at<00:03:16.019> it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.940 

I<00:03:19.489> he<00:03:20.420> was<00:03:20.510> he<00:03:20.629> good<00:03:20.840> play<00:03:21.470> on<00:03:23.409> Blue's<00:03:24.409> Blue's

well play dropped off defend the line

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.610 
well play dropped off defend the line
then<00:03:28.579> we<00:03:28.790> got<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.329> got<00:03:29.360> tight<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.409> thing
