00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.149

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 the people you need to love 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 otherwise they never learn 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.300
 therefore it read 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.310
 little bit extra I also understand that it touches me I also understand what's going on 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.050
 hand 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.040
 buying textual stuff in the past it was all about reproduction and food 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.360
 yet that was a bit of what we were doing 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.840
 but yes now it's all about stuff I mean 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.350
 there goes the subject 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.740
 there is still no TV program possible without advertising needs advertising 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.830
 Albert Blokker around and then came in and between work first feature film 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.820
 six blocks of advertising service 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.970
 in movie advertising 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.820
 if can't already participate 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.190
 Football is about the advertising billboards on the virtual side 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.910
 Advertising signs for on TV on the shirts must all advertising matter every interview 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.430
 sports must pay for a sign with all advertising rotterdam citizens then 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.640
 it is no longer possible there is no newspaper possible without advertisements 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 advertisement 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.550
 Weekly newspapers are no longer allowed once you have a bus shelter you still need advertising 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.909
 organizes on vacation without paying for the big event and the 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:28.870
 sponsored 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.130
 everything is no longer possible 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 everything is advertising commercials in which the index buy buy buy buy buy 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.230
 buy buy 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.490
 Because that does is that advertising does everyone who advertises knows you 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.910
 then your stuff for sale 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.080
 and it works 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.210
 then some billions are spent on advertising 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.600
 under the name 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.380
 there are always people who think today 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.380
 she does a fact stupid people like vvd has 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.930
 it was going very well 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.930
 emmen and I know people who say yes I think I have your particular group 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.970
 self 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.210
 I always handy myself pick up that stuff he hopes it is not already 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.680
 buy the brand okay so that means global warming 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.800
 I already have that that has no influence on their practice 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.270
 is 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.419
 people who didn't follow look at that 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.449
 who buy save up to 50 percent 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.529
 I am still at it myself I determine exactly how it works is continuous 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.289
 manipulated there are currently a million people in the Netherlands and there 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:20.689
 There were also a fair in the hall a few times 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.129
 and they take such a party every day as an active member or things with a 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:25.259
 much higher 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.919
 ridiculously expensive boy with two bacteria and the couch 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:32.239
 new challenge better for my resistance to boost that is what to 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.439
 say the lack of a weather station did not envisage bodybags at all 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.040
 knowing that is a different story 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.690
 yes but i also know what is then they can use this to look at it 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.030
 The result is that Monday is known to the members against the wind and rain but nothing 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.369
 the number found 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:50.219
 it went wrong a second man says you have bought and not yet 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.089
 be made i tell you then i am satisfied 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.089
 he would withdraw 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:07.019
 this would withdraw emmen 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.100
 I think 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.480
 that may be so about broken anticipated buying and the worst I think we then 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.520
 that there are people who participate in advertising in 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.109
 listen I understand that you are an actor or something that you 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.019
 With that new anti make money in show jumping and we all want to 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.559
 nice life and the prices announced that I understand 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.629
 What I don't understand is about being rich people who have plenty of money 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:27.190
 to make 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.840
 here nevertheless choose to also do a bullshit bit of jan smit 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.290
 those memories of the ret and for the failed jeans on a pose 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.579
 testify 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.989
 the man was fed up with the money why do you think that is only because of greed 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:39.829
 remains 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.430
 why are people who top lopez more
