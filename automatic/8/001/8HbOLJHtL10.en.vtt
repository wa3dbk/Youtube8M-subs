00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.240
 Hi, I'm Monica from Unai Cole, today we're going to 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.760
 an exercise or activity 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.610
 symmetry for children as you see we are going 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.140
 to use some photographs can already be 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.240
 of yourselves from someone from the 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.400
 family or even some famous that 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.900
 find in a magazine what 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.820
 important is that the photograph be 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.740
 frontal that is in front so that 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.929
 we can do as you have seen a 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.550
 vertical line just in half that 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.470
 go through the center point of the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.190
 nose of the forehead the chin and so on 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.920
 we cut it out and stick it on paper or 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.960
 cardboard a little bigger on one side 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.030
 so they can complete the part 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.970
 missing we can use the part 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.620
 right or the left also depends 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.060
 of whether the child or the good person 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.750
 go to do the right-handed or left-handed what 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.510
 be more comfortable 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.760
 let's make a kind of marquito 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:59.559
 it's the same size so that we stay 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 totally symmetric good now it 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.030
 try to reconstruct the portrait 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 on the opposite side with a pen 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.530
 taking as reference for the hair 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.360
 the widest point of the forehead the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.149
 distance of the eyes with the nose 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 etcetera etcetera this is very good for 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.140
 children because it helps them to be 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.610
 aware of the dimensions of a 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.549
 face for example you can also do it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.979
 with other things like animals but 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.320
 as long as it's a symmetrical photograph 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.689
 as I say it's the same on the left 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.299
 that the right that is frontal if not not 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.340
 will see symmetry is also interesting 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.539
 if you do it first with the side 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.310
 left and then with the right side 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.229
 because they say we never have both 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.909
 sides of the face equal and sometimes 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.440
 condensation mounts with photoshop by 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.840
 example you see portraits appear 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.850
 totally different and duplicates the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.830
 left or doubles the right to 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.750
 do it on both sides 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.130
 finally you can color it I'll go 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.410
 to do the shading a little bit with 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.330
 pen or black paint I 'm going to 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.010
 Color following the tones that 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.020
 appear in the picture is a bit 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.210
 orange this up when it was a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.640
 little bit smaller 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.350
 and as you can see I'm making him the shirt 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.350
 same one as similar as possible 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.750
 the eyes the flower hair 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.350
 I'm going to do it, it's just decorating 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.960
 a little bit the bottom but this is 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.030
 optional since the one so it's here 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.610
 hugo is striped because I'm going to do what 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.860
 same I will make stripes clearly that in 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.860
 wrong blue blue 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.380
 you can do it as you want also what 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.720
 I'm going to frame to place it in our 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.880
 artistic wall you already know what is your 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.480
 review of other times then I teach it 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.720
 again so he framed it on a 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.720
 cap 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.490
 as you see even little children 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.770
 Daniela is 6 years old 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.890
 pretty and he's very good at here he has 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:42.010
 his tea and today he has chosen to do background 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.700
 good pink hearts you know girls 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.010
 they are like that 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.730
 we place it as I tell you in our 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.069
 Wall 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.870
 and little by little the house is invading 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.480
 we're going to have to take in more wall of the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.099
 hall to continue placing for 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.629
 teach some that they have done in the 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.370
 kind of had I saw them the other day 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.959
 when I went to school and gave me the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.049
 idea of this video as you have 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.000
 caught famous people from magazines a 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.060
 book to the best that we serve more the 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.680
 they have printed good internet and have 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.170
 done both the left profile and the 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.760
 right some yes also helps them to 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.680
 meet certain famous people 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.840
 I hope you liked it and what 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.299
 put in practice with your children or good 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.340
 with your students if you are a professor of 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.380
 go like and subscribe and follow us on 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.820
 social networks 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.889
 here I'll leave you another couple of ideas 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.020
 with other techniques than his false mosaic 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.150
 and stains of roses you can 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.889
 serve to make abstract paintings are 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.889
 very funny and beautiful goodbye
