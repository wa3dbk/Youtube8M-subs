00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
year this one hatched completely out of

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.509 
year this one hatched completely out of
season<00:00:12.750> so<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.440> egg<00:00:13.559> was<00:00:13.769> laid<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:14.130> Christmas

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
season so the egg was laid on Christmas

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.150 
season so the egg was laid on Christmas
Eve<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.120> nice<00:00:15.269> Christmas<00:00:15.660> present<00:00:15.690> and

Eve so it's a nice Christmas present and

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.150 
Eve so it's a nice Christmas present and
then<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.460> hatched<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.210> 2nd<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.630> February

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
then it hatched on the 2nd of February

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.250 
then it hatched on the 2nd of February
and<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.240> was<00:00:21.330> completely<00:00:21.480> out<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.930> season

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and so it was completely out of season

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.859 
and so it was completely out of season
they<00:00:22.350> should<00:00:22.529> start<00:00:22.800> laying<00:00:23.010> their<00:00:23.220> eggs<00:00:23.250> now

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
they should start laying their eggs now

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.380 
they should start laying their eggs now
and<00:00:24.869> this<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:25.920> was<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> teenager<00:00:26.699> run<00:00:26.939> in

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and this one was to a teenager run in

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.179 
and this one was to a teenager run in
the<00:00:27.660> penguin<00:00:27.990> world<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.380> she's<00:00:28.560> about<00:00:28.800> three

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
the penguin world so she's about three

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.150 
the penguin world so she's about three
four<00:00:29.460> years<00:00:29.490> old<00:00:30.050> never<00:00:31.050> laid<00:00:31.560> before<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.099> we

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
four years old never laid before so we

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620 
four years old never laid before so we
wanted<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> give<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.759> good<00:00:32.910> fighting<00:00:33.180> chance

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
wanted to give it a good fighting chance

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.750 
wanted to give it a good fighting chance
so<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> thought<00:00:34.230> we'd<00:00:34.860> look<00:00:34.980> after<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> one

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
so we thought we'd look after this one

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.510 
so we thought we'd look after this one
this<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.270> particularly<00:00:36.809> squeaky<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.710> don't

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this one is particularly squeaky I don't

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.880 
this one is particularly squeaky I don't
remember<00:00:38.760> ever<00:00:39.149> any<00:00:39.660> others<00:00:40.110> being<00:00:40.350> quite<00:00:40.710> so

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
remember ever any others being quite so

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.850 
remember ever any others being quite so
noisy<00:00:41.870> generally<00:00:42.870> even<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.469> really

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
noisy generally even when it really

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979 
noisy generally even when it really
still<00:00:44.160> quite<00:00:44.460> noisy<00:00:44.640> he's<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.480> friendly<00:00:45.690> as

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
still quite noisy he's very friendly as

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.010 
still quite noisy he's very friendly as
well<00:00:46.230> when<00:00:46.829> they<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.460> hatch<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.149> they<00:00:48.899> get

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
well when they first hatch out they get

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.670 
well when they first hatch out they get
their<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.579> feed<00:00:50.579> which<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.840> lovely<00:00:52.410> fish

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
their first feed which is a lovely fish

their first feed which is a lovely fish
movie<00:00:53.219> as<00:00:53.370> we<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.699> call<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.210> it's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
movie as we like to call it it's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.069 
movie as we like to call it it's
basically<00:00:55.399> blended<00:00:56.399> up<00:00:56.520> fish<00:00:56.820> with<00:00:57.809> some

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
basically blended up fish with some

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
basically blended up fish with some
sailor<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.559> solution<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.489> because

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
sailor and solution and because

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
sailor and solution and because
obviously<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.629> salt<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> world

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
obviously they have salt in the world

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.759 
obviously they have salt in the world
and<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.670> bit<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.000> mini<00:01:03.600> bits<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.199> skip

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and a little bit of a mini bits and skip

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.770 
and a little bit of a mini bits and skip
them<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> right<00:01:05.250> nutrients<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.659> as

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
them all the right nutrients and then as

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.450 
them all the right nutrients and then as
it<00:01:06.930> gets<00:01:07.080> slightly<00:01:07.290> older<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.860> starts<00:01:08.189> getting

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
it gets slightly older it starts getting

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
it gets slightly older it starts getting
small<00:01:08.939> chunks<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> fish<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.070> on

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
small chunks of fish and now it's on

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.640 
small chunks of fish and now it's on
half<00:01:11.490> fish<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> we<00:01:12.960> feed<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.530> our

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
half fish so we feed it we put our

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.429 
half fish so we feed it we put our
fingers<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> v-shape<00:01:15.540> where<00:01:15.990> with<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
fingers we make a v-shape where with the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.350 
fingers we make a v-shape where with the
second<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.860> third<00:01:17.009> finger<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:18.180> just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
second and third finger and that just

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.830 
second and third finger and that just
makes<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> beak<00:01:18.990> shape<00:01:20.150> gap<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
makes like a beak shape gap so that the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.469 
makes like a beak shape gap so that the
chick<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.259> put<00:01:22.470> its<00:01:22.670> beak<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.880> towards<00:01:24.330> it

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
chick can put its beak up towards it

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.390 
chick can put its beak up towards it
thinks<00:01:24.840> it's<00:01:24.990> mums<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.890> begs<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.280> its

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
thinks it's mums and it begs for its

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.950 
thinks it's mums and it begs for its
food<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.670> then<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.150> just<00:01:27.299> post<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.780> fish

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
food and then you can just post the fish

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
food and then you can just post the fish
in<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.470> when<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:28.770> first<00:01:29.009> eaten<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> they

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
in so when they first eaten and they

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
in so when they first eaten and they
start<00:01:30.270> shivering<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:31.680> means<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
start shivering and that just means that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.950 
start shivering and that just means that
they<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.369> digest<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:33.060> food<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.659> makes<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
they can digest the food it makes a

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
they can digest the food it makes a
little<00:01:34.110> bit<00:01:34.229> easier<00:01:34.350> getting<00:01:34.770> down<00:01:35.040> they<00:01:35.250> also

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
little bit easier getting down they also

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
little bit easier getting down they also
like<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.299> warmer<00:01:36.329> at<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.840> stage<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
like to be a bit warmer at that stage so

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
like to be a bit warmer at that stage so
they<00:01:37.350> tend<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.650> head<00:01:37.829> towards<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> light<00:01:38.340> or

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
they tend to head towards the light or

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.850 
they tend to head towards the light or
the<00:01:38.759> heat<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.810> cuddly<00:01:40.350> toys<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the heat we have the cuddly toys it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.140 
the heat we have the cuddly toys it
means<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.490> snuggle<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.970> to
