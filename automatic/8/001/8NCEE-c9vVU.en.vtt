00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.840
 July a little too blue 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.280
 We were flowing in the back 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.180
 In the hem of your breast 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 Was nestling a jewel 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.220
 At the dawn of your embraces 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.320
 A desert of little 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.460
 An empire of nothing 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.840
 A diamond without a box 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.900
 Like a jewel too old 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.040
 Even mercury 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220
 It happened sometimes 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.500
 That at your feet I burn myself 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.600
 Demons sometimes conquered 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.460
 Demons never defeated 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.660
 Licked with one swing 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.780
 This unexpected fire 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.620
 September is early 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.660
 And our souls, head to tail 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.920
 Do not digest the offense 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.980
 That with great strokes of caresses 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.900
 From these tropical opaque 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.860
 In their winter coat 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.640
 I will remember the asp 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.860
 And this sad inventory: 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.960
 An emerald jewel 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.160
 Still in mercury 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.120
 And our tawny hugs 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.460
 Make up of burns 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.620
 Fire in jeopardy 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.720
 Like an ivy we get tangled 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.740
 You said I'm bored 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.260
 A two, we get bored
