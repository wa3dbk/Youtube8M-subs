00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
they've changed the formula it's an

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250 
they've changed the formula it's an
advanced<00:00:38.430> formula<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.660> hand<00:00:39.899> shoulders

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
advanced formula we have hand shoulders

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.920 
advanced formula we have hand shoulders
eg<00:00:40.559> scalp<00:00:40.950> care<00:00:41.280> shampoo<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.300> conditioner

eg scalp care shampoo and conditioner

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900 
eg scalp care shampoo and conditioner
and<00:00:43.230> there's<00:00:43.710> also<00:00:43.860> actually<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.370> two<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.850> one

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and there's also actually a two and one

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.869 
and there's also actually a two and one
I<00:00:45.420> find<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.230> those<00:00:46.500> tend<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.430> better<00:00:47.670> for

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
I find that those tend to be better for

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.459 
I find that those tend to be better for
men<00:00:48.120> though<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.450> think<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.930> women<00:00:49.140> really

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
men though I think that women really

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.880 
men though I think that women really
need<00:00:50.120> too<00:00:51.120> much<00:00:51.239> efficiency<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.840> actually<00:00:52.230> not

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
need too much efficiency is actually not

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.049 
need too much efficiency is actually not
such<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> great<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> comes<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.940> hair

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
such a great thing when it comes to hair

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.310 
such a great thing when it comes to hair
for<00:00:54.270> women<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.719> least<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.050> my<00:00:55.170> experience

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
for women at least in my experience

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.959 
for women at least in my experience
unless<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.219> very<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.230> go

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.569 
have this patch of I think it's actually
eczema<00:01:51.479> behind<00:01:52.170> my<00:01:52.290> left<00:01:52.649> ear<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.070> I've<00:01:53.340> never

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
eczema behind my left ear and I've never

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.429 
eczema behind my left ear and I've never
actually<00:01:53.790> seen<00:01:54.390> anything<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> just

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
actually seen anything there but I just

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.069 
actually seen anything there but I just
have<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.680> phantom<00:01:56.610> itchiness<00:01:57.149> every<00:01:57.930> once

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
have this phantom itchiness every once

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.359 
have this phantom itchiness every once
in<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> while<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.590> found<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.009> really

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
in a while and I found that this really

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.490 
in a while and I found that this really
helps<00:01:59.729> with<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.149> especially<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:01.200> she<00:02:01.469> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
helps with it it's especially if she I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.440 
helps with it it's especially if she I
found<00:02:02.040> after<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.520> got<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.790> hair<00:02:02.969> colored<00:02:03.180> which

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
found after I got my hair colored which

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.170 
found after I got my hair colored which
I<00:02:03.570> guess<00:02:03.750> makes<00:02:04.140> sense<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.619> my

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
I guess makes sense that my

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.790 
I guess makes sense that my
skin<00:02:05.660> is<00:02:05.780> sort<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.020> reacting<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
skin is sort of reacting to the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.620 
skin is sort of reacting to the
chemicals<00:02:07.250> from<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.610> color<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.180> all<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.450> that

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
chemicals from the color and all of that

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.780 
chemicals from the color and all of that
so<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.470> find<00:02:09.770> that<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.070> know<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.220> first

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
so I find that you know the first

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.720 
so I find that you know the first
