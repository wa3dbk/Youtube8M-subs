00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:02.920
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.427
 Welcome to Videoblog.hk 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.080
 I have shared some with you in the previous episodes. 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.680
 Advantages of SLR filming 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.760
 And the preparation of the short film creation 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.540
 This episode will introduce you to everyone. 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.860
 Several settings to pay attention to when making a film 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.740
 First, when filming 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.440
 Of course, first convert the camera to the recording mode. 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.460
 Some SLRs, such as 70D 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.540
 I have to twist this to the recording mode. 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.360
 The LCD will display the correct shooting ratio 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.440
 At the same time, you can also adjust the settings related to other filmings. 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.800
 Such as video format 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.780
 Recording settings, etc. 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.500
 In addition, you should also pay attention to the Frame Rate used. 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.234
 Playing media in different regions 

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:39.000
 Have specific Frame Rate settings 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 For example, in general 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.700
 In the cinema we will use 24 fps 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.060
 Hong Kong's broadcasting system is 25 fps 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.140
 Japan is 30 fps 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.340
 As for the short film placed on the Internet 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.840
 There are no specific restrictions. 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.200
 But I would recommend using 25 fps in Hong Kong. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.660
 Then you can save the trouble of editing. 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.020
 Second, anti-shake 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.800
 In most circumstances 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 We don't want to let the shock affect the picture. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.480
 So if you choose to take a handheld shot 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.480
 Instead of using a tripod 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.300
 Then a lens equipped with IS anti-shake function 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.020
 It is very important 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.820
 The following shots 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.480
 On the left is no anti-shake shooting 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.300
 And there is on the right 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260
 Everyone can see that it is obvious 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.260
 So I suggest that everyone take a hand-held shot. 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.860
 Start the anti-shake function of your lens 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.360
 Third, the shutter speed 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.280
 At the time of the film 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.060
 We often use a higher shutter speed 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.260
 To freeze some fast movements 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.800
 But on the film 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.440
 This practice may not be suitable 

00:01:32.894 --> 00:01:33.794
 In the picture 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.280
 The clip on the left is taken at 1/500 second shutter speed 

00:01:37.353 --> 00:01:39.273
 On the right is 1/50 second 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.920
 When you pay attention 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920
 You will find the high speed shutter on the left 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.380
 Instead, the picture doesn’t look smooth enough. 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.100
 Slow shutter on the right 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.940
 Let the place of activity be a bit fuzzy 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.933
 The picture looks smoother 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.060
 In fact, the principle behind it is very simple. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.600
 The movie is a series of photos in play 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.180
 The audience thinks they are moving 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.280
 Actually an illusion 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.900
 If using a fast shutter 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.320
 Let every place with activity be clear 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.600
 Then it seems that the action is not coherent 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.860
 But if you use a slower shutter speed 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 Where there is action, it will be a bit fuzzy 

00:02:08.913 --> 00:02:10.913
 It looks like the film will be smoother. 

00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:13.915
 This is called "motion blur" Motion Blur 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.940
 Fourth, white balance 

00:02:16.113 --> 00:02:17.953
 General SLR video format 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.140
 Both use H.264 compression 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
 It’s like taking a picture in JPG format 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.700
 Before everyone shoots 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.940
 Need to respond to the environment 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.533
 Adjust the correct white balance 

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:27.893
 To avoid too much color cast 

00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:29.694
 Post-production may not be remedied 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.420
 In the SLR, the white balance of different scenes has been preset. 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.340
 Such as daylight, tungsten light, fluorescent lights, etc. 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.780
 Of course, you can also manually enter the color temperature value. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.300
 To adjust the white balance 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.040
 In the next episode, we will share more about camera settings. 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.700
 Remember to pay attention!
