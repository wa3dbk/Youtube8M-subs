00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.099
 Hi, my dear 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 I came here to show you today a 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:21.619
 hair that is not hairless is a 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:24.779
 line and I painted her hair 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.210
 straw color like a straw right 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.949
 singing hair and straw 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:36.030
 so look at it with two small brushes 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:38.870
 I started lighting up with the most 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.700
 light light here I'm using ivory 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.559
 Scarecrow here she'll be a project 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:50.039
 so I'll tell you that color 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.989
 that you will use the confusion is the color 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.390
 who is there in the project 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:01:00.149
 I brushed the two brushes are 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 equal is the number is equal to the reference 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:11.150
 is equal and the size is equal 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.150
 look only first one end now with the ton 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:30.810
 here ton full of base here is the hat 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:37.400
 Look, I was selling a lot of ink. 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.400
 tightly cover the brush plot're 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:51.390
 her hair hair 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:55.619
 it's all in as if they were tapes as 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.429
 if they were even strips of straw 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.759
 so I've been trying as by bud 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:07.399
 good 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:10.709
 I'll get dark later 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.980
 now I come with the heavier tom tone 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:24.000
 darker 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:29.160
 and I'm going to darken under my hat and 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.299
 I'm going to pull, I 'm not going to touch the light. 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:43.980
 watch out for the light 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:48.030
 I come here in the middle of the sea and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.389
 stop it 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:03:02.670
 and down here I'm going to do it myself 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:03:06.049
 I come here a little while and I go up but I 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:11.970
 I want you to notice that I do not 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:16.790
 I've hit the middle ground, you're all here. 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:19.650
 You still see that tone. 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.459
 between the light and this shadow 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.459
 darker going to do now again 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:35.609
 if you want to make the shadow 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.889
 the base and leave to darken after 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:43.769
 that you finish on all buds 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:46.049
 It can also work, but I like it. 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:50.600
 A lot of fear work on the menu 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.600
 you just will not be able to delay 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.750
 OK 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.580
 You are realizing that you leave a 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.170
 space here 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.129
 good now I have with my other potential 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.129
 of the darker color 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:16.769
 I go with my intermediate tone giving 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:22.530
 just one of a kind on the water ink 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:28.080
 ran dem O okay you can even spend a 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:39.240
 little bit of ivory looks pretty goes 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:50.880
 Give a damn here you see in 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:55.290
 under the other good is another shuttle 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.180
 light a smoke exit lifting 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:05.700
 brush before him 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:11.340
 O to give an intention to define what 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:15.979
 here in the case there is wire is the straw clapboard 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.300
 I go to shade of darker tone 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.539
 remembers that the ink can not be too 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.160
 thick, otherwise you'll get this 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.270
 It is made 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:34.470
 there I see beneath the other gomo in 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:39.180
 I lighten my hat and I pull. 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:47.570
 As I said, look at the brush and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:51.139
 a little care with the streets 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.139
 here you take care of brush only 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.139
 to touch 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.680
 in the tone and intermediary, right? 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:10.870
 and here you if you want to paint or 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.840
 other type other hair with this technique 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.440
 You can also tell him what you want. 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.620
 You have to be careful with the hair shape. 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:23.470
 coming here your hand also has to 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.290
 I came here Hair is turning here 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.750
 Your hand must also come to the

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.340
