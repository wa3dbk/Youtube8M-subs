00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
first but we had a pretty good bout

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.710 
first but we had a pretty good bout
there<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.609> we<00:02:41.669> don't<00:02:41.730> use<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> seat<00:02:42.239> there<00:02:42.419> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.800 
instigator probably on that one would
you<00:03:03.870> think<00:03:04.080> possibly<00:03:04.620> maybe<00:03:05.580> ruffians<00:03:06.330> garni

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
you think possibly maybe ruffians garni

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.810 
you think possibly maybe ruffians garni
he<00:03:07.050> didn't<00:03:07.410> throw<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.680> roughing<00:03:08.280> maybe<00:03:08.520> his

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
he didn't throw it roughing maybe his

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.030 
he didn't throw it roughing maybe his
throne<00:03:09.180> he<00:03:09.300> punch<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.690> oh<00:03:09.780> because<00:03:09.990> well<00:03:10.710> you

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
throne he punch it oh because well you

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.440 
throne he punch it oh because well you
always<00:03:11.160> were<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.520> other<00:03:11.670> way<00:03:11.850> but<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.090> think<00:03:12.360> he

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
always were the other way but I think he

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.250 
always were the other way but I think he
did<00:03:12.630> take<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.870> shot<00:03:13.170> he<00:03:13.500> did<00:03:13.680> take<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> shot<00:03:14.220> with
