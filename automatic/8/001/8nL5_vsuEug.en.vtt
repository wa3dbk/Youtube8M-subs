tilt moves suggestion number five let's

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.130 
tilt moves suggestion number five let's
add<00:00:42.460> multiple<00:00:43.150> tilt<00:00:43.510> moves<00:00:43.750> for<00:00:44.050> each

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
add multiple tilt moves for each

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.590 
add multiple tilt moves for each
character<00:00:44.379> as<00:00:44.800> an<00:00:45.309> inspiration<00:00:45.640> I<00:00:46.180> want<00:00:46.449> you

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
character as an inspiration I want you

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600 
character as an inspiration I want you
to<00:00:46.780> look<00:00:46.900> at<00:00:47.080> sage<00:00:47.350> mode<00:00:47.590> now<00:00:47.830> so<00:00:48.070> who's<00:00:48.309> tilt

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
to look at sage mode now so who's tilt

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.729 
to look at sage mode now so who's tilt
moves<00:00:48.850> have<00:00:49.180> changed<00:00:49.719> from<00:00:50.020> stomp<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:50.530> to

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
moves have changed from stomp to to

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.729 
moves have changed from stomp to to
stomp<00:00:50.950> generations<00:00:52.110> instead<00:00:53.110> of<00:00:53.230> only<00:00:53.380> having

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
stomp generations instead of only having

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.530 
stomp generations instead of only having
one<00:00:54.190> specific<00:00:54.790> tilt<00:00:55.030> move<00:00:55.210> for<00:00:55.450> each

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
one specific tilt move for each

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.840 
one specific tilt move for each
character<00:00:55.780> we<00:00:56.680> should<00:00:56.890> expand<00:00:57.399> this<00:00:57.610> into

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
character we should expand this into

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.270 
character we should expand this into
having<00:00:58.300> multiple<00:00:58.780> tilled<00:00:59.050> moves<00:00:59.260> so<00:00:59.920> that<00:01:00.100> we

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
having multiple tilled moves so that we

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:10.870 
having multiple tilled moves so that we
add<00:01:00.399> more<00:01:00.640> gameplay<00:01:00.910> diversity

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.280 

in<00:01:11.880> addition<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.450> incorporating<00:01:13.050> multiple

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in addition to incorporating multiple

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
in addition to incorporating multiple
tilt<00:01:13.800> moves<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.610> should<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.910> course<00:01:15.090> keep<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
tilt moves we should of course keep the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
tilt moves we should of course keep the
original<00:01:16.050> tilt<00:01:16.290> attack<00:01:16.620> settings<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.400> that

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
original tilt attack settings so that

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.880 
original tilt attack settings so that
it's<00:01:17.790> as<00:01:18.030> simple<00:01:18.240> as<00:01:18.510> possible<00:01:18.750> however<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it's as simple as possible however it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.130 
it's as simple as possible however it
should<00:01:20.190> be<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.729> exception<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> having<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
should be with the exception of having a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.140 
should be with the exception of having a
different<00:01:22.560> tilt<00:01:22.710> move<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.340> each<00:01:23.520> analog

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
different tilt move to each analog

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.990 
different tilt move to each analog
direction<00:01:24.830> here's<00:01:25.830> an<00:01:26.130> example<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.700> how<00:01:26.940> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
direction here's an example of how the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
direction here's an example of how the
settings<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:27.690> be<00:01:27.869> when<00:01:28.229> incorporating

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
settings could be when incorporating

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.680 
settings could be when incorporating
multiple<00:01:29.130> tilt<00:01:29.640> moves<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.090> order<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.540> make

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
multiple tilt moves in order to make

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.380 
multiple tilt moves in order to make
room<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:30.900> more<00:01:31.200> diversity<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.830> this<00:01:32.790> case<00:01:33.030> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
room for more diversity in this case we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.240 
room for more diversity in this case we
have<00:01:33.540> tilt<00:01:33.810> move<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.680> tilting<00:01:35.040> four

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
have tilt move one when tilting four

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.609 
have tilt move one when tilting four
words<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.240> tilt<00:01:36.540> move<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.960> when<00:01:37.289> tilting

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
words we have tilt move to when tilting

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.770 
words we have tilt move to when tilting
to<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> right<00:01:38.039> tilt<00:01:38.789> move<00:01:39.060> three<00:01:39.509> when

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
to the right tilt move three when

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.139 
to the right tilt move three when
tilting<00:01:40.110> backwards<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.979> finally<00:01:41.759> tilt

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
tilting backwards and then finally tilt

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.270 
tilting backwards and then finally tilt
move<00:01:42.390> for<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:43.259> tilting<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> left<00:01:44.100> in

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
move for when tilting to the left in

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.460 
move for when tilting to the left in
this<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.880> we<00:01:45.119> keep<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.509> simplicity<00:01:46.110> without

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
this way we keep the simplicity without

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.560 
this way we keep the simplicity without
changing<00:01:46.979> anything<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.550> such<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.390> still

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
changing anything as such and we still

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.960 
changing anything as such and we still
get<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> have<00:01:49.110> more<00:01:49.380> moves<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.890> perform

suggestion number six in addition to
incorporating<00:01:56.130> multiple<00:01:56.399> tilt<00:01:56.910> moves<00:01:57.149> let's

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
incorporating multiple tilt moves let's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.779 
incorporating multiple tilt moves let's
add<00:01:58.080> different<00:01:58.320> tilt<00:01:58.740> move<00:01:58.979> categories

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
add different tilt move categories

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.749 
add different tilt move categories
categories<00:02:00.750> such<00:02:01.440> as<00:02:01.500> attacking<00:02:02.100> defense

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
categories such as attacking defense

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.300 
categories such as attacking defense
touching<00:02:03.479> counter-attacking<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.740> signature

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
touching counter-attacking and signature

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
touching counter-attacking and signature
moves<00:02:05.520> by<00:02:06.060> doing<00:02:06.330> this<00:02:06.360> we<00:02:06.869> will<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
moves by doing this we will have that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.830 
moves by doing this we will have that
exit<00:02:07.920> death<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.610> gameplay<00:02:08.789> experience<00:02:09.540> by

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
exit death to the gameplay experience by

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
exit death to the gameplay experience by
having<00:02:10.170> specifically<00:02:10.830> designed<00:02:11.160> moves<00:02:11.430> that
