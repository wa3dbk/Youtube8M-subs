00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hey ho people are you fan of the anime 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.740
 attack and hold 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.210
 have you ever wondered how that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.890
 whole would look like if someone was playing 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.510
 if it does then I have one 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.550
 small solution for you and that 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.019
 attack and hold tribute game what that 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.610
 whole is and what the whole dives 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.610
 you are now experiencing the intro 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.140
 First of all, I want a small one 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.550
 Issue warning for all deal in anime 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.560
 attack and titan have not looked 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.300
 have this review or ideas 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.489
 The game may have a few small spoiler 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.800
 so if you do not 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.730
 to mess up the whole thing or if you want 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.449
 stop the anime still want to look then 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.250
 maybe not look 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.780
 Of course I try the spoiler like that 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.860
 as little as possible and as small as 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.570
 possible to keep 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.280
 Well, let's start with it 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.100
 clarify what the game at all for one 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.379
 game is launched contribute game is 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.540
 a browser game so you play that in the 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.400
 browser and for that you need the unity 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.750
 webplayer when they start the game 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.369
 you want and you do not have the player then 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.869
 you will also be shown where you have the 

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.309
 you can download the game you can 

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:06.439
 play for free is just like us 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.420
 said a tribute also animated 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.159
 So it was made by a fan of 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.659
 animes made the game different 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.670
 Modi I have to start with the first 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.159
 main menu and what is there so everything 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.190
 us so and then explain afterwards 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.960
 whole game 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.880
 in the main menu could first the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 change the language of the menu to german 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.940
 then there is the single and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.680
 multiplayer as well as the option and the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.120
 credits to play in multiplayer 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
 You do not have to have your own account 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.160
 then you will only have the name guest 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.540
 then with a number then shown and 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.010
 I really think it's better if you do 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.720
 his own name has the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.520
 Registration is fast and easy 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.440
 you just have to e-mail 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.770
 confirm but that does not last 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.630
 say 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.160
 in the options could be the control 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.260
 change for the key assignment 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.940
 You can also enter the graphic there 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.620
 little change but there are only four 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.360
 stages and it does not really work that way 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.630
 a lot from then you can still there 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.159
 new sensibility and also the 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.780
 camera settings 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.009
 if you want to play my players 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 you can choose a map 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.049
 a character from the animated titan 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.509
 a daytime the difficulty and 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.100
 also the camera setting in this 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.289
 Example play on the card in front of it 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.330
 with the character then on the day with the 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.760
 camera setting original and with the 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.650
 difficulty normal to normal 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.200
 Maps city and foris are easy 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.040
 therefore 15 titan in a certain time too 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.629
 kill 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.160
 while you can pay with a 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.810
 impact to the neck may 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.269
 there are currently four classes of titan 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.280
 the normal titan the abnormal ones 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.329
 jumper and the crawler have this 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.069
 each also different 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.410
 skills or special features 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.629
 as well as in anime one owns too 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.430
 the typical equipment that means you 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.319
 has the blades and the 3d maneuver go 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.970
 the swing with the trading maneuver goes 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.480
 it is somewhat difficult at the time 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.890
 Beginning 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.599
 so it is also relative to the beginning 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.519
 hard to kill in titan 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.530
 Each of the selectable characters has one 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.120
 can spaniard special ability to 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.850
 for example, from the hands of the total 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.410
 free what others can not 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.270
 as you can see here, there are also 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.800
 different ads in the game altogether 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.200
 down in the middle, for example, you see 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.690
 the level of your gas tanks you for 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.060
 the 3d maneuver also sees a lot of woman 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.170
 number of all available blades above 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.940
 left in the corner you will see the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.520
 Names of your players in multiplayer 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.990
 and whether they are dead or not 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.670
 in the middle you can still see how 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.920
 many titan are still left or which 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.420
 wave of titania is playing and how 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.250
 a lot of time is left or how 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.960
 a lot of time has already passed 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.650
 then on the particular mode to which he 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.840
 just playing 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.550
 okay so now I have all the important ones 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.140
 Information collected for you 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.000
 has thus her play playing times 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.440
 can and still wants that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.830
 you discovered a few features yourself 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.660
 become 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.280
 I'll play the game now 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.870
 Let's summarize what I mean 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.180
 find the game good and bad and so on 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.920
 even with other features represented 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.630
 So, let's do something for everyone 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.070
 music still lacks music like hers 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.840
 maybe already seen in the gameplay 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.980
 there are only sounds that someday 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.260
 get on your nerves and not really 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.120
 good and there are music emotions lazy 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.650
 is that what is very important in what 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.840
 I can not miss a game, for example 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.550
 found no everyday life and titan game 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.560
 before i do not do the soundtracks but 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.180
 could have done on here times 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.180
 a small montage without music 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.340
 and here a montage with the tech 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.340
 and titan soundtracks 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.460
 you see that really makes a lot of difference 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.229
 I also think that one the 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.310
 Models of the characters and the title 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.080
 to edit 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.340
 make the maps a bit nicer 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.229
 can make a bit bigger 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.690
 other apps where can 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:45.610
 one holds more variety more freewheel 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.289
 has and in any case it would have to 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.360
 give something like a friends list one 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.800
 better and filter for the server up 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.770
 where you can just sort the servers 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.070
 by name or player or something and so 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.660
 very important also new sounds so please 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.460
 could have anime and cool sounds 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.840
 why can not you take that over 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.210
 you get somewhere I think 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.979
 times 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.509
 So you see I still have many ideas 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.229
 what could be improved and many 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.660
 proposals 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.759
 So what do you mean in the description 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.710
 is the link for example it plays 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.729
 it just costs nothing and nothing 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.349
 We could do with purely ten minutes 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.030
 invest with a few friends or 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.410
 so play that and then write me 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.910
 just in the comments like her 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.030
 the game finds what you even better 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.650
 would you do and yes that was it time 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.380
 Again, I thank you very much 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.300
 for your attention and for yours 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.289
 patience i hope i do not work 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.289
 opposite 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.370
 I've just got into the 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.810
 we comment the presentations or 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.870
 review or whatever that was 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.740
 found and yes the game and I play 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.740
 say goodbye to me here
