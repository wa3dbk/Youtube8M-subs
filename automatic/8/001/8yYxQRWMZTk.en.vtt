the<00:01:48.070> performance<00:01:48.250> tests<00:01:48.909> we<00:01:49.030> use<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> race

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
the performance tests we use a race

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.320 
the performance tests we use a race
logic<00:01:49.960> fifth<00:01:50.229> box<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:51.009> allows<00:01:51.310> us<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.700> measure

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
logic fifth box it allows us to measure

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.810 
logic fifth box it allows us to measure
all<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.899> required<00:01:53.259> data<00:01:53.440> in<00:01:53.860> one<00:01:54.190> clean<00:01:54.490> sweep

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
all the required data in one clean sweep

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.389 
all the required data in one clean sweep
it's<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.479> GPS<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.289> accelerometer<00:01:57.130> based

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
it's a GPS and accelerometer based

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.700 
it's a GPS and accelerometer based
system<00:01:57.909> which<00:01:58.659> has<00:01:58.869> a<00:01:58.899> very<00:01:59.170> high<00:01:59.350> degree<00:01:59.380> of

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
system which has a very high degree of

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:10.650 
system which has a very high degree of
accuracy

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.130 

so<00:02:11.660> as<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.900> can<00:02:12.020> see<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.500> shows<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.390> 0<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.570> 100

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
so as you can see it shows the 0 to 100

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.730 
so as you can see it shows the 0 to 100
at<00:02:15.320> eight<00:02:15.800> seconds<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.520> 100<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.120> zero<00:02:17.360> at<00:02:17.740> 38.2

at eight seconds the 100 to zero at 38.2
