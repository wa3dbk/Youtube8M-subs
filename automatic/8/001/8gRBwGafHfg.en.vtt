in<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.680> video<00:00:04.980> we're<00:00:05.399> going<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.580> take<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.819> look

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.780 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.390> outliner<00:00:06.840> the<00:00:07.799> outliner<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.340> another

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
at the outliner the outliner is another

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.090 
at the outliner the outliner is another
tool<00:00:09.059> very<00:00:09.510> similar<00:00:09.930> to<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.530> hyper<00:00:10.740> graph

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.100 
tool very similar to the hyper graph

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.640 
tool very similar to the hyper graph
that<00:00:11.580> will<00:00:11.850> show<00:00:12.120> us<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.719> nodes<00:00:13.019> that<00:00:13.200> we<00:00:13.410> have

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
that will show us the nodes that we have

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.730 
that will show us the nodes that we have
within<00:00:14.070> our<00:00:14.280> scene<00:00:14.809> to<00:00:15.809> access<00:00:16.200> the<00:00:16.379> outliner

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
within our scene to access the outliner

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.900 
within our scene to access the outliner
we<00:00:17.220> go<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> window<00:00:18.529> outliner

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
we go to window outliner

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.900 
we go to window outliner
we<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.150> see<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:21.930> hidden<00:00:22.490> cameras<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.880> I

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
we can see the hidden cameras that I

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.200 
we can see the hidden cameras that I
have<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.480> my<00:00:25.050> scene<00:00:25.290> file<00:00:25.619> as<00:00:25.800> well<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:26.520> some

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
have in my scene file as well as some

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.410 
have in my scene file as well as some
default<00:00:27.720> nodes<00:00:28.110> that<00:00:28.500> Maya<00:00:28.740> needs<00:00:29.420> let's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
default nodes that Maya needs let's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.749 
default nodes that Maya needs let's
create<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:31.349> nodes<00:00:31.590> here<00:00:31.860> and<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.250> how<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
create some nodes here and see how the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.000 
create some nodes here and see how the
outliner<00:00:33.300> updates<00:00:33.900> and<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.530> gonna<00:00:34.650> just<00:00:34.800> go

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
outliner updates and I'm gonna just go

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.549 
outliner updates and I'm gonna just go
to<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.520> shelf<00:00:35.850> click<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.750> sphere<00:00:37.019> button

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
to my shelf click the sphere button

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.610 
to my shelf click the sphere button
there<00:00:37.769> and<00:00:37.980> now<00:00:38.220> I<00:00:38.250> have<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> piece<00:00:39.000> vr1<00:00:39.660> inside

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there and now I have a piece vr1 inside

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.520 
there and now I have a piece vr1 inside
of<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.070> outliner<00:00:41.540> now<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.600> will<00:00:42.930> not<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.320> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
of my outliner now we will not get to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.360 
of my outliner now we will not get to
see<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:45.120> lower<00:00:46.190> connection<00:00:47.190> or

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
see all of the lower connection or

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.750 
see all of the lower connection or
inputs<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.269> our<00:00:49.230> nodes<00:00:49.769> that<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.610> get

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
inputs of our nodes that would get

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.490 
inputs of our nodes that would get
really<00:00:50.970> confusing<00:00:51.629> inside<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> outline

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
really confusing inside of the outline

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.889 
really confusing inside of the outline
or<00:00:52.680> anyways<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.879> we<00:00:54.030> will<00:00:54.210> get<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.480> see<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
or anyways but we will get to see all of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
or anyways but we will get to see all of
the<00:00:55.140> parent-child<00:00:55.739> relationships<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.640> any

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the parent-child relationships and any

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
the parent-child relationships and any
nodes<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.200> visible<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.770> our<00:00:58.920> scene<00:00:59.219> I'm

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
nodes that are visible in our scene I'm

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.580 
nodes that are visible in our scene I'm
gonna<00:00:59.910> create<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.690> couple<00:01:00.899> more<00:01:01.110> objects

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
gonna create just a couple more objects

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.229 
gonna create just a couple more objects
here<00:01:01.829> we'll<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.010> throw<00:01:02.430> some<00:01:02.700> stuff<00:01:03.000> out

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
here we'll just throw some stuff out

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.870 
here we'll just throw some stuff out
there<00:01:03.510> using<00:01:04.080> our<00:01:04.379> shelf<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.280> pile<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there using our shelf just pile that

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
there using our shelf just pile that
stuff<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:07.979> thing<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.250> want<00:01:08.399> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
stuff up and the first thing I want to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
stuff up and the first thing I want to
do<00:01:08.580> inside<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.940> my<00:01:09.060> outliner<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.800> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
do inside of my outliner here is do a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.150 
do inside of my outliner here is do a
parent-child<00:01:11.550> relationship<00:01:12.479> we<00:01:13.410> can<00:01:13.590> middle

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
parent-child relationship we can middle

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.790 
parent-child relationship we can middle
mouse<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.640> drag<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.479> just<00:01:15.869> drop<00:01:16.170> on<00:01:16.410> to

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
mouse and drag and just drop on to

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.880 
mouse and drag and just drop on to
another<00:01:16.979> node<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.600> again<00:01:18.600> very<00:01:19.350> similar<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
another node and again very similar to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.460 
another node and again very similar to
our<00:01:20.009> hyper<00:01:20.220> graph<00:01:20.520> setup<00:01:20.910> we<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.720> need<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
our hyper graph setup we do not need to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.389 
our hyper graph setup we do not need to
have<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:23.190> node<00:01:24.110> selected<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.560> I'm<00:01:25.740> middle-mouse

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
have a node selected so I'm middle-mouse

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:27.919 
have a node selected so I'm middle-mouse
thing<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.759> let's<00:01:26.880> go<00:01:27.000> down<00:01:27.209> here<00:01:27.240> I'll<00:01:27.630> middle

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
thing and let's go down here I'll middle

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.960 
thing and let's go down here I'll middle
mouse<00:01:28.080> okay<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.250> as<00:01:29.340> soon<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.550> I<00:01:29.670> start<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
mouse okay and as soon as I start to

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910 
mouse okay and as soon as I start to
drag<00:01:30.179> it<00:01:30.360> kind<00:01:30.539> of<00:01:30.599> highlights<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
drag it kind of highlights and then I

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.029 
drag it kind of highlights and then I
can<00:01:32.130> drop<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.789> onto<00:01:33.289> another<00:01:34.289> node<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> make<00:01:34.890> it

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
can drop it onto another node to make it

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.380 
can drop it onto another node to make it
a<00:01:35.220> child<00:01:35.750> now<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.080> get<00:01:37.319> a<00:01:37.349> plus<00:01:37.679> sign<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.940> I<00:01:39.000> can

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
a child now I get a plus sign that I can

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.260 
a child now I get a plus sign that I can
then<00:01:39.599> choose<00:01:40.289> and<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.069> will<00:01:41.190> expand<00:01:41.940> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
then choose and that will expand that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.480 
then choose and that will expand that
hierarchy<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.319> it<00:01:43.440> shows<00:01:43.649> me<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.950> parent<00:01:44.340> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
hierarchy so it shows me the parent and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.400 
hierarchy so it shows me the parent and
then<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.729> will<00:01:44.849> show<00:01:44.880> me<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.899> children

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
then it will show me all of the children

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.800 
then it will show me all of the children
underneath<00:01:47.099> it<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> let's<00:01:48.240> change<00:01:48.569> this

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
underneath it and let's change this

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.169 
underneath it and let's change this
hierarchy<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.679> little<00:01:49.890> bit<00:01:50.069> we'll<00:01:50.459> make

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
hierarchy just a little bit we'll make

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.270 
hierarchy just a little bit we'll make
that<00:01:51.450> one<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:52.020> notice<00:01:52.289> now<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:52.440> get<00:01:52.679> plus<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that one and notice now I get plus and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.029 
that one and notice now I get plus and
let's<00:01:53.780> take<00:01:54.780> peak<00:01:55.140> cone<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.679> make<00:01:55.800> that<00:01:55.979> a

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
let's take peak cone and make that a

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.770 
let's take peak cone and make that a
child<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:56.970> there's<00:01:57.239> another<00:01:57.450> plus

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
child of that one there's another plus

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.260 
child of that one there's another plus
and<00:01:57.989> we'll<00:01:58.080> just<00:01:58.229> expand<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.739> and<00:01:59.149> I'm<00:02:00.149> gonna

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
and we'll just expand that and I'm gonna

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.139 
and we'll just expand that and I'm gonna
move<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.720> out<00:02:00.959> in<00:02:01.440> my<00:02:01.500> viewport<00:02:02.429> we'll<00:02:02.940> just

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
move this out in my viewport we'll just

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.199 
move this out in my viewport we'll just
slide<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.539> over<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:03.989> let's<00:02:04.410> collapse<00:02:04.800> that

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:05.209 
slide that over and let's collapse that

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:09.800 
slide that over and let's collapse that
so<00:02:06.209> in<00:02:06.509> my<00:02:07.289> perspective<00:02:08.069> view<00:02:08.700> if<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.149> select

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
so in my perspective view if I select

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.920 
so in my perspective view if I select
that<00:02:09.899> cone<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.649> then<00:02:11.370> want<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.880> see<00:02:12.300> where<00:02:12.780> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
that cone and then want to see where it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.800 
that cone and then want to see where it
sits<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.440> my<00:02:13.650> outliner<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:15.090> see<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.569> it

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
sits in my outliner I can see that it

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.869 
sits in my outliner I can see that it
does<00:02:16.140> highlight<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> parent<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:17.730> not

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
does highlight the parent but it's not

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.270 
does highlight the parent but it's not
showing<00:02:18.270> me<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.750> actual<00:02:19.170> node<00:02:19.440> inside<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.160> the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
showing me the actual node inside of the

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.640 
showing me the actual node inside of the
outliner<00:02:20.640> yet<00:02:20.940> what<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:21.989> can<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
outliner yet what we can do is

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.070 
outliner yet what we can do is
right-click<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.450> going<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.629> bring<00:02:24.840> up<00:02:24.959> a

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
right-click and it's going to bring up a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.839 
right-click and it's going to bring up a
pop-up<00:02:25.290> window<00:02:25.620> here<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.370> can<00:02:26.550> choose

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
pop-up window here and we can choose

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.309 
pop-up window here and we can choose
reveal<00:02:27.770> selected

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
reveal selected

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.160 
reveal selected
and<00:02:29.469> that<00:02:29.829> will<00:02:29.950> automatically<00:02:30.459> expand<00:02:31.390> that

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
and that will automatically expand that

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.789 
and that will automatically expand that
hierarchy<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.969> expose<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:35.349> node<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.769> I

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
hierarchy out to expose the node that I

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.709 
hierarchy out to expose the node that I
currently<00:02:35.920> have<00:02:36.310> selected<00:02:37.090> that's<00:02:37.420> just<00:02:37.629> a

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:37.719 
currently have selected that's just a

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:40.349 
currently have selected that's just a
nice<00:02:37.930> quick<00:02:38.439> shortcut<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.549> get<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.060> those

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
nice quick shortcut to get to those

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.280 
nice quick shortcut to get to those
nodes<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:40.989> expand<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.129> entire<00:02:42.459> hierarchy

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
nodes and to expand the entire hierarchy

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.960 
nodes and to expand the entire hierarchy
now<00:02:44.319> maneuvering<00:02:45.069> inside<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.549> outliner

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
now maneuvering inside of the outliner

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.259 
now maneuvering inside of the outliner
is<00:02:46.150> again<00:02:47.140> just<00:02:47.319> like<00:02:47.560> our<00:02:47.799> normal<00:02:48.269> cameras

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
is again just like our normal cameras

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.750 
is again just like our normal cameras
and<00:02:49.480> let's<00:02:50.140> populate<00:02:50.859> it<00:02:50.980> with<00:02:51.010> a<00:02:51.220> bunch<00:02:51.549> of

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
and let's populate it with a bunch of

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.789 
and let's populate it with a bunch of
stuff<00:02:52.000> here<00:02:52.329> I'm<00:02:52.510> gonna<00:02:52.659> choose<00:02:53.079> control<00:02:53.560> D

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
stuff here I'm gonna choose control D

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.940 
stuff here I'm gonna choose control D
just<00:02:54.099> to<00:02:54.659> duplicate<00:02:55.659> this<00:02:55.900> off<00:02:56.200> of<00:02:56.829> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
just to duplicate this off of the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.069 
just to duplicate this off of the
outliner<00:02:57.340> screen<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.060> okay<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.780> now<00:02:59.049> I

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
outliner screen there okay and now I

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.349 
outliner screen there okay and now I
have<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.319> bar<00:02:59.590> here<00:02:59.859> that<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.219> can<00:03:00.489> go<00:03:00.670> up<00:03:01.180> and

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
have a bar here that I can go up and

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.080 
have a bar here that I can go up and
down<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.659> see<00:03:01.840> my<00:03:02.019> other<00:03:02.139> objects<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:03.939> I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
down to see my other objects but if I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.580 
down to see my other objects but if I
hit<00:03:04.299> Alt<00:03:04.599> +<00:03:04.959> middle<00:03:05.439> mouse<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:06.040> can<00:03:06.370> then<00:03:06.909> pan

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
hit Alt + middle mouse I can then pan

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.369 
hit Alt + middle mouse I can then pan
inside<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.950> my<00:03:09.459> outliner<00:03:09.909> we<00:03:10.780> can<00:03:10.959> select

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
inside of my outliner we can select

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.339 
inside of my outliner we can select
multiple<00:03:11.909> nodes<00:03:12.909> inside<00:03:13.659> of<00:03:13.780> our<00:03:13.900> outliner

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
multiple nodes inside of our outliner

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.170 
multiple nodes inside of our outliner
simply<00:03:14.799> by<00:03:14.950> left<00:03:15.459> clicking<00:03:15.579> and<00:03:16.060> dragging

simply by left clicking and dragging
that<00:03:16.930> will<00:03:17.620> highlight<00:03:17.859> all<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.609> those<00:03:18.730> objects

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
that will highlight all of those objects

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.140 
that will highlight all of those objects
there<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.659> then<00:03:20.409> I<00:03:20.620> can<00:03:20.680> middle<00:03:21.549> mouse<00:03:21.819> and

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
make all of those objects a child of

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.230 
make all of those objects a child of
something<00:03:25.329> else

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
something else

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.240

and<00:03:54.129> let's<00:03:54.610> expand<00:03:55.239> these<00:03:55.510> out<00:03:55.900> here<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.790> I'm

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
and let's expand these out here and I'm

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.699 
and let's expand these out here and I'm
just<00:03:58.030> gonna<00:03:58.180> click<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:58.720> our<00:03:58.930> little<00:03:59.110> plus<00:03:59.440> sign

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
just gonna click on our little plus sign

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.080 
just gonna click on our little plus sign
here<00:03:59.739> just<00:04:00.190> so<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.549> makes<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.849> a<00:04:00.909> little

space there okay so now I have this long

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.410 
space there okay so now I have this long
list<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.159> it<00:04:09.159> can<00:04:09.310> be<00:04:09.430> somewhat<00:04:09.790> tedious<00:04:10.000> to

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
list and it can be somewhat tedious to

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.569 
list and it can be somewhat tedious to
kind<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:10.810> have<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.079> continually<00:04:11.620> scroll<00:04:12.190> back

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
kind of have to continually scroll back

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.850 
kind of have to continually scroll back
and<00:04:12.819> forth<00:04:13.120> through<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.720> outline<00:04:14.349> or<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.650> try

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
and forth through the outline or to try

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.949 
and forth through the outline or to try
to<00:04:14.890> find<00:04:15.250> any<00:04:15.549> of<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.209> objects<00:04:16.690> that<00:04:16.810> you're

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
to find any of the objects that you're

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.620 
to find any of the objects that you're
looking<00:04:17.290> for<00:04:17.560> what<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.669> outliner<00:04:19.060> gives<00:04:19.389> us

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
looking for what the outliner gives us

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.449 
looking for what the outliner gives us
is<00:04:19.840> down<00:04:20.049> at<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.320> bottom<00:04:20.739> here<00:04:20.949> it's<00:04:21.070> actually

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
is down at the bottom here it's actually

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.360 
is down at the bottom here it's actually
collapsed<00:04:22.180> down<00:04:22.479> if<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:23.350> left<00:04:23.800> click<00:04:24.070> and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
collapsed down if you left click and

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.909 
collapsed down if you left click and
drag<00:04:24.400> you'll<00:04:25.090> see<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:25.570> get<00:04:25.750> a<00:04:25.990> second

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
drag you'll see that you get a second

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.120 
drag you'll see that you get a second
instance<00:04:27.639> of<00:04:27.910> your<00:04:28.539> outliner<00:04:29.080> view<00:04:29.500> they're

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
instance of your outliner view they're

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.159 
instance of your outliner view they're
essentially<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.610> same<00:04:30.729> thing<00:04:31.240> but<00:04:31.510> it<00:04:31.900> allows

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
essentially the same thing but it allows

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.159 
essentially the same thing but it allows
us<00:04:32.410> to<00:04:32.620> see<00:04:32.919> different<00:04:33.639> locations<00:04:34.360> so<00:04:34.539> if<00:04:35.020> I

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
us to see different locations so if I

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.080 
us to see different locations so if I
can<00:04:35.380> scroll<00:04:35.770> this<00:04:36.160> one<00:04:36.370> all<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.550> way<00:04:36.729> down<00:04:36.910> at

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
can scroll this one all the way down at

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.210 
can scroll this one all the way down at
the<00:04:37.120> bottom<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.570> I<00:04:37.870> can<00:04:38.139> keep<00:04:38.320> this<00:04:38.530> one<00:04:38.590> up

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
the bottom here I can keep this one up

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.850 
the bottom here I can keep this one up
at<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.520> top<00:04:39.729> and<00:04:40.060> be<00:04:40.570> able<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.870> choose<00:04:41.169> nodes

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
at the top and be able to choose nodes

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.770 
at the top and be able to choose nodes
at<00:04:42.430> different<00:04:42.850> locations<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.449> little<00:04:43.660> bit

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
at different locations a little bit

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.590 
at different locations a little bit
quicker<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:45.430> can<00:04:45.760> even<00:04:45.910> bring<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.330> down

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
quicker so you can even bring this down

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.420 
quicker so you can even bring this down
and<00:04:46.870> just<00:04:47.199> kind<00:04:47.350> of<00:04:47.470> use<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.979> highlight

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
and just kind of use this to highlight

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.879 
and just kind of use this to highlight
specific<00:04:48.699> areas<00:04:49.449> or<00:04:49.570> a<00:04:49.630> specific<00:04:49.960> hierarchy

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
specific areas or a specific hierarchy

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.600 
specific areas or a specific hierarchy
of<00:04:51.039> nodes<00:04:51.639> that<00:04:51.789> you're<00:04:52.060> looking<00:04:52.330> for

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
of nodes that you're looking for

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.820 
of nodes that you're looking for
if<00:04:53.669> you<00:04:54.030> want<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.360> clean<00:04:54.689> the<00:04:54.990> outliner<00:04:55.439> up<00:04:55.710> a

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
if you want to clean the outliner up a

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.700 
if you want to clean the outliner up a
bit<00:04:56.009> we<00:04:56.219> can<00:04:56.250> take<00:04:56.669> nodes<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.240> hide<00:04:57.629> them<00:04:57.960> so

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
bit we can take nodes and hide them so

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.320 
bit we can take nodes and hide them so
we'll<00:04:58.830> grab<00:04:59.129> just<00:04:59.430> a<00:04:59.550> bunch<00:04:59.759> of<00:04:59.849> these<00:05:00.030> here

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
we'll grab just a bunch of these here

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.800 
we'll grab just a bunch of these here

see a bit more and that can get
confusing<00:05:35.310> we'll<00:05:35.580> have<00:05:35.730> lots<00:05:36.150> of<00:05:36.300> nodes<00:05:36.540> lots

of little plus signs here so it can get
