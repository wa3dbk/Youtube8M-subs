00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.650
 we will show you how 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.170
 dismantle a pipe on a typical engine 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.019
 without three so there the engine that you 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.110
 see on this tutorial and disassemble because 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.070
 I'm doing them but he 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.949
 there is no need to disassemble the engine 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.340
 when you see on a machine if you 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.260
 see but the peep remains accessible 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.600
 it's harder when it's not 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.150
 when those wills but then it's 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.510
 feasible even though going on the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.399
 bÃ©cane so it will simply 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.860
 removed the four vices you see 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.390
 so we have one two three four on the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.480
 smoking pipe 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.800
 we wanted to davis and you davis and the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.890
 peep so with a key 10 8 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.739
 so if your engine is mounted of course 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.789
 it will disassemble the carbu before so 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 for this if you watch the video 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.620
 how to disassemble a carburetor and sparkle 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.680
 so pay the stage and arrive who 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.710
 cool rest is not complicated so that 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.000
 you do to keep it but the goal 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.430
 it's changing course and so we're 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 it can be ruined otherwise go for 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.549
 put you in a name but that's it 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.369
 will pass them we will put new 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:25.369
 valves we did not play but one stop south 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 you positioned it above 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:50.549
 you come a master levis we go to 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:53.789
 through sweet but the hardest it is 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:59.459
 to put the first two you have 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:04.170
 managed to take the seal the valves l2 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:06.030
 - elma you are good so the four 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.429
 vices have returned you will remain more 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 that their life is therefore at the beginning or 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.459
 it's just the hand 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.810
 so still not even system very 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.299
 tight too tight and you're star 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.120
 so I have star tight 1 that means 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.500
 in the opposite direction or in the direction 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.420
 clockwise that's all 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.180
 simply crossed so if I avoid that it's 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.609
 this one i'm going to come by cc so right 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.390
 after can prevent life is this one 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.390
 is this one
