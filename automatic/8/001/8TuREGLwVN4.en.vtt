00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.480
 these penguins are penguin species of 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.370
 humboldt is a species in climates 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.160
 tropical temperate unlike 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.480
 other species of penguins that exist 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.489
 in the world there are 17 different 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.199
 species of penguins they all live 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.900
 in the radius in the southern hemisphere of 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.199
 planet there are species that are from the pole 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.000
 south others and the arctic arts of 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.100
 ice and other fish are from climates 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.390
 tempered and by the way there is a kind 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.980
 that can reach the house of the school 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.839
 all the equator has gone down 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.150
 all ways of thinking and such the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.100
 Freiburg football is habitat so 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.650
 free in chile and peru the coasts of 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.780
 chile and peru and is native to the current 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.920
 of the football subway not only what 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.409
 that we have the sort of good of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.500
 football as run there are 17 species 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.330
 different from penguins and soccer is 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.790
 one of the smallest species of the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.729
 first one reaches a size of 45 70 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.590
 centimeters of height a weight of 4 to 4 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.750
 kilos and a half on average is just a 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.340
 pointer has three females three males 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.509
 physically there are no differences in 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.540
 species of penguins is to say that no 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.970
 there is a sexual rhythm whereby they 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.009
 they were counted through DNA is like 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.430
 we know that aclares are males that are 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.619
 females 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.229
 if the 20 in a different bracelet 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.060
 This we hope we can identify and 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.770
 is each have a different color 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.690
 besides this they are placed in 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.460
 different fin the females on the side 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.259
 left the males in the right and so 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.000
 the simple sight we know that exemplary and 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.380
 that this performance is football tube 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.299
 like most wrecks penguins 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.610
 they live in very large groups are 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.899
 monogamous at the respective time he by 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.310
 it is not usually in the same couple 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.170
 every year that enters the time of 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.500
 reproduction 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.470
 the profession in them can be during 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.399
 the whole year is mainly considered 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.020
 from March to December 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.910
 bavaria also much remember the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.040
 region there are places or has been reported 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.420
 that there are two peaks of reproduction one 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.480
 which is April May and the processes of 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.580
 October for this the macho builds the 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.920
 nest and they can get it are the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.090
 rocky on land in males that 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.950
 manufactures the level of November 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.560
 it will arrive in the position of the eggs 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:33.700
 They put 1 to 3 eggs on average are 2 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.930
 that will incubate up to 40 42 days the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.090
 can share it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.600
 directly in this species he performs 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.850
 the female there are species like the emperor 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.380
 that the female passes the egg to the male 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.880
 and the male is going to incubate while 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.819
 the company will call you looking for food 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.080
 and it was too long in returning the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.370
 first the emperor also to 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.049
 difference from humboldt's is that they 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.790
 report on the parties yesterday you have not 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.530
 had all the time connect the egg 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.840
 in the legs and also with the use of 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.190
 egg have a button or button of 3 to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.660
 just like other species attributes that 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.250
 they are very close to them 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.420
 in fact physically the species that most 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.480
 it looks like it's the penguin's 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.340
 magallanes that unlike soccer 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.410
 that has a black horseshoe in the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.270
 white chest the one of magallanes has two 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.330
 threatened encounter 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.520
 not in a serious danger as such but if 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.890
 I take out your trade on one side so 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.320
 you can market the species not 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.180
 is protected we do not mind mentioning that 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.720
 the penguins is a non-flying species 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.600
 once they do not fly sperm 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.730
 anatomical adaptations so that 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.350
 wings became fins for this 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.660
 the bones are very fused the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.010
 joints are very hard and does not prevent 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.500
 the independent movement of each 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.570
 of the bones and the skin is also very 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.670
 stuck to the bones to give this 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.470
 fin shape with those that can swim 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.750
 very easily it is said that they fly inside 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.030
 of water can reach a diversity 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.240
 of 14 meters but kilometers per hour to 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.730
 300 per hour and down to 20 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.860
 meters of depth different from 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.560
 penguins have a period or scope on 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.180
 variable conversion period of 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.040
 Larger species reach 18 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.750
 minutes without breathing to hold the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.070
 breathing to be submerged 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.930
 in the water live football like the 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.000
 most bird species are for a 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.500
 process known as pelÃ© cha is to say 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.109
 which is a season in which they change everything 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.670
 the plumage pulls the feathers and they jump in 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.730
 the new ways to give it growth 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.770
 to the exploration 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.060
 this season of feleches so 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.160
 general is given prior to the time 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.590
 reproductive is when we are going to see 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.870
 we as if they were collective 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.760
 of all excited the fact 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.070
 of it are very exported in this 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.010
 era and it's to throw away those old feathers 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.570
 without giving rise to the new ones is also 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.030
 important to mention that it has two types 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.470
 of feathers in the outer layer is what 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.140
 It is difficult for you and protects you against 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.180
 water and the air and the internal one is what 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.680
 It gives impermeability and also for 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.390
 save heat in the three chicks 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.640
 good rights of the three eggs that 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.860
 they can get to put in general 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.720
 they will be different animal season 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.180
 but for days it can be one day at 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.340
 next or two days after the other 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.710
 almost always born to the average 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.870
 12 o'clock because general and the smallest 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.670
 will die later for the time so that 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.750
 it takes to be born and because the cares 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.060
 they are also given by parents more 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.770
 First 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.710
 in a natural way that always happens 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.660
 this parents are going to feed the 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.280
 chicks through trimming the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.230
 food that they consumed and 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.750
 pass them from pickford and this they do 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.250
 up to 3 months of age and in 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.740
 chicks will reach maturity 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.810
 Sexual three years and around 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.120
 the three months starts and its change 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.980
 of plumage to have a way of 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.540
 adult and that's when you can sell 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.550
 to water your problems in contract 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.710
 independent the society of the tribune of 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.720
 football goes between 12 and 15 years without a 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.220
 commissioned operator and will take care of the 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.919
 egg between the legs they do not form 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.479
 nest place it between the legs and they 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.490
 the whole incubation will remain 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.310
 this in amman to do the posture 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.930
 later they pass it to the male a 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.970
 ritual that they make important because the 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.310
 egg can not touch the ice and it does not 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.870
 would harm and not it would not be the chick since 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.550
 Once the female does not pass, she goes to the 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.830
 sea our meter will cost a lot 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.690
 time to return and the male keeps 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.880
 all this time incubation stays 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.889
 on land with the egg between the legs and 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.970
 consume food the other species of 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.030
 penguins that are from temperate climates 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.830
 tropical they do not do is they sustained 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.440
 in the local lands on the ground 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.930
 gather branches 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.940
 excrement and other types of materials 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.580
 vegetables to form the nest of the male 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.320
 and who makes it and the female who carries it 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.010
 almost all incubation height though 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.010
 can go inside 

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:11.679
