00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.030
 two 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.030
 two 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.550
 the project has that in your hands is 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.829
 an innovative initiative that mike that 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.010
 wanted to bring to the education department 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.290
 to support him in such a fundamental area 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.610
 as what is the increase in the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.579
 academic achievement of 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.690
 students in the basic subjects 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.850
 initially we contacted the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.980
 education department to expose you 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.440
 the initiative that we had understanding 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.170
 which was of great use for the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.269
 schools and the department took the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.790
 decision to choose the school to love and 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.289
 toilet was oriented high because it had all 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.230
 the characteristics that we were 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.879
 looking as part of the project 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.730
 initially a school that had a 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.729
 director with a vision of accepting 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.679
 technology and embrace it also to have 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.810
 a committed faculty like in this 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:13.090
 case are the teachers and also because 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.070
 supposedly a community of parents that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.780
 support a project like this in the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.810
 development of yourself 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.540
 the school was currently in a 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.340
 process of passing the tests 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 Puerto Ricans to get out of the plan 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.140
 improvement that we achieved the year 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.750
 last and we had to use new 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.700
 tools for improvement in the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.470
 area specifically of mathematics and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.630
 this was an accounting resource that did not 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.600
 we could let go I saw it as a 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.399
 more work tool to be able 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.880
 develop math skills 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:50.830
 which are sometimes difficult to get to 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:53.610
 student then I thought that of 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.380
 that way playing and at the same time 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.770
 learning then that it was the best way 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.050
 that those zuma skills from this 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.659
 of memory of that mental agility 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.229
 develop it in them I think that the 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.399
 technology is an instrument of 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.239
 learning for our history not 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.209
 since our children are born they are coming 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.790
 with the technology within them from 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.110
 take the initiative when they came to 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.020
 the school looking 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.440
 who had the willingness to work 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.800
 the project well then I said if it's something 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.960
 new 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.060
 and serve for my students because I 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.980
 I'm willing to work it 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.920
 The main objective is the project 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.410
 you have in your hands can offer a 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.190
 innovative tool that could be 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.810
 integrate into the classroom with a view to 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.510
 strengthen the skills needed in 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.160
 the students in the basic subjects 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.260
 especially to increase its 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.310
 academic achievement in the tests 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.130
 puertorriqueÃ±as of aprovechamiento 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.340
 academic specifically in the area of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.440
 mathematics what I like about cinema 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.260
 is 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.340
 I can share with a subject and I learn 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.989
 more I have learned more 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.720
 to do the exercises faster I hope 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.650
 of water give them subtraction as those of sum 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.750
 divide fractions when we saw the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.020
 orientation about the program you have your 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.030
 hands 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.090
 my expectations were very good 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.830
 because I saw that the technological instrument 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.220
 was going to be another instrument in this 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.880
 teaching-learning process in the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.700
 area of mathematics 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.050
 and I've seen eggs and a favorable support 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.580
 I describe this type of technology 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.200
 Fabulous , really, it's one thing and I 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.830
 I say that impressive for 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.950
 students because they have improved 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:57.490
 your notes and sharing with others 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:01.540
 fellow also I thought that 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.940
 and it's going to improve more because before I had in 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.660
 the math class and now I have to 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.720
 The most I liked was playing while 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.240
 I learn the most impressive thing if we have 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.670
 could observe the results of 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.860
 I divide this project into two areas 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.400
 main the first the results 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.470
 academics in the first month of the project 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.900
 of formula post tests to measure the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.490
 results and we noticed an increase in the 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.470
 academic achievement close to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.570
 90% of students in mathematics 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.990
 the other part more important than what 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.250
 it was this project has been in the areas 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.350
 that we have been able to help the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.870
 students to develop that they are going to 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.600
 serve in your life as human beings what 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.000
 that is to teach wait your turn to 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.730
 work collaboratively to be 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.980
 motivated to want to come to school to 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.810
 not wanting to continue from school those are 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.640
 fundamental elements that are not 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.190
 they are necessarily tied to the part 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.720
 academic but they are of great impact and 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.300
 our mission to develop it 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.240
 in the students definitely 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.220
 we have to use technology in 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.050
 stay we can not stay in the 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.690
 paper and on the blackboard and in the chalk and in 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.290
 the side we want to use technology 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.360
 I think it has been a great contribution to 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.130
 these children especially of great impact 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.230
 I know we have changed to its usefulness is 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.810
 that the mood is transformed and I know that 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.770
 they will be an example to continue impacting 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.770
 Y
