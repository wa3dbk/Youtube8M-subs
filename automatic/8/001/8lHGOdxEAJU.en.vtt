keyboards in Brighton and we're going to
look<00:00:16.930> at<00:00:17.140> how<00:00:17.680> we<00:00:17.740> can<00:00:17.980> actually<00:00:18.130> record<00:00:18.640> our

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
look at how we can actually record our

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.620 
look at how we can actually record our
guitar<00:00:19.270> into<00:00:20.260> the<00:00:20.410> iPad<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:21.790> iPad<00:00:22.150> is<00:00:22.360> now<00:00:22.599> a

recording<00:00:36.940> into<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.210> iPad<00:00:37.480> is<00:00:37.660> that<00:00:37.690> really

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
recording into the iPad is that really

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.690 
recording into the iPad is that really
there's<00:00:38.470> not<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.710> connection<00:00:39.340> that's<00:00:39.489> going<00:00:39.550> to

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
there's not a connection that's going to

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.550 
there's not a connection that's going to
allow<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:39.970> to<00:00:40.210> plug<00:00:40.420> your<00:00:40.570> guitar<00:00:40.630> directly

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
into it and so it focused right we've

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.990 
into it and so it focused right we've
developed<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.680> number<00:00:45.220> of<00:00:45.370> products<00:00:45.790> which

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
developed a number of products which

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.720 
developed a number of products which
will<00:00:46.180> help<00:00:46.390> you<00:00:46.920> basically<00:00:47.920> record<00:00:48.430> your

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
first thing that we're going to look at

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
first thing that we're going to look at
is<00:00:53.080> the<00:00:53.320> brand-new

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
is the brand-new

into<00:01:07.570> the<00:01:07.689> dock<00:01:07.930> in<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.650> really<00:01:09.159> nice

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
into the dock in a really nice

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.569 
into the dock in a really nice
great-looking<00:01:10.659> elegant<00:01:11.170> solution<00:01:11.770> so<00:01:12.219> here

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
great-looking elegant solution so here

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.179 
great-looking elegant solution so here
we<00:01:12.729> have<00:01:12.999> the<00:01:13.450> iPad<00:01:13.840> Mini<00:01:14.350> connected<00:01:14.859> into<00:01:15.130> the

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
we have the iPad Mini connected into the

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:17.219 
we have the iPad Mini connected into the
itraq<00:01:15.340> dock<00:01:15.819> but<00:01:16.270> if<00:01:16.359> I<00:01:16.450> slide<00:01:16.780> this<00:01:17.020> out

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
itraq dock but if I slide this out

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.679 
itraq dock but if I slide this out
you'll<00:01:18.100> see<00:01:18.399> that<00:01:18.609> I<00:01:18.670> have<00:01:18.729> a<00:01:19.210> lightning

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
you'll see that I have a lightning

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:21.480 
you'll see that I have a lightning
connection<00:01:20.259> here<00:01:20.439> that<00:01:20.469> will<00:01:20.770> actually<00:01:20.920> move

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
connection here that will actually move

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.969 
connection here that will actually move
to<00:01:22.329> the<00:01:22.450> appropriate<00:01:23.020> position<00:01:23.200> for

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
to the appropriate position for

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.120 
to the appropriate position for
connecting<00:01:24.369> for<00:01:24.549> example<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.060> iPad<00:01:25.389> air<00:01:25.829> if<00:01:26.829> I

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
connecting for example and iPad air if I

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.520 
connecting for example and iPad air if I
have<00:01:27.460> an<00:01:27.609> iPad<00:01:27.909> retina<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.719> can<00:01:29.049> actually<00:01:29.170> take

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
have an iPad retina I can actually take

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.120 
have an iPad retina I can actually take
out<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.859> little<00:01:30.100> stand<00:01:30.399> off<00:01:30.639> and<00:01:31.439> move<00:01:32.439> up<00:01:32.799> to

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
out the little stand off and move up to

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.730 
out the little stand off and move up to
the<00:01:33.340> actual<00:01:33.609> iPad<00:01:34.090> connection<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.560> this

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
the actual iPad connection this so this

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.529 
the actual iPad connection this so this
means<00:01:36.009> that<00:01:36.069> if<00:01:36.219> I<00:01:36.520> cannot<00:01:36.789> plug<00:01:37.090> in<00:01:37.270> any

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
means that if I cannot plug in any

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.599 
means that if I cannot plug in any
lightning<00:01:38.020> connection<00:01:38.560> iPad<00:01:38.920> directly<00:01:39.490> to

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
lightning connection iPad directly to

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.209 
lightning connection iPad directly to
our<00:01:39.639> track<00:01:39.999> dock<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.899> yes<00:01:41.619> so<00:01:41.799> here<00:01:41.979> we<00:01:42.009> have<00:01:42.189> a

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
our track dock and yes so here we have a

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.029 
our track dock and yes so here we have a
dedicated<00:01:42.549> input<00:01:43.539> for<00:01:43.869> your<00:01:43.899> electric<00:01:44.740> guitar

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
dedicated input for your electric guitar

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.889 
dedicated input for your electric guitar
or<00:01:45.219> electric<00:01:45.310> bass<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.539> a<00:01:46.659> high

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
or electric bass this is a high

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.499 
or electric bass this is a high
impedance<00:01:47.200> inputs<00:01:47.909> here<00:01:48.909> we<00:01:48.999> have<00:01:49.149> two

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
impedance inputs here we have two

impedance inputs here we have two
microphone<00:01:50.409> preamps<00:01:51.130> as<00:01:51.279> well<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.359> we're

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
microphone preamps as well so if we're

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.940 
microphone preamps as well so if we're
going<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.689> record<00:01:53.049> directly<00:01:53.469> from<00:01:53.799> a

going to record directly from a

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.410 
going to record directly from a
microphone<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:54.639> is<00:01:54.789> perfect

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
microphone this is perfect

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.499 
microphone this is perfect

coming into I track we've got a clever
little<00:02:40.080> system<00:02:40.500> here<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.710> basically<00:02:41.340> when<00:02:41.520> I

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
little system here that basically when I

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.530 
little system here that basically when I
strike<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.420> chord<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:42.990> the<00:02:43.020> guitar<00:02:44.420> you'll<00:02:45.420> get

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
strike a chord on the guitar you'll get

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.930 
strike a chord on the guitar you'll get
a<00:02:45.570> nice<00:02:45.900> light<00:02:46.500> lighting<00:02:47.130> up<00:02:47.430> around<00:02:47.730> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
actual gain control to show me the level

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.080 
actual gain control to show me the level
I<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.370> if<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:51.209> level<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> bit<00:02:51.750> too<00:02:51.959> much

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
I have if the level is a bit too much

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.550 
I have if the level is a bit too much
the<00:02:54.090> level<00:02:54.330> will<00:02:54.450> go<00:02:54.570> red<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:55.140> show<00:02:55.290> me<00:02:55.410> it's

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the level will go red to show me it's

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.010 
the level will go red to show me it's
going<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.739> distort<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.550> can<00:02:57.390> back<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:57.630> off

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
going to distort I can back that off

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.350 
going to distort I can back that off
until<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> green<00:02:59.040> level<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.640> that's<00:03:00.209> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
until I get a green level and that's the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.199 
until I get a green level and that's the
perfect<00:03:00.570> sort<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.080> level<00:03:01.380> for<00:03:01.530> recording<00:03:02.209> we

in<00:03:28.170> true<00:03:29.010> real<00:03:29.340> time<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.540> we've<00:03:30.660> looked<00:03:30.810> at

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
in true real time so we've looked at

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.210 
in true real time so we've looked at
some<00:03:31.110> of<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.290> key<00:03:31.410> features<00:03:31.650> on<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> itraq

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
some of the key features on the itraq

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.039 
some of the key features on the itraq
dock<00:03:32.670> but<00:03:32.820> let's<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.209> how<00:03:33.420> easy<00:03:33.630> is<00:03:33.959> to

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
dock but let's see how easy is to

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.560 
dock but let's see how easy is to
actually<00:03:34.410> record<00:03:34.769> directly<00:03:35.459> into<00:03:35.880> into<00:03:36.510> your
