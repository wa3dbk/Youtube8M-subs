00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay hi guys today I wanted to talk to

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.270 
okay hi guys today I wanted to talk to
you<00:00:03.830> about<00:00:07.550> a<00:00:08.550> different<00:00:08.639> picking<00:00:09.599> technique

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
you about a different picking technique

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.440 
you about a different picking technique
that<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.429> may<00:00:11.580> well<00:00:11.820> find<00:00:11.849> very<00:00:12.360> useful

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.080 

especially<00:00:15.450> when<00:00:15.809> playing<00:00:16.170> solos<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.940> can

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
especially when playing solos but it can

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.910 
especially when playing solos but it can
also<00:00:18.240> be<00:00:18.359> useful<00:00:18.750> when<00:00:18.900> playing<00:00:18.930> some<00:00:19.710> bass

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
also be useful when playing some bass

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.700 
also be useful when playing some bass
lines<00:00:22.160> now<00:00:23.160> we<00:00:24.000> usually<00:00:25.160> play<00:00:27.349> the<00:00:28.349> walking

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
lines now we usually play the walking

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.750 
lines now we usually play the walking
finger<00:00:30.830> index<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.340> middle<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
finger index and middle but the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.340 
finger index and middle but the
technique<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.360> once<00:00:36.690> talked<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:42.350> it's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
technique I once talked about is it's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.029 
technique I once talked about is it's
more<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.910> using<00:00:44.910> your<00:00:45.270> thumb<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:47.010> can

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
more like using your thumb you can

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.350 
more like using your thumb you can
either<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.670> thumb<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.180> first

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
either use your thumb and your first

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.450 
either use your thumb and your first
finger<00:00:48.539> or<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> use<00:00:49.829> your<00:00:49.950> thumb<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.370> your

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
finger or we can use your thumb and your

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.069 
finger or we can use your thumb and your
middle<00:00:50.489> finger<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.390> thumb<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:51.960> middle

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
middle finger I use my thumb and middle

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.490 
middle finger I use my thumb and middle
finger<00:00:52.640> instead<00:00:53.960> and<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.050> hold<00:00:55.320> them<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:56.340> this

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
finger instead and I hold them like this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.490 
finger instead and I hold them like this
to<00:00:58.500> represent<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> thumb<00:01:00.899> gives<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> Down

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to represent the thumb gives a Down

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.030 
to represent the thumb gives a Down
stroke<00:01:03.140> whereas<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> other<00:01:04.379> finger<00:01:04.799> gives

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
stroke whereas the other finger gives

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.990 
stroke whereas the other finger gives
the<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.400> stroke<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.580> literally<00:01:08.970> just

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the up stroke and it's literally just

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.980 
the up stroke and it's literally just
the<00:01:10.549> efficiency<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.580> movement<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.299> from

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the efficiency of movement is just from

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:28.550 
the efficiency of movement is just from
the<00:01:13.110> wrist<00:01:25.790> but<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.060> also<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.840> find

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the wrist but you can also get I find

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.440 
the wrist but you can also get I find
you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.890> also<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.340> some<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.759> texture<00:01:30.180> as

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
you can also get some more texture as

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.260 
you can also get some more texture as
well<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.960> just<00:01:34.290> playing<00:01:35.270> don't

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
well so like you know just playing don't

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.810 
well so like you know just playing don't
leave<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:40.490> when<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.549> play<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> fingers<00:01:43.820> you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
leave it when you play that fingers you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.980 
leave it when you play that fingers you
play<00:01:45.030> finger<00:01:45.270> style<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.299> it's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
play finger style it's it you know it's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:04.640 
play finger style it's it you know it's
difficult<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.500> get<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.680> variation<00:01:50.220> in

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.160 

so<00:02:05.650> you<00:02:05.710> can<00:02:05.979> get<00:02:06.159> up<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:07.840> what<00:02:07.990> I<00:02:08.020> was

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so you can get up you see what I was

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:43.290 
so you can get up you see what I was
doing<00:02:08.410> there<00:02:40.350> now<00:02:41.610> when<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.790> finger<00:02:43.180> as<00:02:43.269> well

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
doing there now when this finger as well

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:51.080 
doing there now when this finger as well
just<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> get<00:02:44.050> more<00:02:45.660> what<00:02:46.660> a<00:02:46.690> cranky<00:02:47.230> tone<00:02:48.989> so

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
just to get more what a cranky tone so

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.550 
just to get more what a cranky tone so
yeah<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.120> recommend<00:02:52.660> using<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.140> technique

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
yeah I recommend using that technique

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.100 
yeah I recommend using that technique
actually<00:02:54.120> some<00:02:55.120> people<00:02:55.239> like<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.660> said<00:02:55.690> would

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
actually some people like I said would

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:24.330 
actually some people like I said would
prefer<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.560> use<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:23.440> also<00:03:23.590> leaves

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
prefer to use it also leaves

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.449 
prefer to use it also leaves
what<00:03:24.519> would<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.850> advantage<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.420> this<00:03:25.630> over

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
what would the advantage of this over

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:35.220 
what would the advantage of this over
using<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.610> fingerstyle<00:03:28.180> technique<00:03:34.230> it

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
using the fingerstyle technique it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.580 
using the fingerstyle technique it
leaves<00:03:35.440> your<00:03:35.620> hand<00:03:35.890> position<00:03:36.070> open<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:36.820> do

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
leaves your hand position open to do

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.830 
leaves your hand position open to do
more<00:03:38.590> interesting<00:03:38.890> stuff<00:03:39.340> for<00:03:39.489> Ford's<00:03:39.910> more

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
more interesting stuff for Ford's more

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.420 
more interesting stuff for Ford's more
textured<00:03:41.970> stem<00:03:42.970> chords<00:03:43.709> because<00:03:44.709> moving<00:03:45.190> from

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.940 

moving<00:03:49.430> from<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:50.810> technique<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.349> another<00:03:51.680> can

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
moving from one technique to another can

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.610 
moving from one technique to another can
be<00:03:52.129> little<00:03:52.430> bit<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.989> can<00:03:54.019> be<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.290> little<00:03:54.379> bit

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
be little bit it can be a little bit

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.790 
be little bit it can be a little bit
cumbersome<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:56.750> that's<00:03:57.050> another<00:03:57.379> advantage

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
cumbersome so that's another advantage

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.449 
cumbersome so that's another advantage
of<00:03:58.160> it

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
of it

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.550 
of it
and<00:04:01.840> although<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.019> takes<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.290> bit<00:04:03.440> of<00:04:03.470> getting

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
and although it takes a bit of getting

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.140 
and although it takes a bit of getting
used<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:04.069> one<00:04:04.970> thing<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.720> practice<00:04:06.879> using<00:04:07.879> this

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
used to one thing to practice using this

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.220 
used to one thing to practice using this
technique<00:04:09.040> oh<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:11.330> other<00:04:11.450> advantage<00:04:11.989> by<00:04:12.170> the

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
technique oh the other advantage by the

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.830 
technique oh the other advantage by the
way<00:04:12.470> is<00:04:12.530> that<00:04:12.920> for<00:04:13.549> muting<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.510> low<00:04:14.690> B<00:04:14.930> string

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
way is that for muting the low B string

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.830 
way is that for muting the low B string
you're<00:04:18.070> using<00:04:19.070> your<00:04:19.370> palm<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:20.090> if<00:04:20.209> our<00:04:20.450> Meucci

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
you're using your palm so if our Meucci

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.420 
you're using your palm so if our Meucci
low<00:04:20.989> B<00:04:21.200> string<00:04:23.350> which<00:04:24.350> is<00:04:24.680> more<00:04:25.160> effective

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
low B string which is more effective

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.490 
low B string which is more effective
than<00:04:25.880> just<00:04:26.240> resting<00:04:26.660> your<00:04:26.690> thumb<00:04:26.990> it<00:04:27.139> actually

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
than just resting your thumb it actually

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:37.990 
than just resting your thumb it actually
meets<00:04:27.740> more<00:04:27.979> of<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.190> strings<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.669> you<00:04:37.729> can't

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
meets more of the strings so you can't

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.159 
meets more of the strings so you can't
hear<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.270> ringing<00:04:39.340> ringing<00:04:40.340> out<00:04:40.550> at<00:04:40.669> all<00:04:47.169> you

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
hear the ringing ringing out at all you

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.240 
hear the ringing ringing out at all you
could<00:04:48.260> hear<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.500> string<00:04:48.770> ringing<00:04:49.039> through

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
could hear a string ringing through

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.600 
could hear a string ringing through
there<00:04:49.460> right<00:04:49.490> but<00:04:50.590> as<00:04:51.590> yet<00:04:51.919> I<00:04:51.950> can't<00:04:52.340> get<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
there right but as yet I can't get the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.600 
there right but as yet I can't get the
speed<00:04:52.940> that<00:04:53.150> I<00:04:53.240> can<00:04:53.800> like<00:04:54.800> I<00:04:54.830> could<00:04:55.280> get<00:04:55.400> with

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
speed that I can like I could get with

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.900 
speed that I can like I could get with
with<00:04:55.970> the<00:04:56.380> regular<00:04:57.380> finger<00:04:57.650> style<00:04:57.889> yet<00:04:58.280> but<00:04:58.639> I

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
with the regular finger style yet but I

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.110 
with the regular finger style yet but I
think<00:04:59.479> with<00:04:59.660> practice<00:04:59.810> it<00:05:00.260> will<00:05:00.380> come<00:05:01.030> so<00:05:02.030> what

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
think with practice it will come so what

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.580 
think with practice it will come so what
I<00:05:02.180> probably<00:05:02.419> recommend<00:05:02.930> for<00:05:03.050> practicing

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
I probably recommend for practicing

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:13.890 
I probably recommend for practicing
anyway<00:05:03.950> just<00:05:04.160> to<00:05:04.280> get<00:05:04.430> used<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:05.389> that

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.400 

chromatic<00:05:18.970> so<00:05:19.970> you<00:05:20.030> get<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.570> get<00:05:20.720> a<00:05:20.780> variation

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
chromatic so you get you get a variation

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.490 
chromatic so you get you get a variation
of<00:05:21.500> up<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:21.889> down<00:05:22.160> strokes<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.080> first<00:05:24.289> one

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
of up and down strokes so the first one

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.080 
of up and down strokes so the first one
I'm<00:05:24.620> using<00:05:24.830> is<00:05:25.010> just<00:05:25.250> between<00:05:25.400> the<00:05:25.669> 12th<00:05:25.970> and

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
I'm using is just between the 12th and

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.110 
I'm using is just between the 12th and
15th<00:05:26.990> fret<00:05:27.560> going<00:05:27.950> to<00:05:28.070> our<00:05:28.190> little<00:05:28.490> Reed<00:05:28.789> and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
15th fret going to our little Reed and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.150 
15th fret going to our little Reed and
then

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
then

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:42.270 
then
I'm<00:05:30.370> going<00:05:33.060> 13<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:40.030> then<00:05:40.180> reverse<00:05:40.540> that<00:05:41.160> go<00:05:42.160> up

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
I'm going 13 and then reverse that go up

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.240 
I'm going 13 and then reverse that go up
from<00:05:42.490> ethically<00:05:42.880> and<00:05:42.940> come<00:05:43.090> back<00:05:43.180> down<00:05:43.650> so<00:05:44.650> so

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
from ethically and come back down so so

00:05:45.250 --> 00:06:04.500 
from ethically and come back down so so
to<00:05:45.310> reverse<00:05:45.760> that<00:05:46.060> you<00:05:46.270> go<00:06:03.330> takes<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.390> bit<00:06:04.480> of

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
to reverse that you go takes a bit of

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.680 
to reverse that you go takes a bit of
getting<00:06:04.630> used<00:06:04.840> to<00:06:06.000> but<00:06:07.000> once<00:06:07.180> you<00:06:07.270> get<00:06:07.360> used<00:06:07.510> to

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690 
getting used to but once you get used to

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:09.990 
getting used to but once you get used to
it<00:06:07.780> you<00:06:07.840> can<00:06:07.990> build<00:06:08.470> up<00:06:08.650> speed<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.220> it's<00:06:09.760> good

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
it you can build up speed and it's good

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.690 
it you can build up speed and it's good
just<00:06:10.510> for<00:06:10.660> your<00:06:10.780> coordination<00:06:11.410> it's<00:06:12.250> boring

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
just for your coordination it's boring

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.490 
just for your coordination it's boring
as<00:06:12.820> hell<00:06:13.030> so<00:06:13.390> it's<00:06:13.690> one<00:06:13.870> of<00:06:13.990> those<00:06:14.080> things<00:06:14.380> I

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
as hell so it's one of those things I

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.920 
as hell so it's one of those things I
recommend<00:06:15.480> doing<00:06:16.480> in<00:06:16.660> front<00:06:16.810> of<00:06:16.870> the

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:16.930 
recommend doing in front of the

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.740 
recommend doing in front of the
television<00:06:17.940> but<00:06:18.940> there<00:06:19.510> you<00:06:19.570> go<00:06:19.600> that's

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:19.750 
television but there you go that's

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.230 
television but there you go that's
basically<00:06:20.290> it<00:06:20.530> that's<00:06:21.310> my<00:06:21.520> recommendation

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
basically it that's my recommendation

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.160 
basically it that's my recommendation
for<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.540> day<00:06:24.090> practice<00:06:25.090> another<00:06:25.480> technique

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.170 
for the day practice another technique

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.140 
for the day practice another technique
because<00:06:26.800> it<00:06:26.830> gives<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.250> more<00:06:27.430> texture<00:06:27.970> and

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
because it gives you more texture and

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.410 
because it gives you more texture and
making<00:06:29.020> it<00:06:29.140> gives<00:06:29.320> you<00:06:29.440> more<00:06:29.970> options<00:06:30.970> as<00:06:31.510> well

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
making it gives you more options as well

00:06:33.420 --> 00:07:49.030 
making it gives you more options as well
so

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.910 

to<00:07:50.040> get<00:07:50.220> the<00:07:50.400> coordination<00:07:51.210> going<00:07:53.570> but<00:07:54.570> anyway

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:54.920 
to get the coordination going but anyway

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.980 
to get the coordination going but anyway
that's<00:07:55.920> my<00:07:56.100> recommendation<00:07:56.370> so<00:07:57.270> hope<00:07:57.840> you

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:57.990 
that's my recommendation so hope you

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.550 
that's my recommendation so hope you
have<00:07:58.110> fun<00:07:58.350> practicing<00:07:58.620> that<00:08:00.050> and<00:08:01.050> like<00:08:01.230> I<00:08:01.380> said

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 
have fun practicing that and like I said

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.570 
have fun practicing that and like I said
I<00:08:01.590> think<00:08:01.710> the<00:08:01.920> main<00:08:02.070> point<00:08:02.310> to<00:08:02.490> remember<00:08:02.820> is

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:04.580 
I think the main point to remember is

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.220 
I think the main point to remember is
fighter<00:08:05.580> preference<00:08:06.180> as<00:08:06.390> well<00:08:06.570> between<00:08:06.810> thumb

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:07.230 
fighter preference as well between thumb

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.260 
fighter preference as well between thumb
and<00:08:07.310> forefinger<00:08:08.310> or<00:08:08.340> thumb<00:08:08.640> and<00:08:08.820> middle

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.270 
and forefinger or thumb and middle

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.620 
and forefinger or thumb and middle
finger<00:08:09.420> some<00:08:10.320> people
