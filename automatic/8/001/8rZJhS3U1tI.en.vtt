setup I am going to put it in my 1979
320i<00:00:18.470> it's<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> be<00:00:19.800> digital<00:00:20.490> fuel

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000

injection<00:00:21.650> obviously<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
injection obviously you can see that the

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.730 
injection obviously you can see that the
intake<00:00:24.029> is<00:00:24.269> not<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.750> original<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> off<00:00:25.710> of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740

a four 318i they did sport the m10 but

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.870 
a four 318i they did sport the m10 but
they<00:00:32.910> were<00:00:33.079> 1.8<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:35.340> engine<00:00:35.670> originally

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
they were 1.8 the engine originally

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.389 
they were 1.8 the engine originally
produced<00:00:36.540> about<00:00:36.870> 110<00:00:37.910> 115<00:00:38.910> horsepower<00:00:40.399> almost

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399

the same in torque

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.260 
the same in torque
I<00:00:42.710> plan<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.739> definitely<00:00:44.340> doubling<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> for

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
I plan on definitely doubling that for

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.959 
I plan on definitely doubling that for
sure<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:46.170> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.500> running<00:00:46.800> 6<00:00:47.489> pounds<00:00:47.910> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
sure I'm going to be running 6 pounds of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.799 
sure I'm going to be running 6 pounds of
boost<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.719> break<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:50.300> after<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.329> after

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
boost to break it in after that after

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.069 
boost to break it in after that after
it's<00:00:52.110> broken<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:54.079> definitely

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it's broken in and I have definitely

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.250 
it's broken in and I have definitely
strong<00:00:56.090> hopes<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.780> broken<00:00:58.170> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
strong hopes that it will be broken in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.569 
strong hopes that it will be broken in
pretty<00:00:58.500> quick<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.129> definitely<00:00:59.340> want

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
pretty quick because I definitely want

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
pretty quick because I definitely want
to<00:00:59.730> get<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.149> throttle<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:01.500> what<00:01:01.680> she

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
to get on the throttle and see what she

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.179 
to get on the throttle and see what she
can<00:01:02.010> do<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:03.239> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.600> running<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.650> max<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
can do I'm going to be running a max of

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.500 
can do I'm going to be running a max of
21<00:01:05.909> psi<00:01:07.159> which<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.369> probably<00:01:08.909> kind<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.299> produce

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
21 psi which is probably kind of produce

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.060 
21 psi which is probably kind of produce
probably<00:01:10.380> close<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.150> 280<00:01:12.650> 285<00:01:13.650> horse

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070
