00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
wear eye makeup but today I did I have

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.490

frames<00:01:46.500> because<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.950> felt<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.579> put<00:01:47.939> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
frames because I felt if I put in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.990 
frames because I felt if I put in
context<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.869> would<00:01:49.700> draw<00:01:50.700> even<00:01:50.880> more

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
context it would draw even more

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
context it would draw even more
attention<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> black

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
attention to it but with the black

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.010 
attention to it but with the black
frames<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.490> feel<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.630> towards<00:01:54.930> my
