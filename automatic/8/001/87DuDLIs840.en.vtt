like<00:02:26.910> 5050<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.530> can<00:02:28.650> control<00:02:29.010> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
like 5050 that you can control the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.700 
like 5050 that you can control the
volume<00:02:29.280> up<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.760> down<00:02:29.820> can<00:02:30.120> only<00:02:30.270> pause<00:02:30.810> your
