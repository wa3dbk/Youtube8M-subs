would<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:40.019> know<00:03:40.110> if<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.380> could<00:03:40.560> separate<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
would you know if you could separate the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.460 
would you know if you could separate the
runners<00:03:41.850> from<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.330> tank<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:43.140> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
runners from the tank that it's in and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.470 
runners from the tank that it's in and
cut<00:03:43.620> them<00:03:43.709> back<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.130> replant<00:03:44.519> them<00:03:44.610> same

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
cut them back and replant them same

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630 
cut them back and replant them same
water<00:03:45.750> conditions<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.310> is<00:03:47.340> going

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
water conditions you know this is going

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.699 
water conditions you know this is going
to<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.940> different<00:03:48.180> water<00:03:48.540> parameters<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.170> what

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
to be different water parameters so what

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.470 
to be different water parameters so what
I've<00:03:49.799> noticed<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.579> you<00:03:50.790> keep<00:03:50.970> them<00:03:51.150> all<00:03:51.299> in

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
I've noticed is if you keep them all in

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.120 
I've noticed is if you keep them all in
the<00:03:51.570> clump<00:03:51.870> keep<00:03:52.200> all<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> runners<00:03:52.680> together

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
the clump keep all the runners together

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.050 
the clump keep all the runners together
and<00:03:53.459> just<00:03:53.850> put<00:03:54.299> them<00:03:54.420> in<00:03:54.540> clumps<00:03:55.519> you<00:03:56.519> get<00:03:56.700> way

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
and just put them in clumps you get way

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.420 
and just put them in clumps you get way
way<00:03:57.420> less<00:03:57.720> time<00:03:57.989> obviously<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.190> right

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
way less time obviously you know right

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.030 
way less time obviously you know right
there<00:03:59.640> I'm<00:03:59.820> you<00:04:00.360> know<00:04:00.480> I'm<00:04:01.410> trimming<00:04:01.709> up<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.650 
melting or die back when it comes to
dwarfs<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.889> chore<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.940> know<00:04:33.030> Italian<00:04:33.510> Val

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
dwarfs a chore you know Italian Val

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.890 
dwarfs a chore you know Italian Val
things<00:04:33.960> like<00:04:34.139> that<00:04:34.550> here<00:04:35.550> I'm<00:04:35.940> starting<00:04:36.720> them

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
things like that here I'm starting them

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.659 
things like that here I'm starting them
you<00:04:37.139> know<00:04:37.229> I<00:04:37.260> got<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.710> got<00:04:37.740> some<00:04:38.040> stem<00:04:38.280> plants

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
you know I got I got some stem plants

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.189 
you know I got I got some stem plants
and<00:04:38.820> obviously<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.270> gotta<00:04:39.449> fill<00:04:39.660> the<00:04:39.810> tank<00:04:40.050> up

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
and obviously you gotta fill the tank up

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.520 
and obviously you gotta fill the tank up
to<00:04:40.260> get<00:04:40.500> stem<00:04:40.740> plants<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:42.199> doing<00:04:43.199> it<00:04:43.290> fairly

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
to get stem plants and doing it fairly

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.219 
to get stem plants and doing it fairly
quickly<00:04:43.680> so<00:04:44.160> it's<00:04:44.610> not<00:04:44.790> taking<00:04:45.090> up<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.810> bunch<00:04:46.139> of

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
quickly so it's not taking up a bunch of

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.360 
quickly so it's not taking up a bunch of
your<00:04:46.350> guys<00:04:46.470> time<00:04:48.500> check<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.650> water<00:04:49.830> as<00:04:50.100> you<00:04:50.220> go

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
your guys time check the water as you go

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.500 
your guys time check the water as you go
see<00:04:50.639> that's<00:04:50.729> what<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:50.970> just<00:04:51.000> did<00:04:51.270> right<00:04:51.330> there

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
see that's what I just did right there

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.210 
see that's what I just did right there
check<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.080> make<00:04:52.199> sure<00:04:52.260> that<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.710> water<00:04:52.860> hasn't

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
check to make sure that the water hasn't

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.480 
check to make sure that the water hasn't
changed<00:04:53.760> you<00:04:54.030> know<00:04:54.150> dramatically<00:04:54.900> from<00:04:55.100> 75<00:04:56.100> 80

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
changed you know dramatically from 75 80

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.860 
changed you know dramatically from 75 80
to<00:04:56.850> 90<00:04:57.540> degrees<00:04:57.630> all<00:04:58.139> of<00:04:58.229> a<00:04:58.290> sudden<00:04:58.699> I<00:04:59.810> try<00:05:00.810> to

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
to 90 degrees all of a sudden I try to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.040 
to 90 degrees all of a sudden I try to
kick<00:05:01.560> up<00:05:01.740> debris<00:05:02.070> so<00:05:02.880> flows<00:05:03.479> to<00:05:03.720> the<00:05:03.750> surface

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
kick up debris so flows to the surface

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.409 
kick up debris so flows to the surface
so<00:05:04.440> when<00:05:04.620> I<00:05:04.650> go<00:05:04.919> in<00:05:05.100> and<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.550> met<00:05:05.970> everything

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
so when I go in and I met everything

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.620 
so when I go in and I met everything
else<00:05:06.600> out<00:05:07.520> it's<00:05:08.520> not<00:05:08.639> a<00:05:08.669> mess<00:05:08.970> there<00:05:09.330> I'm

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
else out it's not a mess there I'm

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.210 
else out it's not a mess there I'm
fluffing<00:05:10.260> everything<00:05:10.620> up<00:05:10.770> because<00:05:10.919> it<00:05:11.130> was

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
fluffing everything up because it was

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.670 
fluffing everything up because it was
all<00:05:11.370> matted<00:05:11.580> down<00:05:11.760> especially<00:05:12.660> stem<00:05:13.260> plants

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
all matted down especially stem plants

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.740 
all matted down especially stem plants
you<00:05:13.740> don't<00:05:13.919> want<00:05:14.039> stand<00:05:14.280> plants<00:05:14.729> all<00:05:14.910> tangled

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
you don't want stand plants all tangled

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.300 
you don't want stand plants all tangled
up<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.020> messy<00:05:16.410> look<00:05:16.590> and<00:05:16.770> so<00:05:16.830> you<00:05:16.919> gotta<00:05:17.070> go<00:05:17.220> in

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
up and messy look and so you gotta go in

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.670 
up and messy look and so you gotta go in
there<00:05:17.340> as<00:05:17.520> you<00:05:17.669> fill<00:05:17.910> the<00:05:18.030> tank<00:05:18.330> and<00:05:18.660> you<00:05:19.560> know

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
there as you fill the tank and you know

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.400 
there as you fill the tank and you know
separate<00:05:20.160> all<00:05:20.340> those<00:05:20.510> those<00:05:21.510> stem<00:05:21.840> plants<00:05:22.260> so

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
separate all those those stem plants so

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.480 
separate all those those stem plants so
it's<00:05:22.560> a<00:05:22.789> it's<00:05:23.789> not<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.030> tangled<00:05:24.479> up<00:05:24.600> mess<00:05:25.490> turn

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
it's a it's not a tangled up mess turn
