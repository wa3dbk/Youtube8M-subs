00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
them all individually it's going to take

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.020 
them all individually it's going to take
you<00:00:58.949> awhile<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.460> we're<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.910> get

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you awhile but we're not going to get

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
you awhile but we're not going to get
much<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.870> also<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.289> sure<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.469> have<00:01:01.710> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
much and also make sure you have that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
much and also make sure you have that
northern<00:01:02.489> cloth<00:01:02.699> scavenging<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.570> as<00:01:03.690> much

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
northern cloth scavenging to get as much

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.750 
northern cloth scavenging to get as much

cloth as possible as without it it

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.100 
cloth as possible as without it it
probably<00:01:05.970> isn't<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.540> worth<00:01:06.689> doing<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
probably isn't really worth doing this

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.350 
probably isn't really worth doing this
gold<00:01:07.500> making<00:01:07.680> method<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.970> really<00:01:09.180> need<00:01:09.330> that
