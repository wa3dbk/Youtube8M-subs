00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.860 
floor film for the past few weeks I
thought<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:05.759> would<00:00:05.850> make<00:00:05.910> sense<00:00:06.210> comparing<00:00:06.750> it

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
thought it would make sense comparing it

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.780 
thought it would make sense comparing it
to<00:00:06.899> another<00:00:07.290> very<00:00:07.589> popular<00:00:07.890> small<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.700> less

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
back the Samsung Galaxy s4 mini hmm I

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340 
back the Samsung Galaxy s4 mini hmm I
remember<00:00:14.910> all<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.299> buzz<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.809> s4<00:00:16.199> mini

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
remember all the buzz about the s4 mini

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.870 
remember all the buzz about the s4 mini
when<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.680> saw<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.890> leaked<00:00:17.160> photos<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.820> I

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
when we saw the leaked photos and I

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.740 
when we saw the leaked photos and I
thought<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.119> would<00:00:18.210> make<00:00:18.240> complete<00:00:18.449> sense

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
thought it would make complete sense

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.720 
thought it would make complete sense
comparing<00:00:19.410> these<00:00:19.590> two<00:00:19.800> devices<00:00:20.220> against<00:00:20.609> each

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
comparing these two devices against each

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
comparing these two devices against each
other<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.330> let's<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.689> how<00:00:21.869> these<00:00:22.080> two<00:00:22.140> compete

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
other so let's see how these two compete

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.560 
other so let's see how these two compete
