00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
pen that's both proximity sensitive so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.859 
pen that's both proximity sensitive so
that<00:00:29.730> means<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> works<00:00:30.240> without<00:00:30.570> me<00:00:30.720> touching

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that means it works without me touching

whereas with touch we've got the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
whereas with touch we've got the
convenience<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.360> using<00:00:45.690> our<00:00:45.809> fingertip<00:00:46.550> now

have it as bigger as small as you want
it<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.300> be<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.680> can<00:03:00.709> just<00:03:00.980> type<00:03:01.160> away<00:03:02.470> if

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
it to be and you can just type away if

you'll<00:04:16.539> see<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.870> difference<00:04:17.229> in<00:04:17.380> these<00:04:17.470> two

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
you'll see the difference in these two

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.800 
you'll see the difference in these two
screens<00:04:18.070> here<00:04:18.400> the<00:04:18.910> touch<00:04:19.150> version<00:04:19.630> currently

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
screens here the touch version currently

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.260 
screens here the touch version currently
doesn't<00:04:20.229> have<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:20.739> anywhere<00:04:21.099> it<00:04:21.669> may<00:04:21.909> do<00:04:21.970> in

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
doesn't have you anywhere it may do in

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.170 
doesn't have you anywhere it may do in
future<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.860> keep<00:04:24.220> an<00:04:24.370> eye<00:04:24.490> out<00:04:24.520> for<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:24.880> one

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
future so keep an eye out for that one

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.080 
future so keep an eye out for that one
the<00:04:25.780> thing<00:04:26.050> is<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.440> currently<00:04:26.860> not<00:04:27.699> having

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
the thing is that currently not having

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.839 
the thing is that currently not having
view<00:04:28.300> anywhere<00:04:28.690> it<00:04:28.900> means<00:04:29.229> that<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:30.190> non

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
view anywhere it means that the non

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.760 
view anywhere it means that the non
touch<00:04:31.120> version<00:04:31.360> is<00:04:31.750> still<00:04:31.870> much<00:04:32.260> better<00:04:32.289> to

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
touch version is still much better to

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.279 
touch version is still much better to
view<00:04:32.979> outside<00:04:33.250> now<00:04:34.240> what<00:04:34.449> view<00:04:34.690> anywhere<00:04:35.080> is

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
view outside now what view anywhere is

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.339 
view outside now what view anywhere is
is<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:36.240> treatment<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.360> goes<00:04:37.659> onto<00:04:37.930> the<00:04:38.080> glass

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
is a treatment that goes onto the glass

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.339 
is a treatment that goes onto the glass
that<00:04:38.970> diffuses<00:04:39.970> light<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.570> gives<00:04:41.199> a<00:04:41.320> much

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
that diffuses light and gives a much

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.320 
that diffuses light and gives a much
better<00:04:41.560> pass<00:04:42.070> through<00:04:42.400> of<00:04:42.520> light<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:42.970> return

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
better pass through of light and return

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.689 
better pass through of light and return
of<00:04:43.479> light<00:04:43.659> so<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:45.130> that<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.310> can<00:04:45.430> get<00:04:45.580> the

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
of light so that so that you can get the

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.339 
of light so that so that you can get the
best<00:04:45.909> out<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.120> that<00:04:46.360> reflectivity<00:04:46.900> on<00:04:47.199> the

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
best out of that reflectivity on the

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:50.070 
best out of that reflectivity on the
highest<00:04:47.889> display<00:04:48.580> you'll<00:04:49.330> also<00:04:49.479> see<00:04:49.900> that

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
highest display you'll also see that

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.010 
highest display you'll also see that
it's<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.320> much<00:04:50.349> clearer<00:04:50.919> glass<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:52.120> for<00:04:52.599> example

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
it's a much clearer glass so for example

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.430 
it's a much clearer glass so for example
if<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.260> turn<00:04:53.500> both<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.099> tablets<00:04:54.490> off<00:04:54.639> now

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
if I turn both of the tablets off now

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.830 
if I turn both of the tablets off now
you<00:04:56.440> can<00:04:56.620> see<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:57.280> this<00:04:57.909> screen<00:04:58.330> here<00:04:58.570> has<00:04:58.810> a

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
you can see that this screen here has a

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.080 
you can see that this screen here has a
sort<00:04:59.320> of<00:04:59.349> a<00:04:59.500> pigness<00:04:59.979> about<00:05:00.310> it<00:05:00.490> whereas<00:05:00.970> the

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
sort of a pigness about it whereas the

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.300 
sort of a pigness about it whereas the
view<00:05:01.300> anywhere<00:05:01.630> treated<00:05:02.080> display<00:05:02.440> here<00:05:02.830> has<00:05:03.280> a

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
view anywhere treated display here has a

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.760 
view anywhere treated display here has a
much<00:05:03.669> deeper<00:05:04.479> black<00:05:04.900> about<00:05:05.229> it<00:05:05.440> and<00:05:05.530> you<00:05:05.590> can

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
much deeper black about it and you can

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.080 
much deeper black about it and you can
see<00:05:05.949> the<00:05:06.099> difference<00:05:06.490> between<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.940> two

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
see the difference between the two

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.339 
see the difference between the two
sheets<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.510> glass<00:05:07.570> there<00:05:08.080> so<00:05:11.400> so<00:05:12.400> currently<00:05:12.849> my

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
sheets of glass there so so currently my

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.719 
sheets of glass there so so currently my
recommendation<00:05:14.349> would<00:05:14.530> be<00:05:14.590> that<00:05:15.039> if<00:05:15.580> you're

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
recommendation would be that if you're

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.420 
recommendation would be that if you're
working<00:05:16.060> outdoors<00:05:16.270> and<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.740> don't<00:05:17.979> really

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
working outdoors and you don't really

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.640 
working outdoors and you don't really
need<00:05:18.759> touch<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.960> would<00:05:20.080> still<00:05:20.289> go<00:05:20.440> for<00:05:20.620> the

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
need touch you would still go for the

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.409 
need touch you would still go for the
non<00:05:20.889> touch<00:05:21.159> version<00:05:21.400> because<00:05:21.909> it<00:05:22.030> is<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.180> much

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
non touch version because it is a much

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.540 
non touch version because it is a much
clearer<00:05:22.780> glass<00:05:23.080> and<00:05:23.440> it<00:05:23.860> does<00:05:24.070> work<00:05:24.340> better

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
clearer glass and it does work better

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.149 
clearer glass and it does work better
outside<00:05:24.870> this<00:05:25.870> display<00:05:26.320> is<00:05:26.469> still<00:05:26.650> a<00:05:26.710> viewable

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159

you<00:05:28.580> really<00:05:28.819> need<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.060> look<00:05:29.180> at<00:05:29.270> the<00:05:29.419> screen

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
you really need to look at the screen

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.990 
you really need to look at the screen
straight<00:05:30.020> on<00:05:30.229> whereas<00:05:30.919> this<00:05:31.100> display<00:05:31.550> here

you<00:05:32.419> can<00:05:32.600> see<00:05:32.780> it<00:05:32.870> any<00:05:33.050> angle<00:05:33.380> even<00:05:33.830> in<00:05:34.160> full

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
you can see it any angle even in full

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.930 
you can see it any angle even in full
sunlight<00:05:35.289> so<00:05:36.289> there<00:05:36.470> you<00:05:36.560> have<00:05:36.590> it<00:05:36.919> the<00:05:37.729> motion
