00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.810
 hello everyone we are always on the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.520
 gamescom with alex goude 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.230
 it's up to him to have some info 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.120
 crisp on gran turismo 6 then 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.310
 what are they 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.080
 yes surprise an hour with yamauchi 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.470
 so the creator of the series 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.270
 kazunori yamauchi exact weight and I 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.650
 think of to have not much but 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.210
 because in fact I was a little disappointed 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.930
 because he told us where 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.760
 tell us about the visual gt which is actually 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.350
 it's not even a mode it's just the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.470
 did they work with a lot 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.620
 of vehicle designers yeah a lot 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.470
 of makes of vehicles for 1 1 m of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.510
 content in gt6 including squarely 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.790
 concept cars exclusively made for the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.860
 play then there we talk of course two 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.510
 cars that does not exist in the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.140
 reality when this map is that they have 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.060
 did not agree you're at 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.190
 caire said yes yes it's time 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.630
 for me it's more physically and who 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 were made for the game this is the case 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.980
 of the alfa romeo 6c so the 4c exists 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.930
 already there there is cissé which is a 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.140
 between 4c and 8c euros but you do not 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.240
 can not have it there will be a damage 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.610
 alpine is calpine comes back from 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.170
 behind I believe so here is there will be 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.730
 an alpine mall aston martin audi 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.280
 these are concept cars that have been 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.110
 made for the game but still 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.340
 come from real statistics not no 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.870
 more of the big anything it's not 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.880
 a car that will drive 7000 km 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.300
 time I hope not push there is also 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.370
 a lot of builders who did 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.020
 finally sorry about designers who did 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.430
 in fact dozens of cars and 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.510
 cement for the player there are concretes 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.980
 who is still the designer of 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.130
 lamborghini yeah so it's not 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.810
 anyone bmw 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.850
 gm design she limp what 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.259
 really works a lot on it 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.869
 nissan eyefinity 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.580
 nike who had shod nike wayne I think 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.349
 that it was for gt4 I tell you it's 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.000
 of head so I'm not sure and his 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.470
 inputs have reworked the trick a little 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.849
 little who we do nike tou actually 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.140
 for gt6 mercedes crisis when we do it 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.390
 there are a lot of brands like that in all 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.950
 there are still 18 companies that have 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.030
 well wanted to work with them and 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.640
 apparently he has others coming 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.290
 subsequently but still in 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.540
 working on it actually 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.130
 and behind that what you need to know 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.290
 is that these cars will be added 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.780
 as and when in the game yeah via 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.370
 some members is free ok this is 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.260
 cool but maybe just a few 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.370
 will be paying he agree a little bit 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.540
 he said a little vague 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.140
 they will be almost all free 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.140
 true hockey 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.170
 it's brutal so there are also some 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.489
 cars in the car game that 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.049
 really exist that they saw in the 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.819
 game that was not in gt5 in anything that 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.900
 some examples in front of the bmw z8 w 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.750
 707 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.540
 he is had 16 t gold for me I pay and 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.209
 m setek was 14 that there was I know 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.209
 not if I'm more for a moment the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.290
 ford focus st who presents who was 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.730
 announced this year 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.170
 new pagani 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.730
 huayra who was not in the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.739
 previous episodes with a lot of 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.290
 new cars or not because 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.150
 that there are also old two 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.549
 new yala endurance races 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.620
 goodwill and air conditioning which is a principle that 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.120
 is it really the brand hatch that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.120
 really exists at circus bandage yeah 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.560
 and the apricot it remains way who she 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.209
 does not exist but that was already 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.010
 present in gt4 this is one of the races 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.090
 they had created first appeared in gt5 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.860
 I do not know why three 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.470
 remakes and who comes back so I was 6 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.930
 with a day / night mode that they had 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.420
 not at the time 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.700
 So there is there and we talked a bit about the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.500
 ring ring and including the possibility 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.760
 to create his races had already so 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.680
 now the real ones to really create 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.780
 competitions and we really have a 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.340
 pretty easy interface for that or they 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.099
 will be able to choose the usual things 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.219
 that is, whether it will rain or not 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.569
 noon the humidity this stuff 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.519
 the scrolling of time also for the 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.039
 particularly long races where the 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.180
 night falls stiff or that kind of things 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.260
 So at ca not feel bad its hard 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.350
 shoes 1 16 people per race 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.510
 potential 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.370
 he spoke to us I repaired and we get 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.050
 did not care but basically there is the museum mode 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.210
 or in fact we can put pictures 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.260
 behind cars and Hungarian has us 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.180
 talked about new images that one 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.590
 could have for this occasion it's going 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.110
 to be exciting as a presentation of the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.620
 month the city ​​of arts and sciences of 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.240
 valence 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.420
 something in italy here are some stuff 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.550
 you are delighted with his life what has me 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.020
 says so I tell you is surely the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.970
 president questions relative to the 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.340
 potential ps4 version they said that 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.300
 would certainly come on ps4 cgt 6 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.680
 they said that whatever happens 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.490
 fish there would be nothing before at least 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.130
 one year of ps4 is useless before minimum 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.930
 end of 2014 and that perhaps by then already 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.980
 it may be prolonged again if they 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.480
 want to work on it 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.700
 it will be their general time 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.160
 exactly and maybe by then that 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.780
 will be called dropped 7 to grant to 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
 passionate I think we can get 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.080
 brush will only for a few 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.640
 time in my opinion but that's it 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.800
 it's good for me they're really 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.300
 on ps3 that's for sure that's working 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.160
 after there is something going on ps4 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.660
 so much the better if their work since it's 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.390
 to have a version 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.890
 I was 6.5 that would not have been 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.850
 great in time and transforms 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.990
 later I was 7 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.940
 hoping it will not be a 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.230
 already rehashed that I am I was so 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.520
 is not yet too much where he will go 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.840
 especially since we are still waiting for 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.030
 gt mode information 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.280
 I still have the big one normally 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.470
 your assets of gt and there we do not know 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.820
 too if if it will evolve or not and 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.660
 it's like a pity damage because 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.700
 it was something that was criticized for 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.890
 gt5 towards the lack of evolution to his 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.210
 level there even though the run run has added 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.260
 a lot of things and there it is true that 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.790
 we are part of how to talk about 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.770
 online 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.300
 but for this one, thank you very much 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.890
 you for this wonderful listings 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.390
 I hope you enjoyed it and that you 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:10.770
 are not lost on the way like me and 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.770
 I'll see you soon on site alone 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.230
 the
