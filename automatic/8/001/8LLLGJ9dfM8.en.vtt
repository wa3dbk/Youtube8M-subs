00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 a greeting to all my mister friends 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.690
 computer technology 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.030
 in this video we want to show you the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.820
 benchmark is always followed with youtube 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 benchmark on a samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.460
 how can you see the tablet that we are 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:26.539
 using still adopts a version 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:31.019
 of android 4.0.3 ice cream sandwich e 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.070
 let's go and see now with a tutu 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.660
 benchmark what results we can have 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.010
 for this tablet 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.840
 we have already performed a first time 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.840
 we will follow the tester again 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.860
 you are we disable the defendant from 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 sd card and then start as usual 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.030
 if you have seen our videos with others 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.870
 antutu benchmark performs some tests 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.859
 the first is the test on the cpu and on 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.600
 memory 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.909
 then we could see a ram test in 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.570
 further test on the CPU though 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.950
 on the computational capabilities of integers and of 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.500
 flop and finally a test is performed 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.060
 up for the graphics card for both 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.060
 2d environments than for 3d environments 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.820
 this specific tablet how 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.650
 we said he installed again 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.759
 android ice cream sandwich 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:40.619
 like all owners of a galaxy tab 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.840
 2 7.0 Italians will unfortunately know in the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.060
 our country is still not there 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.079
 the version with was not released 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.179
 jelly Bean 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.640
 which instead in other countries too 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:55.799
 neighbors has already happened so let's do it 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.250
 this benchmark then when 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.130
 we could also use android 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.640
 jelly beans for this tablet came true 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.399
 that we will propose here that begins the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.480
 test regarding the video card 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:17.870
 this is the first phase of the 2d test here 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.670
 this is the second phase of the test two of 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.849
 these tests therefore concern 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.640
 expressly in this case the card 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.319
 graphic then the graphic capabilities of the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:36.860
 tablet in a few moments here 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.510
 3d rendering capabilities test 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.430
 this is the first phase and then there was one 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.709
 another very important thing this is 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.660
 a very popular tablet 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.560
 specifically this version that 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.180
 only wifi and therefore without 3g and how 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.840
 we said it is widespread because in 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.400
 Italy in the months of August September and has 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.870
 given in combination with the purchase of a 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.599
 samsung galaxy s3 so in Italy there is 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.439
 they are very many and easy to find 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:20.359
 owners of a samsung galaxy tab 2 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:22.340
 7.0 we are almost at the end with 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.390
 the last phase of the tests and this the 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:29.870
 result 6.278 we can go and see 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.720
 detail of the results 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:38.959
 we also propose in the description of 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:42.579
 this video with this we conclude a 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.579
 mister computer greetings
