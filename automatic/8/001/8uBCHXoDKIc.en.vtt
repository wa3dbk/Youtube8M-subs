00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
components now one thing I like about

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.670 
components now one thing I like about
the<00:01:12.790> PC<00:01:13.360> power<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:13.719> cooling<00:01:13.810> case<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.619> that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
the PC power and cooling case is that

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.770 
the PC power and cooling case is that
they<00:01:14.920> use<00:01:15.070> these<00:01:15.219> brass<00:01:15.520> thumb<00:01:15.880> screws<00:01:16.270> to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
they use these brass thumb screws to

hold<00:01:16.930> on<00:01:17.110> all<00:01:17.380> of<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.619> panels<00:01:18.040> now<00:01:18.430> what<00:01:18.579> this

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
hold on all of the panels now what this

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.100 
hold on all of the panels now what this
means<00:01:18.909> is<00:01:19.030> that<00:01:19.060> we<00:01:19.240> can<00:01:19.360> open<00:01:19.390> up<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.750> machine

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
means is that we can open up the machine

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.110 
means is that we can open up the machine
with<00:01:20.229> no<00:01:20.350> tools<00:01:20.650> so<00:01:21.490> for<00:01:21.700> example<00:01:21.760> I'm<00:01:22.090> going

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
with no tools so for example I'm going

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.670 
with no tools so for example I'm going
to<00:01:22.270> take<00:01:22.390> off<00:01:22.570> this<00:01:22.720> one<00:01:22.930> side<00:01:23.170> panel<00:01:23.560> by

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
to take off this one side panel by

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.420

micro ATX board we're going to have some
extra<00:04:40.140> room<00:04:40.560> here<00:04:40.770> but<00:04:41.040> that's<00:04:41.220> okay<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:42.630> here

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
extra room here but that's okay and here

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.070 
extra room here but that's okay and here
are<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.990> screws<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.440> I'm<00:04:43.560> going<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.800> use<00:04:43.980> to

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
are the screws that I'm going to use to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:53.659 
are the screws that I'm going to use to
install<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.260> motherboard<00:04:52.520> these<00:04:53.520> are

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
install the motherboard these are

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.670 
install the motherboard these are
Phillips<00:04:54.030> screws<00:04:54.360> now<00:04:55.050> normally<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.560> don't

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
Phillips screws now normally you don't

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.840 
Phillips screws now normally you don't
want<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.919> use<00:04:56.040> Phillips<00:04:56.430> screws<00:04:56.669> when

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
want to use Phillips screws when

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.220 
want to use Phillips screws when
installing<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.419> motherboard<00:04:57.900> but<00:04:58.050> in<00:04:58.140> this

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
installing a motherboard but in this

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.080 
installing a motherboard but in this
case<00:04:58.440> we're<00:04:58.650> going<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.800> be<00:04:58.919> careful<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.820> as<00:04:59.940> not

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
case we're going to be careful so as not

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
case we're going to be careful so as not
to<00:05:00.240> walk<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.780> screw<00:05:01.110> driver<00:05:01.650> head<00:05:02.010> out<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.490> the

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
to walk the screw driver head out of the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:15.380 
to walk the screw driver head out of the
socket<00:05:04.110> i'm<00:05:04.200> going<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.410> start<00:05:04.680> each<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:05.070> these

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.180 

okay<00:05:16.390> now<00:05:16.600> all<00:05:16.810> six<00:05:17.110> screws<00:05:17.380> are<00:05:17.620> installed<00:05:18.010> in

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
okay now all six screws are installed in

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.470 
okay now all six screws are installed in
the<00:05:18.280> motherboard<00:05:18.730> so<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:18.970> motherboard<00:05:19.390> is

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
the motherboard so the motherboard is

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.110 
the motherboard so the motherboard is
firmly<00:05:19.720> attached<00:05:20.170> to<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.560> tray<00:05:20.980> i<00:05:21.220> wanted<00:05:22.060> to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
firmly attached to the tray i wanted to

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.450 
firmly attached to the tray i wanted to
mention<00:05:22.240> i<00:05:22.480> also<00:05:22.660> installed<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.320> AGP<00:05:23.980> support

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
mention i also installed the AGP support

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.640 
mention i also installed the AGP support
bracket<00:05:24.880> on<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.030> AGP<00:05:25.870> slot<00:05:25.900> this<00:05:26.380> is<00:05:26.560> the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
bracket on the AGP slot this is the

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.780 
bracket on the AGP slot this is the
bracket<00:05:27.070> which<00:05:27.190> provides<00:05:27.520> additional

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
bracket which provides additional

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.270 
bracket which provides additional
support<00:05:28.420> so<00:05:28.990> the<00:05:29.110> AGP<00:05:29.560> card<00:05:29.800> isn't<00:05:30.010> likely<00:05:30.130> to

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
support so the AGP card isn't likely to

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.970 
support so the AGP card isn't likely to
walk<00:05:30.520> out<00:05:30.760> of<00:05:30.790> this<00:05:30.970> up<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.510> slot<00:05:31.830> which<00:05:32.830> can

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
walk out of this up the slot which can

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.350 
walk out of this up the slot which can
of<00:05:33.070> course<00:05:33.250> damage<00:05:33.610> both<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.910> card<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.270> the

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
of course damage both the card and the

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.620 
of course damage both the card and the
board<00:05:35.370> ok<00:05:36.370> now<00:05:36.880> I'm<00:05:37.000> going<00:05:37.120> to<00:05:37.180> make<00:05:37.330> sure<00:05:37.480> that

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
board ok now I'm going to make sure that

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.780 
board ok now I'm going to make sure that
the<00:05:37.780> i/o<00:05:37.990> shield<00:05:38.200> properly<00:05:39.160> matches<00:05:39.580> the

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
the i/o shield properly matches the

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.040 
the i/o shield properly matches the
motherboard<00:05:40.480> this<00:05:40.630> should<00:05:40.750> have<00:05:40.840> come<00:05:41.020> with

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
motherboard this should have come with

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.500 
motherboard this should have come with
the<00:05:41.230> motherboard<00:05:42.060> I'm<00:05:43.060> just<00:05:43.120> going<00:05:43.360> to<00:05:43.390> do<00:05:43.480> a

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
the motherboard I'm just going to do a

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.840 
the motherboard I'm just going to do a
test<00:05:43.600> fitting<00:05:44.170> here<00:05:44.410> and<00:05:44.620> we'll<00:05:45.220> see<00:05:45.400> how<00:05:45.610> this

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 
test fitting here and we'll see how this

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.440 
test fitting here and we'll see how this
matches<00:05:46.510> up<00:05:47.430> you<00:05:48.430> can<00:05:48.550> see<00:05:48.700> how<00:05:48.820> the<00:05:48.880> shield<00:05:49.270> is

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
matches up you can see how the shield is

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.230 
matches up you can see how the shield is
going<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.690> be<00:05:50.790> surround<00:05:51.790> all<00:05:52.030> of<00:05:52.150> the
