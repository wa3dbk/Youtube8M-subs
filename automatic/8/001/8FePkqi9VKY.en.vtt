00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.759 
nothing yet for neo so I'm assuming that
he's<00:02:08.910> gonna<00:02:09.030> go<00:02:09.149> something<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.450> 8-12<00:02:10.259> pool

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
he's gonna go something like 8-12 pool

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.830 
he's gonna go something like 8-12 pool
because<00:02:11.069> they<00:02:11.940> haven't<00:02:12.090> showed<00:02:12.300> its<00:02:12.450> base<00:02:12.660> in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
because they haven't showed its base in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.690 
because they haven't showed its base in
a<00:02:12.900> while<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.349> overload<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.340> gonna<00:02:14.519> scout

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
a while that overload is gonna scout

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.790 
a while that overload is gonna scout
that<00:02:14.819> 12<00:02:15.150> hatch<00:02:15.360> though<00:02:15.629> so<00:02:16.319> definitely<00:02:16.440> going

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
that 12 hatch though so definitely going

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.190 
that 12 hatch though so definitely going
to<00:02:16.860> know<00:02:16.980> what<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.750> wow<00:02:18.989> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
to know what is going on and wow it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.190 
to know what is going on and wow it
looks<00:02:19.530> like<00:02:19.769> neo<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.580> 2<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.239> 0<00:02:21.360> vs<00:02:21.780> zerg<00:02:21.989> so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
looks like neo is 2 and 0 vs zerg so

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.720 
looks like neo is 2 and 0 vs zerg so
this<00:02:22.349> is<00:02:22.470> going<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.680> be<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.799> very<00:02:22.950> very<00:02:23.549> good

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
this is going to be a very very good

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.190 
this is going to be a very very good
matchup<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.239> do<00:02:24.299> see<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.620> 12<00:02:26.340> pool<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.840> neo

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
matchup I do see that 12 pool in neo

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.720 
matchup I do see that 12 pool in neo
space<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.530> little<00:02:28.920> bit<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.099> deviation<00:02:29.519> then<00:02:29.580> he

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
space a little bit of deviation then he

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.789 
space a little bit of deviation then he
also<00:02:29.940> has<00:02:30.239> picked<00:02:30.450> up<00:02:30.540> his<00:02:30.599> extractor<00:02:31.560> puts

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
also has picked up his extractor puts

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.660 
also has picked up his extractor puts
three<00:02:32.040> drums<00:02:32.400> on<00:02:32.760> there<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.920> see<00:02:35.430> hit<00:02:35.549> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
three drums on there and you see hit the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.580 
three drums on there and you see hit the
path<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> drones<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.750> wonder<00:02:37.170> if<00:02:37.380> that's

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
path of the drones I wonder if that's

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.520 
path of the drones I wonder if that's
delays<00:02:38.160> delays<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:39.090> all<00:02:39.329> to<00:02:39.959> be<00:02:39.989> honest<00:02:40.380> on

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
delays delays at all to be honest on

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.789 
delays delays at all to be honest on
that<00:02:40.680> extractor<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:42.630> know<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.959> heard<00:02:43.410> that

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
that extractor you know I heard that

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.250 
that extractor you know I heard that
when<00:02:44.579> you<00:02:44.700> put<00:02:44.880> your<00:02:44.910> pile<00:02:45.269> on<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.660> how

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
when you put your pile on there how

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.539 
when you put your pile on there how
someone<00:02:46.560> explain<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.099> me<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
someone explain it to me on one of the

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.710 
someone explain it to me on one of the
comments<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.799> your<00:02:50.030> drone<00:02:51.030> spawned

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
comments is that your drone spawned

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.900 
comments is that your drone spawned
closer<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.380> your<00:02:52.560> middle<00:02:52.680> line<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.730> does

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
closer to your middle line and it does

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.550 
closer to your middle line and it does
something<00:02:54.660> with<00:02:54.690> your<00:02:55.019> attract<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.380> didn't

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
something with your attract I didn't

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.509 
something with your attract I didn't
really<00:02:55.650> understand<00:02:55.980> what<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.160> did<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:56.459> your

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
really understand what I did with your

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.759 
really understand what I did with your
extractor<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.599> make<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.049> milliseconds

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
extractor to make it like milliseconds

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.740 
extractor to make it like milliseconds
faster<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.060> wondering<00:03:00.360> if<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.720> was

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
faster and I was wondering if that was

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.050 
faster and I was wondering if that was
at<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.260> weird<00:03:01.560> path<00:03:01.980> as<00:03:02.340> seems<00:03:02.849> like<00:03:02.970> it

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
at that weird path as seems like it

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.009 
at that weird path as seems like it
would<00:03:03.120> take<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.329> little<00:03:03.420> bit<00:03:03.540> longer<00:03:03.690> though

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
would take a little bit longer though

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.729 
would take a little bit longer though
and<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:05.910> kind<00:03:06.090> of<00:03:06.150> weird<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.629> know<00:03:07.560> his

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
and so it's kind of weird I know his

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.729 
and so it's kind of weird I know his
pool<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.040> now<00:03:08.160> down<00:03:08.370> are<00:03:08.670> now<00:03:09.299> done<00:03:09.500> for<00:03:10.500> Jae

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
pool is now down are now done for Jae

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.890 
pool is now down are now done for Jae
dong<00:03:10.889> as<00:03:11.130> well<00:03:11.459> excuse<00:03:11.760> me<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.630> looks<00:03:12.840> like

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
dong as well excuse me it looks like

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.860 
dong as well excuse me it looks like
Neil's<00:03:13.230> probably<00:03:13.530> picking<00:03:13.680> up<00:03:13.829> his<00:03:13.950> expansion

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
Neil's probably picking up his expansion

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.220 
Neil's probably picking up his expansion
as<00:03:15.870> natural<00:03:16.260> as<00:03:16.350> well<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.030> looks<00:03:18.030> like<00:03:18.109> neo<00:03:19.109> is

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
as natural as well so looks like neo is

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.470 
as natural as well so looks like neo is
gonna<00:03:19.410> go<00:03:19.530> for<00:03:19.769> quick<00:03:20.040> layer<00:03:20.370> and<00:03:20.639> J<00:03:21.299> Tom's

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
gonna go for quick layer and J Tom's

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.610 
gonna go for quick layer and J Tom's
gonna<00:03:21.630> kind<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.989> sticks<00:03:22.200> with<00:03:22.500> his<00:03:24.319> with<00:03:25.319> his

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
gonna kind of sticks with his with his

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.890 
gonna kind of sticks with his with his
you<00:03:26.519> know<00:03:26.639> normal<00:03:27.090> hatch<00:03:27.709> as<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.769> viet<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.900> I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
you know normal hatch as a viet and I

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.009 
you know normal hatch as a viet and I
wonder<00:03:31.739> if<00:03:31.980> Neil<00:03:32.730> even<00:03:33.090> got<00:03:33.239> sterling<00:03:33.510> speed

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
wonder if Neil even got sterling speed

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.640 
wonder if Neil even got sterling speed
if<00:03:34.290> he<00:03:34.590> upgraded<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.549> no<00:03:36.359> to<00:03:36.420> layer<00:03:37.019> tech<00:03:37.319> before

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
if he upgraded a no to layer tech before

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.990 
if he upgraded a no to layer tech before
he<00:03:37.739> got<00:03:37.829> certain<00:03:38.190> speed<00:03:38.430> I'm<00:03:38.549> assuming<00:03:38.880> that's

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
he got certain speed I'm assuming that's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.400 
he got certain speed I'm assuming that's
what<00:03:39.060> he<00:03:39.180> did<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.420> I'm<00:03:39.540> assuming<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.049> Jade

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
what he did and I'm assuming that Jade

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.940 
what he did and I'm assuming that Jade
on<00:03:41.090> opted<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.209> go<00:03:42.239> for<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:43.079> little<00:03:43.410> bit<00:03:43.590> later

they<00:03:45.810> just<00:03:45.989> didn't<00:03:46.170> show<00:03:46.200> that<00:03:46.319> natural

they just didn't show that natural

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.800 
they just didn't show that natural
