 other events drove 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.470
 in one of my very first releases I 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.410
 talked about inventors who 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.930
 constructed a tank shooting feces 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.690
 and here he again declared himself 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.330
 Russia St. Petersburg inventor 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.320
 offered to drop on the enemy 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.820

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.229

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.750
 says that you can dump dolls 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.090
 without explosive but soaked 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.790
 a special substance that will infect 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.430
 enemies case they start 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.680
 use them as intended well and yet 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.290
 one option from the inventor is 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.619
 throw off inflatable sex dolls along with 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.960
 models of paratroopers I suppose so 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.300
 even break the brain 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.270

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.039
 sex bombs in the truest sense of the word 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.530
 and if such a doll came down from 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.569
 sky but not exploded don't rush and and 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.959
 use as intended 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:59.759
 the inventor hid somewhere inside 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.759
 antitank same plod yet 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.619
 as soon as in the last issue I said that 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.250
 what van see news is very rare 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.790
 video news so here's another one in the us 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.480
 student during a lecture to the entire audience 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.400
 turned on porn movie online edition 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.980
 argue that in one of the cities of the United States 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.950
 university students witnessed 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.350
 one of their colleagues decided to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.420
 class time watch porn 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.550
 Well, naturally there was that person 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:42.860
 who filmed this action on 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:45.200
 video camera yes the guy forgot to connect 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.570
 headphones to a laptop well, or simply not 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.930
 until the end inserted the plug so all 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.760
 sounds heard not only he as well 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.690
 people around him including 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.690
 teacher 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.890
 once he noticed that absolutely everything 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.530
 laugh then realized something is not right 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.050
 then quickly behind the floor cover 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.680
 laptop and software when the house ran out 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.680
 audience 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.360
 but I donâ€™t understand why 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.070
 turned on porn being in class even 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.640
 if the sound went through the headphones 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.020
 why video guy too hard but 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.360

 than him 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:57.560

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.870
 Nepal is home to a teenager who 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.020
 set a world record for striking himself 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.640

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.720
 one minute a young man tells 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.130

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.410

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.919

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.630
 feared that he was hurting himself 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.390
 the guy after all 134 strikes quote not 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.090

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.669
 It came true to get into the Guinness Book of Records 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.919

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.350
