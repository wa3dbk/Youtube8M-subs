case<00:01:56.970> let's<00:01:57.240> actually<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:57.750> look<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.110> a

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
case let's actually have a look at a

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.490 
case let's actually have a look at a
profile<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.149> sideways

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.190 

and<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.370> flat<00:02:06.320> one<00:02:07.320> hundred<00:02:07.650> percent<00:02:07.680> flat

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
and it is flat one hundred percent flat

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.640 
and it is flat one hundred percent flat
which<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.470> fantastic<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:14.630> viewing<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:19.320> if<00:02:19.560> I

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
which is fantastic for viewing and if I

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.290 
which is fantastic for viewing and if I
can<00:02:19.830> swing<00:02:20.100> around<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.820> front<00:02:20.850> will

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
can swing around here to the front will

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.330 
can swing around here to the front will
show<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.510> some<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> controls<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.190> this
