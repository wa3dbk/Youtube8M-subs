00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.830
 this is very recent well 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.200
 somehow you are an old acquaintance 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.910
 but so we put together here 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.910
 it does not exist yet 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 if you look like that then you could say 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.480
 yes is just a compact combination with 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.760
 a bit extroverted optics though 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.980
 just this loud optics leaves 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.840
 suspect that a bit more behind it 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 And so it is the seat leon 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.340
 cupra is currently the strongest of its kind 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.280
 in the whole of europe the seat leon sp has 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.230
 in the cuba version the 280 ps strong 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 gasoline under the hood and that makes 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.890
 so special in his segment 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
 apart from the special paint 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
 with orange highlights brightened 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.950
 pleasantly subtle back optics im 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 grill one or two cupra logo 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.850
 or the exhaust pipes indicate to be 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.739
 power potential 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.690
 In the interior you will find more subtle 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 details such as the churer 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.559
 writings that are around the s t so 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.059
 the combinatorial acts quickly again for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.610
 log hold 587 maximum 1400 70 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.939
 liter more importantly how much buzz has 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 Europe's strongest compacts sc 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 cupra comes with 265 and with the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
 mentioned 280 ps 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 Of course we have it for exactly this one 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.250
 here the big gasoline engine of the decided 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.960
 four-cylinder has 206 kilo watt and one 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.070
 maximum torque of 350 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 newton meters 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.270
 the top speed is 250 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530
 km h and in smooth six seconds 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.780
 it's 100 km h 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.149
 the 350 newton meters maximum torque 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.259
 they are already at 1700 tours to 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.179
 disposal and then the fun is first 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.360
 really go because you can do that 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.469
 four cylinders loose turn further until 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.369
 6,500 tours to the red 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.189
 area into it 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.560
 there are even close to 7,000 if 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.450
 you have the right famos next to eco 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.159
 and comfort there is sport and then it is 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.110
 there just cooper in the one on 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.869
 electronic helper as far as possible 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.850
 the cup racing mode does not work 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.100
 sc is much sharper on the gas and that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.509
 color is crisp hard not me 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.909
 quite as much as you like it is 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.649
 artificially additionally generated motor 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.569
 Sound that switches to it as soon as you 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.670
 in driving modes Cuba or sports 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.319
 is the mediated a trained 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.519
 scary and also the force of the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.519
 bring cars to the streets 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.430
 but it may be time already 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.780
 but some are annoying he is good 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.970
 less criticism than it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.530
 is a matter of taste and also rather 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.150
 insignificant if you agree with the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.780
 athletic spanier through the tight 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.780
 turns shoots 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.720
 what surprised me positively is that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.280
 the front-wheel drive hexagonal way of driving 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.800
 never really leaves arise the feeling 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.209
 you would lose the necessary grip and 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.880
 also drive influences are in the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.709
 steering barely noticeable even the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.450
 Well found sports seats provide with the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.580
 pronounced cheeks good sideways 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.400
 without missing the necessary rest comfort 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.290
 to let what fits the overall impression 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.720
 is the really excellent 6 course 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.610
 dsg that quickly switches to the point 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.200
 like a Swiss clockwork and bring or 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.850
 towards the handshake at sprint 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.450
 from 0 to 100 a little bit of time 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.980
 out but also costs 1700 euros extra 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.540
 but my opinion is if you look 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.100
 because for such a vehicle decides 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.959
 then it is really well invested 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.150
 money 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.519
 the tiresome topic money yes that is dsg 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.290
 great but also costs extra then 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.440
 Do you want in such a car just that too 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.459
 performance package with brembo brakes 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.530
 alloy wheels or high performance 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.540
 Tires say that costs just four 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.400
 Giant with other manufacturers will be 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.320
 but often much more expensive though 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.570
 not only because of that, the seat 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.290
 leon st copper in the overall package 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.019
 play in the upper area 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.370
 the new seat leon st cupra a car where 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.049
 There is hardly anything to moan about 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.030
 if you are looking for then you will find it 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.230
 always some trifles and such 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.420
 At least for my taste 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.329
 the steering will be a tick sharpener 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.950
 and then this look so the paint 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.540
 with the orange not mine 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.100
 but then you can say it has to be yes 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.930
 do not take and besides that should be 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.459
 a over 100 kilo man in 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.290
 Cord pants ever thought where 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.840
 optics so ticked off the topic altogether 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.519
 a really nice and well done 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.950
 car and also at the price you can not 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.829
 really grump the 280 ps strong 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.010
 petrol starts at 33 1820 euro 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:19.299
 and the starting price for the 265 hp 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.680
 strong four-cylinder is 32 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.479
 1650 euro is clear that now no 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.919
 Grabbeltisch bargain but at least 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.690
 not really expensive in comparison 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.450
 And besides, you get that right now 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.889
 the strongest compact combination in europe 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.409
 at least yet 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.699
 yes, because even the direct attack on 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:37.249
 this title comes from your own 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.960
 the corporations queen mother vw 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.419
 should already in the next few months the 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.219
 golf air variant with 300 ps on the 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.749
 push public roads and then 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.029
 is the title for the Spaniards gone 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:50.259
 well as they say it remains 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.259
 at least in the family
