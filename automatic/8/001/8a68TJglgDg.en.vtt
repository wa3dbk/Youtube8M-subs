assault<00:01:51.240> rifle<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.720> king<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.070> just

assault rifle is king it will just
overpower<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.450> straight-up<00:01:56.990> reason<00:01:57.990> I'm

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
overpower you straight-up reason I'm

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.780 
overpower you straight-up reason I'm
choosing<00:01:58.170> lightweight<00:01:58.890> over<00:01:59.189> stopping<00:01:59.640> power

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
choosing lightweight over stopping power

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.510 
choosing lightweight over stopping power
is<00:02:00.409> mainly<00:02:01.409> because<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.130> weight<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
is mainly because the weight the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.050 
is mainly because the weight the
submachine<00:02:02.939> gun<00:02:03.149> shoots<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.659> fast<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:05.060> they

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
submachine gun shoots so fast and they

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
submachine gun shoots so fast and they
have<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.630> two<00:02:06.840> extra<00:02:07.200> bullets<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
have one or two extra bullets it

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.540 
have one or two extra bullets it
requires<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.489> kill<00:02:08.670> somebody<00:02:09.170> generally

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
requires to kill somebody generally

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.400 
requires to kill somebody generally
doesn't<00:02:11.550> weigh<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.270> way

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
doesn't weigh out way

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.740 
doesn't weigh out way
the<00:02:13.560> extra<00:02:14.040> movement<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:14.790> when<00:02:15.600> you're

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the extra movement you get when you're

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.630 
the extra movement you get when you're
using<00:02:15.990> lightweight<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.830> can<00:02:16.860> use<00:02:17.160> it<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.400> some

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
using lightweight you can use it on some

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.070 
using lightweight you can use it on some
of<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.760> heavier<00:02:18.090> damage<00:02:18.420> assault<00:02:18.720> rifles

it makes your moving it makes you move

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.660 
it makes your moving it makes you move
and<00:02:30.630> are<00:02:31.020> harder<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.410> hit<00:02:31.740> unless<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.610> out

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
and are harder to hit unless you get out

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.420 
and are harder to hit unless you get out

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.140 
to a building I don't really pay
attention<00:05:56.690> I<00:05:57.139> look<00:05:57.320> at<00:05:57.440> messages<00:05:57.830> and<00:05:58.370> things

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
attention I look at messages and things

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.339 
attention I look at messages and things
of<00:05:59.300> that<00:05:59.330> nature<00:05:59.449> because<00:05:59.750> I<00:05:59.930> don't<00:06:00.080> have<00:06:00.139> any

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
of that nature because I don't have any

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.760 
of that nature because I don't have any
plans<00:06:00.620> of<00:06:00.800> going<00:06:00.889> out<00:06:01.160> and<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:02.560> generally<00:06:03.560> my

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
plans of going out and I generally my

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.430 
plans of going out and I generally my
teammates<00:06:04.190> are<00:06:04.960> preoccupied<00:06:05.960> on<00:06:06.229> the<00:06:06.320> other

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
teammates are preoccupied on the other

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.719 
teammates are preoccupied on the other
team<00:06:06.770> by<00:06:06.979> getting<00:06:07.280> destroyed<00:06:07.610> by<00:06:07.669> them<00:06:09.729> but

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
team by getting destroyed by them but

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:11.980 
team by getting destroyed by them but
you<00:06:10.910> could<00:06:11.060> go<00:06:11.180> into<00:06:11.330> buildings<00:06:11.810> and

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
you could go into buildings and

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.629 
you could go into buildings and
generally<00:06:12.740> we<00:06:12.830> have<00:06:12.860> air<00:06:13.130> support<00:06:13.460> out<00:06:13.610> there

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
generally we have air support out there

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.520 
generally we have air support out there
a<00:06:13.820> lot<00:06:14.000> easier<00:06:14.479> to<00:06:14.599> kill<00:06:14.810> because<00:06:15.020> half<00:06:15.380> them

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
a lot easier to kill because half them

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.469 
a lot easier to kill because half them
are<00:06:15.680> unaware<00:06:15.919> and<00:06:16.849> they're<00:06:17.060> not<00:06:17.210> really

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:17.479 
are unaware and they're not really

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.180 
are unaware and they're not really
