we<00:00:14.889> use<00:00:15.360> concentrate<00:00:16.360> to<00:00:16.840> make<00:00:17.020> our<00:00:17.170> own

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.290 
we use concentrate to make our own

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.630 
we use concentrate to make our own
polymeric<00:00:17.830> sand<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:19.390> use<00:00:19.660> to<00:00:20.290> fill<00:00:20.529> in<00:00:20.680> joints

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
polymeric sand to use to fill in joints

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.560 
polymeric sand to use to fill in joints
for<00:00:21.820> driveways<00:00:22.300> that<00:00:22.570> we<00:00:22.689> cover<00:00:23.560> with<00:00:23.800> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
for driveways that we cover with a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.300 
for driveways that we cover with a
rubber<00:00:25.570> product<00:00:26.050> that<00:00:26.140> we<00:00:26.260> also<00:00:26.380> develop<00:00:26.890> but

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
rubber product that we also develop but

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.670 
rubber product that we also develop but
making<00:00:27.640> our<00:00:27.730> own<00:00:27.760> polymeric<00:00:28.300> sand<00:00:28.599> has<00:00:28.810> saved

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
making our own polymeric sand has saved

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.660 
making our own polymeric sand has saved
us<00:00:29.890> quite<00:00:29.920> a<00:00:30.220> bit<00:00:30.400> of<00:00:30.490> money<00:00:30.670> and<00:00:30.970> time<00:00:32.670> and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
us quite a bit of money and time and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.070 
us quite a bit of money and time and
it's<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.910> good<00:00:34.059> product<00:00:34.300> that's<00:00:34.600> an<00:00:34.690> excellent

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
it's a good product that's an excellent

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.990 
it's a good product that's an excellent
product<00:00:35.379> but<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:36.129> it's<00:00:36.250> really<00:00:36.430> easy<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.760> make

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
product but and it's really easy to make

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.520 
product but and it's really easy to make
so<00:00:37.239> there's<00:00:37.390> no<00:00:37.480> reason<00:00:37.809> not<00:00:37.960> to<00:00:38.170> make<00:00:38.379> your

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
so there's no reason not to make your

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.500 
so there's no reason not to make your
own<00:00:38.650> sand<00:00:38.949> all<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:39.850> do<00:00:40.000> is<00:00:40.059> you<00:00:40.180> start<00:00:40.360> off

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
own sand all you do is you start off

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.920 
own sand all you do is you start off
with<00:00:40.660> a<00:00:40.690> couple<00:00:41.410> of<00:00:41.500> buckets<00:00:42.309> of<00:00:42.460> sand<00:00:42.780> if<00:00:43.780> you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
with a couple of buckets of sand if you

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.959 
with a couple of buckets of sand if you
don't<00:00:44.079> mixer<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:45.660> say<00:00:46.660> start<00:00:46.930> with<00:00:47.050> one<00:00:47.469> bucket

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
don't mixer I say start with one bucket

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.029 
don't mixer I say start with one bucket
and<00:00:48.969> then<00:00:49.629> I<00:00:49.750> one<00:00:50.110> of<00:00:50.230> these<00:00:50.350> will<00:00:50.710> make<00:00:50.829> you<00:00:51.010> a

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
and then I one of these will make you a

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.160 
and then I one of these will make you a
hundred<00:00:51.430> pounds<00:00:51.940> of<00:00:52.199> Pali<00:00:53.199> fan<00:00:54.690> content<00:00:55.690> it's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
hundred pounds of Pali fan content it's

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.990 
hundred pounds of Pali fan content it's
all<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.440> polymers<00:00:56.860> it's<00:00:57.070> just<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.489> polymer

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
all the polymers it's just the polymer

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.420 
all the polymers it's just the polymer
sand<00:00:58.239> binders<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:58.960> this<00:00:59.590> use<00:00:59.829> your<00:00:59.980> own<00:01:00.070> sand

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
sand binders and this use your own sand

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:10.230 
sand binders and this use your own sand
and<00:01:00.789> I<00:01:00.969> just<00:01:01.210> use<00:01:01.359> a<00:01:01.390> slow<00:01:01.719> mixer<00:01:02.109> and

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.790 

I'll<00:01:10.630> let<00:01:10.780> it<00:01:10.810> mix<00:01:11.020> up<00:01:11.260> and<00:01:11.380> then<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.560> had<00:01:11.680> the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
I'll let it mix up and then I had the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.220 
I'll let it mix up and then I had the
second<00:01:12.220> bucket

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
second bucket

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.940 
second bucket
you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:14.310> also<00:01:14.460> optionally<00:01:14.760> cover<00:01:15.300> this<00:01:15.540> but

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
you can also optionally cover this but

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.630 
you can also optionally cover this but
go<00:01:17.490> ahead<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.820> leave<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.120> open<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:19.640> you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
go ahead just leave it open for now you

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
go ahead just leave it open for now you
don't<00:01:20.790> want<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> mix<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> too<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.540> but<00:01:21.810> you'll

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
don't want to mix it too much but you'll

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:35.010 
don't want to mix it too much but you'll
loose<00:01:22.229> some<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.440> the<00:01:24.770> polymer<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> air

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.640 

I'm<00:01:35.530> using<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.920> white<00:01:36.159> masonry<00:01:37.060> band

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.810 

about

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
about

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.880 
about
thirty<00:01:42.360> about<00:01:43.230> $30<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> yard<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.050> then

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
thirty about $30 a yard I think and then

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.560 
thirty about $30 a yard I think and then
I<00:01:46.980> just<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.600> drying<00:01:48.600> station

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.090 

in<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.960> big<00:01:52.110> warehouse<00:01:52.380> or

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
in a big warehouse or

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:13.720 
in a big warehouse or
someone<00:01:54.580> where<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.790> can<00:01:54.970> cover<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.360> if<00:01:55.479> it<00:01:55.570> rain

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.729 

small<00:02:14.240> mixers<00:02:14.690> sometimes<00:02:15.140> out

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
small mixers sometimes out

good<00:02:19.630> max<00:02:19.840> going<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.500> don't<00:02:21.010> make<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.400> longer

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
good max going I don't make it longer

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.550 
good max going I don't make it longer
just<00:02:22.120> two<00:02:22.599> to<00:02:22.720> three<00:02:22.900> minutes<00:02:23.260> he's<00:02:24.250> done

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.100 

sometimes<00:02:28.250> I'll<00:02:28.400> run<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.630> stand<00:02:29.900> through<00:02:30.080> a

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
sometimes I'll run the stand through a

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.900 
sometimes I'll run the stand through a
screen<00:02:30.530> depending<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:31.250> how<00:02:31.550> good<00:02:31.610> or<00:02:31.850> the

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.839 

it<00:02:52.560> means<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.859> got<00:02:53.069> pretty<00:02:53.249> good<00:02:53.400> at<00:02:53.519> foreign

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
it means I got pretty good at foreign

stuff

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.210 

and<00:03:02.750> that's<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:03.110> until<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.620> make<00:03:03.770> polymeric

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
and that's it until you make polymeric

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.330 
and that's it until you make polymeric
sand<00:03:04.430> out<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.670> concentrate
