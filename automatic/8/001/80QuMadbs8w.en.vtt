00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.500
 today at sea ​​del directo we invite you to 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:15.840
 learn more about the world of 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.860
 dogs that participate in exhibitions of 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.860
 beauty and structure 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.580
 and she told me a training that was 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.230
 flame handling that is the art of showing 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.900
 dogs at beauty shows and 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.900
 structure and it's because you talk about 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.220
 the art of showing dogs 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.000
 prepare them to go to that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.370
 competition if actually 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.830
 the exhibition is an exhibition of all 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.620
 the races where there is a regulation where 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.040
 there is a judge where the dog has to go 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.440
 getting ready 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.300
 weekly both hair and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.070
 physically to be able to get to that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 exhibition in its fullness and power 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.320
 compete and win a success that we 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.400
 pretend there are different races too 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.390
 you have to keep in mind it's not the same 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.790
 prepare a doberman 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.790
 what may have other facets that 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.890
 show as physical your muscles that 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.080
 they prepared georgia there's a schnauzer that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.930
 have a more exhausted job in hair 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.720
 especially the fact there are positions 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.940
 which evaluates at that moment because it is the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.910
 first step that asks you to do good 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.400
 I usually always reiterate it depends 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.250
 of the race what is true in the case of a 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.200
 miniature schnauzer gets on the table 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.630
 where the judge examines it can examine 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.320
 mouths upper lines that is everything 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.290
 what is the back of the head 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.970
 to lead that is all that is the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.640
 previous and the lower rear train 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 touch everything everything is always evaluating 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.050
 comparing with the standard claws 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.310
 then he makes it come down from the table to 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.220
 be able to make a series of movements 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.740
 like the round trip no where can 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.660
 observe the parallels of the dog if 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.750
 have a problem if you cross your hands 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.940
 and weaves is something to explain a success and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.680
 then he does a circle where 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.910
 he is evaluating a balance between 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.479
 previous or the subsequent train and a line 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:09.149
 top good we are with a springer 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.350
 it's a sports race called 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.730
 english springer spaniel 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.069
 It's similar 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.840
 as a cocker, he gets very confused with the 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.849
 cocker is bigger I would say a term 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.000
 medium between the setter gland the setter and 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.239
 the cocker is a race with a lot 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.239
 movement 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.829
 is a race of those used in the 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.359
 exhibitions and therefore has a 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.299
 also important hairdressing work 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.549
 it's a georgia and it's another type a race 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.650
 very different in terms of hairdressing in 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.560
 regarding handling with respect to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.180
 schnauzer that we saw before is not true 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.549
 It's striking because this is not the dog 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.370
 of susana although that same race of 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:51.430
 puppy that has susana a race of 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.560
 company that enters group 3 that is 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.050
 called the terrier group 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.020
 judges them in the same way as 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.090
 other dogs in their style and style 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.310
 and let's not forget that for every race there is 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.400
 a certain standard then you have to 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.750
 compare with the standard or comparing 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.750
 always against the rival of turn
