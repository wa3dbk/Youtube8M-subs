00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.520 
the biggest surprise about being is that
this<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.480> first<00:04:13.720> time<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.350> actually

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
this is the first time that you actually

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.500 
this is the first time that you actually
get<00:04:14.890> to<00:04:15.100> drive<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.490> Batmobile<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:16.270> know<00:04:16.390> and

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
get to drive the Batmobile you know and

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.910 
get to drive the Batmobile you know and
all<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.750> other<00:04:16.870> games<00:04:17.140> they<00:04:17.470> get<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:17.800> the

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
all the other games they get to be the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.860 
all the other games they get to be the
bat<00:04:18.070> but<00:04:18.280> in<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.520> one<00:04:18.760> you<00:04:19.209> actually<00:04:19.239> get<00:04:19.750> to

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
bat but in this one you actually get to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.150 
bat but in this one you actually get to
drive<00:04:19.989> this<00:04:20.230> vehicle<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.830> that's<00:04:20.980> something

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
drive this vehicle and that's something

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.620 
drive this vehicle and that's something
that<00:04:21.400> they<00:04:21.520> haven't<00:04:21.700> done<00:04:21.910> before<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:22.480> I<00:04:22.510> think

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
that they haven't done before so I think

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.810 
that they haven't done before so I think
they'll<00:04:22.810> have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.930> lot<00:04:23.140> of<00:04:23.230> fun<00:04:23.350> with<00:04:23.470> that<00:04:23.820> I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
they'll have a lot of fun with that I

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.720 
they'll have a lot of fun with that I
need<00:04:25.330> to<00:04:25.540> attract<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:25.930> military<00:04:26.500> vehicle

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730

great perhaps the main reason I wanted

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.430 
great perhaps the main reason I wanted
to<00:04:50.230> play<00:04:50.440> scarecrow<00:04:51.100> is<00:04:51.670> because<00:04:52.060> I<00:04:52.270> hope<00:04:52.600> he

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
to play scarecrow is because I hope he

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.590 
to play scarecrow is because I hope he
might<00:04:53.620> get<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:54.010> drive<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.370> Batmobile<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:55.210> no

might get to drive the Batmobile and no

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.690 
might get to drive the Batmobile and no
one<00:04:55.840> does<00:04:56.020> that<00:04:56.080> wouldn't<00:04:56.800> let<00:04:56.890> me<00:04:57.040> say<00:04:57.370> for
