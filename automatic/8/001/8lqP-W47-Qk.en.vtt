pounds
however<00:01:11.460> on<00:01:11.640> FIFA<00:01:11.970> 14<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.630> year<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:13.020> has<00:01:13.110> been

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
however on FIFA 14 this year he has been

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.920 
however on FIFA 14 this year he has been
upgraded<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.369> 68<00:01:15.000> rated<00:01:15.420> defensive

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
upgraded to a 68 rated defensive

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.170 
upgraded to a 68 rated defensive
midfielder<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> he<00:01:17.040> has<00:01:17.130> also<00:01:17.310> changed<00:01:17.790> teams

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
midfielder and he has also changed teams

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.230 
midfielder and he has also changed teams
to<00:01:18.509> buy<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> Leverkusen<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.520> FIFA<00:01:20.850> 40

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to buy a Leverkusen and then on FIFA 40

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850 
to buy a Leverkusen and then on FIFA 40
and<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.509> believe<00:01:21.810> he<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.290> potential

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and I believe he will have a potential

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.760 
and I believe he will have a potential
of<00:01:23.040> around<00:01:23.430> 86<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.540> therefore<00:01:25.200> an<00:01:25.350> increased

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
of around 86 and therefore an increased

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.730 
of around 86 and therefore an increased
starting<00:01:26.220> price<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.670> probably<00:01:27.270> around<00:01:27.740> 1.75

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
starting price of probably around 1.75

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.890 
starting price of probably around 1.75
million<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.060> he<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.210> definitely<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.659> player

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
million but he is definitely a player

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300 
million but he is definitely a player
you<00:01:31.140> should<00:01:31.350> be<00:01:31.470> looking<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.040> because

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
you should be looking to get because

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.620 
you should be looking to get because
there<00:01:32.490> aren't<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.729> many<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.030> defensive

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
there aren't that many a defensive

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.410 
there aren't that many a defensive
midfielders<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.380> FIFA<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.579> very<00:01:36.119> good

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
midfielders on FIFA that are very good

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
midfielders on FIFA that are very good
and<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.780> high<00:01:36.990> potential<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:37.770> this<00:01:38.220> is

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
and have high potential so this is

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.770 
and have high potential so this is
definitely<00:01:38.549> one<00:01:38.790> player<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.450> should<00:01:39.630> keep

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
definitely one player you should keep

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.620 
definitely one player you should keep
your<00:01:39.930> eye<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.470> career<00:01:40.829> mode<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> then<00:01:42.420> going

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
your eye on on career mode so then going

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.520 
guy will be incredible in the future so
I've<00:03:27.910> decided<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.360> give<00:03:28.510> him<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.720> potential<00:03:29.350> of

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
I've decided to give him a potential of

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.790 
I've decided to give him a potential of
around<00:03:29.709> 83<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.850> FIFA<00:03:31.270> 14<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.959> therefore<00:03:32.620> an

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
around 83 on FIFA 14 and therefore an

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.770 
around 83 on FIFA 14 and therefore an
increased<00:03:33.340> starting<00:03:33.820> price<00:03:34.060> on<00:03:34.300> career<00:03:34.600> mode

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
increased starting price on career mode

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.860 
increased starting price on career mode
of<00:03:34.959> around<00:03:35.459> 800,000<00:03:36.459> pounds<00:03:36.640> but<00:03:37.330> yet<00:03:37.720> this

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
of around 800,000 pounds but yet this

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.780 
of around 800,000 pounds but yet this
guy<00:03:38.080> should<00:03:38.350> be<00:03:38.470> pretty<00:03:38.709> good<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.190> there<00:03:39.670> is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
guy should be pretty good and there is

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.509 
guy should be pretty good and there is
fairly<00:03:40.330> quick<00:03:40.570> as<00:03:40.750> well<00:03:41.050> at<00:03:41.290> only<00:03:41.470> 18<00:03:42.130> years<00:03:42.459> of

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
fairly quick as well at only 18 years of

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.020 
fairly quick as well at only 18 years of
age<00:03:42.760> with<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.540> pace<00:03:43.870> rating<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.590> 80<00:03:45.040> overall<00:03:45.700> so

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
age with a pace rating of 80 overall so

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.640 
age with a pace rating of 80 overall so
you<00:03:46.090> can<00:03:46.239> probably<00:03:46.480> get<00:03:46.750> this<00:03:46.870> up<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.110> around

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
you can probably get this up to around

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.790 
you can probably get this up to around
there<00:03:47.890> 89<00:03:48.489> on<00:03:48.700> career<00:03:49.150> mode<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.590> when<00:03:50.709> I'm

he<00:03:56.290> was<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.650> 71<00:03:57.519> rated<00:03:57.970> player<00:03:58.300> at<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.870> age<00:03:59.019> of

he was a 71 rated player at the age of

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.620 
he was a 71 rated player at the age of
19<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.400> is<00:04:00.459> a<00:04:00.489> very<00:04:00.580> high<00:04:01.030> rating<00:04:01.300> for

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
19 so that is a very high rating for

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.960 
19 so that is a very high rating for
such<00:04:01.810> a<00:04:02.019> young<00:04:02.230> player<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:03.160> a<00:04:03.190> only<00:04:03.850> other

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
potential of 78 last year so that's

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.490 
potential of 78 last year so that's
quite<00:04:06.430> weird<00:04:06.760> scene<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.120> it's<00:04:07.269> only<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.630> plus<00:04:08.110> 7

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500
