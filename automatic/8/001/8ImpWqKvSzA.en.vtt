00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.940
 basic section in the basic section 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.220
 we find in addition to baita fondo backup that 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.709

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.220
 the device setting will appear 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.670
 font and we simply must 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.680
 wait for a respring that's mine 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.409
 device turned on again 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.849
 we unlock and how you see even if it will be 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.310
 a bit difficult to see in the video 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.519
 because the reflex is not good for this 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.930
 guys is the font of ios 9 definitely 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.609
 when will you install yourself and maybe 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.739
 you will make a good comparison 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.480
 immediately it is a font very similar to that 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.159
 previous Swiss but I think it is 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.900
 characterized by characters a 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.940
 a little narrower and above all a 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.709
 I don't know how to say anything more rounded 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.780
