new<00:00:31.140> features<00:00:31.560> here<00:00:32.390> they<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> new

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
new features here they have a new

new features here they have a new
keyboard<00:00:33.899> design<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> butterfly<00:00:35.460> switch

keyboard design with a butterfly switch

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.569 
keyboard design with a butterfly switch
instead<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.570> normal<00:00:37.200> scissor<00:00:37.860> switch<00:00:38.129> which

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
instead of a normal scissor switch which

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.670 
instead of a normal scissor switch which
they<00:00:38.760> say<00:00:38.910> makes<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> keys<00:00:39.420> more<00:00:39.629> stable<00:00:40.050> they

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
they say makes the keys more stable they

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.709 
they say makes the keys more stable they
seem<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.920> have<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> pretty<00:00:41.520> good<00:00:41.760> travel<00:00:42.329> still

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
seem to have a pretty good travel still

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:43.790 
seem to have a pretty good travel still
on<00:00:42.840> them<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> should<00:00:43.440> get<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> nice

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
on them so you should get a nice

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.680 
on them so you should get a nice
confirmation<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.579> keystrokes<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.539> it's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
confirmation for keystrokes but it's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.970 
confirmation for keystrokes but it's
definitely<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.079> narrower<00:00:46.379> travel<00:00:46.829> than

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
definitely a narrower travel than

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
definitely a narrower travel than
previously<00:00:47.399> most<00:00:47.789> likely<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.270> it's

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
previously most likely because it's

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.660 
previously most likely because it's
thinner<00:00:48.629> there's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> new<00:00:49.860> touchpad<00:00:50.309> slightly

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
thinner there's a new touchpad slightly

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.779 
thinner there's a new touchpad slightly
larger<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.390> has<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.570> horse<00:00:52.260> touch

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
larger and it has a horse touch

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.400 
larger and it has a horse touch
mechanism<00:00:53.789> inside<00:00:54.120> which<00:00:54.420> provides<00:00:54.840> forced

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
mechanism inside which provides forced

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.700 
mechanism inside which provides forced
feedback<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.850> press<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.559> can

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
feedback when you press on it you can

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
feedback when you press on it you can
get<00:00:58.859> kind<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> feedback<00:00:59.820> there<00:01:00.149> but<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.690> also

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
get kind of feedback there but it also

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.389 
get kind of feedback there but it also
allows<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.320> force<00:01:01.739> touch<00:01:01.949> which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
allows you to force touch which is a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.170 
allows you to force touch which is a
single<00:01:02.910> tap<00:01:03.120> or<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.719> deeper<00:01:04.619> harder<00:01:05.040> tap<00:01:05.430> which

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
single tap or a deeper harder tap which

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.320 
single tap or a deeper harder tap which
can<00:01:06.360> provide<00:01:06.600> contextual<00:01:07.790> results<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> say

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
can provide contextual results on say

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.399 
can provide contextual results on say
calendar<00:01:10.080> entry<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.850> pulling<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> link<00:01:12.409> then

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
calendar entry or pulling up a link then

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.179 
calendar entry or pulling up a link then
the<00:01:14.330> various<00:01:15.590> quadrants<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> touch<00:01:16.979> pad

can be activated separately let's see

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.950 
can be activated separately let's see
what<00:01:20.610> else<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.759> got<00:01:20.939> Oh<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> construction

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
what else we got Oh so the construction

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
what else we got Oh so the construction
is<00:01:22.140> all<00:01:22.259> aluminium<00:01:22.680> here<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.040> may<00:01:23.220> notice

is all aluminium here you may notice

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
is all aluminium here you may notice
that<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.000> no<00:01:24.210> plastic<00:01:25.020> window<00:01:25.770> here

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that there is no plastic window here

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100 
that there is no plastic window here
which<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.430> normal<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:26.850> MacBooks<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.840> order<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
which is normal for MacBooks in order to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.270 
which is normal for MacBooks in order to
provide<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> window<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.950> wireless

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
provide a window for wireless

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.980 
provide a window for wireless
transmission<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.060> Wi-Fi<00:01:30.420> bluetooth<00:01:30.869> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
transmission like Wi-Fi bluetooth that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.450 
transmission like Wi-Fi bluetooth that
sort<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> thing<00:01:31.380> they<00:01:31.920> said<00:01:32.070> they've<00:01:32.250> included

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
sort of thing they said they've included

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
sort of thing they said they've included
the<00:01:32.700> antennas<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.570> casing<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> casing

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the antennas in the casing so the casing

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.679 
the antennas in the casing so the casing
most<00:01:35.070> likely<00:01:35.430> acts<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> antenna<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.630> at

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
most likely acts as the antenna or at

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
most likely acts as the antenna or at
least<00:01:36.810> portions<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.369> that's<00:01:38.520> new

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
least portions of it do so that's new

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.060 
least portions of it do so that's new
the<00:01:39.630> display<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.290> say<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.500> thinner<00:01:40.829> than

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the display they say is thinner than

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.429 
the display they say is thinner than
ever<00:01:41.340> before<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.030> uses<00:01:42.390> 30%<00:01:42.930> less<00:01:43.020> energy

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
ever before and uses 30% less energy

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.770 
ever before and uses 30% less energy
contributes<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> better<00:01:44.700> battery<00:01:45.030> life<00:01:45.119> in

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
contributes to better battery life in

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.350 
contributes to better battery life in
addition<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.710> inside<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.729> inside<00:01:48.030> we've

addition the inside in the inside we've
reduced<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> internals<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> logic<00:01:50.520> board

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
reduced the internals so the logic board

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.149 
reduced the internals so the logic board
is<00:01:50.909> 30%<00:01:51.810> smaller<00:01:52.470> than<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> has<00:01:53.040> been

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
is 30% smaller than it has been

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.940 
is 30% smaller than it has been
previously<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:54.619> accordance<00:01:55.619> with<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.829> new

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
previously in accordance with a new

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.240 
previously in accordance with a new
denser<00:01:56.340> design<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:57.990> they've

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
denser design on that and then they've

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.310 
denser design on that and then they've
changed<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> battery<00:01:59.729> design<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> tiered

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
changed the battery design to a tiered

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.020 
changed the battery design to a tiered
structure<00:02:01.680> which<00:02:02.009> layers<00:02:02.340> thin<00:02:02.759> layers<00:02:02.969> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
structure which layers thin layers of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.480 
structure which layers thin layers of
battery<00:02:03.420> together<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.680> places<00:02:05.070> them<00:02:05.189> inside

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
battery together and places them inside

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.240 
battery together and places them inside
the<00:02:05.640> casing<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.450> they<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.689> shape<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
the casing so they can shape to the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.969 
the casing so they can shape to the
tapered<00:02:09.119> design<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:09.960> case<00:02:10.170> which<00:02:10.740> allows

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
tapered design of the case which allows

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.310 
tapered design of the case which allows
them<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.190> fit<00:02:11.430> more<00:02:11.550> battery<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.240> there<00:02:12.450> which

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
them to fit more battery in there which

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.080 
them to fit more battery in there which
provides<00:02:13.680> more<00:02:14.070> battery<00:02:14.460> life<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.790> say<00:02:14.940> it's

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
provides more battery life I say it's

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.090 
provides more battery life I say it's
full<00:02:15.600> ten<00:02:15.810> hours<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.110> wireless<00:02:16.710> web<00:02:16.890> browsing
