there's two screws there and then one
eep<00:01:34.979> screw<00:01:35.430> there<00:01:35.640> that's<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> first<00:01:36.479> time

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
eep screw there that's the first time

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.899 
eep screw there that's the first time
I've<00:01:36.810> seen<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> don't<00:01:38.790> know

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
I've seen that actually so I don't know

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.730 
I've seen that actually so I don't know
why<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:40.400> little<00:01:41.400> talking<00:01:41.759> laws<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.210> so

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
why this is little talking laws to be so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.700 
why this is little talking laws to be so
entangled<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> whole<00:01:44.460> web<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> things<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
entangled in the whole web of things but

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.880 
entangled in the whole web of things but
hopefully<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> same<00:01:49.259> thing<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hopefully I can just do the same thing I

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.980 
hopefully I can just do the same thing I
did<00:01:49.950> on<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.149> acer<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.990> keyboard

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
you can just snap down on the top like

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.030 
you can just snap down on the top like
it's<00:03:03.660> open<00:03:03.840> right<00:03:04.170> now<00:03:04.200> and<00:03:04.620> then<00:03:04.800> you<00:03:04.890> can

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
it's open right now and then you can

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.500 
it's open right now and then you can
just<00:03:05.160> snap<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.489> down<00:03:05.790> once<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.209> connected

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
just snap it down once it's connected

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.590 
just snap it down once it's connected
and<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:08.160> should<00:03:08.430> work<00:03:08.670> if<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.180> doesn't<00:03:09.239> work

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
and it should work if it doesn't work

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.130 
and it should work if it doesn't work
then<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:10.049> goofed<00:03:10.350> up<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.799> I'm<00:03:10.890> sorry<00:03:11.160> apologize

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.259 
then I goofed up and I'm sorry apologize
so<00:03:13.140> just<00:03:13.560> snap<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.829> back<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.340> place<00:03:15.920> should<00:03:16.920> be

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
so just snap it back in place should be

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.819 
so just snap it back in place should be
good<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> go<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.230> put<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.500> screws

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
good to go and then just put the screws

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.350 
good to go and then just put the screws
on<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.250> back<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.230> hopefully<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.620> still<00:03:22.860> works

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
on the back and hopefully it still works

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.789 
on the back and hopefully it still works
