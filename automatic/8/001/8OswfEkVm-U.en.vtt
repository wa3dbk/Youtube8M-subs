00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.179
 the result is 30 ruby ​​won against the amkar 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:13.240
 vibro sweet Anton Kuzmin scored goals 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:16.940
 38 68 implanted for replacement and almost immediately 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.450
 17 strokes of a ruby ​​dealt the 10th card of them 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.180
 four 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.030
 Ruby on target means 3 were assists 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.360
 amkar replied with only two hits 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.370
 target ruby okay I commented 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.940
 brute force matches very organized 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.820
 Berdiyev 's team played well 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.230
 karm happened after so long 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.030
 the series let together eat deliciously and I would 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.910
 I did not wonder at this result 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.160
 just be a much more ruby conference 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.739
 redder the finest diamonds on the tube to 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.590
 much redder teams than you to frame 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.320
 call me very cool spent this 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.559
 championship segment squeezing out well 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 close to maxim if not max and here 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.809
 of course the right churches on but ruby ​​like 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.059
 since maxim did not reach it 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.000
 I will get a lot of due to different 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.030
 causes of injuries there 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.640
 injuries rondon can be match on two 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.479
 front somewhere lack of luck and so 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.229
 further incomprehensible situation within the team 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.140
 complex whole problem 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.150
 you ruby ​​just a team that is higher 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.530
 class than amkar viruses for matches from 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.570
 derby categories 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.910
 opposition Kazan on two fronts 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.040
 ruby for him can read tsanava on 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.900
 two gates of Europa League 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.729
 we chop an experienced team that you know 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.990
 you still see and it does not work 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.150
 story because if you take 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.040
 Rubies Krasnodar Kuban 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.590
 this story does not work yes that is not 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.540
 in a straight line for different examples that's all 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.490
 that the ruby ​​should play like this 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.979
 an explanation needs to be said only about ruby 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.430
 what comes back center form you came out 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.479
 and black loaded 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.479
 one more thing helped for 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.009
 Handon is not generally a golovaschenko for 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.140
 ruby for ruby ​​is very important and therefore 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.679
 that I would understand her except the last 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.929
 home match this year they all drives 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.000
 center 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.480
 they are extremely important to always finish 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.610
 season here I lead year to finish it 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.110
 okay victory surely eron don is back 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.530
 overall positive when teams 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.610
 finish the championship of the year is always 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.860
 great I think it is for and for 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.630
 future button trusting right now ryazan 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.400
 there was a farewell ceremony for sure 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.440
 leaves to score the last match 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.640
 home could not be killed kuzmin 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.560
 also better names here are still 30 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.630
 secretive and the broadcast fell apart who 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.989
 maybe watched or write somewhere 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.970
 that's what ruby ​​is fundamentally different 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.400
 football showed no focus on 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.530
 defense was not there 30 after all this for 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.570
 ruby is quite rare results can 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.430
 so play as if before there were more 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.560
 there are spectators in the stands how many up to 3000 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.209
 thousands of soldiers and to go all the same 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.650
 the next championship like me on it they 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.200
 will start at their new stadium 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.660
 next year paint la notte not 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.500
 cool stadium built specifically for 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.160
 Universiade 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.750
 and if the team will play like this 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.850
 shoot one in groups to 4 he won't but 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.190
 today they scored three calling 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.230
 we must keep going further 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.880
 proceeds ruby returns returns he 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.830
 while there is a little more here 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.480
 groups of teams fighting for 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.460
 Euro Cup permits but I think for 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.470
 Byrd was very important was this ending 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.350
 championship hold like that kick on with 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.300
 points with victories to calm 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.980
 work in the offseason to prepare a team 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.460
 championship renewal alexander 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.840
 Ryazan 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.840
 really did forgive
