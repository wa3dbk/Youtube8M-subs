special planned we have for you an
automatic<00:00:27.630> speed<00:00:28.590> comparison<00:00:29.310> test<00:00:29.660> just<00:00:30.660> not

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
automatic speed comparison test just not

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.510 
automatic speed comparison test just not
with<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.140> knife<00:00:31.349> yeah<00:00:31.740> sorry

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
with that knife yeah sorry

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.420 
with that knife yeah sorry
we've<00:00:33.120> got<00:00:33.270> 12<00:00:33.510> automatics<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.320> 800<00:00:35.040> tf's

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
we've got 12 automatics and 800 tf's

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.819 
we've got 12 automatics and 800 tf's
we're<00:00:35.940> gonna<00:00:36.059> fire<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.510> randomly<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.230> groups

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
we're gonna fire them randomly in groups

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.670 
we're gonna fire them randomly in groups
of<00:00:37.950> four<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.030> fast<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:39.620> now<00:00:40.620> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
of four and see how fast they go now we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.350 
of four and see how fast they go now we
recognize<00:00:41.190> our<00:00:41.489> test<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> not<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.270> be

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
recognize our test is not going to be

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.959 
recognize our test is not going to be
100%<00:00:43.110> accurate<00:00:43.590> as<00:00:44.100> each<00:00:44.520> knife<00:00:44.760> has<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
100% accurate as each knife has a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.970 
100% accurate as each knife has a
different<00:00:45.329> blade<00:00:45.480> length<00:00:45.809> blade<00:00:46.410> weight<00:00:46.739> as

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
different blade length blade weight as

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.440 
different blade length blade weight as
well<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.280> different<00:00:47.579> firing<00:00:47.760> mechanic

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
well as different firing mechanic

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
well as different firing mechanic
however<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.170> made<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> selection<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:50.129> knives

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
however we made a selection of knives

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.069 
however we made a selection of knives
that<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.579> similar<00:00:51.030> dimensions<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:51.899> it

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that have similar dimensions to make it

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.100 
that have similar dimensions to make it
a<00:00:52.260> reasonably<00:00:52.860> fair<00:00:53.129> comparison<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> way

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
a reasonably fair comparison so the way

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.270 
a reasonably fair comparison so the way
this<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.289> gonna<00:00:55.469> work<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this is gonna work is we're going to

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
this is gonna work is we're going to
shoot<00:00:56.460> each<00:00:56.730> knife<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.180> slow<00:00:57.449> motion<00:00:57.660> we're

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
shoot each knife in slow motion we're

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.349 
shoot each knife in slow motion we're
gonna<00:00:58.469> shoot<00:00:58.680> them<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:58.920> 480<00:00:59.760> frames<00:01:00.059> per

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
gonna shoot them at 480 frames per

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.029 
gonna shoot them at 480 frames per
second<00:01:00.750> we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> start<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> clock<00:01:01.800> as

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
second we're going to start the clock as

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.070 
second we're going to start the clock as
soon<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.460> visibly<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.390> blade<00:01:03.719> move

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
soon as we visibly see that blade move

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.780 
soon as we visibly see that blade move
and<00:01:04.619> we're<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.830> finish<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.430> when<00:01:05.580> it's

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and we're gonna finish it when it's

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.520 
and we're gonna finish it when it's
fully<00:01:06.000> deployed<00:01:06.390> we're<00:01:06.990> gonna<00:01:07.110> count<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
fully deployed we're gonna count the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.710
