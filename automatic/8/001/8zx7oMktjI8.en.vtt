00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
spinning for that and I love this game

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:42.569 
spinning for that and I love this game
because<00:00:40.870> there's<00:00:41.230> several<00:00:41.500> levels<00:00:41.860> to<00:00:42.250> it<00:00:42.399> so

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
because there's several levels to it so

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.010 
because there's several levels to it so
kids<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:42.940> different<00:00:42.969> ages<00:00:43.239> can<00:00:43.629> play<00:00:43.840> together

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
together because the three-year-old

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.459 
together because the three-year-old
might<00:00:48.370> only<00:00:48.610> look<00:00:49.000> four<00:00:49.390> colors<00:00:49.870> in<00:00:50.079> order

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
might only look four colors in order

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.350 
might only look four colors in order
whereas<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.399> five-year-old<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:52.149> going<00:00:52.300> to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
whereas the five-year-old is going to

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.910 
whereas the five-year-old is going to
have<00:00:52.450> a<00:00:52.510> more<00:00:52.629> challenging<00:00:52.899> task<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.739> pick

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
have a more challenging task to pick

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.080 
have a more challenging task to pick
cargo<00:00:54.399> by<00:00:54.969> number<00:00:55.570> shape<00:00:56.410> and<00:00:56.710> color<00:00:57.520> so

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
cargo by number shape and color so

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.240 
cargo by number shape and color so
there's<00:00:58.300> a<00:00:58.360> little<00:00:58.449> strategy<00:00:59.020> involved<00:00:59.320> so

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
there's a little strategy involved so

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
there's a little strategy involved so
you're<00:01:01.059> going<00:01:01.180> to<00:01:01.270> spin<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:02.140> spinner<00:01:02.199> ooh

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
you're going to spin the spinner ooh

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.730 
you're going to spin the spinner ooh
take<00:01:04.270> one<00:01:04.509> for<00:01:04.720> under<00:01:04.899> from<00:01:05.199> under<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.530> blue

take one for under from under the blue
box<00:01:05.920> cars<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.549> go<00:01:06.790> in<00:01:06.970> here<00:01:07.390> and<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.960> pick<00:01:08.200> out

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
box cars you go in here and you pick out

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.859 
box cars you go in here and you pick out
here<00:01:10.500> they're<00:01:11.500> both<00:01:11.590> yellows<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.820> we<00:01:13.420> have<00:01:13.720> to

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
here they're both yellows so we have to

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.109 
here they're both yellows so we have to
look<00:01:14.080> on<00:01:14.229> our<00:01:14.260> v<00:01:14.560> card<00:01:14.860> and<00:01:15.130> match<00:01:15.520> up<00:01:15.820> where

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
look on our v card and match up where

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.300 
look on our v card and match up where
the<00:01:16.270> yellow<00:01:16.570> goes<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:17.110> can<00:01:17.320> be<00:01:17.470> in<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.950> fourth

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
the yellow goes it can be in the fourth

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.700 
the yellow goes it can be in the fourth
or<00:01:18.610> fifth<00:01:19.060> place<00:01:19.390> on<00:01:19.799> our<00:01:20.880> train<00:01:21.880> so<00:01:22.600> we<00:01:22.930> learn

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
or fifth place on our train so we learn

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.399 
or fifth place on our train so we learn
order<00:01:24.400> we<00:01:24.580> learn<00:01:24.759> sequencing<00:01:25.570> it's<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.229> great

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
order we learn sequencing it's a great

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.760 
order we learn sequencing it's a great
game<00:01:26.770> while<00:01:27.549> you're<00:01:27.729> having<00:01:27.970> fun<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.450> learn

game while you're having fun to learn

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.200 
game while you're having fun to learn
pre-literacy<00:01:29.770> skills<00:01:29.939> preparing<00:01:30.939> kids<00:01:31.090> for

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
pre-literacy skills preparing kids for

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.840 
pre-literacy skills preparing kids for
reading<00:01:31.659> because<00:01:32.110> kids<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.770> learn<00:01:33.070> that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
reading because kids have to learn that

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.170 
reading because kids have to learn that
symbols<00:01:34.750> are<00:01:35.020> in<00:01:35.439> a<00:01:35.619> certain<00:01:35.890> order<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.700> our

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
symbols are in a certain order and our

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.899 
symbols are in a certain order and our
representational<00:01:38.110> for<00:01:38.470> reading<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.579> they

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
representational for reading so they

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.270 
representational for reading so they
match<00:01:40.270> in<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:41.380> game<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:42.009> learn<00:01:42.070> that

match in this game and learn that

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.830 
match in this game and learn that
there's<00:01:42.579> a<00:01:42.640> first<00:01:42.880> place<00:01:43.119> a<00:01:43.150> second<00:01:43.630> place<00:01:43.810> a

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
there's a first place a second place a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.230 
there's a first place a second place a
third<00:01:44.170> place<00:01:44.439> and<00:01:44.650> so<00:01:44.799> on<00:01:45.009> the<00:01:45.670> language<00:01:45.909> in

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
third place and so on the language in

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.639 
third place and so on the language in
this<00:01:46.390> game<00:01:46.600> is<00:01:46.750> wonderful<00:01:47.259> because<00:01:47.380> there's

this game is wonderful because there's
great<00:01:47.829> vocabulary<00:01:48.220> for<00:01:48.759> sequencing<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:50.110> can

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
great vocabulary for sequencing it can

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.520 
great vocabulary for sequencing it can
be<00:01:50.409> first<00:01:50.680> middle<00:01:51.250> last<00:01:52.140> beginning<00:01:53.140> middle

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
be first middle last beginning middle

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.950 
be first middle last beginning middle
and<00:01:53.680> end<00:01:53.890> oh<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.670> need<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.240> have<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.509> second

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
and end oh you need to have the second
