00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.170
 chapter 11 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.029
 then one was called a lazaro de betania 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.169
 Maria's village and Marta's sister 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.480
 Mary whose Lazarus brother was sick was the one who anointed the Lord with 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.720
 perfume of the juice the feet with their hair 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.689
 So the sisters sent to tell Jesus 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.689
 sr here is the one that hamas is sick 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.159
 hearing what Jesus said 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:27.359
 this disease is not for death 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.760
 but for the glory of God so that the son of God may be glorified by her 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 jesus called to marta his sister and lazaro 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.999
 when I was sick 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.190
 he stayed two more days in the place where he was 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.710
 then after this he said the disciples 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.900
 Let's go to Judea again 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.550
 the disciples told him 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.040
 rabbi now sought the Jews to stone t 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.830
 and again beyond 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.360
 Jesus answered 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.180
 does not have the day 12 hours 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.790
 He who walks by day does not stumble because he sees the light of this world 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.800
 but he who walks at night stumbles because there is no light in him 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.640
 said this he told them after 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.520
 Our friend Lázaro sleeps 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.600
 more I'm going to wake you up 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.030
 His disciples said then 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.430
 sir been hermes to nothing 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.160
 but Jesus said this about the death of Lazarus 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.490
 and they thought he was talking about the repose of the dream 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 then Jesus told them clearly lazaro has died 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.369
 and I'm happy for you not to have been there 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.760
 so you believe 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.560
 more let's go to him 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.469
 said then tomás called dídimo 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.100
 to his classmates 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 we also go so that we die with him 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.729
 Jesus came and there what Lazarus had been doing for four days 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.060
 tomb 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.790
 bethania was near jerusalem like atkins stadiums 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.080
 and many of the Jews had had marta called to comfort them for their 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.110
 brother 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.399
 then marten 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.310
 when I that jesus was coming 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.830
 he went out to meet him 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.380
 but Maria stayed home 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.170
 and marta said jesus 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.020
 Mr 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.450
 if you had been here 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.370
 my brother would not have died 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.469
 but also now that everything you ask God 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:11.859
 God will give it to you 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.119
 Jesus told him 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:14.999
 your brother will be resurrected 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:19.019
 marta told him I know he will be resurrected at the resurrection on the last day 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:20.959
 Jesus said to him 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.859
 I am the resurrection and the life that believes in me even though I am dead will live 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.579
 and everyone who lives and believes in me will not die eternally 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.609
 believe is this 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.060
 he said yes sir 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.629
 I have believed that you are the Christ the son of God that you have come to the world 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:43.739
 having said this it was and I love Maria her sister saying in secret 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.619
 the teacher is here and he wanted more 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:49.679
 when she heard it she got up quickly and said no to him 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:53.070
 Jesus had not yet entered the village 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.359
 but he was in the place where marta had found him 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.969
 then the Jews who were at home with her and comforted her when they saw 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.659
 that Maria had risen quickly had already left the followed saying 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.749
 go to the grave to cry there 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.779
 Mary when she got to Jesus when she saw him 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.929
 he fell at his feet saying 

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.120
 if you had been here 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.379
 my brother would not have died 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.709
 Jesus then to see her crying 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.620
 and the Jews who accompanied her also crying 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.919
 he shuddered in spirit and was moved and said 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.659
 where did you put him 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.189
 they said sr 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.709
 denis d 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.249
 jesus cried 

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.079
 said the Jews then 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.289
 Look how I loved him 

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:37.999
 and some of them said 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:42.179
 could not this one that opened the eyes of the blind man have also made lazaro 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:43.809
 I did not die 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.329
 Jesus deeply touched again he came to the grave 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.499
 It was a cave, and had a stone placed over 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:52.569
 said Jesus 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.179
 remove the stone 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.079
 Martha the sister of the one who had died said 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:00.079
 ladies of her because it's four days 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.779
 Jesus told him I did not tell you that if you believe the glory of God 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.859
 then they removed the stone from where it had been put to death 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.369
 and Jesus looking up said 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.139
 thank you I give you for having joined me 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.220
 I knew you always hear me but I said it because of the crowd that is 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.999
 around 

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:23.909
 so they believe that you sent me 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.710
 and having said this he cried out to the great 2 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.729
 Lazarus 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.370
 impunity 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.860
 and the one who had died came out tied with hands and feet with garments 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.219
 and the face wrapped in a shroud 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:37.569
 Jesus told them 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.800
 unleash him and let her go 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.290
 then many of the Jews who had had to accompany Maria 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.819
 and they gave what Jesus did they believed in him 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.080
 but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.439
 have done 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:57.889
 then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council and 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:58.650
 they said 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.669
 we want 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.009
 because this man does many signs 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.969
 if we let him like that, everyone would believe in him 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:08.809
 and the Romans will come and destroy our holy place and our nation 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.150
 then caliphs one of them 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.509
 high priest that year he told them 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:16.370
 you do not know anything 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.550
 not to think is that it suits us that a man dies for the people and not that all 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.529
 the nation grow 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.599
 this did not say it by itself 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.869
 but as he was the high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus had 

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:30.370
 to die for the nation 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.460
 and not only for the nation but also to gather 1 children 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.589
 of god that were scattered 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:37.509
 so 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:40.210
 since that day they agreed to kill him 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.080
 so 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.260
 Jesus was no longer openly among the Jews 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.710
 but he moved away from there to the region adjoining the desert to a city 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.710
 called ephraim and stayed there with his disciples 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.110
 and the Passover of the Jews was near 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.110
 and many had from that region to Jerusalem before Easter 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.599
 to purify 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.100
 and they were looking for Jesus 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.610
 and while they were in the temple they asked each other 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.029
 what do you think will not come to the party 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.969
 and the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:14.830
 Someone knew where he was 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.600
 manifest it so that it
