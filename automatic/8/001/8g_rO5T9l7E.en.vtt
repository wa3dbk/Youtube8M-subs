00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
tell this is obviously a lot more than

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.160

the two to three drops per section that
the<00:02:34.320> syringe<00:02:34.680> recommends<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.610> I'm<00:02:36.270> not

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the syringe recommends but I'm not

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.670 
the syringe recommends but I'm not
really<00:02:36.630> concerned<00:02:36.870> about<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.380> I'm<00:02:37.500> pretty

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
really concerned about that I'm pretty

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.190 
really concerned about that I'm pretty
experienced<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:39.180> applying<00:02:39.600> these<00:02:39.840> type<00:02:40.170> of

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
experienced and applying these type of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.820 
experienced and applying these type of
coatings<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:42.210> I<00:02:42.720> feel<00:02:43.380> pretty<00:02:43.620> comfortable

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
coatings so I feel pretty comfortable

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.850 
coatings so I feel pretty comfortable
doing<00:02:44.400> more<00:02:44.790> than<00:02:45.290> what<00:02:46.290> they<00:02:46.470> suggest<00:02:48.770> so<00:02:49.770> I'm

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
doing more than what they suggest so I'm

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.660 
doing more than what they suggest so I'm
going<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.040> use<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.370> same<00:02:50.640> pattern<00:02:51.500> go

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
going to use that same pattern go

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.870 
going to use that same pattern go
horizontal<00:02:53.670> or<00:02:54.240> go<00:02:54.660> vertical<00:02:55.140> first<00:02:55.410> and

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
horizontal or go vertical first and

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.350 
horizontal or go vertical first and
switch<00:02:58.160> as<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.220> can<00:02:59.520> tell<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.820> is<00:02:59.880> putting<00:03:00.270> a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
switch as you can tell this is putting a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.350 
switch as you can tell this is putting a
nice<00:03:00.570> thick<00:03:01.050> layer<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.550> product<00:03:02.940> down<00:03:03.150> on

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
nice thick layer of the product down on

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.450 
nice thick layer of the product down on
the<00:03:03.450> surface<00:03:05.240> and<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.650> can<00:03:07.650> tell<00:03:07.980> especially

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
the surface and you can tell especially

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.000 
the surface and you can tell especially
from<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:08.790> run<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:10.200> almost<00:03:10.470> immediately

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
from that run that it almost immediately

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.950 
from that run that it almost immediately
flashed<00:03:11.820> completely<00:03:12.480> clear<00:03:12.720> if<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.870> look

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960
