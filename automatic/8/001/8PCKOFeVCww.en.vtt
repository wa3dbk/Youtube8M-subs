00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
I'm going to go over the application on

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.410 
I'm going to go over the application on
this<00:00:25.170> other<00:00:25.439> eye<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.789> how<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> did

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
this other eye so you can see how I did

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900 
this other eye so you can see how I did
this<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.810> did<00:00:28.260> curl<00:00:28.859> my<00:00:29.099> lashes<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.789> bit

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
this I did curl my lashes a little bit

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.709 
this I did curl my lashes a little bit
my<00:00:30.029> my<00:00:30.330> life<00:00:30.480> was<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> real<00:00:31.050> real<00:00:31.260> straight<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
my my life was a real real straight and

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.110 
my my life was a real real straight and
this<00:00:33.719> one<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:33.989> did<00:00:34.260> with<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.440> base<00:00:35.280> coat<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.910> my

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
this one I did with a base coat of my

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.350 
this one I did with a base coat of my
regular<00:00:36.450> mascara<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> did<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:39.120> gel

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
regular mascara and then I did the gel

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.080 
regular mascara and then I did the gel
the<00:00:39.870> fiber<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> gel<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.610> always<00:00:41.940> want

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the fiber and the gel so you always want

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.549 
the fiber and the gel so you always want
to<00:00:42.120> remember<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.540> gel<00:00:43.020> if<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.230> were<00:00:43.350> gel

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
to remember that gel if I were gel

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.860 
to remember that gel if I were gel
because<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.250> gel<00:00:44.730> seals<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> fibers<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
because the gel seals the fibers on and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.690 
because the gel seals the fibers on and
the<00:00:46.350> TG<00:00:46.680> fibers<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.129> actually<00:00:47.160> different

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the TG fibers are actually different

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.880 
the TG fibers are actually different
lengths<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.899> gives<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> natural<00:00:49.559> appearance

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
lengths so it gives a natural appearance

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.799 
lengths so it gives a natural appearance
summer<00:00:50.250> short<00:00:50.489> summer<00:00:50.760> longer<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.360> they

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
summer short summer longer and they

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
summer short summer longer and they
attach<00:00:52.230> themselves<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.860> gel<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> then

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
attach themselves to the gel and then

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.569 
attach themselves to the gel and then
you<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.180> them<00:00:54.270> on<00:00:54.449> there<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.399> being

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
you see them on there so with that being

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.450 
you see them on there so with that being
said<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:57.420> gonna<00:00:57.570> try<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
said I'm gonna try on this I just the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
said I'm gonna try on this I just the
gel<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:01.579> regular<00:01:02.579> mascara<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.470> will

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
gel not with regular mascara so I will

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.820 
gel not with regular mascara so I will
probably<00:01:04.830> get<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.369> my<00:01:05.990> eyelid<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.229> usually

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
probably get it on my eyelid I usually

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
probably get it on my eyelid I usually
do<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.760> as<00:01:09.030> usually<00:01:09.570> right<00:01:09.840> there<00:01:11.930> so<00:01:12.930> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
do so as usually right there so I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.170 
do so as usually right there so I
usually<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.979> layer<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:16.939> to<00:01:17.939> my<00:01:18.180> desired

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
usually just layer this on to my desired

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
usually just layer this on to my desired
you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.299> look<00:01:21.600> some<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:22.320> very<00:01:22.500> dramatic<00:01:23.070> so

just want something wrong

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.950 
just want something wrong
natural-looking<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.360> don't<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> use

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
natural-looking you don't have to use

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.490 
natural-looking you don't have to use
the<00:01:28.049> fibers<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.979> use<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:30.119> gel

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.260 

it's<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.829> weird<00:01:34.979> doing<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
it's kind of weird doing this in a

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.109 
it's kind of weird doing this in a
camera<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.140> not<00:01:37.350> seeing<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.040> fine<00:01:38.610> details

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
camera and not seeing the fine details

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.620 
camera and not seeing the fine details
but<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.750> hope<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.040> job<00:01:41.100> okay<00:01:41.430> now<00:01:42.420> if

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
but I hope I do a good job okay now if

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.580 
but I hope I do a good job okay now if
you<00:01:42.810> want<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:44.520> length<00:01:44.930> mine<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:46.079> medium<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you want just length mine are medium to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.830 
you want just length mine are medium to
long<00:01:46.770> already<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.850> would<00:01:47.939> apply<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
long already you would apply just at the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.899 
long already you would apply just at the
tips<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.500> add<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> fibers<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.670> want

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
tips and add the fibers if you want

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.389 
tips and add the fibers if you want
volume<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.750> length<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> mid<00:01:53.369> to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
volume and length then do to the mid to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.450 
volume and length then do to the mid to
the<00:01:53.610> end<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.899> want<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:56.009> both

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
the end so I want a little bit of both

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
the end so I want a little bit of both
so<00:01:56.869> I'm<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.049> gonna<00:01:58.229> apply<00:01:58.710> these<00:01:58.829> fibers<00:02:02.990> as

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
so I'm just gonna apply these fibers as

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.160 
so I'm just gonna apply these fibers as
you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:04.820> it's<00:02:05.820> already<00:02:06.000> longer<00:02:06.360> okay

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you can see it's already longer okay

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:16.370 
you can see it's already longer okay
now<00:02:07.740> you're<00:02:08.069> gonna<00:02:08.160> seal<00:02:08.580> them<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.550> gel

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.990 

this<00:02:17.380> just<00:02:17.620> ensures<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.370> fibers<00:02:18.790> don't

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
this just ensures that the fibers don't

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.170 
this just ensures that the fibers don't
fall<00:02:19.300> on<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.740> your<00:02:20.830> cheeks<00:02:21.280> we<00:02:21.670> don't<00:02:21.880> want

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
fall on to your cheeks we don't want
