demo of touch ID for the iphone 5s so

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.160 
demo of touch ID for the iphone 5s so
we're<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.400> go<00:00:14.969> ahead<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.210> do<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.809> go<00:00:16.020> into

we're gonna go ahead and do is go into

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.560 
we're gonna go ahead and do is go into
passcode<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.710> fingerprint<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:18.330> we're<00:00:18.449> going

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
passcode and fingerprint and we're going

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.929 
passcode and fingerprint and we're going
to<00:00:18.630> enter<00:00:18.869> our<00:00:18.900> passcode<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.609> we've<00:00:20.760> got

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
to enter our passcode and here we've got

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.179 
to enter our passcode and here we've got
pretty<00:00:21.150> much<00:00:21.270> all<00:00:21.510> our<00:00:21.570> security<00:00:22.470> options<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
pretty much all our security options and

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.009 
pretty much all our security options and
all<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.510> go<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> into

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
all you got to do is go to into

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.170 
all you got to do is go to into
fingerprints<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.890> then<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.910> see

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
fingerprints and then here you can see

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.880 
fingerprints and then here you can see
that<00:00:27.359> we<00:00:27.449> can<00:00:27.630> unlock<00:00:27.960> our<00:00:28.109> phone<00:00:28.349> passcode

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
that we can unlock our phone passcode

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.339 
that we can unlock our phone passcode
unlock<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> fingerprint<00:00:30.179> sensor<00:00:30.349> built

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
unlock with the fingerprint sensor built

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.900 
unlock with the fingerprint sensor built
into<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> home<00:00:31.890> button<00:00:32.219> or<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.790> make

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
into the home button or we can make

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.540 
into the home button or we can make
iTunes<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.690> App<00:00:33.780> Store<00:00:34.050> purchases<00:00:34.370> which<00:00:35.370> is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
iTunes and App Store purchases which is

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.520 
iTunes and App Store purchases which is
really<00:00:35.760> cool<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.329> hope<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.600> they<00:00:36.870> expand

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
really cool but I hope that they expand

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
really cool but I hope that they expand
the<00:00:37.649> system<00:00:38.010> wide<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> can<00:00:39.480> enter<00:00:39.719> all

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the system wide so you can enter all

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
the system wide so you can enter all
your<00:00:40.079> passwords<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.620> stuff<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.010> that<00:00:41.219> with

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
your passwords and stuff like that with

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
your passwords and stuff like that with
the<00:00:41.910> fingerprint<00:00:42.360> sensor<00:00:42.510> but<00:00:42.989> hopefully

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the fingerprint sensor but hopefully

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.220 
the fingerprint sensor but hopefully
we'll<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.489> near<00:00:44.879> future<00:00:45.230> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
we'll see that in the near future so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.750 
we'll see that in the near future so
we're<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.620> ahead<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.950> do<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.610> my

get like the side of my finger and the
top<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> phone<00:01:20.070> can

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
top of it going so that the phone can

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.719 
top of it going so that the phone can
read<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.240> maybe<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> bottom<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:25.729> bam

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
read it maybe the bottom of it and bam

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.060 
read it maybe the bottom of it and bam
it's<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.330> success<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.530> we're<00:01:28.619> gonna<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.950> ahead
