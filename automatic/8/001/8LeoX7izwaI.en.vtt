thing so I thought I'd fire it up and
gave<00:01:02.649> you<00:01:02.769> guys<00:01:02.949> a<00:01:02.980> listen<00:01:03.460> to<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:04.059> noise<00:01:04.840> as

Idol

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.360 

yeah<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:33.880> kind<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:34.970> what<00:01:35.120> we're<00:01:35.270> up<00:01:35.300> against

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
yeah it's kind of what we're up against

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.670 
yeah it's kind of what we're up against
not<00:01:37.370> entirely<00:01:37.670> sure<00:01:37.850> what<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.210> noise<00:01:38.540> is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.380 

anything<00:01:42.680> inside<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.810> could<00:01:44.810> break

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
anything inside that could break

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.719 
anything inside that could break
probably<00:01:47.390> would<00:01:47.510> affect<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.460> running<00:01:49.460> of<00:01:49.550> the

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
probably would affect the running of the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:02:09.660 
probably would affect the running of the
engine<00:01:50.060> wouldn't<00:01:50.270> it

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:20.250
