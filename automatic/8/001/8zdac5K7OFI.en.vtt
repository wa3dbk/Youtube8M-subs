00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.030 
think it's really funny and
you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.619> Oscar<00:01:44.369> Wilde<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.829> haven't<00:01:46.829> read

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
you know Oscar Wilde so I haven't read

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
it'll be great to read more of his work

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.200 
it'll be great to read more of his work
