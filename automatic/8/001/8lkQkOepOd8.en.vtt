00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Fashion is a way of life for me 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.720
 fashion was fun it became 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.380
 that's what it was 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.790
 People bring clothes with the fun 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.049
 I express myself and also with it 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.780
 express how I feel 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.449
 of course you must also itself well 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.090
 I say that no fashion 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.570
 question of age is the target question where is 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.570
 actually fun 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.140
 I sometimes had to be a little bit braver 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.309
 and sometimes you try me too 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.230
 to make you more courageous 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 the consultation is above all service 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.719
 the right style for every customer 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.789
 find out the concert to hear me 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.500
 to put in the customer what he is dealing with 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.949
 I can tell the product water 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.629
 what does he want to do with it we want 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.530
 that he looks good we want him 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.050
 feels good 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.579
 even if honest as a friend 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.770
 practical to be ashamed to advise 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.750
 That's why I say fashion consultants 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.040
 then you feel at home then 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.040

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.719

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.399
 trends and also there will be shopping 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.670
 to really get the customers to the new 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.670
 offer 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.329
 up to date 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.489
 From my point of view, we form here 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.979
 an assortment of a brands structure 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.660
 from every german big city 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.790
 but could rather be us from 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.580
 our customer confirms that we are currently 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.590
 in terms of service 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.730
 have a completely different level here 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.530
 that the customer is still taken seriously 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.750
 that's why customers are not 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.070
 Rest on the road 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.870
 not so that you become a customer 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.960
 would care about the time has come 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.910
 not honest at 1000, we know 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.190
 Stop a little earlier than that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.290
 customer who tries that is good 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.650
 Advice that is the recommendation for one 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.710
 look good for good clothes and for 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.500
 a good composition stay there 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:46.570
 we are very well trained we can 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.840
 to respond to each customer individually 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.850
 because we know our goods very well 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.410
 that you buy your clothes here 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.760
 his bright sweater his pants 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.410
 but you just get more here 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.390
 I think I feel in with 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.250
 I feel comfortable in my clothes then 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.330
 in the restaurant well and after the meal 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.330
