j.crew<00:01:17.700> version<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.500> fact<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.950> has

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
j.crew version for the fact that it has

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.910 
j.crew version for the fact that it has
this<00:01:20.220> back<00:01:20.460> stitch<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:22.770> other

this back stitch going down the other

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.010 
this back stitch going down the other
thing<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> consider<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.180> color<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
thing to consider is this color of the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
thing to consider is this color of the
welt<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.590> j.crew<00:01:25.950> version<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> darker

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
welt the j.crew version has a darker

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
welt the j.crew version has a darker
well<00:01:27.360> which<00:01:27.630> was<00:01:27.869> right<00:01:28.080> here<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.470> part<00:01:28.799> here

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
well which was right here this part here

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.719 
well which was right here this part here
and<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:31.890> gives<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> better<00:01:32.579> look

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
and I think that gives it a better look

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
and I think that gives it a better look
also<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.869> see<00:01:34.020> my<00:01:34.140> prior<00:01:34.409> video<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.979> I'm
