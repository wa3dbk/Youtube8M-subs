shank size for example a 18 or six
millimeter<00:01:23.439> shank<00:01:23.799> requires<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.520> different

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
millimeter shank requires a different

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.779 
millimeter shank requires a different
amount<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.149> time<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.780> heat<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.229> cool<00:01:26.399> then<00:01:27.399> say

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
amount of time to heat and cool then say

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.580 
amount of time to heat and cool then say
and<00:01:28.060> one<00:01:28.450> inch<00:01:28.600> shank<00:01:28.899> or<00:01:29.110> inch<00:01:29.259> and<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.409> quarter

and one inch shank or inch and a quarter

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.770 
and one inch shank or inch and a quarter
shank<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.909> what<00:01:31.060> I'll<00:01:31.149> do<00:01:31.329> is<00:01:31.359> allow<00:01:31.719> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
shank so what I'll do is allow the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.450 
shank so what I'll do is allow the
machine<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.229> three<00:01:32.680> quarter<00:01:32.979> inch

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.730 

and<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.510> Machine<00:01:39.659> has<00:01:40.080> selected<00:01:40.530> nine

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
and the Machine has selected nine

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.320 
and the Machine has selected nine
seconds<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.430> amount<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.790> time<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:42.180> going

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
seconds is the amount of time it's going

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.990 
seconds is the amount of time it's going
to<00:01:42.390> take<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.470> eat<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.770> up<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.190> about<00:01:44.340> 350

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
to take to eat this up to about 350

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.390 
to take to eat this up to about 350
degrees<00:01:45.450> certainly<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.440> can<00:01:46.619> extract<00:01:47.159> this

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
degrees certainly I can extract this

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.550 
degrees certainly I can extract this
cutting<00:01:47.760> tool<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.930> next<00:01:49.140> thing<00:01:49.229> I'll<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.530> is

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
cutting tool the next thing I'll do is

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.810 
cutting tool the next thing I'll do is
bring<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.950> induction<00:01:50.400> hair<00:01:50.550> down<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.670> main

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
bring the induction hair down the main

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.980 
bring the induction hair down the main
thing<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> remember<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.659> bring<00:01:54.840> the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.510 
most heat applied to where the shank is
located<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.160> create<00:02:08.340> that

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
heat for this demonstration we've done

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.060 
heat for this demonstration we've done
many<00:03:36.720> times<00:03:37.049> when<00:03:37.290> we<00:03:37.380> knew<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.769> didn't

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
many times when we knew that we didn't

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.770 
many times when we knew that we didn't
need<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.609> extract<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.209> particular

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
need it to extract this particular

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.810 
need it to extract this particular
cutting<00:03:40.049> tool<00:03:40.260> however<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.160> best<00:03:41.280> practice

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
cutting tool however the best practice

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.479 
cutting tool however the best practice
is<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.060> select<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.989> certain<00:03:43.350> size<00:03:43.590> that

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
is to select the certain size that

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.070 
is to select the certain size that
matches<00:03:44.850> your<00:03:44.880> shank<00:03:45.180> size<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:47.370> mean

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
matches your shank size that mean

00:03:48.080 --> 00:04:08.820 
matches your shank size that mean
the<00:03:48.410> possible

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.170 

so<00:04:09.830> approximately<00:04:10.430> one<00:04:10.610> minute<00:04:10.760> we've<00:04:11.000> gone

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
so approximately one minute we've gone

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.540 
so approximately one minute we've gone
from<00:04:11.330> 350<00:04:12.110> degrees<00:04:12.440> to<00:04:12.650> room<00:04:12.860> temperature<00:04:13.220> and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
from 350 degrees to room temperature and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.520 
from 350 degrees to room temperature and
now<00:04:14.270> this<00:04:14.450> tool<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:14.720> ready<00:04:15.020> to<00:04:15.230> be<00:04:15.380> either

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
now this tool is ready to be either
