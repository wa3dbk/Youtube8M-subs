first day of games coro did you expect

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.420 
first day of games coro did you expect
to<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.880> well<00:00:18.779> against<00:00:19.230> c9<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:20.100> into<00:00:20.310> that

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
to do so well against c9 going into that

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
to do so well against c9 going into that
that<00:00:20.850> game<00:00:21.090> today<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.810> was<00:00:21.960> just<00:00:22.289> a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
that game today because it was just a

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.810 
that game today because it was just a
stomp<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:24.300> toyota<00:00:24.840> me<00:00:25.220> our<00:00:26.220> team<00:00:26.550> currently

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
stomp the toyota me our team currently

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.080 
stomp the toyota me our team currently
is<00:00:27.180> undefeated<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.859> figured<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.519> things

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
is undefeated so we figured that things

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.110 
is undefeated so we figured that things
will<00:00:30.420> go<00:00:30.630> smoothly<00:00:31.019> here<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:32.669> game<00:00:32.850> against

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
will go smoothly here the game against

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.229 
will go smoothly here the game against
c9<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:34.530> got<00:00:34.739> off<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.219> really<00:00:35.489> smooth<00:00:35.910> start

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
c9 we got off to a really smooth start

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.680 
c9 we got off to a really smooth start
so<00:00:37.050> i<00:00:37.079> think<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:38.010> helped<00:00:38.399> us

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
so i think that really helped us

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.920 
so i think that really helped us
dominate<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.020> game<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:41.129> did<00:00:41.780> this<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
dominate the game the way we did this is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.369 
dominate the game the way we did this is
the<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.500> time<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.860> your<00:00:44.579> team<00:00:44.850> has<00:00:44.879> played
