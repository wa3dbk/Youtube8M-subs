00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.879
 at the foot from the inside to the outside to the 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.639
 ball with the outside of another 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.980
 legs to take the ball sideways 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.259
 I know that and straight forward so go with 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.420
 bet that leg 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.719
 keep bob close to the foot and every pass 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.719
 hit the ball 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.450
 double scissors movement 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.420
 immediately used with the other leg 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.730
 rapid movement to the ball for a round 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.210
 use scissors with the strong and the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 weak bee 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 the ball with the inside of the foot in front 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.670
 along the inside of the other 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.640
 draw foot for along and not 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 drag the ball diagonally forwards 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.000
 don't tap and make a sideways pass 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.860
 to make the movement wide always after 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.970
 two signs straight ahead with inside and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.610
 outside foot 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.610
 motion inserts and exercising both legs 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.979
 to the inside by doing 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.960
 as if the ball was dragged along the front 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.920
 but take the source and the side with it 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.920
 the outside of the foot 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.590
 now the ball is over the foot of the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.390
 opponent reported by the ball a 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.720
 dragging a small piece 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.670
 the foot can get well under the ball 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.220
 also keep the ball close by and play 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.710
 not the nice outside 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.240
 first drag a bit for long then the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.360
 poll to the outside threaten to come along 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.369
 but take steps past the ball and 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.850
 the ball with the other leg outside 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.880
 foot 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:55.190
 also take a piece for long now 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.409
 drag and then move a pair of scissors 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.640
 to put the ball in the ball with the outside 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.539
 of the other leg 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.539
 take it sideways 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.030
 a body sham from a 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.740
 dribble 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.710
 pretend the ball with the outside of it 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.780
 the foot be truth is taken 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.410
 but for passing the ball and the ball 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.740
 further 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.560
 straight forward alternating with 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.210
 strong and weak leg dribbling 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.440
 move your body sideways well 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.440
 and bend at the knees 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.740
 also double run first with the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.420
 dribble leg and fast and with the other 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.420
 leg to step past the boat 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.110
 now the ball becomes sideways 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.190
 exercise with the outside of 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.770
 the other leg 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.120
 also taken sideways with both 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.650
 put your legs in 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.650
 and perform single and double 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.170
 the ball for the opponent at the 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.750
 stop or retrieve food 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.290
 step over the bellows and immediately with the 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.790
 food from the other when taking over 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.420
 the body must be between the ball and the 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.200
 opponent come both with the right and 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.200
 left turn 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.700
 hack the ball in front of the opponent with 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.950
 turn the inside of the foot and the ball 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.460
 with the outside foot of the other 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.220
 leg 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.870
 along the opponent with both 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.870
 make legs and cup move 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.180
 above and stationary beam the locomotive 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.330
 make movement by pretending the ball 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.950
 is retrieved with the base of the foot 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.950
 the nice straight with the instep straight 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.160
 taken forward and then the ball becomes 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.440
 really quiet and 2 bars and walked through 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.830
 after reversing the movement with the other 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.830
 to make a leg 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.700
 now with a rolling ball first the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.080
 ball with one tap and above the 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.620
 moving ball becomes the movement 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.620
 executed 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.250
 a switch from the inside to the outside 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.460
 make the ball and the trees the outside 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.460
 from the same leg sideways 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.550
 bright shorter step to put the ball down 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.680
 put and take the voucher 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.970
 after two signs straight ahead the movement 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.970
 bet with the other leg 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.240
 get the ball back with the food at an angle 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.970
 behind the standing leg play a 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.760
 tap on the outside with another foot and with 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.680
 that mine get the ball back 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.080
 pretend the ball is shot and 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.080
 recover explosive ball bottom foot 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.000
 fast moving straight ahead for passing by 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.580
 and stagger sideways 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.460
 the ball every pass with alternating inside 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.200
 and outside foot touch on the 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.170
 moving the front feet well through the 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.570
 knees bend in high motion 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.660
 pace double 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.830
 not moving fast but a lot 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.740
 ball contacts 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.350
 without ever moving forward quickly 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.810
 threaten to the sides 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.370
 first with the strong dribbling then 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.320
 with the weak bee 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.370
 and finally to 4 ball contacts 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.370
 changing legs 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.069
 appeared at high speed and 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.159
 passing movements one after the other in 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.590
 for example the damage put it 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.960
 wide draw to pass the ball 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.060
 steps and the switch 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.340
 practice the movements one after the other 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.009
 taking them as little as possible in between 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.159
 is dribbled the accent is on 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.050
 handling speed of course can also 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.520
 others seem to be passing movements 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.139
 used 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.520
 the movement and all must be reasonable 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.520
 be properly controlled
