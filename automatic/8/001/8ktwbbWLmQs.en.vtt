 communication to fix or rebuild 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.680
 what has been damaged and already reached 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.960

 the relationship with your partner

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.630
 a valid excuse if you kill someone and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.970
 it is not a valid excuse if it betrays 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.360

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.230
 I know I do not know who does not know how it happened that he 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.050
 we were just friends and from a moment to 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.740
 another one if you know how it happened you saw the tracks 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.420
 you saw the signs, you felt the doubts 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.850
 you ignored all those doubts you ignore 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.010
 the signs and you let yourself go 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.260
 you let your partner call and you started 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.810
 call another person you should have talked to 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.790
 the truth no matter how hard you should have been 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.770
 end your current relationship before 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.350
 open the door to another person and 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.470
 offer him a position that is busy 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.410
 as humans we make mistakes and that I 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.120
 I know but the mere idea that someone 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 who has betrayed his partner can 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.940
 wash your hands and blame your 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.240
 couple is a barbarity is a 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.910
 stupidity because you're never in your

 right to cheat how you're going to stop 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.480
