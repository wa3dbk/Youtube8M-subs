00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:11.409 
to say a study was conducted by the
vegetarian<00:06:10.580> Institute<00:06:10.939> of<00:06:11.030> higher<00:06:11.180> learning

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
vegetarian Institute of higher learning

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.499 
vegetarian Institute of higher learning
yes<00:06:11.990> that<00:06:12.229> is<00:06:12.319> a<00:06:12.349> real<00:06:12.439> place<00:06:13.389> it<00:06:14.389> was

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:14.509 
yes that is a real place it was

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:16.809 
yes that is a real place it was
conducted<00:06:14.659> in<00:06:14.960> the<00:06:15.020> late<00:06:15.199> 2008<00:06:16.069> where<00:06:16.669> they

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
conducted in the late 2008 where they

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:18.249 
conducted in the late 2008 where they
compared<00:06:17.240> 50<00:06:17.719> of<00:06:17.810> the<00:06:17.930> most<00:06:17.960> common

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259 
compared 50 of the most common

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.619 
compared 50 of the most common
vegetarian<00:06:19.159> diets<00:06:19.460> 50<00:06:20.120> of<00:06:20.210> the<00:06:20.300> most<00:06:20.330> common

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:20.629 
vegetarian diets 50 of the most common

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:23.019 
vegetarian diets 50 of the most common
omnivorous<00:06:21.349> diets<00:06:21.830> and<00:06:21.979> found<00:06:22.039> the

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
omnivorous diets and found the

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.240 
omnivorous diets and found the
vegetarian<00:06:23.629> diets<00:06:23.960> had<00:06:24.409> at<00:06:24.560> least<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:25.009> same

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
vegetarian diets had at least the same

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.350 
vegetarian diets had at least the same
amount<00:06:25.639> of<00:06:25.729> protein<00:06:25.969> as<00:06:26.419> the<00:06:27.319> omniverse<00:06:27.919> diets

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
amount of protein as the omniverse diets

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.809 
amount of protein as the omniverse diets
so<00:06:29.360> um<00:06:29.659> although<00:06:30.409> the<00:06:31.370> study<00:06:31.520> can't

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
so um although the study can't

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:35.649 
so um although the study can't
conclusively<00:06:32.270> say<00:06:33.099> that<00:06:34.099> a<00:06:34.400> vegetarian<00:06:35.060> diet

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:35.659 
conclusively say that a vegetarian diet

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.159 
conclusively say that a vegetarian diet
has<00:06:35.960> more<00:06:36.830> more<00:06:37.129> more<00:06:37.759> protein<00:06:38.360> than<00:06:38.389> members

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
has more more more protein than members

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.959 
has more more more protein than members
died<00:06:39.409> I<00:06:39.680> think<00:06:40.250> is<00:06:40.340> pretty<00:06:40.520> safe<00:06:40.729> to<00:06:40.789> assume

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:40.969 
died I think is pretty safe to assume

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.830 
died I think is pretty safe to assume
that<00:06:41.840> it<00:06:42.020> does<00:06:42.909> animal<00:06:43.909> meat<00:06:44.090> is<00:06:44.330> dangerous

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
that it does animal meat is dangerous

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.570 
that it does animal meat is dangerous
and<00:06:45.020> eating<00:06:45.560> excessive<00:06:46.039> amounts<00:06:46.370> of<00:06:46.430> animal

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.939 
and eating excessive amounts of animal
meat<00:06:46.909> and<00:06:47.330> have<00:06:47.419> negative<00:06:47.779> consequences<00:06:48.440> far
