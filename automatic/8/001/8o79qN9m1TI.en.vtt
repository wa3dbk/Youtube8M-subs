00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.420
 will return everyone and come to a new 

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:06.730
 video we have a warm rumor 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.470
 so to speak one of those that to me 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.000
 I like them so much I do not like rumors 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.190
 unfounded in nothing and this good one is 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.130
 unfounded something and it really me 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.610
 it draws attention not 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.270
 Let's see 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.820
 recently it seems that it has been 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.920
 fired an entertainer of gta 5 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.110
 and well your resume is in the network by 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.330
 so to say he did not bet the curriculum as 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.820
 who looks for work and such and does not appear 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.480
 surprise does not appear the surprise that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.129
 It says that in titles worked out 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.130
 grand theft auto 5 and it leaves neither more nor 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.020
 less than the departure date 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.900
 October 2012 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 first let's leave aside the why 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.770
 puts an exit date on a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.630
 curriculum I do not understand why not 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 I understand if it's for revenge I do not understand 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.370
 why he might do 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.510
 the seconds because I do not put it in the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 description as the description 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.480
 basically because there is very information 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.589
 personal I really put your mobile your 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 landline also your address all 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.050
 put this and your email and I do not want to be 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.440
 participant that people ask for things 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.390
 and you already understand me well 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.820
 I already know that when I can, I put the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 source and through I will not be able to be 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.130
 impossible because it is at 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.070
 seen this does not seem very legal to me 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.590
 let's say October 2012 first let's 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.240
 leave it because you put the date can 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.940
 be for revenge for thousands of reasons 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.580
 October 2012 to get it out I was 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.290
 saying yesterday what 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.620
 a good commercial strategy would be 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.810
 dry gta 52 after black ops 2 by 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.030
 what 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.000
 basically because people want 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.280
 prove what has already happened with 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.090
 battlefield that went ahead a month came out 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 in October and not that he did not write 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.600
 but neither little nor no sold it 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.090
 also expected a month before you know 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.640
 what happened sold less than modern 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.530
 warfare 3 modern warfare 3 and this is 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.030
 because I had basically the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.549
 people want to try the next call of 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.090
 duty not before the best the gta 5 or 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.220
 the game that comes out 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.860
 for me it really is a bad strategy 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.460
 commercial the good I already said take it out 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.680
 four or five months after d 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.910
 of call of duty because people will know 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.700
 case of Juan Calot useful and the great 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.310
 majority and gta 5 could double sales 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.050
 very easily we do not understand what 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.450
 it means a lot of people see porn 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.970
 Well, people who like 7 to 5 stone 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.490
 7 to 5 already but who many people who 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.830
 like 7 to 5 and who likes black ops and 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.870
 there are many people who like black ops 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.080
 for the zombies and 7 to 5 I do not think that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.430
 let's have zombies and the truth is there's a lot 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.799
 people that I tell you to choose 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.560
 these are going to decide and will go down 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.269
 price the gt to the people I know that I am 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.040
 who thinks well 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.200
 the vast majority I'm saying I 'm not 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.150
 doing neither all the Spaniards nor all 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.340
 they have them and all those I'm 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.799
 saying what the vast majority thinks and 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.079
 the truth I do not know what you think of this 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.530
 strategy if it's real that you get them 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.530
 October 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.400
 it can be good or bad 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.660
 can go very well they can leave very 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.900
 bad in case of health is very bad then 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.520
 to take for sack but I think that for the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.960
 name you have although you go out in October 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.210
 I think it would sell would not sell 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.610
 pretty at least 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.360
 three million copies maybe so 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.670
 would sell in 21 years and that I think that 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.470
 I would sell though that tourism 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.500
 generates double you know that sells 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.590
 quite sells pretty says the figures 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.090
 makes a previous video that talks about 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.570
 go up gta 5 and from the figures that 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.280
 sold each one and fuck in modern 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.110
 warfare that centuries doubled and was very 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.930
 impressive and yes who did not know 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.000
 and see what gta 4 for example the 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.610
 budget that they spent was 100 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.040
 million dollars I think remember is not 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.530
 little thing if with gta 5 by I guess 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.560
 that the thing will go around and I do not think that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.330
 if they want to risk taking it out on 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.010
 October a lot of good people can say 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.600
 think that taking them out before you can 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.370
 be a better strategy than taking it out 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.650
 then there are many people who want it 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.930
 before then not 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.690
 that you think the vast majority there is also 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.579
 People who want it before are already good 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.410
 nothing else this has been all we have in the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.900
 Next video to comment on what you think and 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.900
 nothing more no more in it until the next
