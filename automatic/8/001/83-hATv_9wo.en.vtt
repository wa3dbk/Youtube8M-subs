00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.469
 speak personal beauty guilherme and in the area 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.019
 with one more video and today I want to talk 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.759
 of informed century before year I have 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.039
 played it for a week or so 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.560
 so I decided to bring no gameplay now 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.470
 standard but rather a kind of say 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.539
 overview of what I think of the game 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.580
 of the then setback of a direct gameplay 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.710
 Just like the scene, I'm going to edit and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 put different parts of the game but only 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.669
 relax that I'll try to leave without 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.829
 spoiler the beauty video 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.110
 first if you do not know if you are 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.660
 of another planet is this is the third 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.420
 game series reported on senna in females 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.789
 that's where it was supposed to be one of the games 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 of Playstation 4 but the 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.860
 studio needed this extra time to 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.780
 make the game more perfect and watch them 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 They did a great job. 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.620
 when talking about new generation one of the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 aspects that come soon in the head by 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.570
 The least for me are the graphics, right ? 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 I can say then that the game does not 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.460
 disappoints in that question is that type 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.530
 game that you look at and really feel 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.570
 who is playing on Playstation 4 and not 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.150
 on Playstation 3 that would not be 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 possible in the past generation the details 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.299
 of the streets said that the city where 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.930
 pass the game right 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.360
 are astonishing the asphalt the buildings 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 the particles of smoke from rain to rain 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.479
 you're beautiful 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.720
 everything is very beautiful and you can stay 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.400
 impressed from start to finish 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.290
 this without counting the characters that 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.540
 they are also very well detailed both 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.030
 in what is said in game 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.829
 to complete the effects of the powers of the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.610
 protagonist who is dell yes are 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.920
 Surreal everything very well done even good 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.259
 since I told the protagonist how 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.360
 Talk about the story now, he's a guy. 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.119
 very cool of 24 years 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.189
 he enjoys pitching game and that is 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.930
 Kind of a joke all the time. 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.189
 well in the style of man torch spider 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.110
 human 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.810
 he gets his powers after 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.130
 an accident involving three other faces 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.290
 with superpowers 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.469
 from there he discovers that he has the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.229
 ability to absorb any kind of 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.360
 power with which it comes into contact 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.690
 At first he gets a little scared half 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.760
 but that is distrustful 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.220
 that it does not take long for him to start 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.020
 to use the powers without any problem by 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.540
 I would do it myself. 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.690
 only it obviously has to happen 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.060
 some problem and a villain appears in the case 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.790
 here is a super villain 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.520
 from there the game consists in searching 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.250
 this villain to be able to absorb his 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.720
 power and with that save the galera I will 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.910
 leave there not to give too many 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.010
 spoilers beauty one of the balconies as well 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.310
 The infamous franchise is the system 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.110
 of karma or choices let us say to the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.380
 Throughout history you 'll be taking 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.600
 decisions that go from good to you 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.150
 You'll see a real bad guy. 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.760
 and these decisions clearly not affecting the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.160
 history until its end and even the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.410
 type of powers that dell uses 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.740
 same skill as fire for 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.630
 example can have different effects 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.030
 depending on your karma this aspect 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.640
 ends up bringing I think the game a 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.560
 even longer because 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.600
 several moments of the will to follow 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.190
 the other way just to see which 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.709
 would be the consequences then you can 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.720
 come back and play the whole game again going 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.630
 on the evil side the good side 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.550
 rather than your previous choice in 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.530
 terms of gameplay as well 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.150
 do not disappoint obvious 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.430
 besides being very fun to use 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.350
 dell powers if you still have the use of 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.750
 control tank for example 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.630
 open a door or even place the 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.070
 digital scanner and also the control in 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.470
 foot like a spray can 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.180
 you still hear the noise that 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.040
 inside the can connected to the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.530
 creativity so it shows that the 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.410
 really want to use the 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.970
 Playstation 4 news in your favor 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.130
 to complete you can play 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.150
 informed the Holy Ages totally in 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.340
 Portuguese 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.720
 only you change the system language of the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.760
 your playstation 4 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.070
 in my case the game in English as you 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.140
 You see but the dubbing is very 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.030
 good one of the best sony ever made 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.640
 until today because I watch some 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.320
 videos of the game in Portuguese also 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.330
 This was the video they are talking about. 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.049
 informed that the condition I will not be the 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.790
 still play 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.470

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.479
 little more about him about what I 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.669
 I found the end of the game but so far I 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.960
 I think he's sensational and sure 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.580

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.080
