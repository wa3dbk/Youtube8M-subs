keep the calories keep the energy really

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.119 
keep the calories keep the energy really
close<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> muscle<00:00:43.500> where<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:43.920> used

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
close to the muscle where it can be used

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.279 
close to the muscle where it can be used
all<00:00:44.340> day<00:00:44.520> then<00:00:45.149> around<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> year<00:00:45.570> 1600<00:00:45.899> when

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
all day then around the year 1600 when

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.990 
all day then around the year 1600 when
Westerners<00:00:46.829> first<00:00:47.070> started<00:00:47.370> coming<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> Japan

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
Westerners first started coming to Japan

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.270 
Westerners first started coming to Japan
through<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> port<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> kobane<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.950> started

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
through the port of kobane they started

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.340 
through the port of kobane they started
to<00:00:50.370> consume<00:00:50.730> their<00:00:50.969> beef<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:52.110> first

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
to consume their beef and they first

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709 
to consume their beef and they first
realized<00:00:52.590> how<00:00:52.980> special<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.579> was<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.600> that's

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
realized how special it was so that's

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.290 
realized how special it was so that's
why<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.559> term<00:00:56.160> Kobe<00:00:56.610> has<00:00:56.730> become<00:00:57.059> synonymous

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
why the term Kobe has become synonymous

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.450 
why the term Kobe has become synonymous
with<00:00:58.550> with<00:00:59.550> Wagyu<00:01:00.000> there's<00:01:00.690> other<00:01:01.440> Wagyu<00:01:02.219> on

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
with with Wagyu there's other Wagyu on

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.979 
with with Wagyu there's other Wagyu on
par<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:03.090> Kobe

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
par with Kobe

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.130 
par with Kobe
this<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:05.129> same<00:01:05.430> grading<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.750> would<00:01:06.930> be

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
this is the same grading this would be

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.620 
this is the same grading this would be
so<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> five<00:01:08.100> refers<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.060> size<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.900 
assaults gonna pull the moisture out and
that's<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.900> gonna<00:01:55.080> cause<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:56.160> nice<00:01:56.430> crispy

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
that's just gonna cause a nice crispy

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.120 
that's just gonna cause a nice crispy
nest<00:01:57.120> when<00:01:57.300> its<00:01:57.450> ears

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.789 

so<00:02:01.610> this<00:02:01.760> is<00:02:01.850> only<00:02:01.939> think<00:02:02.150> about<00:02:02.710> three<00:02:03.710> to

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
so this is only think about three to

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.039 
so this is only think about three to
four<00:02:03.950> minutes<00:02:04.159> two<00:02:05.150> minutes<00:02:05.420> on<00:02:05.509> each<00:02:05.540> side<00:02:05.659> to

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
four minutes two minutes on each side to

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.529 
four minutes two minutes on each side to
cook

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.929 

what<00:02:11.200> Bobby<00:02:11.590> doesn't<00:02:11.860> cook<00:02:12.280> so<00:02:12.489> well<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:12.849> the

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
what Bobby doesn't cook so well on the

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.030 
what Bobby doesn't cook so well on the
grill<00:02:13.180> because<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.659> fat<00:02:13.930> will<00:02:14.349> fall<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.799> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
grill because the fat will fall in and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.800 
grill because the fat will fall in and
cost<00:02:15.250> flare-ups<00:02:15.819> so<00:02:16.239> it's<00:02:16.390> really<00:02:16.510> hard<00:02:16.750> to

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
cost flare-ups so it's really hard to

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.720 
cost flare-ups so it's really hard to
control<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.260> heat<00:02:17.469> I<00:02:17.709> suggest<00:02:18.189> using<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.489> cast

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
control the heat I suggest using a cast

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.089 
control the heat I suggest using a cast
iron<00:02:18.939> pan<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.689> either<00:02:20.260> cook<00:02:20.409> entirely<00:02:20.890> in

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
iron pan you can either cook entirely in

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.970 
iron pan you can either cook entirely in
a<00:02:21.129> cast<00:02:21.370> iron<00:02:21.489> pan<00:02:21.790> or<00:02:22.359> move<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.379> then<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.769> an

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
a cast iron pan or move it then to an

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.449 
a cast iron pan or move it then to an
oven<00:02:24.930> started<00:02:25.930> sear<00:02:26.469> the<00:02:26.620> meat<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
oven started sear the meat and the

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.979 
oven started sear the meat and the
Catherine<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.060> then<00:02:28.269> move<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.569> an<00:02:28.750> oven

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
Catherine and then move it to an oven

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.250 
Catherine and then move it to an oven
and<00:02:29.230> finish<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.620> under<00:02:29.859> boiling
