pocket one hand out here and the pole
plants<00:00:17.789> go<00:00:17.940> like<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.359> then<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.350> face<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
plants go like this then we face the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800 
plants go like this then we face the
downhill<00:00:20.189> side<00:00:20.400> there's<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> lot<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.510> stuff

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
downhill side there's a lot of stuff

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.900 
downhill side there's a lot of stuff
there<00:00:22.050> that's<00:00:22.350> totally<00:00:22.769> unnecessary<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
there that's totally unnecessary and

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.910 
there that's totally unnecessary and
when<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.180> move<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.539> hands<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.439> moves<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
when you move the hands it moves the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
when you move the hands it moves the
body<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.550> whack<00:00:26.880> quite<00:00:27.330> often<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:27.960> want

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
body out of whack quite often so we want

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.380 
body out of whack quite often so we want
the<00:00:28.260> hands<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:28.769> very<00:00:29.039> very<00:00:29.220> quiet<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.760> the

I'm<00:00:48.570> not<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.050> rigid<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.800> but

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
I'm not going to be rigid this way but

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
I'm not going to be rigid this way but
this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> general<00:00:50.850> area<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.989> reason

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this is the general area and the reason

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
this is the general area and the reason
that<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.800> general<00:00:53.129> area<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:53.760> that<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.120> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
that is the general area is that this is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
that is the general area is that this is
neutral<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.170> as<00:00:55.289> far<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.649> move<00:00:55.770> my<00:00:55.949> hand

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
neutral it's just as far to move my hand

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
neutral it's just as far to move my hand
out<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.210> as<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> way<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
out all the way as in all the way so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
out all the way as in all the way so
it's<00:00:59.010> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.340> halfway<00:00:59.820> between<00:01:00.030> everywhere

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
it's kind of halfway between everywhere

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
it's kind of halfway between everywhere
this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.410> where<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> carry<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.219> hands<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this is where I carry my hands and

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.990 
this is where I carry my hands and
what's<00:01:03.629> important<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> maintain<00:01:05.610> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
what's important is to maintain that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
what's important is to maintain that
relationship<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> hands<00:01:07.619> have<00:01:07.830> with

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
relationship that the hands have with

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.429 
relationship that the hands have with
the<00:01:08.250> torso<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.420> uphill<00:01:09.630> side<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the torso on the uphill side on the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.980 
the torso on the uphill side on the
downhill<00:01:10.890> side<00:01:10.920> both<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.600> don't

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
downhill side both because if I don't

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020 
downhill side both because if I don't
what<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> indicates<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.400> I'm<00:01:14.549> turning<00:01:14.909> with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
what that indicates is I'm turning with

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.969 
what that indicates is I'm turning with
my<00:01:15.180> hands<00:01:15.420> instead<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.049> legs<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.740> hand

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
my hands instead of my legs if this hand

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
my hands instead of my legs if this hand
start<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.460> come<00:01:17.670> across<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.570> means<00:01:18.810> I'm

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
start to come across that means I'm

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
start to come across that means I'm
turning<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.710> body<00:01:19.979> rather<00:01:20.610> than<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
turning with the body rather than the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.570 
turning with the body rather than the
feet<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.049> hand<00:01:22.290> comes<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.369> may<00:01:23.520> be

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
feet if this hand comes back it may be

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
feet if this hand comes back it may be

what I want to do is move my hands
forward<00:01:38.549> without<00:01:38.970> unbending<00:01:39.750> my<00:01:39.930> elbows<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
forward without unbending my elbows the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.340 
forward without unbending my elbows the
only<00:01:40.710> way<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.850> from<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> ankles

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
only way to do that is from the ankles

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.080 
only way to do that is from the ankles
so<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.790> front<00:01:44.909> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
so that I can get out there in front of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.060 
so that I can get out there in front of
the<00:01:45.149> boots<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> hands<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.680> pull

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the boots right and the hands can pull

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.359 
the boots right and the hands can pull
me<00:01:47.220> into<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.460> turn<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.659> quiet

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
me into the turn this way so quiet

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.069 
me into the turn this way so quiet
neutral<00:01:50.369> hands<00:01:50.909> are<00:01:51.180> really<00:01:51.329> important<00:01:51.930> and

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
neutral hands are really important and

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.530 
neutral hands are really important and
that<00:01:52.140> extends<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> pole<00:01:53.220> plant<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.759> most

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
that extends to the pole plant to most

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.359 
that extends to the pole plant to most
the<00:01:54.720> time<00:01:54.990> people<00:01:55.290> say<00:01:55.530> ok<00:01:55.740> I've<00:01:55.829> got<00:01:55.950> my<00:01:55.979> hands

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the time people say ok I've got my hands

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.429 
the time people say ok I've got my hands
right<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.939> elbows<00:01:57.270> bending<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
right my elbows bending then all of a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.719 
right my elbows bending then all of a
sudden<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> pole<00:01:59.250> plant<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.640> they

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
sudden they make a pole plant and they

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459 
sudden they make a pole plant and they
raise<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.149> they<00:02:00.329> twist<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.810> they<00:02:00.960> point<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
raise it they twist it they point it

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.859 
raise it they twist it they point it
they<00:02:01.829> aim<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.310> or<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.820> swing<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.329> out<00:02:03.509> here

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
they aim it or they swing it out here

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.350 
they aim it or they swing it out here
and<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.530> pole<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.700> you're<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.270> all

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
and the pole is if you're for all

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.969 
and the pole is if you're for all
intents<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.869> purposes<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.500> pole<00:02:07.680> plant

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
intents and purposes the pole plant

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.010 
intents and purposes the pole plant
should<00:02:08.220> come<00:02:08.429> only<00:02:08.729> from<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.300> wrists<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.869> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
should come only from the wrists all I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.500 
should come only from the wrists all I
have<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:11.009> release<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.030> kind<00:02:12.390> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
have to do is release it and kind of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.940 
have to do is release it and kind of
 my<00:02:13.200> wrists<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.620> way

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
 my wrists this way

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.220 
 my wrists this way
and<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.550> will<00:02:14.730> put<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.060> pole<00:02:15.270> exactly<00:02:15.599> where

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
and that will put the pole exactly where

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.809 
and that will put the pole exactly where
it<00:02:16.319> needs<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.650> go<00:02:16.770> I<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.069> have<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.520> reach<00:02:17.790> for

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
it needs to go I don't have to reach for

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.120 
it needs to go I don't have to reach for
it<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:18.360> have<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.690> go<00:02:18.720> anywhere<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.770> don't

it or have to go anywhere for it I don't

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.949 
it or have to go anywhere for it I don't
have<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.370> twist<00:02:20.580> my<00:02:20.910> hand<00:02:21.120> out<00:02:21.330> or<00:02:21.510> twist<00:02:21.780> my

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
have to twist my hand out or twist my

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.770 
have to twist my hand out or twist my
hand<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.250> simple<00:02:23.730> movement<00:02:24.450> of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
hand in it's just a simple movement of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.110 
hand in it's just a simple movement of
the<00:02:24.900> wrist<00:02:25.140> puts<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.890> pole<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.459> for<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> touch

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
the wrist puts the pole in for a touch

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.760 
the wrist puts the pole in for a touch
of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.510> snow<00:02:27.690> it's<00:02:27.930> not<00:02:28.050> really<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.349> plant

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
of the snow it's not really a plant

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.620 
of the snow it's not really a plant
anymore<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.640> used<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.910> be<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.540> just

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
anymore like it used to be it's just

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.229 
anymore like it used to be it's just
touching<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.319> snow<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.430> will<00:02:32.730> help

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
touching the snow and that will help

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.809 
touching the snow and that will help
trigger<00:02:34.080> my<00:02:34.350> turn<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:34.830> mostly<00:02:35.520> it'll<00:02:35.640> help

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
trigger my turn but mostly it'll help

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.809 
trigger my turn but mostly it'll help
stabilize<00:02:36.569> my<00:02:36.840> torso<00:02:37.200> as<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:38.040> tip<00:02:38.340> over<00:02:38.730> and

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
stabilize my torso as I tip over and

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.059 
stabilize my torso as I tip over and
change<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.360> edges<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> pole<00:02:40.620> work<00:02:40.860> is

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
change the edges so a pole work is

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.970 
change the edges so a pole work is
really<00:02:41.220> worth<00:02:41.580> working<00:02:42.209> on<00:02:42.690> ski<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.500> on<00:02:43.650> very

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
really worth working on ski it on very

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.240 
really worth working on ski it on very
very<00:02:44.069> green<00:02:44.700> terrain<00:02:45.180> ski<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:46.140> lot<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.980> turns

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
very green terrain ski a lot of turns

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.610

but<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.299> other<00:03:15.450> important<00:03:16.110> thing<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.709> other

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
but the other important thing the other

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.550 
but the other important thing the other
important<00:03:17.310> thing<00:03:17.459> about<00:03:17.489> pole<00:03:18.090> timing<00:03:18.870> is<00:03:19.260> not

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
important thing about pole timing is not

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.740 
important thing about pole timing is not
so<00:03:19.799> much<00:03:19.950> when<00:03:20.220> it<00:03:20.250> touches<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.970> snow<00:03:21.209> but

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
so much when it touches the snow but

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.500 
so much when it touches the snow but
when<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.079> start<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.530> swing<00:03:22.799> forward<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.549> what

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
when you start to swing forward and what

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.170 
when you start to swing forward and what
happens<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.200> people<00:03:25.290> make<00:03:25.859> the<00:03:26.100> turn<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.760> then

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
happens is people make the turn and then

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.340 
happens is people make the turn and then
they<00:03:27.299> say<00:03:27.450> oh<00:03:27.480> gosh<00:03:27.810> I've<00:03:28.019> got<00:03:28.049> to<00:03:28.260> make

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
they say oh gosh I've got to make

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.110 
they say oh gosh I've got to make
another<00:03:28.650> turn<00:03:28.769> so<00:03:29.190> they<00:03:29.340> decide<00:03:29.970> they're

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
another turn so they decide they're

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.550 
another turn so they decide they're
going<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.299> make<00:03:30.450> another<00:03:30.750> turn<00:03:30.989> they<00:03:31.200> look<00:03:31.410> at

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
going to make another turn they look at

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.349 
going to make another turn they look at
the<00:03:31.680> place<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.130> then<00:03:32.549> they<00:03:32.730> start<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.120> swing

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
the place and then they start to swing

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.599 
the place and then they start to swing
the<00:03:33.540> pole<00:03:33.750> forward<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.350> that<00:03:34.829> pole<00:03:35.130> forward

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
the pole forward and that pole forward

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.400 
the pole forward and that pole forward
swing<00:03:35.910> takes<00:03:36.180> about<00:03:36.359> eight<00:03:36.720> feet<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.260> by<00:03:37.350> the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
swing takes about eight feet and by the

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.750 
swing takes about eight feet and by the
time<00:03:37.680> all<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.160> done<00:03:38.340> they're<00:03:38.549> in<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
