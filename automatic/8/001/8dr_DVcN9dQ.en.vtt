he<00:00:36.149> has<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> little<00:00:36.420> number<00:00:36.660> for<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.559> stripe<00:00:37.890> he

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
he has a little number for the stripe he

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.010 
he has a little number for the stripe he
actually<00:00:38.670> had<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> thing<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.239> said<00:00:39.510> jazz<00:00:39.750> here

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
actually had a thing that said jazz here

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
actually had a thing that said jazz here
but<00:00:40.200> when<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.469> bought<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.040> guy<00:00:41.070> removed<00:00:41.910> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
but when we bought it the guy removed it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.229 
but when we bought it the guy removed it
so<00:00:43.579> as<00:00:44.579> he<00:00:44.700> thought<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> made<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.210> look

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so as he thought it made it look

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.670 
so as he thought it made it look
cluttered<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.960> actually<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.500> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
