00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
of cool but it's not leaps and bounds

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.810

better<00:01:57.180> than<00:01:57.390> IE<00:01:57.570> 9<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.220> one<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.670> home

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
better than IE 9 so that is one is home

better than IE 9 so that is one is home
central<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.360> upper<00:02:01.049> 10<00:02:01.260> which<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.130> kind<00:02:02.520> of

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
central on upper 10 which is kind of

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.100 
central on upper 10 which is kind of
neat<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.880> does<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.150> the<00:02:03.240> turbo<00:02:03.540> mode<00:02:03.720> which<00:02:03.930> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
neat it does have the turbo mode which I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.410 
neat it does have the turbo mode which I
suppose<00:02:04.590> helps<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.950> little<00:02:05.159> bit<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.760> there<00:02:06.270> are

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
suppose helps a little bit so there are

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.399 
suppose helps a little bit so there are
some<00:02:06.540> other<00:02:06.659> cool<00:02:06.870> things<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.260> including

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
USB video out which is neat now none of

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.110 
USB video out which is neat now none of
this<00:02:10.530> though<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.920> seven<00:02:11.250> point<00:02:11.459> eight<00:02:11.700> right

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
this though is seven point eight right

so if you're wondering what since
0.8<00:02:14.120> once<00:02:15.050> again<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:16.190> start

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
0.8 once again it is just the start

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.220 
0.8 once again it is just the start
screen<00:02:16.580> as<00:02:16.880> right<00:02:17.300> now<00:02:17.510> maybe<00:02:17.930> there's<00:02:18.170> more

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
screen as right now maybe there's more

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.410 
screen as right now maybe there's more
later<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:19.130> as<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.850> seven<00:02:20.210> point

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
later but as of now it's seven point

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
eight is just start screen which isn't

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.340 
eight is just start screen which isn't
the<00:02:22.880> most<00:02:23.030> exciting<00:02:23.480> thing<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> world<00:02:23.960> but

gutter<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.690> right<00:02:59.900> but<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.710> kind<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:00.920> a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
gutter to the right but it's kind of a

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.260 
gutter to the right but it's kind of a
neat<00:03:01.130> experience<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.670> like<00:03:01.790> me<00:03:01.910> able<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> shrink

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
neat experience I like me able to shrink

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.000 
neat experience I like me able to shrink
these<00:03:02.450> tiles<00:03:02.690> down<00:03:02.930> big<00:03:03.170> time<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.560> does<00:03:03.710> make

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
these tiles down big time it does make

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.760 
these tiles down big time it does make
organization<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.910> think<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.240> lot<00:03:05.480> easier<00:03:05.990> but

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
organization I think a lot easier but

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.760 
organization I think a lot easier but
you<00:03:07.100> know<00:03:07.220> is<00:03:07.460> it<00:03:07.970> worth<00:03:08.180> hard<00:03:08.840> flashing<00:03:09.650> your
