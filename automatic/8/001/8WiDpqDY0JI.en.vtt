to be doing is just covering some of the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.900 
to be doing is just covering some of the
more<00:00:21.900> basic<00:00:22.769> things<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.519> physical

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
more basic things with just the physical

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.210 
more basic things with just the physical
side<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.359> Windows<00:00:24.750> 7<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.039> mouse

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
side of Windows 7 just with the mouse

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.500 
side of Windows 7 just with the mouse
and<00:00:26.400> stuff<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.880> later<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.210> we're<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and stuff that later on we're going to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210 
and stuff that later on we're going to
be<00:00:27.599> switching<00:00:27.689> over<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> keyboard<00:00:28.680> shortcuts

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
be switching over to keyboard shortcuts

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.220 
be switching over to keyboard shortcuts
which<00:00:29.400> could<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.390> considered<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.990> more

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
which could be considered a more

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.179 
which could be considered a more
complicated<00:00:31.830> thing

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
complicated thing

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.979 
complicated thing
just<00:00:32.759> since<00:00:32.969> there's<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.329> many<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.690> them<00:00:33.809> but

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
just since there's so many of them but

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.030 
just since there's so many of them but
what<00:00:34.170> we're<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.590> doing<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> just

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
what we're going to be doing is just

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.500 
what we're going to be doing is just
covering<00:00:35.340> just<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> basic<00:00:36.480> ones

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
covering just some of the basic ones

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.319 
covering just some of the basic ones
that<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.559> guys<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:37.890> need<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.190> know<00:00:38.370> ok<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that you guys will need to know ok so

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.910 
that you guys will need to know ok so
let's<00:00:39.540> pretend<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:39.989> were<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.230> teacher<00:00:40.590> or

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
let's pretend we were a teacher or

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.200 
let's pretend we were a teacher or
student<00:00:41.340> or<00:00:41.370> someone<00:00:41.730> trying<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> copy

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
student or someone trying to copy

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.389 
student or someone trying to copy
information<00:00:42.480> from<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.350> application<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
information from one application to the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
information from one application to the
other<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.300> let's<00:00:45.450> say<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:45.660> had<00:00:45.809> Internet

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
other so let's say we had Internet

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.830 
other so let's say we had Internet
Explorer<00:00:46.620> open<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.250> notepad<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.719> going

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
Explorer open and notepad you're going

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720 
Explorer open and notepad you're going
to<00:00:48.899> notice<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.129> programs<00:00:50.550> here

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
to notice that we have two programs here

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.340 
to notice that we have two programs here
but<00:00:50.910> they're<00:00:51.030> inter<00:00:51.270> lapping<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.110> could

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
but they're inter lapping and we could

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
but they're inter lapping and we could
resize<00:00:52.860> them<00:00:53.129> by<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.430> dragging<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:53.969> all

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
resize them by like dragging them all

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.150 
resize them by like dragging them all
around<00:00:54.260> just<00:00:55.260> like<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.440> but<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:55.890> takes<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
around just like that but that takes a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
around just like that but that takes a
long<00:00:56.370> time<00:00:56.399> with<00:00:56.850> Windows<00:00:57.390> 7<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.870> actually

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
long time with Windows 7 we can actually

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
long time with Windows 7 we can actually
just<00:00:58.260> take<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.620> top<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> application<00:00:59.160> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
just take the top of the application and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
just take the top of the application and
drag<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.539> over<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> left<00:01:01.109> side<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.620> it'll

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
drag it over to the left side and it'll

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.529 
drag it over to the left side and it'll
automatically<00:01:02.280> make<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.820> full-size<00:01:03.239> and

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
automatically make it full-size and

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
automatically make it full-size and
split<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.229> halfway<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.619> between<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.339> screen

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
split it halfway in between the screen

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.250 
split it halfway in between the screen
and<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.390> take<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> other<00:01:06.720> application

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and we can take the other application

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.780 
and we can take the other application
and<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> exact<00:01:08.040> same<00:01:08.250> thing<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.640> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
and do the exact same thing on the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
and do the exact same thing on the
opposite<00:01:09.180> side<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.439> also<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
opposite side we can also take the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.260 
opposite side we can also take the
application<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> put<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.850> top<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.090> the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
application and put it at the top of the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.020 
application and put it at the top of the
screen<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:13.020> make<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.170> full-size

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
screen and this will make it full-size

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.270 
screen and this will make it full-size
let's<00:01:15.030> say<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.299> also<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.470> notepad<00:01:16.979> just

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
let's say we also just want notepad just

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.130 
let's say we also just want notepad just
there<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.820> let's<00:01:18.000> say<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.210> have<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.570> open<00:01:18.990> just

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
there so let's say we have to open just

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.109 
there so let's say we have to open just
like<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.100> want<00:01:20.250> notepad<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.909> don't

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
like this and we want notepad we don't

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
like this and we want notepad we don't
want<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.299> other<00:01:21.390> one<00:01:21.540> open<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.200> want<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.409> one

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
want the other one open we want this one

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.109 
want the other one open we want this one
minimized<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.610> actually<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.939> take

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
minimized we can actually just take

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.210 
minimized we can actually just take
notepad<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.229> shake<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:25.619> crazy<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
notepad and just shake it like crazy and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.880 
notepad and just shake it like crazy and
it<00:01:26.340> will<00:01:26.430> minimize<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:27.000> other<00:01:27.090> one<00:01:27.890> another

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it will minimize the other one another

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.640 
it will minimize the other one another
