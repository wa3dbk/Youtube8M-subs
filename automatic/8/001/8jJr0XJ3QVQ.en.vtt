let's compare and contrast RGB with CMYK

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.590 
let's compare and contrast RGB with CMYK
these<00:00:05.400> are<00:00:05.580> two<00:00:05.790> different<00:00:06.150> ways<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.540> looking

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
these are two different ways of looking

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.030 
these are two different ways of looking

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
in RGB color mode this is suitable for

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.480 
in RGB color mode this is suitable for

laser jet printer this is an additive

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.200 
laser jet printer this is an additive
color<00:00:33.899> system<00:00:34.489> that<00:00:35.489> means<00:00:35.730> that<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
color system that means that when you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.150 
color system that means that when you
add<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.450> primaries<00:00:37.260> together<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:38.219> get<00:00:38.430> white

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
add the primaries together you get white

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.119 
add the primaries together you get white
this<00:00:41.160> works<00:00:41.460> very<00:00:41.730> well<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.210> light<00:00:43.129> shining

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
composited together that end up looking

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.890 
composited together that end up looking
like<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.119> color<00:01:27.330> photo

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.190 

in<00:01:32.290> theory<00:01:32.860> if<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.460> added<00:01:33.850> cyan<00:01:34.330> magenta<00:01:34.360> and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
in theory if you added cyan magenta and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.410 
in theory if you added cyan magenta and
yellow<00:01:35.290> together<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:36.940> would<00:01:37.060> end<00:01:37.240> up<00:01:37.360> with

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
yellow together you would end up with

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.260 
yellow together you would end up with
black<00:01:38.220> that's<00:01:39.220> because<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.790> it<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.240> a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
black that's because it it is a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.920 
black that's because it it is a
subtractive<00:01:41.020> color<00:01:41.080> system<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.750> more

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
subtractive color system and it's more

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.790 
subtractive color system and it's more
suitable<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.440> reflected<00:01:45.250> light<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:47.350> example

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
suitable to reflected light for example

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.380 
suitable to reflected light for example
in<00:01:47.980> a<00:01:48.100> printed<00:01:48.520> document<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.700> professional

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
in a printed document so professional

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.590 
in a printed document so professional
printers<00:01:52.870> tend<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.590> use<00:01:53.740> CMYK<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.910> they

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
printers tend to use CMYK and they

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.200 
printers tend to use CMYK and they
actually<00:01:55.780> print<00:01:56.290> separate<00:01:57.160> plates<00:01:57.430> one<00:01:57.940> for

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
actually print separate plates one for

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.800 
actually print separate plates one for
each<00:01:58.300> channel<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:59.940> practice<00:02:00.940> no<00:02:01.330> ink<00:02:01.630> is

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
each channel in practice no ink is

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.230 
each channel in practice no ink is
perfect<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:03.190> when<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.430> add<00:02:03.610> cyan<00:02:04.210> magenta

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
and yellow inks together you usually end

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.740 
and yellow inks together you usually end
up<00:02:08.229> with<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.470> muddy<00:02:08.800> brown<00:02:09.130> and<00:02:09.550> that's<00:02:10.450> why<00:02:10.690> the

up with a muddy brown and that's why the

up with a muddy brown and that's why the
black<00:02:11.110> channel<00:02:11.620> was<00:02:11.770> added<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:13.030> boost<00:02:13.270> the

black channel was added to boost the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.420 
black channel was added to boost the
