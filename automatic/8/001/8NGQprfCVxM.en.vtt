00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.700
 new video of grand theft auto 5 in the 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.530

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.150
 say and esther ex about the mode 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.769
 individual of the game first of all 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.140
 I wanted to tell you that I am organizing a 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.970
 series of questions and answers in 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.010
 continue what would be here the answer 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.810
 and simply because you can do 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.369
 any kind of questions about the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.830
 online about the individual or about 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.140
 rockstar in general through the hashtag 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.580
 and answer them also remember you 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.140
 you like me if you like the video and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.090
 also leave your comment with what 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.010
 It has seemed to you about any opinion or 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.600
 thing you want to add we start with 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.999
 a mission called safari 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.039
 neighborhood in which if we deviate from the 

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:46.010
 predefined route that marks the map 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.870
 we can see here and we can see the rai of 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.899
 and we can see big smoke or some 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.210
 imitations of them then strolling in 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.889
 bicycle would remind us a little what 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.659
 it was the first mission of big jetas 

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:57.739
 so even but purpose is simply this 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.959
 curiosity that they have wanted to make 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.119
 sort of nod to them are not 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:04.489
 exactly them but they are very similar 

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:06.619
 we can find a reference to network 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.870
 dead redemption at franklin's house in 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.500
 one of the books and we get very close 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.960
 at 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.480
 that you have in your home or just 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.610
 we look through a sniper 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.440
 the peephole a sniper we can see 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.300
 a book called di network that is 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.760
 written by a certain jota marston what 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.500
 it could be curiously in the word the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.170
 name of John Marston that is the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.460
 protagonist of network dead redemption this 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.350
 another curiosity is very likely that 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.060
 many you know that you have seen in 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.440
 a video or just what ye 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.990
 found to you you have to in the 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.369
 predator or predator mission or depends 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.380
 of the language in which you have will be called 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.640
 one way or another as that mission 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.440
 when we are in the helicopter 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.600
 aiming with the sniper leaving us 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.369
 michaels if we look to the right of the 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.440
 we will all see a brand of light with the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.210
 Thermal sight that will signal us that no 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.729
 it's a deer but it's kind of 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.740
 monkey person and if we remove quickly 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.479
 because the thermal sight will see that it 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.490
 it's about a virus that practically 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.740
 it will disappear in a few seconds 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.960
 after having seen him last 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.550
 we go to the northeast of white and just 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.200
 next to the highway where you are 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.390
 seeing on the map we can find a 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.190
 pretty peculiar tree very different to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.290
 everyone else and that is a tree that 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.720
 it shines and that it is golden in color 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.790
 contrary to the rest of the trees alone 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.010
 find at night during the day 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.170
 this tree will be exactly the same as 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.970
 others but at night changes and 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.430
 this tree is going to be golden it will shine 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.050
 it's going to be like gold and the rest of 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.550
 trees are obviously going to be 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.100
 affected by the light of night they go 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.560
 to see dark green and very different to 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.970
 this special tree live up to here 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.110
