00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.439
 Hello everyone, the long-awaited release 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.269
 how to fall is possible 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.270
 think I'll just die now 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.730
 survive telling and the whole secret is like 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.430
 natural falls really no i 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.519
 just tried it became the main point 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.930
 which she should be a chiropractor 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.790
 difficult recording tricks possible can 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.530
 fall for a drink but for now i'm just 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.329
 parse low standards are boiled and 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.309
 falls which are often found in 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.339
 beginners would we xer0 principle would be a mixer 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.859
 and so the first fall is goose 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.199
 classic have a lot of ass geese 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:58.879
 can be praised in different ways but quickly 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.789
 fatherly then try the rear view 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.320
 ion stalled that with that in the middle 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.879
 at the expense of can and fuel for different 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.970
 the reason for the collapse that you are there about the chest 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.340
 or on the grief with his hands it doesn't matter that he 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.800
 you are treading without salad 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.880
 ahead so this is you way experience in a cult you 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.039
 by you and 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.619
 that and you do not know do it not forward 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.780
 and in this case ideally you should 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.479
 learn to just throw out the bike 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.060
 ahead and yourself fall like a quark father 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.579
 but if this happens very unexpectedly 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.950
 and it happens that you do not have time - and 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.650
 just fall for it on him or near 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.079
 Well, here I already understand the situation 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.970
 describes of you have time try 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.829
 This version has a lot of Sawad time 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.079
 better of course it sounds to fold it if 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.149
 it is not necessary to be able to fall and fall 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.340
 also always need the space of cultures 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.049
 you can generally need to come here not 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.210
 nakida limbs certain swing 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.530
 he was caught in the genre just put you 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.140
 should just fall on hand there 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.119
 cocktail on foot so you can break 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.310
 all limbs you must learn 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.320
 roll up grew and already started talking about 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.329
 get out no bike if that's all 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.060
 summarize and the thing is essentially this is the most 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.579
 main skill and which will save you from 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.200
 all sorts fall suitcase tv 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.959
 when questions are flat like not 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.370
 land also save from falling 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.110
 all sorts of candle when you land on 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.870
 rear wheels and as far as an amateur 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.280
 all 10 all these falls can be avoided 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.410
 simple benches throwing out the bike 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.810
 rollers round when it's hard to throw it away 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.150
 power row backtrack 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.430
 buggy big degrees twist though 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.720
 doesn't change teach then avoid many 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.040
 problems and do not need to be afraid of that is 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.720
 do not feel sorry for the bike or all 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.140
 understand what you are doing where the trick and 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.150
 add w and unscrew and understand what 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.620
 you don't understand him now his little finger 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.019
 specific bike there do not know you 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.730
 magician and feet and how not to get into the frame 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.800
 there is still a poet you should not try 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.540
 just take it there is not an amateur that 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.130
 also this is just you pipette you 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.480
 nothing will be and it is much cheaper 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.930
 your health is not poor devil 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.760
 dirty here as other tricks in such 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.930
 such as to replace that as there 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.150
 in general, but honestly could even learn 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.280
 grooves with him in the first place behind the backs 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.530
 also if you twist understand that everything 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.440
 you lost better throw away and had time down 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.230
 rulers in the side and then distribute 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.630
 on your feet and everything is so hard and tricky tricks 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.660
 as I have before the letters elevator and all there 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.130
 id1 will be coming for years but nonetheless 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.200
 you must practice it constantly and 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.880
 there is a try where new trick you 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.200
 immediately catches the cover and is governed 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.269
 proceed now maybe you don't 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.910
 catch must somehow bullet 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.829
 predicts a fall and avoid it and 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.200
 Of course, counted, too, guy big 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.930
 role if you have good protection 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.850
 good knee nude satire helmet 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.790
 words and desirable, too, and flew 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.819
 you will find that you are a little more comfortable 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.560
 much easier you can somehow not fall 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.569
 put the bureau of course roll over there 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.950
 who else to do i certainly not just not 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.989
 I want to specially make but I 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.480
 inserting footage of some of his bike to ours 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.700
 that you understood what was going on as well 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.230
 Of course I want to note the ridiculous 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.420
 fall as possible you yourself 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.069
 noticed that most often any injuries 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.989
 happens then when you just don't 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.019
 expect is possible only for that dynasty 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:12.639
 the park is still going without protection do throw 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.930
 elementary tricks manual ladies or 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.090
 just just arrived at the park only 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.880
 roll out and this is the sweatiest moment 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.979
 when you can get far you will be equal 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.930
 the elementary trick of it is very 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.340
 serious injuries and so should you i 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.350
 always concentrate always understands 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.880
 what better way to go protection again again 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.560
 repeat and always accept that 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.020
 you can not relax in skating need 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.210
 somehow to you expose you can 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.760
 make the post the simplest trick this manual 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.710
 even a branch was just the same 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.600
 and I rode the rails and moved and got to you 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.100
 your saved will be full 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.920
 relax and you can get serious 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.910
 there therefore always concentrate not 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.680
 relax and sum up again 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.780
 but the essence of this issue is not what but asked 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.810
 take off and leave i'll just say my 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.180
 opinion about the fall of the video compilation 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.490
 Overall the main result is that the first 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.620
 the most important thing is to learn to throw out 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.630
 Sapet food from different bed situations 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.700
 there is a goose either yes we just fly to 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.710
 candle, or sitting there already dropped what 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.720
 there is a TV suitcase iconic 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.450
 calls the property itself correctly 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.070
 throw it pours further kalugin 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.990
 bike you should well pure rolling 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.670
 hundreds serve like candy on limbs 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.950
 of course if you feel that you are 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.230
 remember this ebana but then either there 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.970
 just here right when cooking is not flies on 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.090
 For years, something else of course can recognize 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.900
 with one foot we were even led without two legs 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.060
 may be safer than throwing away 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.610
 bike well you started with controls 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.000
 yourself so now what 1 skills loops 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.000
 put to sleep 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.110
 further you glance or if you 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
 and leave her legs properly 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.070
 no harm to yourself then there are no there 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.360
 cool, too, often happens, too, not 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.070
 you have time to put on my leg 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:53.530
 I'll put it at random 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.710
 protection if you will protect you then 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.260
 there is protection just will not give plus 100 plus 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.720
 then there plus 90 to your chance to 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.480
 grazing falling sword heighten injuries and 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.180
 Protection of safety do not need and do not need this 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.680
 let's save your on protection and 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.070
 knee pro protection I filmed release 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.080
 You can view 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.510
 and don't feel sorry for the bike too 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.550
 plot may be withdrawn 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.530
 i'm so i try many times but it is 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.480
 same most important thing here to judge 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.230
 concentrate on tricks not 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.970
 relax 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.040
