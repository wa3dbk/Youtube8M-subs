00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 again with you adobe school site frame 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.839
 com in the previous four releases we already 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.090
 Acquainted with the four main features 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.070
 lightroom 6 if you have not watched 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.349
 go to the booth read right 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.179
 Now this time we will look at more 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.970
 small but no less important 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.199
 changing the latest version 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.359
 photo editor if you didn't know then in 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 the module can be made quick 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.900
 correction of one or a group of images is not 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.369
 entering the develop module 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 but such a correction has always been 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.410
 limited to a step in the exposure level on 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.690
 extreme buttons and fat inside the exposure 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.510
 on internal even for basic correction 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.040
 this was often not enough 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.200
 after the upgrade is simple enough 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.660
 hold shift key to change pitch 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 exposure has decreased and still doubled 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 like a very simple fix but he 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 responds to the real needs of the real 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.550
 photographers now for the simplest 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.680
 contrasting exposure manipulation 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.230
 color and sharpness can be limited 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 the next window in the library 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.129
 a feature that will save me a lot of time 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.890
 covered in the following module develop 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.019
 hold shift and double click on 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.390
 points of black and white as well 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.850
 sliders responsible for the preservation of shadows 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 lightroom lights and automatically adjust for 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.909
 all this way to achieve 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.340
 maximum dynamic range 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.310
 what we immediately see by evenly 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.619
 filled histogram in varying from 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.020
 frame to frame high contrast scenes 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.240
 This is as well as help to hope for 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.100
 the fact that everything will turn out awesome in 1 click 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 not worth it but as a point of reference for 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.659
 quick editing is very well 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.340
 usable one more innovation which 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.689
 users have long demanded 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.939
 previous versions of lightroom a 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.040
 the ability to edit gradient and 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.829
 radial filters with a brush 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.960
 choose a gradient filter impose 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.240
 him in this photo to the sky with a smooth 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.390
 transition and try to make the sky more 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.549
 dramatically reduce the exposure we take away 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 light in the minus and maybe even add 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.570
 micro contrast with clarity 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.670
 part of the gradient hit the mountains here 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.130
 publications that are somehow not comme il faut 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.450
 check how things are with the mask 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.520
 pressing the button while the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.189
 Now select the brush on the panel and 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.229
 click on the flight inside the circle and see 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.310
 minus sign which means that we are in mode 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.590
 mask removal 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.250
 and then you just need to carefully remove all 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.890
 superfluous with a slight approach to the sky itself 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.410
 I do the same thing even easier instead of clicking 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.390
 on flight just hold down alt and wipe not 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.550
 I needed area if before 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.990
 neat gradients were complexity then 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.820
 now lightroom allows them 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.160
 use to full now 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.709
 let's go to the drop down menu edit 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.810
 further directory settings and in the field 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.300
 standard size previews see new 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.490
 point car in this mode lightroom 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.200
 reads the resolution of your display and 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.610
 adapt to its maximum 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.920
 horizontal indicator 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.959
 why is it done just now honestly 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.760
 saying I can not understand the developers 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.830
 just stumbled upon this 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.580
 setting up and made savory so 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.590
 feyspalm 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.900
 and then quickly patched a hole in the code 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.090
 In general, now everything is fine and the owners 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.709
 retina and 4k displays will stop 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.540
 feel inferior under 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.910
 permission of their device all too 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.920
 optimized you watched school and tobi 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.050
