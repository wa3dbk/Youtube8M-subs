00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.560 
mixture so I'm going to take it off at
this<00:00:37.960> point<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:40.860> using<00:00:41.860> a<00:00:42.040> sieve<00:00:42.370> I'm<00:00:42.670> going

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
this point and using a sieve I'm going

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.869 
this point and using a sieve I'm going
to<00:00:43.659> sieve<00:00:43.960> in<00:00:44.199> some<00:00:44.800> baking<00:00:45.280> powder<00:00:45.460> and<00:00:45.699> some

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
to sieve in some baking powder and some

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.389 
to sieve in some baking powder and some
plain<00:00:46.600> flour<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.530> what<00:00:47.649> I<00:00:47.680> need<00:00:47.860> to<00:00:47.890> do<00:00:48.159> here

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
plain flour and what I need to do here

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:49.860 
plain flour and what I need to do here
is<00:00:48.550> make<00:00:48.760> sure<00:00:48.790> that<00:00:48.970> everything's<00:00:49.510> really

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
is make sure that everything's really

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
light and airy so that we get this

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.579 
light and airy so that we get this
wonderful<00:00:52.180> light<00:00:52.449> sponge<00:00:52.870> when<00:00:53.199> it<00:00:53.290> comes<00:00:53.470> out

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
wonderful light sponge when it comes out

wonderful light sponge when it comes out
of<00:00:53.619> the<00:00:53.769> oven<00:00:54.479> now<00:00:55.479> if<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:55.720> were<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.869> add<00:00:55.989> this

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
of the oven now if you were to add this

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.960 
of the oven now if you were to add this
flour<00:00:56.589> in<00:00:56.860> without<00:00:57.070> saving<00:00:57.430> what<00:00:57.699> you'd<00:00:57.850> end

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
flour in without saving what you'd end

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.509 
flour in without saving what you'd end
up<00:00:58.180> is<00:00:58.360> with<00:00:58.720> a<00:00:58.750> lot<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.259> lumps<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.009> use<00:01:00.339> the

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
up is with a lot of lumps so use the

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:01.859 
up is with a lot of lumps so use the
sieve<00:01:00.729> and<00:01:00.970> then<00:01:01.059> fold<00:01:01.390> through<00:01:01.720> with<00:01:01.839> a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:01.869 
sieve and then fold through with a

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:04.710 
sieve and then fold through with a
spatula<00:01:02.199> until<00:01:02.759> the<00:01:03.759> flour<00:01:03.970> is<00:01:04.119> completely

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
spatula until the flour is completely

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.050 
spatula until the flour is completely
incorporated<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.310> really<00:01:06.729> want<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:06.970> make

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
incorporated and you really want to make

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.420 
incorporated and you really want to make
sure<00:01:07.240> not<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.659> overwork<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:08.500> mixture<00:01:08.860> the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
sure not to overwork this mixture the

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.190 
sure not to overwork this mixture the
whole<00:01:09.670> idea<00:01:10.000> is<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.420> we<00:01:10.509> get<00:01:10.659> left<00:01:10.960> with<00:01:11.170> a

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
whole idea is that we get left with a

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.010 
whole idea is that we get left with a
really<00:01:11.799> light<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.430> airy<00:01:12.790> sponge<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:13.869> will

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
really light and airy sponge this will

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.679 
really light and airy sponge this will
bake<00:01:14.170> at<00:01:14.350> 180<00:01:14.920> degrees<00:01:15.369> for<00:01:15.640> 20<00:01:16.090> minutes<00:01:16.360> until

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
bake at 180 degrees for 20 minutes until

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.350 
bake at 180 degrees for 20 minutes until
it's<00:01:16.810> risen<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:17.409> it's<00:01:17.530> light<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.100> golden<00:01:18.549> so

not<00:02:17.160> just<00:02:17.459> adding<00:02:17.760> in<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.660> just

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
not just adding in here and it's just

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.020 
not just adding in here and it's just
about<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.080> teaspoon<00:02:19.350> so<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.459> goes<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.850> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
about a teaspoon so that goes in and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:32.610 
about a teaspoon so that goes in and
then<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.360> teaspoon<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:22.080> vanilla<00:02:22.170> extract

and<00:02:33.390> now<00:02:34.390> just<00:02:34.629> check<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.140> mixture<00:02:35.530> by

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
and now just check the mixture by

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.440 
and now just check the mixture by
pressing<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.340> beaters<00:02:36.670> against<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.300> bowl

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
pressing the beaters against the bowl

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.330 
pressing the beaters against the bowl
and<00:02:37.690> once<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.080> don't<00:02:38.230> hear<00:02:38.530> any<00:02:38.680> granules<00:02:39.220> of

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and once you don't hear any granules of

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.280 
and once you don't hear any granules of
sugar<00:02:39.400> hitting<00:02:40.180> against<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:40.930> take<00:02:41.170> it

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
sugar hitting against it you can take it

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.869 
sugar hitting against it you can take it
off<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.709> heat<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.069> then<00:02:42.250> I'm<00:02:42.340> gonna<00:02:42.430> continue

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
off the heat and then I'm gonna continue

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.790 
off the heat and then I'm gonna continue
to<00:02:43.000> be<00:02:43.120> just<00:02:43.269> for<00:02:43.629> about<00:02:43.720> six<00:02:44.260> minutes<00:02:44.470> until

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
to be just for about six minutes until

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:55.020 
to be just for about six minutes until
it<00:02:45.010> becomes<00:02:45.099> quite<00:02:45.519> thick

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.880 

okay<00:02:56.030> now<00:02:56.540> as<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.140> can<00:02:57.290> see<00:02:57.500> this<00:02:57.710> is

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
okay now as you can see this is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.890 
okay now as you can see this is
transformed<00:02:58.730> from<00:02:59.210> something<00:02:59.510> a<00:02:59.570> little<00:02:59.780> bit

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
transformed from something a little bit

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.140 
transformed from something a little bit
more<00:02:59.930> liquid<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.500> something<00:03:00.890> very

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
more liquid to something very

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.850

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
sieve so that we get really smooth and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.979 
sieve so that we get really smooth and
glossy<00:03:36.470> Jam<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:38.300> I'm<00:03:38.360> just<00:03:38.510> going<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.720> pour
