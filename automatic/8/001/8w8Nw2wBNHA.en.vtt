00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.210
 hello everyone it was or 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.980
 quiz gamers and today we get 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.480
 found for a hack video on 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.279
 minecraft and if I was to that I did not 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.920
 I'm not mistaken we'll see how 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.779
 hacker minecraft with china engine then 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.010
 we'll see that just after you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 to say that I will try to send this 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.939
 video al hakika kaefer because I want because 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.590
 I saw that there was not a lot of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.760
 hack videos on their channel so 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 I hope they will take me 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.430
 so as I wanted to say this tutorial 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.290
 will rest on shit use 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.540
 engine of shit engine 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.890
 it is a software that allows after dac 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 and everything and anything 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 so before downloading or doing 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.500
 anything with I advise you 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.660
 to look closely at the instructions that I 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.539
 would give in the airship description 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.600
 engine is a bit of a software a little a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.969
 little dangerous we will say then so already 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.370
 with cheung engine you start it and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.989
 we will open minecraft in qinghai 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.879
 to be able to then acquired minecraft 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.000
 so you go in windows list and 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.950
 you select your minecraft here 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.760
 now the shit engine software to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.830
 load and minecraft you see here no 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.630
 the tutorial will rest on two things the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.890
 speed ac and objects to infinity so 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.210
 we will first talk about objects to 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.460
 infinity 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.590
 you see I defeated debbouze so 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.590
 the goal to be in not increasing the 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.909
 quantity so first we will target 20 I 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.570
 will you explain why first name you 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.920
 mark 20 you do firth cannes there 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.780
 now the software will search 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.759
 in the register all the addresses 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.460
 for which the value is equal to 20 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.920
 so among these values ​​there is strength and 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.390
 necessarily one that corresponds to the number 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.840
 of blues clubs that I have in my 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 inventory 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.829
 so now we will fine tune the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.740
 search of which jean ask two I have 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.229
 now 18 and so I'll mark 18 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.149
 and I'm going to do an ex cannes see her 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.159
 there are already many less but there 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.930
 has some that changes so we're going 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.380
 select only those that do not 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380
 do not change 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.200
 that's actually made a gap that 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.130
 do not change and that's it then 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.930
 this one we go there press the small 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.960
 red arrow to put it down then 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.420
 here is a little the window you can 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.730
 change the value of your addresses so 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.130
 the 'record' and value auction valley 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 is here you mark the number of objects 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.280
 that you want to have for example I 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.260
 want 60 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.690
 I'm going to have 60 so there you see 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.040
 ambitions 60s so this part of 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.330
 hacker not really interesting being 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.160
 given that there is plenty of fashion on 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.100
 minecraft that allows that allow 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.830
 to get the objects to infinity but the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.410
 target addresses with shit 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.090
 engine you will use for any 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.580
 what other axis if you want to hack a 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.239
 another game on emulator on pc or on a 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.250
 pc game 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.720
 any one now we're going 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.270
 pass on a more interesting part 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.430
 hac speed ac then has it 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.320
 much much simpler is enough 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.450
 check a box here and there you see 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.610
 that there are several numbers that 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.459
 so here appear one two three to 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.549
 five women it's a bit the speed of the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.260
 game then the chicken jam software will get 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.670
 limit to a speed depending on the game 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.160
 so like minecraft it's a big I 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.970
 see my computer can not speed it up 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.519
 twice both feet on app also 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.560
 so there app it will accelerate my game 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.830
 twice so I hope it shows 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.959
 well 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.400
 so it's not my speed of 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.860
 displacement that accelerated is the game 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.720
 in all which accelerated then as I 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.370
 tell them my nepal fear like minecraft 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.769
 is a big game can not be much 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.780
 accelerated and on the little emulator 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.410
 such as pecs 6 emulator or visualboy 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.510
 advance 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.680
 if you know the games can be 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.719
 accelerated up to 500 times 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.510
 and unlike the hac to have the 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.129
 objects to infinity this mac is available in 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.569
 multiplayer ie in most 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.359
 multiplayer servers if you 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.159
 activate the speed ac but the speed ac b 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.349
 remain in the multiplayer server of 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.909
 cats will not detect that you have a 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.519
 spilak unless they use a more 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.739
 inappropriate so that's all bush 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.109
 stein i hope that you will have it 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.760
 understood and you will have liked 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.709
 find me on my channel for 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.629
 a lot of fashion I do a lot of 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.159
 modding on my string so 6 6 the 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.139
 modding that you like it do not hesitate to 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.329
 take a ride on this I tell you like and
