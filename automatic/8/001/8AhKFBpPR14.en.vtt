base so I've got that here I'm going to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.450 
base so I've got that here I'm going to
position<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.440> stencil<00:00:47.600> where<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> and

this<00:01:08.490> bottle<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> little<00:01:09.360> bit

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
this bottle I think is a little bit

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.390 
this bottle I think is a little bit
thick<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.590> bottle<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> little<00:01:11.280> bit

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
thick and the bottle is a little bit

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
thick and the bottle is a little bit
hard<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> use<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.110> dilute<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.010> put<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
hard to use so I dilute it and put it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 
hard to use so I dilute it and put it
into<00:01:14.580> another<00:01:14.670> bottle<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.720> diluted<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.170> with

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
into another bottle we diluted it with

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
into another bottle we diluted it with
just<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.500> tiny<00:01:16.680> little<00:01:16.979> bit<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.280> water<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.729> so

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
just a tiny little bit of water just so

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.580 
just a tiny little bit of water just so
that<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.540> creamy<00:01:18.840> consistency<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that it's a really creamy consistency it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.620 
that it's a really creamy consistency it
flows<00:01:19.799> well<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.420> fun

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630

and<00:02:56.680> let<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.340> dry<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.640> then<00:02:57.910> we<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.030> move<00:02:58.300> on

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
and let it dry and then we can move on

and let it dry and then we can move on
to<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.660> next<00:02:58.810> step<00:02:58.989> of<00:02:59.140> filling<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.530> in<00:02:59.590> with

to the next step of filling it in with
the<00:02:59.860> fruit<00:03:00.100> now<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.970> our<00:03:01.060> glass<00:03:01.299> line<00:03:01.569> is<00:03:01.750> dry

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
the fruit now that our glass line is dry

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.199 
the fruit now that our glass line is dry
we're<00:03:02.290> ready<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.620> do<00:03:02.739> the<00:03:02.860> marbling<00:03:03.310> because

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
we're ready to do the marbling because

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.580 
we're ready to do the marbling because
of<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.450> type<00:03:04.630> of<00:03:04.810> techniques<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.350> I'm<00:03:05.470> going

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
of the type of techniques that I'm going

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.690 
of the type of techniques that I'm going
to<00:03:05.650> be<00:03:05.769> doing<00:03:06.040> I'm<00:03:06.130> actually<00:03:06.280> going<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.640> flip

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
to be doing I'm actually going to flip

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.039 
to be doing I'm actually going to flip
the<00:03:06.970> glass<00:03:07.120> over<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.569> work<00:03:07.690> on<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:07.900> other

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
the glass over and work on the other

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.500 
the glass over and work on the other
side<00:03:08.380> if<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:09.190> were<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:09.580> filling<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.269> the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
side if I were just filling in the

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.930 
side if I were just filling in the
petals<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.080> would<00:03:11.290> go<00:03:11.410> ahead<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.860> do<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.130> on<00:03:12.370> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
petals I would go ahead and do it on the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.759 
petals I would go ahead and do it on the
same<00:03:13.120> side<00:03:13.390> as<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.569> glass<00:03:13.870> line<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:14.650> the

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
same side as the glass line but the

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.920 
same side as the glass line but the
marbling<00:03:15.180> with<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.330> glass<00:03:16.540> line<00:03:16.750> works

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
marbling with the glass line works

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.229 
marbling with the glass line works
better<00:03:17.140> on<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.440> opposite<00:03:17.890> side<00:03:18.130> so<00:03:18.430> I'm<00:03:19.060> just

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
better on the opposite side so I'm just

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.000 
better on the opposite side so I'm just
going<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.540> gently<00:03:19.780> turn<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.319> over<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.830> back

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
going to gently turn it over to the back

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.080 
going to gently turn it over to the back
okay<00:03:22.319> so<00:03:23.319> I'm<00:03:23.680> working<00:03:24.040> with<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.549> rainbow

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
okay so I'm working with a rainbow

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.610 
okay so I'm working with a rainbow
assortment<00:03:25.690> of<00:03:25.750> colors<00:03:26.110> we're<00:03:26.290> going<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.470> give

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
assortment of colors we're going to give

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.400 
assortment of colors we're going to give
this<00:03:26.769> kind<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.160> tie-dye<00:03:27.430> look<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.959> all<00:03:29.170> I'm

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.080 
this kind of a tie-dye look so all I'm
doing<00:03:29.860> is<00:03:29.980> I'm<00:03:30.099> just<00:03:30.160> going<00:03:30.400> to<00:03:30.489> use<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.849> sign

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
doing is I'm just going to use the sign

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.490 
doing is I'm just going to use the sign
Fred<00:03:31.390> I'm<00:03:31.540> going<00:03:31.750> to<00:03:31.810> make<00:03:31.930> concentric

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
Fred I'm going to make concentric

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.229 
Fred I'm going to make concentric
circles<00:03:32.890> from<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.070> outside<00:03:33.549> working<00:03:34.000> towards

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
circles from the outside working towards

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.199 
circles from the outside working towards
the<00:03:34.390> center<00:03:35.370> easiest<00:03:36.370> way<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.519> do<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:37.060> by

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
the center easiest way to do that is by

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.690 
the center easiest way to do that is by
using<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.600> little<00:03:37.750> straw<00:03:38.170> scoop<00:03:38.560> these<00:03:39.489> are

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
using a little straw scoop these are

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.910 
using a little straw scoop these are
nothing<00:03:40.239> fancy<00:03:40.630> it's<00:03:40.780> just<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.170> regular

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
nothing fancy it's just a regular

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.860 
nothing fancy it's just a regular

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
drinking straw cut at an angle they make

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.970 
drinking straw cut at an angle they make
great<00:03:44.200> spoons<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.970> I'm<00:03:46.480> going<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.690> make<00:03:46.980> my

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
great spoons and I'm going to make my

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.030 
great spoons and I'm going to make my
circles<00:03:48.430> a<00:03:48.549> little<00:03:48.940> bit<00:03:49.090> thick<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:50.620> when

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
circles a little bit thick so that when

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.420 
circles a little bit thick so that when
we<00:03:51.220> pull<00:03:51.609> them<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.780> make<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.109> marbling

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
we pull them to make the marbling

we pull them to make the marbling
you'll<00:03:56.030> have<00:03:56.209> enough<00:03:56.480> frit<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.049> pull<00:03:57.290> into<00:03:57.469> the

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
you'll have enough frit to pull into the

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.110 
you'll have enough frit to pull into the
other<00:03:57.859> colors<00:03:59.500> you<00:04:00.500> can<00:04:00.650> do<00:04:00.799> these<00:04:00.980> in<00:04:01.120> narrow

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
other colors you can do these in narrow

other colors you can do these in narrow
circles<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.959> can<00:04:03.140> do<00:04:03.290> wide<00:04:03.560> circles<00:04:05.079> whatever

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
circles you can do wide circles whatever

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.770 
circles you can do wide circles whatever
your<00:04:06.500> heart<00:04:06.769> desires

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.250 

and<00:04:12.320> I'm<00:04:12.380> not<00:04:12.620> setting<00:04:13.070> this<00:04:13.220> frit<00:04:13.550> with<00:04:13.700> glue

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
and I'm not setting this frit with glue

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.930 
and I'm not setting this frit with glue
so<00:04:15.260> if<00:04:15.350> you're<00:04:15.470> working<00:04:15.770> with<00:04:16.220> kids<00:04:16.459> you<00:04:16.730> want

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
so if you're working with kids you want

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.940 
so if you're working with kids you want
to<00:04:17.030> make<00:04:17.209> sure<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.660> you've<00:04:17.840> got<00:04:17.870> them<00:04:18.320> got

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
to make sure that you've got them got

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.789

from the center of the glass to the
outside<00:05:24.849> edge<00:05:24.999> and<00:05:25.029> then<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.389> outside<00:05:25.509> edge

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
outside edge and then the outside edge

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.899 
outside edge and then the outside edge
in<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.650> do<00:05:26.800> want<00:05:26.979> to<00:05:27.039> press<00:05:27.249> all<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.669> way<00:05:27.759> down

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:27.909 
in you do want to press all the way down

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.730 
in you do want to press all the way down
to<00:05:28.029> the<00:05:28.120> clear<00:05:28.330> glass<00:05:28.539> so<00:05:28.809> that<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.050> make<00:05:29.289> sure

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
to the clear glass so that you make sure

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.879 
to the clear glass so that you make sure
that<00:05:30.419> we're<00:05:31.419> going<00:05:31.569> to<00:05:31.629> see<00:05:31.839> that<00:05:32.050> design<00:05:32.289> on

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
that we're going to see that design on

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.619 
that we're going to see that design on
the<00:05:32.979> other<00:05:33.129> side<00:05:33.490> once<00:05:33.879> we<00:05:33.999> flip<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.419> piece

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
the other side once we flip the piece

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:43.530 
the other side once we flip the piece
over

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.190 

so<00:05:44.050> you<00:05:44.110> can<00:05:44.260> do<00:05:44.410> this<00:05:45.300> farther<00:05:46.300> apart<00:05:46.510> you<00:05:47.020> can

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
so you can do this farther apart you can

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.770 
so you can do this farther apart you can
do<00:05:47.290> it<00:05:47.410> closer<00:05:47.650> together<00:05:48.390> totally<00:05:49.390> up<00:05:49.510> to<00:05:49.540> you

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
do it closer together totally up to you

00:05:51.780 --> 00:06:36.539 
do it closer together totally up to you
it's<00:05:52.780> just<00:05:52.840> like<00:05:53.050> marbling<00:05:53.560> a<00:05:53.710> cake

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:36.549 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:38.949 

all<00:06:37.549> right<00:06:37.759> so<00:06:38.029> we've<00:06:38.179> done<00:06:38.329> the<00:06:38.479> marbling<00:06:38.809> all

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:38.959 
all right so we've done the marbling all

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
all right so we've done the marbling all
the<00:06:39.079> way<00:06:39.169> around<00:06:39.409> we're<00:06:39.559> going<00:06:39.679> to<00:06:39.739> set<00:06:39.889> the

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
the way around we're going to set the

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.319 
the way around we're going to set the
piece<00:06:40.159> with<00:06:40.309> hairspray<00:06:40.639> and<00:06:40.759> then<00:06:40.969> it's<00:06:41.149> ready
