 tv or projector 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.650
 have you heard of laser technology 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.869
 they say ahead of the rest 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.820
 sometimes disputes on those on the forums reach 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.460
 heat that can be expected unless 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.249
 only from elementary school students who 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.980

 fifth grade schoolchildren begin 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.769
 understand that the opposition of movie characters 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.750
 It depends on a variety of factors 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.170
 debaters in the forums after a few 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.239
 weeks 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.850
 desperate discussions come such 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.969
 concludes that everything depends on the script 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.920
 use at one time object 1 and 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.589
 Such Alvar of were projectors but 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.989
 technologies are changing and noisy suitcases on 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.510
 our eyes have turned compact 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.399
 devices are easy to set up easy in 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.399
 installation and universal in 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.409
 use in our next review 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.699
 one of the best to date 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.740
 compact models 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.740
 bank you gp-30 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.200
 at the heart of the optical system of this 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.939
 projector technology dlp source 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.220
 lighting led 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.590
 working in a pair of both of these technologies 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.979
 brought to mind lead to great 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.470
 the luminous flux gp-30 or 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.049
 speaking everyday language brightness is 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.670
 900 lumen is not the highest on 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.649
 today but for the segment 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 ultralight led projector 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.810
 quite worthy and number what does it mean 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.250
 in practice in a room with artificial 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.289
 lighting you can spend 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 presentation on the screen with meter 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.369
 diagonal and completely darkened 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.939
 the room is easy to turn into a cozy 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.100
 cinema hall 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.259
 magic lantern about the power diagonal up 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.970
 five meters in the compartment declared 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.549
 Contrast good color reproduction 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.130
 jeep 30 produces a decent hd picture 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.920
 supports projector and 3d video true 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.479
 Points do not go 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.640
 there is also a set of preset 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.330
 modes and features custom 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.980
 settings 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.580
 able to change the brightness and 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.500
 color temperature contrast 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.320
 there must be a distance from the projector to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.720
 the screen for the jeep 30 is enough to remember 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.640
 such a ratio of screen diagonal 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.660
 approximately equal to the distance between 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.680
 apparatus and projection plane 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.200
 a pair of useful chips 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.600
 gp-30 can adjust vertical 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.760
 trapezoidal distortion automatically 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.799
 or manually and don't be discouraged if 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.260
 you for lack of a special screen or 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.630
 white sheets have to watch favorite 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.139
 the film right on both the projector has 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.329
 tonal adjustment silent pictures 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.609
 projectors have not yet invented and model at 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.739
 bank you are not exceptions however 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.410
 noise level for jeep 30 does not exceed 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:02.900
 30 and 60 liters a similar indicator allows 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.900
 to put the projector in the category of low noise 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.250
 portable bright durable 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.760
 developer promises service life 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.640
 LEDs from 20 to 30 thousand hours 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 what else do modern users need 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.500
 so that the smartphone can be connected before and 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.560
 the wires are already pretty tired 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.750
 gp-30 all this is enough to look 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.750
 back to understand bank you 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:30.450
 take care of you by the way comes bundled 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.280
 hdmi cord and blizzard with which 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.970
 You can not only transfer video from 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.880
 smartphone 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.100
 Well, at the same time to recharge it and still 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.710
 bag for carrying the projector lies wai 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.230
 file dongle it is enough to stick in yusb 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.810
 plug and transfer video straight twist 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.240
 to the cordless module while 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.250
 work and in client mode and as a point 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.690
 access 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.030
 what is interesting is necessary for 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.010
 wireless work software can be downloaded 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.280
 from the built-in memory by connecting the projector 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.080
 and a laptop to one Wi-Fi network 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.760
 impression of the wireless mode he 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.980
 quite suitable for presentations and 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.440
 web surfing but with low frequency 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.440
 frames are not suitable for video broadcasting 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.820
 wireless transfer of documents and 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.920
 photos available for smartphones 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.120
 tablets free apps can 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.650
 download in the appstore and google play 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.450
 it is worth adding that the jeep 30 is equipped 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.340
 2GB internal memory is quite 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.260
 enough storage for dozens 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.600
 bulk documents files can 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.550
 straight from the computer just 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.440
 plug in the mini usb cord and then 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.330
 view taking advantage of slim 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.610
 player 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.470
 a few words about the management to navigate 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.870
 the built-in menu can be used 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.320
 buttons on the case or pick up 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.180
 remote controller 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.400
 infrared receiver placed on 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.009
 front of the projector but dead 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.110
 his zones are minimal 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.119
 and even in the distance can be turned 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.539
 smartphone or tablet mobile 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:59.419
 The application has a special mode until 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:05:01.789
 almost forgot jeep 30 is equipped with two 3 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.110
 cotton speakers along with enhancers 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.149

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.189
 They may well fit for the chamber 

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:09.499
 view calm melodrama 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.339
 Well, for action pictures better fit 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.339
 external acoustics 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.940
 according to experts in the field 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.920
 modern projection devices 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.440
 LED projectors are basically 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.200
 got rid of childhood diseases low 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.570
 brightness noise high flaws in 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.140
 color reproduction and quite suitable for 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:32.760
 daily full operation

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.370
 compactness and can be applied in 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.860
 office and home 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.900
 but with the proper level of ingenuity ahead 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.030
 summer may well be useful for 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.310
 outdoor performances 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.200
 wireless capabilities and support 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.910
 tablet smartphones turn this

 projector claimed device 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.590
 significantly expands the script it 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.720
