let's take a look but first walking us

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:29.919 
let's take a look but first walking us
along<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.710> bit<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.890> saliva<00:00:29.279> with

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
along is a little bit of saliva with

along is a little bit of saliva with
click-click-boom

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
click-click-boom

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.640 
click-click-boom
might<00:00:32.550> be<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.060> would<00:00:33.300> use<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:34.320> get<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
might be what you would use let's get to

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.850 
might be what you would use let's get to
it<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> first<00:00:37.170> thing<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:37.560> got<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> think

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
it so the first thing you got to think

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
it so the first thing you got to think
about<00:00:37.980> what<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.340> a13<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.330> when<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:39.990> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
about what the a13 is when to use it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.650 
about what the a13 is when to use it
when<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> take<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> 105<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:42.510> vice

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
when to take it this is a 105 and vice

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.320 
when to take it this is a 105 and vice
versa<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.740> first<00:00:43.950> let's<00:00:44.130> recap<00:00:44.490> with<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> 105

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
versa so first let's recap with the 105

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.440 
versa so first let's recap with the 105
is<00:00:45.570> all<00:00:45.720> about<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.040> review<00:00:47.610> identify<00:00:48.180> we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
is all about when we review identify we

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.080 
is all about when we review identify we
want<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.900> base<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.590> got<00:00:49.830> nice<00:00:50.190> tight

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
want to see a base it's got nice tight

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.770 
want to see a base it's got nice tight
IEDs<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.290> terms<00:00:52.560> of<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.010> five<00:00:53.700> tiles<00:00:54.060> separated

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
IEDs in terms of a five tiles separated

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
IEDs in terms of a five tiles separated
or<00:00:54.870> less<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.860> they're<00:00:56.100> kind<00:00:56.310> of<00:00:56.400> buried<00:00:57.800> even

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
or less and they're kind of buried even

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.590 
or less and they're kind of buried even
better<00:00:59.010> flat<00:00:59.370> surface<00:00:59.910> where<00:01:00.090> we<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.360> kind<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
better flat surface where we can kind of

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.970 
better flat surface where we can kind of
come<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.080> have<00:01:01.110> a<00:01:01.260> hard<00:01:01.470> time<00:01:01.650> cutting

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
come in and not have a hard time cutting

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.460 
come in and not have a hard time cutting
in<00:01:02.220> that's<00:01:02.970> we<00:01:03.210> want<00:01:03.330> to<00:01:03.450> see<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> 105<00:01:04.140> if

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
in that's we want to see with a 105 if

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.560 
in that's we want to see with a 105 if
we're<00:01:04.710> not<00:01:04.890> seeing<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.400> patter<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.480> an

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
we're not seeing that patter it's an

we're not seeing that patter it's an
eight<00:01:06.690> thirteen<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:08.010> how<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.250> base<00:01:08.550> layout

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
eight thirteen see how this base layout

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.510 
eight thirteen see how this base layout
has<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> V<00:01:09.600> formation<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.620> not<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.040> cluster

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
has a V formation it's not as cluster

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.210 
has a V formation it's not as cluster
between<00:01:12.330> those<00:01:12.780> two<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.020> DS<00:01:13.380> you've<00:01:13.650> got<00:01:13.860> three

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
between those two a DS you've got three

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.280 
between those two a DS you've got three
plus<00:01:14.550> wall<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.150> plus<00:01:15.450> two<00:01:15.659> more<00:01:15.840> seven

plus wall to you plus two more seven

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.800 
plus wall to you plus two more seven
versus<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.340> five<00:01:17.580> if<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:17.970> reason<00:01:18.330> once<00:01:18.480> it's<00:01:18.750> a

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
versus the five if we reason once it's a

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
versus the five if we reason once it's a

kind of lead to towards the 813 let's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.450 
kind of lead to towards the 813 let's
take<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.210> look<00:01:30.330> at<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> hybrid<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.250> space

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
take a look at a hybrid so this space

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.430 
take a look at a hybrid so this space
it's<00:01:32.760> interesting<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.840> gapping<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
it's interesting because the gapping is

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.430 
it's interesting because the gapping is
there<00:01:34.680> that's<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.130> spread<00:01:35.580> of<00:01:35.610> five<00:01:36.440> between

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
there that's a spread of five between

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.350 
there that's a spread of five between
the<00:01:37.680> two<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.190> DS<00:01:38.550> there<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:38.940> they're<00:01:39.090> really

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the two a DS there but they're really

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.570 
the two a DS there but they're really
very<00:01:39.720> plus<00:01:40.380> there's<00:01:40.620> that<00:01:40.650> gap<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.310> front<00:01:41.520> of

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
very plus there's that gap in front of

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.520 
very plus there's that gap in front of
that<00:01:41.640> mortar<00:01:42.000> where<00:01:42.150> you're<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.390> sure<00:01:42.530> how

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that mortar where you're not sure how

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.770 
that mortar where you're not sure how
your<00:01:43.830> attacks<00:01:44.670> gonna<00:01:44.909> flow<00:01:45.240> will<00:01:45.510> you<00:01:45.570> be<00:01:45.720> able

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
your attacks gonna flow will you be able

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.719 
your attacks gonna flow will you be able
to<00:01:45.960> settle<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.440> between<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> two<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> DS<00:01:47.460> like

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
to settle in between the two a DS like

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.180 
to settle in between the two a DS like
you<00:01:47.850> liked<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.330> 105<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:49.650> it's<00:01:49.830> kind<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.070> like

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
you liked with 105 so it's kind of like

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.700 
you liked with 105 so it's kind of like
well<00:01:50.400> it's<00:01:50.729> an<00:01:50.880> ant<00:01:51.030> 105<00:01:51.510> but<00:01:51.900> maybe<00:01:52.260> it's<00:01:52.500> an<00:01:52.590> 8

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
well it's an ant 105 but maybe it's an 8

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.039 
well it's an ant 105 but maybe it's an 8
13<00:01:53.190> in<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.909> case<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.659> make<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> gut

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
13 in that case you got to make a gut

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.530 
13 in that case you got to make a gut
call<00:01:55.080> all<00:01:56.010> right<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.549> now<00:01:56.700> we've<00:01:56.940> seen<00:01:57.180> some<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
call all right so now we've seen some of

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.490 
call all right so now we've seen some of
the<00:01:57.600> things<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.930> think<00:01:58.260> about<00:01:58.350> when<00:01:58.830> trying<00:01:59.190> to

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
the things to think about when trying to

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.340 
the things to think about when trying to
side<00:01:59.650> between<00:02:00.040> a<00:02:00.340> 105<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.210> an<00:02:01.270> 8<00:02:01.420> 13<00:02:01.960> we<00:02:02.140> sit

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
side between a 105 and an 8 13 we sit

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.500 
side between a 105 and an 8 13 we sit
down<00:02:02.470> all<00:02:02.710> eight<00:02:02.920> let's<00:02:03.910> switch<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.150> something

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
down all eight let's switch to something

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.820 
down all eight let's switch to something
more<00:02:04.630> fun<00:02:04.900> let's<00:02:05.080> take<00:02:05.200> a<00:02:05.230> look<00:02:05.470> at<00:02:05.560> their

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
more fun let's take a look at their

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.060 
more fun let's take a look at their
attacks<00:02:06.250> that<00:02:06.940> are<00:02:07.000> 813<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.170> talk<00:02:08.560> about<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
attacks that are 813 and talk about the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.760 
attacks that are 813 and talk about the
steps<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:10.030> want<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.270> go<00:02:10.420> through<00:02:10.720> as<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.560> lay

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
steps you want to go through as you lay

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.520 
steps you want to go through as you lay
down<00:02:11.800> your<00:02:12.310> tactical<00:02:12.910> plan<00:02:13.150> alright<00:02:14.140> with<00:02:14.440> the

down your tactical plan alright with the

down your tactical plan alright with the
first<00:02:14.770> attack<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.400> will<00:02:15.550> take<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> look<00:02:16.150> at

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
first attack we will take a look at

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.120 
first attack we will take a look at
first<00:02:16.540> decision<00:02:17.050> you<00:02:17.110> make<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.410> any<00:02:17.500> 813

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
first decision you make of any 813

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.940 
first decision you make of any 813
that's<00:02:18.370> which<00:02:18.640> 82<00:02:19.120> blow<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.320> case<00:02:20.620> you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
that's which 82 blow in this case you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.280 
that's which 82 blow in this case you
want<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.190> find<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.670> hardest<00:02:22.300> 80<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.900> reach<00:02:23.050> by

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
want to find the hardest 80 to reach by

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.930 
want to find the hardest 80 to reach by
balloon<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.770> that's<00:02:23.920> when<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.190> take<00:02:24.400> out<00:02:24.580> so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
balloon and that's when you take out so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.880 
balloon and that's when you take out so
six<00:02:25.330> o'clock<00:02:25.600> looks<00:02:25.810> easy<00:02:26.050> 9<00:02:26.350> o'clock<00:02:26.680> it's

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
six o'clock looks easy 9 o'clock it's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.270 
six o'clock looks easy 9 o'clock it's
easy

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
easy

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.580 
easy
three<00:02:27.880> o'clock<00:02:28.120> that's<00:02:28.540> not<00:02:28.870> as<00:02:29.050> simple<00:02:29.380> it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
three o'clock that's not as simple it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.199 
three o'clock that's not as simple it
looks<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> too<00:02:30.190> hot<00:02:30.400> path<00:02:30.700> through<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.060> lot

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
looks like a too hot path through a lot

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.600 
looks like a too hot path through a lot
of<00:02:31.320> defensible<00:02:32.320> buildings<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.190> take<00:02:33.400> that

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
of defensible buildings so you take that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.699 
of defensible buildings so you take that
out<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.420> done<00:02:34.630> leaves<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.989> those<00:02:35.200> two<00:02:35.410> 80s

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
out that done leaves you those two 80s

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.229 
out that done leaves you those two 80s
at<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.890> bottom<00:02:36.190> for<00:02:36.340> your<00:02:36.400> attack<00:02:36.670> points<00:02:37.090> I

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
at the bottom for your attack points I

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.600 
at the bottom for your attack points I
would<00:02:37.390> probably<00:02:37.540> attack<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.080> 6:00<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:39.190> then

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
would probably attack it 6:00 and then

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.580 
would probably attack it 6:00 and then
actually<00:02:40.120> roll<00:02:40.390> in<00:02:40.630> your<00:02:40.780> dragons<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.320> always

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
actually roll in your dragons you always

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually roll in your dragons you always
start<00:02:41.830> with<00:02:41.950> cuts<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.640> course<00:02:42.940> as<00:02:43.150> usual<00:02:43.300> so

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
start with cuts of course as usual so

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.850 
start with cuts of course as usual so
make<00:02:43.840> sure<00:02:43.870> your<00:02:44.110> dragons<00:02:44.410> will<00:02:44.500> get<00:02:44.650> there

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
make sure your dragons will get there

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.740 
make sure your dragons will get there
then<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.550> drop<00:02:45.790> your<00:02:45.970> dragons<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.450> between

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
then you drop your dragons in between

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.990 
then you drop your dragons in between
the<00:02:46.900> cuts<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.230> get<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.650> actual<00:02:47.800> ad<00:02:48.310> once

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
the cuts to get to the actual ad once

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.240 
the cuts to get to the actual ad once
the<00:02:49.270> clan<00:02:49.750> castles<00:02:50.290> out<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.650> little<00:02:50.800> early

the clan castles out that little early

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.580 
the clan castles out that little early

is<00:03:23.739> made<00:03:23.920> up<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.549> 8<00:03:24.730> dragon<00:03:25.330> 13<00:03:25.870> moons<00:03:26.080> 5

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
is made up of it's 8 dragon 13 moons 5

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.069 
is made up of it's 8 dragon 13 moons 5
which<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.400> CC<00:03:27.880> should<00:03:28.180> be<00:03:28.329> max<00:03:28.540> then<00:03:28.810> 3

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
which of the CC should be max then 3

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.620 
which of the CC should be max then 3
lightning<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.430> said<00:03:30.790> let's<00:03:31.090> take<00:03:31.329> a<00:03:31.360> look

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
lightning so that said let's take a look

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.930 
lightning so that said let's take a look
at<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.870> attack<00:03:32.200> second<00:03:32.799> attack<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.700> first

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
at the attack second attack and first

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.130 
at the attack second attack and first
take<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.239> look<00:03:34.329> at<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.540> what<00:03:34.780> do<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:34.900> think

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
take a look at that what do you think

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.979 
take a look at that what do you think
which<00:03:35.530> ad<00:03:35.890> would<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.400> blow<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.970> would<00:03:37.269> say<00:03:37.540> die

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
which ad would you blow I would say die

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.250 
which ad would you blow I would say die
this<00:03:38.200> one<00:03:38.440> would<00:03:38.650> be<00:03:38.799> he<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:40.540> all<00:03:40.690> kind<00:03:41.079> of<00:03:41.140> the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
this one would be he and all kind of the

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.050 
this one would be he and all kind of the
same<00:03:41.560> all<00:03:41.829> kind<00:03:42.070> of<00:03:42.100> buried<00:03:42.519> all<00:03:42.760> have

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
same all kind of buried all have

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.780 
same all kind of buried all have
defensive<00:03:43.780> buildings<00:03:44.230> in<00:03:44.380> front<00:03:44.590> of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
defensive buildings in front of

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.759 
defensive buildings in front of
which<00:03:45.209> was<00:03:45.360> causes<00:03:45.810> that'd<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.110> hard<00:03:46.379> to<00:03:46.560> Pat

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
which was causes that'd be hard to Pat

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.339 
which was causes that'd be hard to Pat
the<00:03:46.980> balloon<00:03:47.250> so<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.959> would<00:03:48.959> say<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.230> easiest

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
the balloon so I would say the easiest

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.180 
the balloon so I would say the easiest
is<00:03:49.739> 9<00:03:50.010> yep<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.060> they<00:03:51.180> blow<00:03:51.390> they<00:03:51.750> blow<00:03:51.959> -<00:03:52.440> that

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
is 9 yep so they blow they blow - that

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.660 
is 9 yep so they blow they blow - that
works<00:03:53.959> okay<00:03:54.959> not<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.409> ADEs<00:03:55.769> down<00:03:56.129> the<00:03:56.400> next

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
works okay not that ADEs down the next

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.670 
works okay not that ADEs down the next
choice<00:03:56.879> is<00:03:57.090> which<00:03:57.269> of<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.510> remaining<00:03:57.959> 8<00:03:58.140> -<00:03:58.470> 8

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
choice is which of the remaining 8 - 8

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.130 
choice is which of the remaining 8 - 8
DS<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.280> want<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.549> send<00:03:59.790> your<00:03:59.849> dragons<00:04:00.299> at<00:04:00.480> and

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
DS you want to send your dragons at and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.780 
DS you want to send your dragons at and
I<00:04:01.170> think<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.500> one<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.250> bottom<00:04:02.549> there<00:04:02.700> is

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
I think the one on the bottom there is

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.880 
I think the one on the bottom there is
probably<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.120> hardest<00:04:03.510> because<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.620> drags

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
probably the hardest because the drags

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.949 
probably the hardest because the drags
will<00:04:05.069> tend<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.370> move<00:04:05.580> upwards<00:04:06.420> along<00:04:06.599> that

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
will tend to move upwards along that

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.520 
will tend to move upwards along that
line<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.470> Archer<00:04:07.830> Canon<00:04:08.310> Archer<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.599> ship

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
line of Archer Canon Archer so the ship

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.869 
line of Archer Canon Archer so the ship
pick<00:04:10.739> here's<00:04:10.980> good<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.400> he<00:04:11.459> holds<00:04:11.730> back

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
pick here's good and he holds back

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.180 
pick here's good and he holds back
scimitar<00:04:12.450> loons<00:04:12.660> until<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.110> cc's<00:04:13.530> poi<00:04:13.769> empty

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
scimitar loons until the cc's poi empty

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.180 
scimitar loons until the cc's poi empty
so<00:04:14.760> that's<00:04:14.909> a<00:04:15.030> great<00:04:15.269> timing<00:04:16.229> on<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:16.380> and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
so that's a great timing on that and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.789 
so that's a great timing on that and
then<00:04:17.310> he's<00:04:17.430> holding<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.000> CC<00:04:18.900> loons<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.470> look

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
then he's holding is CC loons and look

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.670 
then he's holding is CC loons and look
correct<00:04:20.609> timing<00:04:20.850> on<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.239> lovely<00:04:21.680> backside

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
correct timing on that lovely backside

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.830 
correct timing on that lovely backside
ad<00:04:22.919> did<00:04:23.280> not<00:04:23.460> start<00:04:23.760> firing<00:04:24.060> until<00:04:24.449> those<00:04:24.570> C

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
ad did not start firing until those C

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.159 
ad did not start firing until those C
seats<00:04:25.110> came<00:04:25.410> out<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:26.610> that's<00:04:26.789> good<00:04:27.090> in<00:04:27.990> both

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
seats came out so that's good in both

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.990 
seats came out so that's good in both
cases<00:04:28.470> he's<00:04:28.740> protecting<00:04:29.310> his<00:04:29.430> loons<00:04:29.669> very

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
cases he's protecting his loons very

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.120 
cases he's protecting his loons very
well<00:04:30.240> because<00:04:31.110> our<00:04:31.260> dragons<00:04:31.710> take<00:04:31.919> their

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
well because our dragons take their

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.710 
well because our dragons take their
victory<00:04:32.520> lap<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:32.850> think<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.180> one<00:04:33.389> was<00:04:33.510> better

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
victory lap I think this one was better

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.270 
victory lap I think this one was better
than<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> first<00:04:33.960> I'll<00:04:34.440> do<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.710> green<00:04:34.979> across

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
than the first I'll do it green across

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.450 
than the first I'll do it green across
the<00:04:35.490> board<00:04:35.729> all<00:04:36.389> five<00:04:36.750> parts<00:04:37.229> of<00:04:37.410> an<00:04:37.560> 8<00:04:37.800> 13<00:04:38.310> were

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
the board all five parts of an 8 13 were

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.129 
the board all five parts of an 8 13 were
correctly<00:04:38.850> done<00:04:39.120> let's<00:04:39.570> move<00:04:39.780> on<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.080> the

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
correctly done let's move on to the

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.659 
correctly done let's move on to the
third<00:04:40.320> attack<00:04:43.010> all<00:04:44.010> right<00:04:44.310> on<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.520> third

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
third attack all right on the third

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.640 
third attack all right on the third
attack<00:04:44.970> let's<00:04:45.210> pick<00:04:45.360> up<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.539> face<00:04:45.750> no<00:04:46.050> pausing

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
attack let's pick up the face no pausing

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.980 
attack let's pick up the face no pausing
so<00:04:46.979> below<00:04:47.760> the<00:04:47.970> ad<00:04:48.300> looks<00:04:48.570> like<00:04:48.720> nine<00:04:48.870> o'clock

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
so below the ad looks like nine o'clock

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.900 
so below the ad looks like nine o'clock
I'll<00:04:49.410> agree<00:04:49.590> with<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:49.770> because<00:04:50.099> it's<00:04:50.400> we're

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
I'll agree with that because it's we're

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.730 
I'll agree with that because it's we're
at<00:04:51.000> bracketed<00:04:51.599> by<00:04:51.630> two<00:04:51.810> with<00:04:52.289> towers

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
at bracketed by two with towers

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.800 
at bracketed by two with towers
attacking<00:04:53.610> from<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.849> bottom<00:04:54.240> also<00:04:54.419> makes

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
attacking from the bottom also makes

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.510 
attacking from the bottom also makes
sense<00:04:55.020> because<00:04:55.169> that<00:04:55.590> ad<00:04:55.889> down<00:04:56.160> there<00:04:56.430> is

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
sense because that ad down there is

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.760 
sense because that ad down there is
covered<00:04:56.849> by<00:04:57.000> the<00:04:57.060> Wiz<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:58.020> be<00:04:58.169> harder<00:04:58.500> for<00:04:58.530> a

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
covered by the Wiz to be harder for a

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.129 
covered by the Wiz to be harder for a
balloon<00:04:59.039> to<00:04:59.130> take<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.490> out<00:04:59.639> so<00:04:59.940> in<00:05:00.690> their<00:05:00.900> role

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
balloon to take it out so in their role

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.779 
balloon to take it out so in their role
he's<00:05:01.440> holding<00:05:01.800> back<00:05:01.830> his<00:05:02.070> inventory<00:05:02.340> loons

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
he's holding back his inventory loons

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.879 
he's holding back his inventory loons
correctly<00:05:03.360> waiting<00:05:03.660> for<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.840> CC<00:05:04.260> empty<00:05:04.710> it's

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
correctly waiting for the CC empty it's

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
I don't know if you really needed to get

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.270 
I don't know if you really needed to get
the<00:05:45.509> win<00:05:45.689> but<00:05:45.719> you<00:05:46.650> want<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:46.889> show<00:05:47.099> a<00:05:47.129> little

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
the win but you want to show a little

the win but you want to show a little
bit<00:05:47.370> of<00:05:47.520> flair<00:05:47.759> you<00:05:48.180> can<00:05:48.330> do<00:05:48.479> it<00:05:48.569> I<00:05:48.780> would<00:05:49.199> agree

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
bit of flair you can do it I would agree

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.959 
bit of flair you can do it I would agree
with<00:05:49.439> the<00:05:49.590> pinky<00:05:50.009> made<00:05:50.189> of<00:05:50.340> which<00:05:50.490> one<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:50.789> blow

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969 
with the pinky made of which one to blow

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:52.580 
with the pinky made of which one to blow
because<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.419> was<00:05:51.539> by<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.840> woods<00:05:52.139> Towers<00:05:52.469> would

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
because it was by the woods Towers would

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.899 
because it was by the woods Towers would
be<00:05:52.650> hard<00:05:52.860> to<00:05:52.949> get<00:05:53.069> the<00:05:53.159> balloons<00:05:53.400> to<00:05:53.669> it<00:05:53.759> and

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
be hard to get the balloons to it and

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.879 
be hard to get the balloons to it and
then<00:05:54.030> the<00:05:54.180> choice<00:05:54.840> for<00:05:55.110> his<00:05:55.199> attack<00:05:55.500> line<00:05:55.770> is

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
then the choice for his attack line is

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.680 
then the choice for his attack line is
also<00:05:56.190> pretty<00:05:56.370> solid<00:05:56.819> because<00:05:57.120> that<00:05:57.270> ad<00:05:57.449> was

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
also pretty solid because that ad was

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.080 
also pretty solid because that ad was
