ok<00:00:21.600> today<00:00:22.130> we're<00:00:23.130> just<00:00:23.250> looking<00:00:23.610> at<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:24.029> normal

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
ok today we're just looking at a normal

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.290 
ok today we're just looking at a normal
corrugated<00:00:25.320> roof<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> particular<00:00:30.119> roof

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
corrugated roof and this particular roof

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.160 
corrugated roof and this particular roof
has<00:00:30.690> got<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.080> lap<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.360> there's<00:00:33.360> not<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.629> left

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
has got a lap in it there's not a left

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.020 
has got a lap in it there's not a left
further<00:00:34.530> down<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.890> bottom<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.400> in<00:00:35.580> old<00:00:35.820> days

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
further down the bottom and in old days

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.500 
further down the bottom and in old days
a<00:00:36.890> sheets<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.250> weren't<00:00:38.550> long<00:00:38.879> enough<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
a sheets just weren't long enough to

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.479 
a sheets just weren't long enough to
have<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.720> continuous<00:00:40.559> sheet<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:43.370> people<00:00:44.370> were

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
have a continuous sheet so people were

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.689 
have a continuous sheet so people were
forced<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.330> a<00:00:45.360> lap<00:00:45.690> now<00:00:46.440> there's<00:00:46.769> a<00:00:47.040> correct

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
forced to do a lap now there's a correct

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.000 
forced to do a lap now there's a correct
way<00:00:47.909> in<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.180> incorrect<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.140> doing<00:00:49.440> laps<00:00:49.710> on

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
way in an incorrect way of doing laps on

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.850 
way in an incorrect way of doing laps on
a<00:00:50.489> corrugated<00:00:51.120> roof<00:00:51.479> profile<00:00:52.110> this

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
a corrugated roof profile this

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.020 
a corrugated roof profile this
particular<00:00:53.190> roof<00:00:53.519> is<00:00:53.670> leaking<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.769> it's

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
particular roof is leaking and it's

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.729 
particular roof is leaking and it's
mainly<00:00:57.030> due<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.690> fact<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.049> the<00:00:58.350> lap

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
mainly due to the fact that the lap

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.369 
mainly due to the fact that the lap
wasn't<00:00:59.190> done<00:00:59.370> correctly<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.190> done<00:01:03.379> in

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
wasn't done correctly was just done in

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.520 
wasn't done correctly was just done in
such<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.750> attracted<00:01:06.750> water<00:01:06.990> into

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
such a way that it attracted water into

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.170 
such a way that it attracted water into
the<00:01:07.619> roof<00:01:07.770> habit<00:01:08.159> yourself<00:01:08.549> let's<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
the roof habit yourself let's have a

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.690 
the roof habit yourself let's have a
look<00:01:09.360> open<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.440> see<00:01:11.159> how<00:01:11.340> that's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
look open this up and see how that's

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
look open this up and see how that's
done

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
done

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
done
as<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.610> left<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.500> get<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.650> opened<00:01:17.810> that's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
as you left there get that opened that's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560 
as you left there get that opened that's
what<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.200> looks<00:01:19.380> like<00:01:19.650> Lisbon's<00:01:20.330> sealant<00:01:21.330> put

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
what it looks like Lisbon's sealant put

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.130 
what it looks like Lisbon's sealant put
there

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
there

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.760 
there
now<00:01:23.780> if<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.890> slap<00:01:26.210> was<00:01:27.210> done<00:01:27.420> correctly<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
now if this slap was done correctly that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.399 
now if this slap was done correctly that
sheep<00:01:29.399> bed<00:01:29.780> should<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.810> under<00:01:31.549> this<00:01:32.549> sheet<00:01:32.759> but

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
sheep bed should be under this sheet but

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.830 
sheep bed should be under this sheet but
this<00:01:34.409> has<00:01:34.590> been<00:01:34.770> left<00:01:35.039> in<00:01:35.190> such<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> way<00:01:35.580> that

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
this has been left in such a way that

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.670 
this has been left in such a way that
this<00:01:37.549> bottom<00:01:38.549> sheet<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:39.240> been<00:01:39.270> placed<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:40.140> top

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
this bottom sheet has been placed on top

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.389 
this bottom sheet has been placed on top
of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.600> upstream<00:01:42.600> sheet<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.890> happens

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
of the upstream sheet and what happens

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.270 
of the upstream sheet and what happens
here<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.180> see<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.689> water<00:01:46.440> gets

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
here is that you see all that water gets

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
here is that you see all that water gets
trapped<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.819> there<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:50.300> it<00:01:51.300> actually<00:01:51.360> has<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
trapped in there and it actually has a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.550 
trapped in there and it actually has a
bit<00:01:52.319> of<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.500> damning<00:01:53.280> effect<00:01:53.720> of<00:01:54.720> course<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.380> bit

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
bit of a damning effect of course a bit

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.399 
bit of a damning effect of course a bit
of<00:01:55.590> dirt<00:01:55.799> gets<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.220> there<00:01:56.429> water<00:01:57.080> flows<00:01:58.080> down

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
of dirt gets in there water flows down

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.859 
of dirt gets in there water flows down
this<00:01:58.649> lap<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.520> runs<00:01:59.729> over<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.750> you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
this lap and then it runs over and you

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.070 
this lap and then it runs over and you
can<00:02:00.990> see<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.770> insulation<00:02:02.479> has<00:02:03.479> been<00:02:03.720> damped

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
can see the insulation has been damped

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.660 
can see the insulation has been damped
over<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.789> and<00:02:05.789> so<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:07.140> been<00:02:07.350> leaking<00:02:07.770> at

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
over time and so it's been leaking at

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.180 
over time and so it's been leaking at
this<00:02:08.910> point<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.940> just<00:02:12.950> let's<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.100> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
this point so this is just let's have a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.130 
this point so this is just let's have a
look<00:02:14.370> at<00:02:14.519> what's<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.180> only<00:02:15.420> sea<00:02:17.510> area

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
look at what's the only sea area

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
look at what's the only sea area
so<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.580> amount<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.880> dirt<00:02:22.120> gets<00:02:22.750> built<00:02:23.020> up<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
so the amount of dirt gets built up and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.050 
so the amount of dirt gets built up and
subsequently<00:02:25.840> water<00:02:26.800> gets<00:02:27.130> into<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.520> capital

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
subsequently water gets into the capital

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.890 
subsequently water gets into the capital
space<00:02:28.350> so<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:31.240> can<00:02:31.390> get<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.540> much<00:02:31.690> better

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
space so you can get a much better

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.870 
space so you can get a much better
result<00:02:32.110> if<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.620> sheet<00:02:32.890> will<00:02:33.070> land<00:02:33.250> properly

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
result if the sheet will land properly

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.960 
result if the sheet will land properly
we<00:02:35.550> nowadays<00:02:36.550> don't<00:02:36.910> recommend<00:02:38.370> having<00:02:39.370> all

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
we nowadays don't recommend having all

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.640 
we nowadays don't recommend having all
these<00:02:40.210> laps<00:02:40.540> because<00:02:40.690> we<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.050> get<00:02:41.200> sheets<00:02:41.470> in

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
these laps because we can get sheets in

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.510 
these laps because we can get sheets in
a<00:02:41.680> continuous<00:02:42.280> length<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:44.050> would<00:02:44.520> lapin

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
a continuous length but we would lapin

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.180 
a continuous length but we would lapin
we<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.390> need<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:47.110> make<00:02:47.680> sure<00:02:47.740> it's<00:02:48.100> done

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
we just need to make sure it's done

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.330 
we just need to make sure it's done
quickly

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.400
