hydraulic<00:00:16.860> if<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.460> want<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.789> call<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.270> lift

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
hydraulic if you want to call this lift

00:00:18.570 --> 00:03:02.080 
hydraulic if you want to call this lift
you<00:00:18.750> need<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> key

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.030

this bridge on the first floor connects
all<00:03:05.220> three<00:03:05.549> buildings<00:03:05.910> so<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.569> seems<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:07.049> be<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
all three buildings so it seems to be a

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.289 
all three buildings so it seems to be a
good<00:03:07.379> idea<00:03:07.530> for<00:03:07.769> disabled<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.819> reach<00:03:09.000> the

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
good idea for disabled to reach the

good idea for disabled to reach the
other<00:03:09.420> buildings<00:03:10.110> but<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.950> not<00:03:11.160> as<00:03:11.340> good

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
other buildings but that is not as good
