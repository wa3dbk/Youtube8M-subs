00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
himself if you watched his gait if you

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.450 
himself if you watched his gait if you
watch<00:00:57.390> his<00:00:57.629> run<00:00:57.870> he<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.469> himself<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
watch his run he was not himself in the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
watch his run he was not himself in the
open<00:00:59.850> field<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.690> he<00:01:00.809> normally<00:01:01.170> would<00:01:01.260> have

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
open field when he normally would have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
open field when he normally would have
just<00:01:01.530> broken<00:01:01.800> out<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.430> no<00:01:02.579> one<00:01:02.670> would<00:01:02.760> catch

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just broken out and no one would catch

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.579 
just broken out and no one would catch
him<00:01:03.210> he<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.480> being<00:01:03.510> caught<00:01:03.930> from<00:01:04.140> behind<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
him he was being caught from behind a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.899 
him he was being caught from behind a
lot<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:04.920> runs<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.400> mean<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.640> he<00:01:05.760> had<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
lot of these runs I mean if he had a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.789 
lot of these runs I mean if he had a
healthy<00:01:06.299> me<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> year<00:01:06.960> he<00:01:07.439> would<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.650> been

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
healthy me that year he would have been

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.060 
healthy me that year he would have been
100%<00:01:08.479> two<00:01:09.479> years<00:01:09.689> later<00:01:09.900> his<00:01:10.439> gates<00:01:10.770> better

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
100% two years later his gates better

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.890 
100% two years later his gates better
and<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.640> think<00:01:11.670> he's<00:01:11.970> much<00:01:12.150> quicker<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.630> better

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
and I think he's much quicker and better

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.020 
and I think he's much quicker and better

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Peterson to my eye he was not the same

Peterson to my eye he was not the same
runner<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.509> may<00:01:48.689> never<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> exact

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
runner and and may never be the exact

runner and and may never be the exact
same<00:01:49.409> runner<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.009> mean<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.640> bad<00:01:50.850> injury

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180

for running back uh don't don't be
fooled<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.630> mean<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.770> come<00:01:55.890> up<00:01:55.979> with<00:01:56.189> good

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
fooled I mean they can come up with good

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.550 
fooled I mean they can come up with good
numbers<00:01:56.579> but<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.509> they're<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.140> same<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
numbers but but they're not the same and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.870 
numbers but but they're not the same and
if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.770> don't<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.040> explosiveness<00:01:59.640> at

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
if you don't have that explosiveness at

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.450 
if you don't have that explosiveness at
Peterson<00:02:00.299> had<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:01.200> don't<00:02:01.530> think<00:02:01.770> an<00:02:01.979> average

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
Peterson had I don't think an average

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.399 
Peterson had I don't think an average
running<00:02:02.729> back<00:02:02.939> even<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> good<00:02:03.719> average<00:02:03.990> running

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
running back even a good average running

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.510 
running back even a good average running
back<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.829> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> be<00:02:05.189> able<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> do<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
back is going to be able to do a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.370 
back is going to be able to do a
Peterson<00:02:06.030> did<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.420> would<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.930> count<00:02:07.259> on

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
Peterson did so I would not count on

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
Peterson did so I would not count on
that<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.770> would<00:02:07.950> kind<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.520> lower<00:02:08.700> him<00:02:08.970> a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
that and I would kind of lower him a

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.420 
that and I would kind of lower him a
little<00:02:09.300> bit
