00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.419
 hello everyone today we are here to 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.070
 introduce yourself of a boxing of a mini pc 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:20.199
 android in this case then we have 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.429
 our new mini pc that mounts the new 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:28.679
 show that erekat 3368 this is the new 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:34.330
 show de roche that is that it incorporates 288 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:39.130
 64-bit 53 -bit Cortex processors 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:42.430
 a gpu a new gpu a power vr a g 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:45.550
 60 and 110 let's see what we have for 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.710
 here in this new mini pc you know 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.460
 well we have commented is a bellingi 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.670
 68 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.949
 these are thus against two gigabytes of 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:01.519
 ram 8 gb storage memory 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:06.790
 Dual band wifi and android 5.1 as 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:14.659
 operating system also as a novelty 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:16.780
 that we have here the android pc in first 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.780
 flat 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.840
 It has been protected 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.840
 typical design since we've seen in 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:38.080
 other equipment is very simple 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.220
 very ligerito good here we can see 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.250
 the laterals 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.010
 we can see that it has a reader of 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.690
 cards and it reads a couple of usb ports 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.050
 2.0 and here we see that it has a micro sd or 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.200
 tg 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.909
 on the other hand 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.939
 here we see where power is the shot 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.880
 power another port or star 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:11.780
 also 2.0 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.410
 the hdmi connector in this case is a dni 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.480
 2.0 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.300
 then since we have the output of 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.840
 digital audio is smart and we see 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.840
 how will the reset button be 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.200
 later 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:38.440
 typical aeration grilles and a couple 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.440
 of the smallest legs of coma 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.760
 what else do we have here 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:57.140
 it looks like we have a feeder here 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.000
 of cases 5 volts 2 amps per type 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.420
 we see that it will not be possible to dismantle 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.300
 He's probably a little crafty, not like me 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:12.130
 it seems that it has different heads 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.840
 to connect depending on where 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.840
 be good with him 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:27.870
 and we have the mind to protect then by 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.870
 one side and minibuses the other 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:42.340
 the typical king 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.340
 male 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.159
 and we go on 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.159
 but well calling distance of rent 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.520
 lives 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.180
 a couple of rows triple a 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.850
 when we have already seen 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.910
 and finally 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.769
 for work 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.660
 but from manual 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.650
 Quick 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.650
 in English 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.800
 you leave 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.639
 in the manuals on these computers a bit 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.389
 they are not very strange 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:41.289
 Well, this is all we have 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.289
 soon you know what 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.890
 Thank you
