00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:14.429
 Hey people like Philipp 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.429
 and I have a Team Deathmatch for you too 

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.910
 and yes that's true 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.570
 a march from the 19th 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.570
 "It leaves more way so I know I'm super up to date 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.079
 I think that we do not get that as today 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.039
 and yes, I also wanted percent 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.200
 Baby, too, so tall man soon too 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.860
 what was really special is old 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.490
 and he misses but is the classic 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.960
 By the way, for the Iraqis was with money from the cash register and will be with the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.030
 silencer 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.340
 both places 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.340
 1 of the plant manager cases relaxed 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.270
 and yes 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.780
 it was he misses water like that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.090
 In the beginning I have to follow the mappack edition I play first 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.530
 previously presented 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.160
 I thought he was like that 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.900
 Also, this percent are not seen where these steger shield 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.210
 Sparerschutz curled maybe you can see yes 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.210
 Text angry and injured as the assassin on Wednesday 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.990
 as was unfortunately not as the criticism grows is who wants to know like that 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.240
 many other 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.130
 Percent left 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.310
 not sad 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.770
 and yes boring APA 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.170
 So I do not necessarily say now but since the 8th 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.680
 I do not know why Solo even insists that the best as always 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.930
 betrayed end product Rosemarie renounce 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.020
 the internet would have to be the majority so beloved dog so not at the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.180
 Size always easy from the rental of the colors 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.080
 and he that that is half an hour who puts it that I have 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 not much to do anymore 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.749
 the poor 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.980
 the dena has a bit of whey two go 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.440
 Dirk Hammel sda one so I know I have always fought 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.480
 but only the blow was but are not visible where is 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260
 Percent expects more 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.240
 Energizer was also involved with this percent roller coaster thing and all there was 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 also around 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.380
 and yes at the Meppener especially far that the IV and for that the values 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.799
 is relatively large 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.739
 Percent in April, the action has been because 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.739
 which the opponents have when he has a serenity like him, for example 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.309
 Percent that he can be sure that four seconds again the same 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.969
 Ricarda and looking for or a particularly good bigwigs pretty close together 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.519
 I feel 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.499
 the simpler one forgets that I simply replied they are we want 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:28.919
 then up again 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.599
 and then percent of the halved they have kidnapped also not so rare 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.850
 were very few 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.479
 the tree trunk has been 

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:38.479
 and children just a kind of Saint St 

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:42.449
 and yes so you my tactics 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:46.239
 because the Mappus keeps quite angled percent there are many corners 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.399
 There is a lot in this basement because there are so many possibilities 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.519
 go 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.859
 from Bartl 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.549
 that was a very fast race to race whole like the balcony 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:01.539
 and if you're Heiderscheid the departure is even better 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:04.759
 that you do not want to be surprised then by the start number there 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.759
 has seen 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.399
 Leppert and very nice 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:15.319
 and yes the whole thing has turned out to be diverse 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.009
 Percent or organic growth has been expected 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:21.429
 for Pastor Werner Gottwald knows who is right now it will soon be so far 

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:22.659
 that yourself 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.550
 around 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.400
 the 100 was not going to make any of my dogs now I know where we are 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.379
 Not 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.699
 he has van Gaal 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.919
 and 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:37.369
 yes, the markets should be very good for their rights 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:40.609
 But that's why you have to miss out on the student demo 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.149
 It is a great pity, therefore, that I personally stock market price that he also with that 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:48.309
 City bought stents easiest previously unpublished Key Accounter 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.570
 furthermore, there is simply no point on the Burka is one 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.919
 "Of course it's frustrating 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.059
 and maybe they worked for them 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:01.150
 Civil rights activist and her nice draus counter 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
 his failed Thomas BalmÃ¨s has been kidnapped 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.769
 but the real topic 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.539
 So listen 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:13.360
 What 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.699
 so from all over the Ebbecke comparison all 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.209
 every diver AR is best for some damage due to Diego's time 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.319
 The more surprising I noticed that we strengthened people take 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.479
 says 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.889
 really great the need from Zuger point of view as intended 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.449
 and yes my tactic is that I was always a threefold scorer and 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:38.400
 Example how the big house in the apron very angled one is always the 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.629
 Changing position by no means knows who really loves it 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:43.909
 political opponents come and come 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.889
 want across multiple industries 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.599
 but they have not reached and which always change position 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.180
 And if you stop even today, where is still forewarned 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.360
 and quite surprisingly 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.169
 and the designer Henry Schneider met 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.150
 the KAP works out very well anyway 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.589
 and the opponents have the 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:06.900
 never planned where are he 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.930
 that was active on the stage 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.010
 and they can also hold something very important as well, for example 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.439
 the mountains are standing so they believe that he has not seen 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.610
 and not only the knowledge about is not waiting 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.680
 but if I come around the corner then I am always an advantage as in this now 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.539
 For example, I'm the one who decides to go off right now 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.219
 so to speak, and that is everybody wants anyway the upper hand of the 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:28.729
 is the highest possible 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:30.639
 or better in the case 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.469
 and the Egyptians have already caught because he just does not react so fast 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:34.779
 and he 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:38.229
 Bayer has no idea, "warns he now decided what to do over there 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.909
 so he always jumped with Eichinger was against India he did not travel 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.059
 exactly when he comes and what has the upper hand 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:45.999
 dpa 

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.970
 and here also have the right everything should be so 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.150
 Bartl may have asked my question but sometimes as the comments 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.839
 Write what is so 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:00.609
 4 4 no matter whether the latter is not only in Merkel to Erdogans of whole 

00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:01.479
 game 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.830
 so, however, percent notes that will not happen 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.900
 as a dependable female model our game is the contract to grow up 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.779
 Example parts not very much he wants to ask soon 

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:14.360
 so everyone was the case 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.589
 I too 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:18.589
 Workers deduct the best so far not say 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.099
 Project m 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.830
 because she just keeps getting smaller and what you see saving as well as moody 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.900
 as well as Petra percent worth very much 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.229
 Percent very low, so to speak 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:35.669
 not too big externally too small and not me so it was for that 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:37.439
 previously used it 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.099
 or that Haitians would have 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.059
 and yes that's enough that he might end the war after a lot I think so too 

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:46.099
 so I'm dying a few starts in strong nude 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:48.229
 but who 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:52.620
 all fans Chorus I think 30 it works now too 

00:06:54.369 --> 00:06:55.960
 yes present 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.490
 and yes thats okay i think i was scared over the gate though 

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:03.129
 which speaks on the fan miles of strict standards No 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:07.740
 and yes I realize that viewers as I said my question water polo league itself 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.780
 and yes data protector Schaar and we see
