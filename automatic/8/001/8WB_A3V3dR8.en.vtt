 How to make an Aircraft Carrier 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.100
 First have fun imagining you are a naval engineer, making a plan of how your ship should be 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.620
 On a cardboard, draw the pieces you have to use. 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.240
 Make sure that the hull of the boat is in one piece, because this will give you a better structure to float better. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.220
 Cut with scissors, both the bow and the stern, and join with enough adhesive tape. 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.400
 Do not forget to put keels, because these will give better support to the structure. 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.000
 Now is the time to put on, the runway for takeoff and landing. 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.080
 Let's add a control tower, with small boxes, like those for medicines, and let's paint! 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.480
 Let's paint! The whole boat! 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:41.340
 For greater resistance to water, cover with tape, the entire helmet, which we will also paint, with a red stripe, which will indicate, your level of buoyancy. 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.420
 Make some paper planes, and try to make them land! 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:02.640
 Take your aircraft carrier, somewhere where there is plenty of water, and have fun imagining, as life is, on the high seas! 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.360
 We hope you like it 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.960
 Julio Ferr√°, wishes you the best!
