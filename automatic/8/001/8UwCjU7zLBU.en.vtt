00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.420
 Corinna is okay 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.009
 I'm not quite finished yet 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.729
 from her are over www 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.729
 for a lot of photos made with them feels 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.809
 to date, no photos make such a story 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.939
 I know 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.939
 the story is about things you can see 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 in pictures 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.759
 with 20 4 weeks on the way 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.890
 and have nothing left to run calls 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.740
 they should paint something 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.150
 I was able to get the photos over everything 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.730
 they should write about the American landscape 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.520
 I already have three tracks from publishers I get people standing there like one 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.470
 dumber 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.880
 So what is 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.880
 I'm not finished yet that is 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.770
 you now have your Krefeld 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.540
 the change looks different 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.040
 through the many topics are 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
 the reason why so many photos were taken 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.220
 that's part of the story 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190
 the chancellor 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.200
 Tell me that was the case 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.340
 they did not have the appointment alone 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.510
 and that's the only thing that interests me 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.580
 I finish history in Germany 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.580
 I fly 000 people have them first 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.420
 just enough for the ticket 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.400
 but I wanted to ask her whose push is not overwhelmed 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 they do not get any cases from me 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.910
 and take them seriously Â»have refuted 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.910
 Mischa Cities o'reilly 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.360
 I tell the publisher that every person is different 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.930
 and that has nothing to do with the cause
