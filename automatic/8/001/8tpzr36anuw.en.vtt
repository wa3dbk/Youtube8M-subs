00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 and the carnival has its rules that only 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.730
 the initiates know these rules and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.630
 especially its stages, the first of which was 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 all its importance 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.940
 the chapel but what is this a 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.800
 chapel flanders television leaned 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.449
 on this concept that for carnivals 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.289
 do not necessarily rhyme with things 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.289
 very catholic 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.859
 good then we're here at the chapel of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.330
 florence or at bayonne his person 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.990
 I say no bullshit altogether 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.610
 is at home 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.930
 good then and then a chapel is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.850
 what is not a little church a 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.780
 chapel not his mates there was no 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.149
 all these churches towns to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 carnavalous a chapel it's for me 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.140
 it's a place of conviviality 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.789
 your life your friends I give them to 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.860
 eat you give them to wood and upa sa 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.629
 great time before going 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.100
 carnival to go do a bac to go 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.570
 make a band whatever you want 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 ok, you've been doing it for a long time 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.800
 chapel you at home then me it's done 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.480
 three years that I do chapel but my 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.230
 parents make chapel since at least 15 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.399
 years 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.870
 okay so this is father's carnival in 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.910
 son in fact carnival from father to son 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.840
 absolutely true I took over 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.489
 still big if I understood the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.780
 concept of the chapel is to take 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.400
 a bit of strength to drink a little shot 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.380
 with friends before going to the ball 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.900
 carnival or in the streets of bailleul 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310
 kind of yeah that's it we'll say 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.950
 that it's a warming up having 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.630
 get down to business 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.979
 ok ok I believe a person who 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.780
 was coming apple tech in general pretty much 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.399
 so me here I'm doing small 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.950
 chapels we'll say twenty or so 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.600
 people but when my parents home 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.890
 do and I do not like to tell the world 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.830
 because we are really dangerous here 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.880
 we must we all have to push for 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.800
 to have room for everyone 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.480
 okay in you you explain that actually 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.980
 you do chapel with your friends but 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.300
 there are also people who invite to ed 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.350
 not necessarily that buddies this is where 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.060
 that everyone can go into his 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.740
 dance how there are chapels where 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.000
 everyone can go in I think that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.320
 it's more on the dunkirk side 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.720
 bailleul that's it works more by 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.220
 invitation us here it's a chapel 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.320
 we will say private in quotation marks because 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.880
 that it was the friends who received a 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.890
 invitation example tonight rendezvous 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.050

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.420
