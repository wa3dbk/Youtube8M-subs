00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
from you but it it really wraps round I

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.950 
from you but it it really wraps round I
know<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.820> sounds<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.210> bit<00:02:33.240> weird<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.930> was

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
know it sounds a bit weird but I was

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.260 
know it sounds a bit weird but I was
watching<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.500> film<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.920> this<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:36.000> suddenly

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
watching a film on this and I suddenly

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.170 
watching a film on this and I suddenly
realized<00:02:36.840> how<00:02:37.160> stereo<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.430> all<00:02:38.640> sounded

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
realized how stereo it all sounded

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.910 
realized how stereo it all sounded
compared<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.930> when<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.110> watch<00:02:40.380> stuff<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.800> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
compared to when you watch stuff on the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.010 
compared to when you watch stuff on the
old<00:02:41.070> iPad<00:02:41.490> Mini<00:02:41.730> which<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.180> know<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.720> got<00:02:42.840> two

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
old iPad Mini which I know it's got two

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.570 
old iPad Mini which I know it's got two
little<00:02:43.170> grills<00:02:43.530> there<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.220> seem<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.460> recall

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
little grills there but I seem to recall

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.760 
little grills there but I seem to recall
this<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.090> actually<00:02:45.420> just<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.690> mono<00:02:45.960> speaker<00:02:46.080> and

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
this is actually just a mono speaker and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.350 
this is actually just a mono speaker and
it's<00:02:46.980> fairly<00:02:47.250> rubbish<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.820> don't<00:02:47.970> get<00:02:48.180> that

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
it's fairly rubbish you don't get that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.660 
it's fairly rubbish you don't get that
sense<00:02:48.660> of<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:48.960> sound<00:02:49.230> being<00:02:49.950> all<00:02:50.100> around<00:02:50.250> you

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
processing this played it back

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.670

little<00:04:03.720> standby<00:04:04.200> mode<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:05.280> loses<00:04:05.910> about<00:04:06.060> 10%

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
little standby mode it loses about 10%

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.200 
little standby mode it loses about 10%
of<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.050> battery<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.440> day<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:08.160> old<00:04:08.250> iPad<00:04:08.700> Mini<00:04:09.000> I

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
of the battery a day the old iPad Mini I

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.400 
of the battery a day the old iPad Mini I
don't<00:04:09.360> know<00:04:09.420> how<00:04:09.510> they<00:04:09.630> do<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:09.990> but<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.230> can

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
don't know how they do it but you can

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.200 
don't know how they do it but you can
put<00:04:10.920> this<00:04:11.040> thing<00:04:11.250> on<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.400> standby<00:04:11.820> come<00:04:12.060> back

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
put this thing on a standby come back

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.050 
put this thing on a standby come back
days<00:04:12.510> later<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.140> it's<00:04:13.230> still<00:04:13.320> on<00:04:13.590> 100%<00:04:14.070> so

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
days later and it's still on 100% so

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.599 
days later and it's still on 100% so
this<00:04:15.270> isn't<00:04:15.570> as<00:04:15.900> good<00:04:16.170> but<00:04:17.040> also<00:04:17.460> I<00:04:17.489> don't

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
this isn't as good but also I don't

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.310 
this isn't as good but also I don't
think<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.000> battery<00:04:18.359> life<00:04:18.510> is<00:04:18.720> as<00:04:18.960> bad<00:04:19.290> as

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
think it's battery life is as bad as

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.650 
think it's battery life is as bad as
some<00:04:19.620> commentators<00:04:20.580> have<00:04:20.790> suggested<00:04:21.090> what

some commentators have suggested what
you<00:04:21.780> do<00:04:21.989> tend<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.440> find<00:04:22.700> is<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.970> little

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
you do tend to find is that the little

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.030 
you do tend to find is that the little
battery<00:04:24.510> icon<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.290> top<00:04:25.500> right<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.920> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
you swipe the notification down and you

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.100 
you swipe the notification down and you
look<00:04:38.830> at<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.099> battery<00:04:39.460> as<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.610> percentage<00:04:40.360> it's

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
look at the battery as a percentage it's

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.499 
look at the battery as a percentage it's
a<00:04:41.259> lot<00:04:41.469> higher<00:04:41.860> than<00:04:42.280> you<00:04:42.789> would<00:04:42.819> think<00:04:42.939> just

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
a lot higher than you would think just

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.629 
a lot higher than you would think just
by<00:04:43.629> looking<00:04:43.990> at<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.169> little<00:04:44.409> icon<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:45.460> top

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
by looking at the little icon in the top

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.369 
by looking at the little icon in the top
right<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.909> the<00:04:46.150> screen<00:04:46.300> so<00:04:46.840> sometimes<00:04:47.259> you

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
right of the screen so sometimes you

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:48.749 
right of the screen so sometimes you
look<00:04:47.469> at<00:04:47.590> that<00:04:47.710> you<00:04:47.800> think<00:04:47.949> huh<00:04:48.099> it's<00:04:48.460> about<00:04:48.639> to

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:48.759 
look at that you think huh it's about to

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.510 
look at that you think huh it's about to
run<00:04:48.879> out<00:04:49.030> of<00:04:49.060> power<00:04:49.330> in<00:04:49.629> fact<00:04:50.199> it's<00:04:50.469> got<00:04:50.590> 4050

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
run out of power in fact it's got 4050

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.980 
run out of power in fact it's got 4050
percent<00:04:51.669> then<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.060> icon<00:04:52.210> just<00:04:52.629> looks<00:04:52.810> like

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
percent then the icon just looks like

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.749 
percent then the icon just looks like
it's<00:04:53.139> half<00:04:53.319> empty<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.310> don't<00:04:54.639> know<00:04:54.699> if

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
it's half empty so I don't know if

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.279 
it's half empty so I don't know if
that's<00:04:54.939> a<00:04:55.060> thing<00:04:55.270> that's<00:04:55.300> specific<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.080> the

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
that's a thing that's specific to the

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.469 
that's a thing that's specific to the
huddle<00:04:56.620> but<00:04:56.919> it's<00:04:57.099> just<00:04:57.340> something<00:04:57.669> that<00:04:58.300> I

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
huddle but it's just something that I

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.850

think worth a look it is slightly

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.450 
think worth a look it is slightly
heavier<00:05:28.449> than<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.199> old<00:05:29.229> iPad<00:05:29.800> Mini<00:05:30.039> and<00:05:30.219> it<00:05:30.340> is

heavier than the old iPad Mini and it is
slightly<00:05:30.699> thicker<00:05:31.180> as<00:05:31.479> well<00:05:31.659> it's<00:05:31.870> a<00:05:31.960> couple

slightly thicker as well it's a couple

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.290 
slightly thicker as well it's a couple
of<00:05:32.409> millimetres<00:05:32.979> thicker<00:05:33.699> I'll<00:05:33.939> see<00:05:34.180> if<00:05:34.270> we

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
of millimetres thicker I'll see if we

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.670 
of millimetres thicker I'll see if we
can<00:05:34.479> pick<00:05:34.689> that<00:05:34.719> up<00:05:34.870> on<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.139> camera<00:05:35.379> it's<00:05:35.650> a
