00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.049
 hi all guys found me in 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.600
 this new video as the title suggests 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.280
 today we will go to both xsara and 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.400
 murder and soul suspect in limited 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.139
 edition for playstation 4 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 if you want to know some information 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.160
 on the game I did a few days ago a 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.460
 then video of expectations previews 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.560
 you can find it in description ea 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.439
 screen by clicking on the cover of 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.230
 game right now 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.700
 well this point I would say without further 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.030
 delay to go and unpack the game 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.940
 and see this limited edition what 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.680
 contains must be said immediately that this is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.469
 a limited edition betrayed read little 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.800
 limit in the sense that it is the day one 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.840
 edition essentially I'm not sure 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.480
 that there is a version in the shops 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.239
 at least in its current state 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.430
 different from this you see in mine 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.280
 possession right now then 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.100
 square outer carton pack 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.869
 enix has more or less always done them 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:16.490
 let's see this type let's try to open it 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:22.259
 without destroying it and it will be a business 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:25.979
 nothing is just sir she is stuck 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:32.850
 then we try to make her robe made 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:36.030
 well inside I'm breaking with the help 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.150
 We were able to open some scissors 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.630
 pack and see these trojans 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.540
 inside then go 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.100
 here we are ok empty pack 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.430
 let's put it this way 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.740
 exact that should be the 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.950
 the diary I don't know if of the protagonist 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.470
 however journal it is written I don't know if 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.270
 let you see something about yourself there are 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.490
 these strange symbols that are those 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.370
 that the other protagonist will meet at 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.660
 apparently in the world of the dead o 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.250
 however in the world in which it comes 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.709
 sent once dead see you there 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.940
 of things written in English 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.240
 yes ok there are half images 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.120
 almost anyway I browsed artbook 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.580
 quickly beautiful the effect of the feint 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.110
 skin practically does the effect a bit 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.420
 of the uncharted limited 3 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.890
 if you remember if you have got to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.820
 touching it with your hand is the kof that effect 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.500
 there and then we have the game in standard 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.020
 there is nothing written about it alone 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.020
 particularities as you have already written by 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.900
 do not sell separately but do not exist 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:54.310
 written in front of the classic stamp 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.640
 then very annoying yellow 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.739
 I repeat probably being a day one 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.650
 edition however avoided pastro 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.650
 clear but I might have liked it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.709
 as on the cover the bandella limited 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.380
 top edition maybe even mister has it 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.800
 right in the game drive 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.880
 nothing they opted for not to sell 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.760
 separately then we go to open e 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.739
 ok, oh well you lived part code 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.910
 what is registration on the site 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.700
 of the square enix 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.190
 oh well if you want you can register it instead 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.920
 maybe work already recorded the disc of 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.799
 I play the problem pretty well 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.560
 behind is this cover printed with 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.019
 the writings that really annoys and 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.430
 nothing this is the booklet but can 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.239
 strategic digital work already 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.470
 redeemed to those who are just like this this is 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.110
 the marvel booklet is behind it 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.110
 health warnings precautions 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.959
 really inside you can do it 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.790
 but really this is it 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.010
 and here's a quick overview of that 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.470
 which contains the limited edition of 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.140
 murder songs aspect as we all know 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.019
 the game is a fairly ambitious game 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.510
 I also read on the posters in the store that 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.310
 there was talk of an experience without 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.250
 previous a thing never seen before 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.390
 we'll see if the game will live up to it 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.489
 of expectations 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.190
 I thank you all for that 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.740
 we will see each other maybe week 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.870
 next or maybe later because there is 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.180
 the three and a half anyway with the 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.639
 impressions or with some 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.340
 opinions about the game in question 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:39.120
 thanks to all a greeting to others 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.120
 hello video
