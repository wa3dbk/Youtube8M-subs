00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 It's time to take the road 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.120
 Once a lot of people come back home. 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.280
 after Christmas and New Year 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.990

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.780
 but did you see your car? 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.330
 the schedule for a safe trip 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.090
 starts with a checkup on the automobile are 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.490
 some care you should take or take the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.510
 vehicle to the workshop the 15 days 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.310
 advance 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.529
 When it is time to leave, it does not have any type 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.810
 surprise in this review should be 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.640
 conferred the main items as 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.480
 oil level and engine oil level. 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.969
 radiator 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.520
 it's time to change the guitar brakes 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.920
 including the pads and the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.840
 buffers is still important to do 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 alignment and balancing the lights 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 panel warning should be 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.690
 verified are they that indicate if the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 battery is being charged if the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.870
 Engine oil pressure is okay so the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.670
 cebs the abs system are working 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.050
 now an alert on the obligations of 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.660
 every driver 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.789
 many of them are obvious but we have 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.500
 I repeat, always see if everything is 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.960
 right with your driver's license 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.909
 the car document the fire extinguisher 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.490
 fire that needs to be inside the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.979
 Validity will want to get rid of the cell phone 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.270
 on vacation in an emergency as you go 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.250
 ask for help 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 Before you take the road, see how 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.450
 the windshield wiper blades on the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.460
 time to calibrate tire pressure 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.250
 must follow what the car manual says 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.590
 full even do not forget the steppe 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.259
 in there under the trunk must be 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.990
 in order also the monkey triangle and 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 wrench check still flashlights 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.420
 brake lights and headlamps for greater 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.430
 safety the easy low always 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 now what helps a lot is a kit of 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.409
 emergence seen worth carrying key 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.630
 Phillips screwdriver a Phillips screwdriver 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.740
 starting auxiliary cable for the battery 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.680
 A set of fuse and lamp reserves 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.960
 GPS flashlight to a liter of oil 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.270
 engine is advisable not to mention a good 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.610
 piece of wire that can break branches 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.070
 and awesome at the time of the squeeze 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.350
 the other thing never bring loose objects 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.629
 inside the car they can hurt you 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.270
 if a trunk strike happens 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.410
 It's for this, it's all up to date now. 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.830
 Careful with you. 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.690
 the biggest villains are sleep and alcohol 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.820
 I would not even need to reinforce here that 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.390
 You should never drink and drive, huh? 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.460
 But sleep a lot of people organize everything for 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.130
 to travel at dawn right 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.620
 accustomed to the schedule in this case 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.410
 do this, you better try to fight the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.660
 sleep because they will always beat you 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.280
 the show also causes a heat wear 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 brings wear very great wear 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.840
 very large so it is important to 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.060
 every two hours a quick stop to 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.070
 take a stretch in the body to take a 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.920
 light snack do not rush to arrive 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.350
 destiny even exceeding the limits of 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.739
 speed time will not cooperate to 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.739
 your favor 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.780
 at any sign of rain the driver 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.920
 should immediately slow down 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.660
 increase the distance from the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.580
 vehicle ahead of you 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.590
 turn your headlights on and redouble your attention 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.060
 because the risk of an accident becomes 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.890
 much bigger when the weather is rainy 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.080
 do not have an error 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.160
 following these guidelines and respecting 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.680
 the signaling 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.370
 You have a good chance of a good 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.370
 trip
