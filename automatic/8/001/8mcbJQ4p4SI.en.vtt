piece<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.930> Molly<00:01:31.259> gear<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> attach<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
piece of Molly gear and attach it to

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.069 
piece of Molly gear and attach it to
almost<00:01:32.610> any<00:01:32.850> other<00:01:33.000> piece<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.600> Molly<00:01:33.869> gear

almost any other piece of Molly gear

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
almost any other piece of Molly gear
carrier<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:34.740> say<00:01:35.460> almost<00:01:35.670> because<00:01:35.909> there's<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
carrier I say almost because there's a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.609 
carrier I say almost because there's a
couple<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.689> exceptions<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> rule<00:01:37.590> but

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
couple of exceptions to the rule but

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.520 
couple of exceptions to the rule but
those<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.610> few<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.880> far<00:01:38.909> between<00:01:39.320> so<00:01:40.320> first

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
those are few and far between so first

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.210 
those are few and far between so first
thing<00:01:40.650> we're<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.860> do<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.009> we're<00:01:41.159> gonna

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.190 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
drive<00:01:41.400> fit<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.899> want<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> make

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
drive fit this because I want to make

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.569 
drive fit this because I want to make
sure<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> right<00:01:43.890> position<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
sure that it's in the right position and

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.130 
sure that it's in the right position and
I<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.909> make<00:01:45.000> sure<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.780> enough

I want to make sure that I have enough

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.170 
I want to make sure that I have enough
of<00:01:46.200> these<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:46.829> enough<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.100> these<00:01:47.189> for<00:01:48.090> each

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
of these for enough of these for each

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.609 
of these for enough of these for each
one<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> these<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.780> gonna<00:01:48.869> go<00:01:49.049> into<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> gaps

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
one of these it's gonna go into the gaps

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.569 
one of these it's gonna go into the gaps
between<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:51.240> ladder<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.369> we're

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
between the ladder on here so we're

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.219 
between the ladder on here so we're
gonna<00:01:53.670> drive<00:01:53.880> fit<00:01:54.090> it<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
gonna drive fit it just like this to

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.580 
gonna drive fit it just like this to
make<00:01:55.380> sure<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:55.979> enough<00:01:56.009> space<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
make sure that I have enough space and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.219 
make sure that I have enough space and
there<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.680> go<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.009> should<00:01:59.040> work<00:01:59.960> now<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
there we go that should work now in this

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
there we go that should work now in this
case<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.740> know<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.790> hat<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.149> panel

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
case I know that the this hat the panel

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.300 
case I know that the this hat the panel
the<00:02:03.509> back<00:02:03.659> panel<00:02:03.930> has<00:02:04.079> 12<00:02:04.469> across<00:02:04.770> 12<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.250> these

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the back panel has 12 across 12 of these

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.340 
the back panel has 12 across 12 of these
loops<00:02:05.610> across<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> want<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.750> put<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.020> in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
loops across so I want to put this in

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.499 
loops across so I want to put this in
the<00:02:08.069> middle<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.700> back<00:02:08.910> section<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.420> it's

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the middle of this back section so it's

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.200 
the middle of this back section so it's
going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.780> three<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.410> and

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
going to be three in and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.690 
going to be three in and
we<00:02:12.570> three<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.050> well<00:02:13.460> now<00:02:14.460> what<00:02:14.610> we're

we three and as well now what we're

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.050 
we three and as well now what we're
gonna<00:02:14.790> do<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.270> we're<00:02:15.390> going<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.600> weave<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.380> in

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
gonna do is we're going to weave this in

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.250 
gonna do is we're going to weave this in
just<00:02:18.060> like<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.420> we're<00:02:18.840> gonna<00:02:18.930> weave<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
just like this we're gonna weave the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.170 
just like this we're gonna weave the
straps<00:02:19.530> into<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> moly<00:02:20.220> gear<00:02:20.520> first<00:02:20.760> onto<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
straps into the moly gear first onto the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.390 
straps into the moly gear first onto the
vest<00:02:21.480> or<00:02:22.170> whatever<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> carrier<00:02:22.920> happens<00:02:23.310> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
vest or whatever the carrier happens to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.920 
vest or whatever the carrier happens to
be<00:02:23.490> if<00:02:23.580> you're<00:02:23.700> using<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.090> like<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> front<00:02:24.690> vest

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
you would put it on the front vest first

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.220 
you would put it on the front vest first
or<00:02:27.060> if<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:27.300> have<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.450> belt<00:02:27.660> system<00:02:27.960> on<00:02:28.050> if<00:02:28.170> you

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
or if you have a belt system on if you

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.050 
or if you have a belt system on if you

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
put it on that first now you're gonna

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.510 
put it on that first now you're gonna
weave<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.420> through<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:31.740> actual<00:02:32.190> piece<00:02:32.490> of

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
weave it through the actual piece of

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.010 
weave it through the actual piece of
moly<00:02:32.820> gear<00:02:33.090> itself<00:02:33.390> or<00:02:33.600> whatever<00:02:33.840> the

moly gear itself or whatever the
whatever<00:02:34.410> you're<00:02:34.620> attaching<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.610> vest

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
whatever you're attaching to the vest

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.520 
whatever you're attaching to the vest
just<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.960> then<00:02:39.960> you're<00:02:40.050> gonna<00:02:40.170> tighten

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
just like that then you're gonna tighten

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.720 
just like that then you're gonna tighten
it<00:02:40.560> down<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.800> make<00:02:41.070> sure<00:02:41.100> there's<00:02:41.310> no<00:02:41.370> excess

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
it down to make sure there's no excess

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.790 
it down to make sure there's no excess
strap<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.420> then<00:02:43.080> we're<00:02:43.230> going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> repeat

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
strap and then we're going to repeat

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.920 
strap and then we're going to repeat
this<00:02:43.980> step<00:02:44.040> all<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.300> way<00:02:45.420> down<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.780> MOLLE

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
this step all the way down the MOLLE

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
this step all the way down the MOLLE
vest<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:52.710> last<00:02:52.950> couple<00:02:53.340> are<00:02:53.400> always<00:02:53.640> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
vest the last couple are always the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.320 
vest the last couple are always the
hardest<00:02:55.250> now<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.490> thing<00:02:56.580> you'll<00:02:56.730> notice<00:02:56.940> is

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
hardest now one thing you'll notice is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.840 
hardest now one thing you'll notice is
that<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:58.020> could<00:02:58.980> just<00:02:59.190> attach<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.490> right<00:02:59.670> here

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
that I could just attach it right here

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.630 
that I could just attach it right here
but<00:03:00.660> to<00:03:00.810> really<00:03:01.170> get<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.440> solid<00:03:01.800> they<00:03:02.430> really

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
but to really get a solid they really

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.150 
but to really get a solid they really
get<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> solid<00:03:03.120> keep<00:03:03.630> on<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.680> want<00:03:04.830> to<00:03:05.010> make

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
get a solid keep on it you want to make

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.070 
get a solid keep on it you want to make
sure<00:03:05.190> that<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.550> last<00:03:05.790> weave<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:06.870> make

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
sure that the last weave that you make

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.560 
sure that the last weave that you make
is<00:03:07.380> actually<00:03:08.070> on<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.400> platform<00:03:08.850> itself<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.450> in

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
is actually on the platform itself so in

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.940 
is actually on the platform itself so in
this<00:03:09.660> case<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.020> last<00:03:10.170> weave<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.470> gonna<00:03:10.530> be<00:03:10.740> on

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
tight now this has a snap system so

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.100 
tight now this has a snap system so
we're<00:03:24.210> just<00:03:24.240> gonna<00:03:24.450> snap<00:03:24.870> these<00:03:25.080> shut<00:03:26.180> on<00:03:27.180> both

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
we're just gonna snap these shut on both

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.710 
we're just gonna snap these shut on both
sides<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.800> I'm<00:03:29.790> now<00:03:30.000> ready<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.300> play<00:03:30.450> stock

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
sides and I'm now ready to play stock

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.650 
sides and I'm now ready to play stock
class<00:03:30.990> with<00:03:31.350> my<00:03:31.470> molly<00:03:31.650> gear<00:03:32.360> now<00:03:33.360> that's<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
class with my molly gear now that's the

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.030 
class with my molly gear now that's the
right<00:03:33.810> way<00:03:33.960> to<00:03:34.020> do<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.230> let<00:03:34.710> me<00:03:34.740> show<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:34.980> guys

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
right way to do it let me show you guys

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.470 
right way to do it let me show you guys
the<00:03:35.160> wrong<00:03:35.490> way<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.700> do<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.210> way<00:03:36.300> that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
the wrong way to do it and the way that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
the wrong way to do it and the way that
this<00:03:36.980> individual<00:03:37.980> did<00:03:38.900> and<00:03:39.900> I'm<00:03:39.990> not<00:03:40.140> passing

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
this individual did and I'm not passing

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.170 
this individual did and I'm not passing
judgment<00:03:40.530> here<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.370> if<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.790> don't<00:03:41.940> you

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
judgment here because if you don't you

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.910 
judgment here because if you don't you
know<00:03:42.240> if<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.230> don't<00:03:43.380> ask<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.710> don't<00:03:43.770> learn

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
know if you don't ask you don't learn

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.200 
know if you don't ask you don't learn
now<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:46.950> lot<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.280> some<00:03:47.610> people<00:03:47.790> will<00:03:47.910> do<00:03:48.030> is

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
now a lot of some people will do is

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.150 
now a lot of some people will do is
they'll<00:03:48.360> cheat<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.410> what<00:03:49.710> they'll<00:03:49.830> do<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:49.980> I'll

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
they'll cheat so what they'll do is I'll

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.800 
they'll cheat so what they'll do is I'll
actually<00:03:50.280> attach<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.790> Molly<00:03:50.970> here<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.690> the

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
actually attach the Molly here to the

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.040 
actually attach the Molly here to the
top<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.610> then<00:03:53.610> strap<00:03:54.210> it<00:03:54.360> down<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.780> bottom

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
top and then strap it down on the bottom

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.080 
top and then strap it down on the bottom
like<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.890> they'll<00:03:59.250> say<00:03:59.370> okay<00:03:59.670> I'm<00:03:59.820> done

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
like that and they'll say okay I'm done

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.060 
like that and they'll say okay I'm done
and<00:04:00.330> then<00:04:00.720> they'll<00:04:00.930> bring<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.560> over<00:04:01.740> and

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
and then they'll bring this over and

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.390 
and then they'll bring this over and
they<00:04:02.160> will<00:04:02.720> snap<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.870> shut<00:04:04.010> like<00:04:05.010> that<00:04:05.250> but

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
they will snap it shut like that but

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.740 
they will snap it shut like that but
you'll<00:04:05.520> notice<00:04:05.670> one<00:04:05.880> thing<00:04:05.910> about<00:04:06.210> that<00:04:06.450> is

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
you'll notice one thing about that is

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.440 
you'll notice one thing about that is
that<00:04:07.020> now<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:07.410> is<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.800> loose<00:04:08.300> and<00:04:09.300> this

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
that now this is really loose and this

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.600 
that now this is really loose and this
is<00:04:09.570> gonna<00:04:09.660> flop<00:04:09.990> around<00:04:10.320> now<00:04:10.500> for<00:04:11.160> ten<00:04:11.340> round

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
is gonna flop around now for ten round

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.800 
is gonna flop around now for ten round
tubes<00:04:11.880> that's<00:04:12.030> not<00:04:12.210> gonna<00:04:12.330> be<00:04:12.420> really<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.630> big

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
tubes that's not gonna be really a big

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.160 
tubes that's not gonna be really a big
deal<00:04:13.190> if<00:04:14.190> you're<00:04:14.460> doing<00:04:14.880> two<00:04:15.570> pods<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.049> are

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
deal if you're doing two pods that are

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.200 
deal if you're doing two pods that are
full<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.380> paints<00:04:16.770> then<00:04:17.549> starts<00:04:17.940> become<00:04:18.180> a

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:18.210 
full of paints then starts become a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.450 
full of paints then starts become a
really<00:04:18.480> big<00:04:18.630> deal<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:20.010> want<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.340> actually

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
really big deal so you want to actually

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.620 
really big deal so you want to actually
take<00:04:20.790> a<00:04:20.850> little<00:04:21.030> bit<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.210> time<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.570> actually

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
take a little bit of time and actually

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.450 
take a little bit of time and actually
weave<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.260> all<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.620> way<00:04:22.740> through<00:04:23.040> so<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.370> you

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
weave it all the way through so that you

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
weave it all the way through so that you
have<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.580> nice

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
have a nice

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.790 
have a nice
it's<00:04:25.480> just<00:04:25.750> gonna<00:04:25.990> it's<00:04:26.110> not<00:04:26.200> gonna<00:04:26.350> budge<00:04:26.590> on

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
it's just gonna it's not gonna budge on

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.160 
it's just gonna it's not gonna budge on
you<00:04:26.920> there<00:04:27.850> are<00:04:28.030> different<00:04:28.360> ways<00:04:28.660> to<00:04:28.810> do<00:04:28.930> Molly

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
you there are different ways to do Molly

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.530 
you there are different ways to do Molly
gear<00:04:29.530> now<00:04:29.680> there<00:04:29.860> are<00:04:30.070> other<00:04:30.970> systems<00:04:31.270> that

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
gear now there are other systems that

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.330 
gear now there are other systems that
exist<00:04:31.960> out<00:04:32.110> there<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.470> make<00:04:32.620> them<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:33.010> weaving

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
exist out there to make them the weaving

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.700 
exist out there to make them the weaving
process<00:04:33.370> faster<00:04:34.240> there's<00:04:35.230> something<00:04:35.620> out

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
process faster there's something out

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.980 
process faster there's something out
there<00:04:35.860> called<00:04:35.890> malice<00:04:36.490> clips<00:04:36.700> which<00:04:37.510> I'm<00:04:37.810> not

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
there called malice clips which I'm not

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.570 
there called malice clips which I'm not
exactly<00:04:38.200> sure<00:04:38.440> how<00:04:38.470> they<00:04:38.890> work<00:04:39.130> but<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:39.460> can

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
exactly sure how they work but you can

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.340 
exactly sure how they work but you can
probably<00:04:39.670> find<00:04:40.000> several<00:04:40.630> videos<00:04:40.870> on<00:04:40.990> YouTube

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
probably find several videos on YouTube

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.560 
probably find several videos on YouTube
to<00:04:41.500> explain<00:04:41.830> those<00:04:42.010> and<00:04:42.970> there's<00:04:43.210> other

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
to explain those and there's other

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.030 
to explain those and there's other
systems<00:04:43.990> as<00:04:44.110> well<00:04:44.290> there's<00:04:44.740> a<00:04:44.770> lot<00:04:44.920> of

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
systems as well there's a lot of

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.310 
systems as well there's a lot of
third-party<00:04:45.970> systems<00:04:46.750> that<00:04:46.900> work<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:47.230> the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
third-party systems that work in the

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.870 
third-party systems that work in the
same<00:04:47.500> principle<00:04:47.950> but<00:04:48.070> they<00:04:48.430> all<00:04:48.550> use<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.850> same

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
same principle but they all use the same

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.240 
same principle but they all use the same
basic<00:04:49.420> carrier<00:04:49.930> system<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:50.680> they<00:04:50.980> all<00:04:51.070> have

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
basic carrier system so they all have

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.040 
basic carrier system so they all have
the<00:04:51.370> one-inch<00:04:51.670> loops<00:04:51.940> so<00:04:52.660> that's<00:04:52.840> your<00:04:52.930> basic
