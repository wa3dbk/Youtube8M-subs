00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
something that's stuck with me I tried

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.210 
something that's stuck with me I tried
to<00:00:31.750> bring<00:00:31.960> that<00:00:32.079> into<00:00:32.290> everything<00:00:32.559> I<00:00:32.800> do<00:00:32.860> as<00:00:33.190> a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220

that extra layer is something that's

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.650 
that extra layer is something that's
important<00:00:39.070> even<00:00:39.190> if<00:00:39.399> it's<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.670> work<00:00:40.059> without<00:00:40.239> a
