00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.049
 today I have a super video 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:11.599
 interesting is a review about me 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.599
 first post volume express 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.060
 this review was requested by valeria ramÃ­rez 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.210
 two months ago more important or I 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.349
 I think the great innovation with mega 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:28.290
 plus is the formula if it talks about a 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.930
 new formula that gives mega volume but 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.110
 that will not leave lashes or harsh 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.629
 nor that the mask of 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.960
 tabs to pieces to the contrary and of 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.960
 fact 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.060
 it's kind of described as a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.160
 kind of gel or mousse 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.080
 and that this will help you to leave 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.690
 your lashes soft during the day 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.760
 so if it's like a proposal 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.320
 different 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.930
 and if that's why I wanted her more than anything 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.780
 try and good says super bulky and 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.170
 more flexible or promises much much 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.780
 a lot of mega volume and also tabs 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.640
 flexible things that are usually 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.410
 as divorced not always we have 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.870
 super-cute lashes feel super 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.210
 uncomfortable with some formulas then 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:22.210
 that is the great wonder 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.910
 This is in 271 baby blacks point 3 ounces 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.350
 or 9 milliliters is a little less than 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.270
 It always touches me that they are 10 or 11 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.820
 milliliters what masks have 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.470
 eyelashes but still I do not feel that the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.460
 go to dig the is using two 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.610
 months it almost costs 155 pesos I bought it 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.340
 in walmart I've seen it in a range of 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.050
 155 and 160 pesos really yes it's a 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.080
 very different formula feels very 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.930
 soft when applying you can go adding the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.040
 layers and it does not dry so fast if you do not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.280
 I feel that it is falling during 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.030
 or that begins to break the mask and 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.180
 begins to fall the brush has is a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.990
 brush more or less medium-sized or 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.810
 big if you do not have how it is not very fine 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.480
 the brush is very thick is very small 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.040
 If your eyes are very eyes torn with 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.620
 Asian descent and others I think it's 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.690
 a bit problematic because at the tip 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.910
 it's not even enough 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.040
 garitano like to get to parties 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.890
 difficult and his eye is very small 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.080
 then you have to consider that the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.640
 fibers are plastic fibers and are 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.040
 fibers that look like they do not have a 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.290
 special order they go as towards all 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.610
 sides but I think that helps a lot 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.630
 create the volume I started to realize 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.790
 I have to 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.790
 show me the tabs to use it 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.350
 things that do not happen to me very often 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.950
 it even never happens to me 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.960
 because I realized that I do not know if the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.690
 formula even though you do not feel 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.410
 heavy the formula is somewhat heavy for 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.830
 my eyelashes and this and if I do not know it in 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.360
 Chinese as the day goes by I give myself 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.880
 I realize that the 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.720
 eyelashes which is I really like that 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.840
 It is very black 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.450
 because sometimes not 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.250
 there are not as blacks more blacks though 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.610
 say it's the blackest black in the 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.870
 line I like that this one is very black 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:29.170
 the formula is thick it is not dry but 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.670
 it is only thick because of this that it is 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.670
 a kind of gel mousse 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.540
 they are about around 45 I do not know about 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.650
 the layers that saw me put and good 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.860
 basically here is the result 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.590
 can buy one eye with the other is a 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.900
 good mascara if it is like 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.900
 conclusion but I think that 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:58.640
 it's like 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:03.050
 go do not expect a huge huge huge 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.690
 difference with this one because if you do your 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.180
 work if it gives volume lengthens the 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.340
 eyelashes are very flexible they remain very 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.670
 soft do not fall does not run does not 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.440
 sweeps however I think there are better and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.630
 is that the result they want is a 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.010
 little more dramatic here I do a 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.570
 good price makes me a good 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.390
 investment is me a good mask of 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.110
 eyelashes in general I think it 's one of 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.930
 the keys that leaves a very finished 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.030
 simple very natural especially I think 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.310
 which is good for those who are looking 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.650
 a mascara that looks very 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.960
 natural around the whole day that you 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.620
 last all day that does not fall does not 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.720
 bar does not run and so on and I also think 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.880
 which is a great option I know many of 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.730
 you in this channel are very chavita 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.700
 I have many subscribers who have 13 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.440
 14 15 years and I think this is a very 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.590
 good choice for you because number 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.790
 one is not breaking the little pig 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.090
 buying super eyelash masks 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.510
 faces 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.840
 and I think it gives some very very very eyelashes 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.300
 natural but if the eye is opened what 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.270
 enough the formula allows highlighting 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:15.210
 your eyes without that mascara 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.830
 be the protagonist but all your eye 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.460
 is the protagonist I do not know if I explain 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.010
 it highlights without being too without the 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.550
 formula is very comfortable what they promise is 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.460
 very true it is very soft what leaves not 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.800
 maybe it's not in my point of view very 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.220
 Personal my favorite mascara 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.200
 because I do look for a hairline more like 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.740
 a little bit more like my boli max scheler 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.250
 we will be giving is like the bar not of 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.320
 to size 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.870
 then yes yes remodeling in this here 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.180
 this is like here or is missing a 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.700
 little to get is a very good 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.520
 eyelash mask I recommend it on 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.930
 everything in the cases that I mentioned before 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.280
 and then that's all 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.129
 Well I see them until next 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.639
 video and have a very nice week 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:01.639
 my
