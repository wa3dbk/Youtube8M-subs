hello again thanks for joining me I want

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.180 
hello again thanks for joining me I want
to<00:00:03.210> talk<00:00:03.389> to<00:00:03.540> you<00:00:03.629> about<00:00:03.750> fire<00:00:04.290> line<00:00:04.650> because<00:00:05.160> I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
to talk to you about fire line because I

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.220 
to talk to you about fire line because I
think<00:00:05.339> it's<00:00:05.730> an<00:00:05.879> absolutely<00:00:06.480> excellent

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
think it's an absolutely excellent

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.220 
think it's an absolutely excellent
beading<00:00:07.890> thread<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.940> actually<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.599> fishing

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
beading thread it's actually a fishing

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.890 
beading thread it's actually a fishing
line<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.740> it's<00:00:11.250> braided<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> very<00:00:12.540> fine

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
line and it's braided with a very fine

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.550 
line and it's braided with a very fine
waxy<00:00:13.710> coating<00:00:14.389> comes<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.660> few<00:00:15.900> well<00:00:16.230> quite<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
waxy coating comes in a few well quite a

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.769 
waxy coating comes in a few well quite a
lot<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.980> different<00:00:17.430> strengths<00:00:17.970> but<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> most

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
lot of different strengths but the most

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.290 
lot of different strengths but the most
used<00:00:19.140> ones<00:00:19.470> for<00:00:19.890> bead<00:00:20.039> workers<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.060> four

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
used ones for bead workers are the four

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.259 
used ones for bead workers are the four
pound<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> six<00:00:22.080> pound<00:00:22.350> strengths<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.269> mostly

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
pound and six pound strengths I mostly

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.480 
pound and six pound strengths I mostly
use<00:00:24.539> four<00:00:24.869> pound<00:00:25.170> because<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.619> work<00:00:26.039> with<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.310> lot

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
use four pound because I work with a lot

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.300 
use four pound because I work with a lot
of<00:00:26.519> charlotte's<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:28.080> very<00:00:28.349> tiny<00:00:28.650> beads<00:00:28.980> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
of charlotte's and very tiny beads and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.160 
of charlotte's and very tiny beads and
it's<00:00:29.519> useful<00:00:29.849> for<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.570> through<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> beads

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
it's useful for going through the beads

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.580 
it's useful for going through the beads
quite<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> lot<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.890> times<00:00:32.840> it<00:00:33.840> comes<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.380> two

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
quite a lot of times it comes in two

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.310 
quite a lot of times it comes in two
different<00:00:34.640> colors<00:00:35.640> there's<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.630> crystal

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
different colors there's the crystal

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.440 
different colors there's the crystal
which<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.829> very<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:39.450> white<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:41.210> it's<00:00:42.210> great

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
which is very very white and it's great

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.369 
which is very very white and it's great
for<00:00:42.690> using<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.140> very<00:00:43.379> pale<00:00:43.680> beads<00:00:44.149> but

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
for using with very pale beads but

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.930 
for using with very pale beads but
unfortunately<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.309> thread<00:00:47.579> shows

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
unfortunately when the thread shows

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.510 
unfortunately when the thread shows
between<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.690> beads<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.289> actually<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.340> really

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
between the beads is actually it really

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.670 
between the beads is actually it really
can<00:00:50.910> show<00:00:51.239> up<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.350> around<00:00:52.410> that

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
can show up but you can get around that

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.760 
can show up but you can get around that
by<00:00:53.010> getting<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.730> color<00:00:54.300> marker<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.350> close

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
by getting a color marker which is close

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
by getting a color marker which is close
to<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.129> color<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> beads<00:00:56.820> you're<00:00:57.059> using

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
to the color of the beads you're using

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.290 
to the color of the beads you're using
and<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.840> dab<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.920> very<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.460> lightly<00:00:59.760> in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and just dab it very very lightly in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
and just dab it very very lightly in
between<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> beads<00:01:01.199> where<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> thread<00:01:01.829> shows

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
between the beads where the thread shows

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
between the beads where the thread shows
and<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.940> does<00:01:03.120> spread<00:01:03.480> into<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.960> fibers<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and it does spread into the fibers and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.390 
and it does spread into the fibers and
it<00:01:05.400> should<00:01:05.820> mask<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.479> color<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> thread

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
it should mask the color of the thread

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
it should mask the color of the thread
the<00:01:08.400> other<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> color

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the other one and it's this is the color

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.120 
the other one and it's this is the color
I<00:01:09.960> mostly<00:01:10.590> use<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.659> called<00:01:12.659> smoke<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.619> it's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I mostly use is called smoke and it's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.969 
I mostly use is called smoke and it's
actually<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.850> very<00:01:15.380> neutral<00:01:16.380> color<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.830> may

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
actually a very neutral color it may

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.399 
actually a very neutral color it may
look<00:01:17.189> extremely<00:01:17.700> dark<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.200> very

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
look extremely dark but it's a very

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.030 
look extremely dark but it's a very
neutral<00:01:19.920> color<00:01:20.540> and<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.960> fact<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.680> it's

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
neutral color and in fact I think it's

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.760 
neutral color and in fact I think it's
probably<00:01:23.479> designed<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> fish<00:01:25.439> can't

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
probably designed so that the fish can't

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.090 
probably designed so that the fish can't
actually<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> water<00:01:27.829> I'll<00:01:28.829> just

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
actually see it in the water I'll just

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.319 
actually see it in the water I'll just
bring<00:01:29.939> some<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:32.150> it<00:01:33.150> may

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
bring some out for you to see it may

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.980 
bring some out for you to see it may
appear<00:01:33.659> dark<00:01:34.079> but<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> waxy<00:01:35.460> coating

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
appear dark but I think the waxy coating

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.550 
appear dark but I think the waxy coating
somehow<00:01:36.990> seems<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.680> deflect<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> light<00:01:38.759> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
somehow seems to deflect the light and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.560 
somehow seems to deflect the light and
it<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.650> remains<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:41.729> neutral<00:01:42.420> in

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
it just remains very very neutral in

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.380 
it just remains very very neutral in
between<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.140> beads<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.799> absolutely<00:01:44.610> love<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
between the beads I absolutely love it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.380 
between the beads I absolutely love it
and<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.680> particularly<00:01:47.670> excellent

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
and I think it's particularly excellent

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.490 
and I think it's particularly excellent
for<00:01:48.720> working<00:01:49.320> with<00:01:49.470> crystals<00:01:50.070> because<00:01:51.500> some

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
for working with crystals because some

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.859 
for working with crystals because some
bicone<00:01:53.100> crystals<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:53.939> very<00:01:54.299> very<00:01:54.360> excellent

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
bicone crystals even very very excellent

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.310 
bicone crystals even very very excellent
quality<00:01:55.409> ones<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:56.159> tend<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.210> sharp<00:01:58.020> edges

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
quality ones do tend to have sharp edges

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.580 
quality ones do tend to have sharp edges
and<00:01:58.920> when<00:01:59.820> under<00:02:00.149> pressure<00:02:00.450> when<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.320> thread

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and when under pressure when the thread

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.039 
and when under pressure when the thread
is<00:02:01.740> under<00:02:01.979> pressure<00:02:02.189> right<00:02:02.939> where<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.360> leaves

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
is under pressure right where it leaves

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.130 
is under pressure right where it leaves
the<00:02:04.380> bead<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.610> actually<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.689> sheared

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
the bead it can actually be sheared

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.339 
the bead it can actually be sheared
through<00:02:07.560> by<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.860> crystal<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> find

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
through by the crystal so but I find

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.110 
through by the crystal so but I find
that<00:02:10.500> fireline<00:02:11.220> tends<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.910> stand<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.810> that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
that fireline tends to stand up to that

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.869 
that fireline tends to stand up to that
quite<00:02:13.299> well<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.590> only<00:02:14.739> drawback<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.700> is

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
quite well the only drawback with it is

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.470 
quite well the only drawback with it is
that<00:02:16.750> it's<00:02:17.230> not<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.860> flat<00:02:18.519> it's<00:02:19.209> not

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
that it's not a flat it's not

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.170 
that it's not a flat it's not
specifically<00:02:20.049> made<00:02:20.349> for<00:02:20.379> beading<00:02:21.040> like<00:02:21.640> Naima

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
specifically made for beading like Naima

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.140 
specifically made for beading like Naima
is<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.349> it's<00:02:23.530> not<00:02:23.709> a<00:02:23.769> flat<00:02:24.250> thread<00:02:24.909> it's

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
is and so it's not a flat thread it's

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.240 
is and so it's not a flat thread it's
actually<00:02:25.540> round<00:02:25.720> at<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:25.989> end<00:02:26.110> but<00:02:26.440> you<00:02:26.739> can

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
actually round at the end but you can

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.089 
actually round at the end but you can
get<00:02:27.400> round<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.819> by<00:02:28.690> using<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.530> flat<00:02:29.769> nosed

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
get round that by using a flat nosed

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.160 
get round that by using a flat nosed
pair<00:02:30.459> of<00:02:30.549> pliers<00:02:30.909> when<00:02:31.629> you<00:02:31.750> bring<00:02:31.959> out<00:02:32.140> a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
pair of pliers when you bring out a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.089 
pair of pliers when you bring out a
length<00:02:32.769> of<00:02:32.980> thread<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.430> use<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:35.099> flatten

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
length of thread to use and just flatten

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.670 
length of thread to use and just flatten
it<00:02:36.430> at<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.909> end<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:39.400> then<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:40.409> wasn't<00:02:41.409> easily

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
it at the end and then it wasn't easily

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.619 
it at the end and then it wasn't easily
pass<00:02:42.370> through<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.970> eye<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.269> needle<00:02:43.299> and

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
pass through the eye of the needle and

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.839 
pass through the eye of the needle and
this<00:02:43.750> is<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.959> size<00:02:44.290> 12<00:02:44.590> needle<00:02:45.160> I've<00:02:45.280> got<00:02:45.549> here

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
this is a size 12 needle I've got here

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.690 
this is a size 12 needle I've got here
and<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:47.230> just<00:02:48.090> easily<00:02:49.090> pass<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.190> if<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.340> hadn't

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
and I just easily pass it on if I hadn't

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.190 
and I just easily pass it on if I hadn't
done<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.359> would<00:02:52.599> have<00:02:52.720> been<00:02:52.870> sitting

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
done that I would have been sitting

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.530 
done that I would have been sitting
there<00:02:53.379> trying<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.010> push<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.849> needle<00:02:55.030> on<00:02:55.269> for<00:02:55.510> a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
there trying to push the needle on for a

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.259 
there trying to push the needle on for a
long<00:02:55.720> while<00:02:56.129> but<00:02:57.129> there<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.310> are<00:02:57.489> I<00:02:57.670> love<00:02:58.120> it
