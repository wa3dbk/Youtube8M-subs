00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.710
 if they do not round off any wood with the surface for example 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.999
 The machine only weighs half the weight on the workpiece 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.009
 on the basins of the board, the edition then reduces to just one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.970
 fifth 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.860
 and then I had to be very much for what 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 so that the rounding is really perfect 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.870
 especially at the competitions 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.870
 can it happen sometimes that the surface goes to side way 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 and mills an ugly notch in the edge 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.420
 at some Upper Franconian 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.450
 They can prevent dumping with a low loader with the sliders 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.730
 who plays the machine sideways 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.730
 initiated thereby are overjoyed 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.130
 even better is the use of an additional the span and 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.450
 she is on the one hand with the two bars is parallel stop and to 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.960
 another with two screws under the surface so mounted 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.960
 and I search for it in no time 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.600
 Firstly, with the TIG distribution, the doormat is extended laterally and thus 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.499
 increases the contact surface of the machine 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:19.099
 and secondly you can attack Knaup with your left hand attack 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.009
 always keep the OberpfÃ¤lzer perfectly in the horizontal position 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.509
 In any case, the danger of taking off is happy to spread 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.439
 almost impossible 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.190
 and a perfectly rounded edge 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.169
 nothing stands in the way 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:41.889
 but with two threaded rods from green glass and a bit of multiplex you can 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.049
 You can also easily build a table spread yourself 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:50.789
 The threaded rods are doing a parallel stop not plagued foot 

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:51.589
 pushed 

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:55.659
 and the the night's rest glass plate will be back in the back with two 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 Fixed screws 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.679
 even the self-built works perfectly 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.699
 and at material costs of just five euros 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.789
 I can play want to highly recommend use of this device 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.139
 especially a speaker with superimposed 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.700
 should use them whenever possible with a quiche spread 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.620
 Anyway, there may be other accessories 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.980
 that can save you more trouble and work 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.179
 as this table spread 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:53.399
 and the FES results are really impressive
