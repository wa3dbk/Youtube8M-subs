00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:09.700
 Your eyes tell us about rules. 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.700
 did a little roll now I have 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.590
 I think this is easy for anyone 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.590
 you are easy 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.990
 that mark 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.610
 but 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.610
 already thinking of 2010 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.630
 how long does it take until the part is 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.780
 ready 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.780
 Some say that the play 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
 shelvey 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:54.900
 another three hours but when you get back to 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.900
 zero at the time 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.059
 at home 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.290
 But I do not even want to talk about the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.980
 property of the lady but now she 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.980
 it's okay 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.970
 robert 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.420
 no one more or less but how much more 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.080
 fast one more 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:30.690
 in fact she fails from there nobody understands 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.080
 and it is this material based on what this 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.080
 resin 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.330
 maize starch 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.170
 the new material and if it has no relation 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:49.119
 with those I encouraged there 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.570
 those benches without furniture is that they 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.250
 say it's ecological neco is usually 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.450
 exaggerate to speak with logic sometimes she 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.070
 it would be peaceful and babi makes this clear 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.119
 here for example that one bottle 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.310
 advertising on TV has tears after 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.479
 30 percent similar prison 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.479
 and it will always be better 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.959
 just I wanted to pay'm alone has several 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.819
 ways to actually do is the one that the 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.260
 people buy some closing 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:26.200
 made with the low ranking 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.200
 centimeters we have legal 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 and this 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.090
 ready material still in the clear case 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
 that mechanism there for example that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.239
 orange piece there you ride her 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.640
 Let's say her carcass is more macho. 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.160
 that we look to show that you can 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.239
 stay very yes for example some 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.110
 parts of the machine that prints 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:57.780
 image of her mother of course is this is already 31 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.739
 in case it is sim in the original of the model 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.739
 earlier than this first
