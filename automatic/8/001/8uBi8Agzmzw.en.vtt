00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
chemicals now I'm thinking that the way

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.270 
chemicals now I'm thinking that the way
pattern<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.510> you<00:00:59.569> see<00:00:59.839> I'm<00:01:00.649> thinking<00:01:01.159> that

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
pattern that you see I'm thinking that

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.680 
pattern that you see I'm thinking that
that<00:01:01.460> might<00:01:01.670> have<00:01:01.850> been<00:01:01.879> created<00:01:02.359> like<00:01:02.510> with

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
that might have been created like with

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.810 
that might have been created like with
steam<00:01:03.049> or<00:01:03.229> something<00:01:03.559> like<00:01:03.679> that<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.280> it<00:01:04.549> has

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
steam or something like that but it has

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.030 
steam or something like that but it has
no<00:01:05.000> chemicals<00:01:05.239> in<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.380> let<00:01:06.560> me<00:01:06.680> turn<00:01:06.890> it
