00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
give you an idea of what I'm doing along

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:33.819 
give you an idea of what I'm doing along
the<00:00:24.570> edge

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:48.050 

making<00:00:34.640> a<00:00:34.790> little<00:00:35.890> like<00:00:36.890> a<00:00:36.920> rope<00:00:37.280> twist

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:02:02.000 

I'm<00:00:48.600> skipping<00:00:49.020> every<00:00:49.320> other<00:00:49.620> one

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.350 

that's<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:04.320> nobody<00:02:05.320> I'll<00:02:05.410> continue<00:02:05.890> down

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
that's the nobody I'll continue down

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.990 
that's the nobody I'll continue down
this<00:02:07.360> whole<00:02:07.630> edge<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:09.400> I'll<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.790> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
this whole edge and then I'll do it the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.850 
this whole edge and then I'll do it the
same<00:02:10.210> thing<00:02:10.420> on<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:10.660> inside<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:11.350> connect<00:02:11.680> with

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
same thing on the inside to connect with

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.830 
same thing on the inside to connect with
the<00:02:11.980> other<00:02:12.100> ones<00:02:12.430> I've<00:02:12.820> already<00:02:12.940> done<00:02:13.330> I'm

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
the other ones I've already done I'm

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.080 
the other ones I've already done I'm
going<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.830> certain<00:02:15.070> direction<00:02:15.190> with<00:02:15.760> the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
going in a certain direction with the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.810 
going in a certain direction with the
rope<00:02:16.300> with<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.200> twist<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.100> that's<00:02:18.400> why<00:02:18.610> I'm

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
rope with the twist so that's why I'm

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.720 
rope with the twist so that's why I'm
going<00:02:19.120> at<00:02:19.300> this<00:02:19.480> angle<00:02:19.720> when<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.710> did<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.520> first

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
going at this angle when I did the first

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.270 
going at this angle when I did the first
one<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.090> came<00:02:22.270> at<00:02:22.690> myself<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.530> had<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.920> reverse

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
one I came at myself so I had to reverse

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.260 
one I came at myself so I had to reverse
direction<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:25.960> going<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.410> same<00:02:26.650> way

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
direction so it's all going the same way

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.180 
direction so it's all going the same way
so<00:02:28.270> when<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> get<00:02:28.750> this<00:02:28.930> edging<00:02:29.320> on<00:02:29.530> which<00:02:30.010> won't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
so when I get this edging on which won't

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.530 
so when I get this edging on which won't
take<00:02:30.430> me<00:02:30.580> long<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.660> these<00:02:32.380> three<00:02:33.220> last

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
take me long and the these three last

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.450 
take me long and the these three last
pieces<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.080> clasp<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.710> am<00:02:35.950> done<00:02:36.250> this
