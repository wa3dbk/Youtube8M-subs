it's a design which has been around for
three<00:00:45.489> or<00:00:45.609> so<00:00:45.850> years<00:00:45.879> and<00:00:46.300> I've<00:00:46.539> experimented

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
with it in the past but what made me

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.049 
with it in the past but what made me
decide<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.739> dust<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.190> off<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.579> pull<00:00:51.789> it<00:00:51.910> out

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059

all<00:02:25.860> right<00:02:26.250> so<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.580> get<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> idea<00:02:26.910> now<00:02:27.890> just

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
all right so you get the idea now just

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.610 
all right so you get the idea now just
punch<00:02:29.400> out<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.569> underneath<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.349> put<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
punch out this one underneath and put a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.380 
punch out this one underneath and put a
torch<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:34.849> come<00:02:35.849> around<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.209> front

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
torch like that come around the front

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.559 
torch like that come around the front
here<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.220> we're<00:02:38.220> gonna<00:02:38.310> put<00:02:38.580> sticky<00:02:39.090> pistons

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
here and we're gonna put sticky pistons

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.920 
here and we're gonna put sticky pistons
every<00:02:40.110> second<00:02:40.640> row<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:44.090> now<00:02:45.090> come<00:02:45.900> down

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
every second row like this now come down

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.770 
every second row like this now come down
put<00:02:46.560> plain<00:02:46.830> pistons<00:02:47.430> facing<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:48.150> on<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.630> end

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
put plain pistons facing up on the end

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.920 
put plain pistons facing up on the end
of<00:02:48.870> each<00:02:48.989> sticky<00:02:49.410> piston<00:02:49.830> like<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:53.930> alright

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
of each sticky piston like this alright

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.890 
of each sticky piston like this alright
let's<00:02:55.140> take<00:02:55.319> a<00:02:55.380> look<00:02:55.620> at<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:56.330> pretty<00:02:57.330> simple

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
let's take a look at that pretty simple

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.759 
let's take a look at that pretty simple
stuff<00:02:58.940> now

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
stuff now

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.750 
stuff now
we're<00:03:01.769> just<00:03:01.920> going<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.130> fill<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.519> these<00:03:02.700> gaps

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
we're just going to fill in these gaps

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.570 
we're just going to fill in these gaps
here

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.930 

and<00:03:08.670> we're<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.690> going<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:09.930> add<00:03:10.140> another

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
and we're just going to add another

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.430 
and we're just going to add another
layer<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:14.120> pistons<00:03:15.120> at<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.450> top<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:16.050> push<00:03:16.230> you

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
layer of pistons at the top to push you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.120 
layer of pistons at the top to push you
off<00:03:17.990> so<00:03:18.990> this<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.410> last<00:03:19.620> thing<00:03:19.740> you<00:03:19.950> do

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
off so this is the last thing you do

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.620 
off so this is the last thing you do
when<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.430> reach<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.880> top<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.360> where<00:03:21.510> you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
when you reach the top and where you

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.410 
when you reach the top and where you
want<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.960> elevator<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.560> stop<00:03:24.950> come<00:03:25.950> over

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
want the elevator to stop come over

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.720 
want the elevator to stop come over

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.129 
button on the side here all right now
fence<00:05:24.850> posts<00:05:25.360> on<00:05:25.479> top<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:25.900> pressure

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
fence posts on top of the pressure

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.560 
fence posts on top of the pressure
plates<00:05:26.500> then<00:05:27.280> pressure<00:05:27.610> plates<00:05:28.000> on<00:05:28.240> top<00:05:28.270> of

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
plates then pressure plates on top of

plates then pressure plates on top of
the<00:05:28.660> fence<00:05:28.900> posts<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:30.090> just<00:05:31.090> noting<00:05:31.479> that

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
the fence posts and just noting that

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.600 
the fence posts and just noting that
these<00:05:31.840> are<00:05:32.020> iron<00:05:32.259> pressure<00:05:32.770> plates<00:05:33.160> they<00:05:33.550> do

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
these are iron pressure plates they do

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.249 
these are iron pressure plates they do
behave<00:05:34.090> a<00:05:34.120> little<00:05:34.389> bit<00:05:34.660> differently<00:05:35.050> than

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
behave a little bit differently than

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.409 
behave a little bit differently than
wooden<00:05:35.590> ones<00:05:35.800> so<00:05:36.610> you're<00:05:36.759> probably<00:05:37.000> better

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
wooden ones so you're probably better

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.850 
wooden ones so you're probably better
using<00:05:37.960> these<00:05:39.330> then<00:05:40.330> some<00:05:40.660> fence<00:05:40.930> posts<00:05:41.440> on<00:05:41.560> top

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
using these then some fence posts on top

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.490 
using these then some fence posts on top
of<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.100> pressure<00:05:42.370> plates<00:05:42.990> and<00:05:43.990> when<00:05:44.289> you<00:05:44.380> get

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
of the pressure plates and when you get

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.740 
of the pressure plates and when you get
to<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.800> top<00:05:45.039> just<00:05:45.759> put<00:05:45.940> down<00:05:46.150> some<00:05:46.479> pressure

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
to the top just put down some pressure

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.980 
to the top just put down some pressure
plates<00:05:47.139> and<00:05:47.470> then<00:05:47.919> some<00:05:48.699> glass<00:05:48.970> panes<00:05:49.449> on<00:05:49.780> top

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.600 
plates and then some glass panes on top
of<00:05:50.169> those<00:05:50.410> like<00:05:51.400> this<00:05:52.949> and<00:05:53.949> then<00:05:54.099> cover<00:05:54.430> this

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
of those like this and then cover this

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.260 
of those like this and then cover this
up<00:05:54.820> a<00:05:54.940> little<00:05:55.090> bit<00:05:55.650> make<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.680> all<00:05:56.919> safe<00:05:57.280> bring

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270

up a little bit make it all safe bring
that<00:05:58.419> around<00:05:58.599> there<00:05:59.110> like<00:06:00.660> this<00:06:03.449> okay<00:06:04.449> that's

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
that around there like this okay that's

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.450 
that around there like this okay that's
looking<00:06:04.900> pretty<00:06:05.110> good<00:06:05.590> so<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:05.889> think<00:06:06.009> we<00:06:06.280> can

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
looking pretty good so I think we can
