00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.430
 For some time we have been telling you about sightings 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.189
 more or less curious about objects really 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.349
 unidentified or identifiable in one 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.170
 word through the contribution of you 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.719
 attentive spectators of our news we have 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.910
 sent photos or wicker the sea of 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.410
 those that seem ufo that furrow i 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
 heavens in all respects 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.220
 and then a bit for fun a little for that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.519
 it's worth trying at least to give yourself a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.740
 explanation of all sightings 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.420
 etna ensnared by paternÃ² adrano 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.660
 I had decided to call a number 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.370
 one in the subject roberto pinotti ufologo e 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.710
 secretary of the UFO center 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.059
 national 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.870
 called almost always on rai ea 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.390
 Mediaset 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 in short, one who really knows something about it and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.190
 then let's hear what pinotti tells us 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 on sightings of our parts 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.949
 undoubtedly sicilia found itself in 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.050
 an almost privileged situation 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.120
 as for what you are reporting 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 this may also be due 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.940
 to the particular geographical position 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 island 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.729
 but what is certain is that it seems to be 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.130
 in fact , Sicily had to be 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.960
 almost a crossroads of these reports 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.900
 in particular the thing is precisely 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.119
 jonica the etnea race 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.580
 has repeatedly been at the center of 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.920
 reports and also of you resumed 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.530
 carried out by normal we say witnesses 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.240
 that I have with video phones or with 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.950
 video cameras or digital cameras 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.430
 have actually documented the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.890
 presence of anomalous bodies in the sky 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.759
 because first we say we limited ourselves 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.399
 as scholars that if it is not new to 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.570
 simply record 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.229
 testimonials now you have are born 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.090
 they are normally accompanied by images 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.040
 how much there is to take for good the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.500
 meaning what you see even when 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.750
 it seems that 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.870
 is really something explicable 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.560
 how true can there be about these 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.200
 sightings 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.509
 we proceed to a careful screening of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.810
 all this material that reaches us and 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.300
 we can safely say that about 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.540
 three quarters of what we get 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.459
 can have conventional type explanations 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.270
 however, this does not mean that there is a 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.580
 a reasonable number is listed and 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.830
 documentations that stand up to any 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.280
 explanation in some cases even 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:34.810
 we are faced with something that 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.480
 to its details how to say 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:42.650
 characteristics that are spheroidal objects 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:46.970
 or discoid that appear to say let's say 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.350
 day as opaque but structured bodies 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.630
 beyond all the customary request 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.190
 only one remains, but until that 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.100
 point to believe ufo is 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.070
 automatically to the aliens still 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.800
 exists resists preferred because the 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.440
 problem is this at a distance of over 60 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.600
 years all the conventional explanations 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.090
 they basically failed 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.890
 the only one that we still say resists and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.709
 this also because beyond that 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.519
 extremely rational is the only one for 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.610
 exclusion 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.680
 we say can give an explanation of 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.260
 this phenomenon that continues to arise and 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.060
 this is the most fact 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.239
 incontestable among other things also the 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.799
 people are now having an approach 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.799
 different towards these 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.630
 so much so that the tg1 a 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.060
 January did a survey of 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.280
 opinion in Italy which budding 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.519
 in three quarters of the Italians accept 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.260
 the idea not only the existence of 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.840
 UFO phenomenon but also of the possible 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.090
 existence of being who it was 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.599
 get to film something 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.160
 in short, that flies by air 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.709
 sometimes a bit from the mystery like 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.590
 should also behave maybe do it 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.510
 technical visionary a true sense of the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.540
 word like you 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.769
 I said prematurely that we in the area have 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.680
 catani our regional coordination 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.670
 indeed of the UFO center 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.580
 national 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.620
 anyone can any search engine 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.819
 to refer to the internet in the center 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.280
 national ufology 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.530
 we say that anyone can in some 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.930
 how to refer to ours 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.970
 organization that has existed for over 40 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.800
 years and is the point of reference 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.550
 obliged for a serious investigation on 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.860
 these phenomena 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.020
 in short, at the end of sightings there is 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.450
 will still be and we will continue those a 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.370
 tell them also why you want to put 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.200
 that charm that mystery to try 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.979
 understand if extraterrestrials exist 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.440
 really 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.710
 some things don't really have 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.710
 price
