00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.810 

first<00:00:25.249> thing<00:00:25.810> typically<00:00:26.810> on<00:00:26.929> a<00:00:26.960> blower<00:00:27.289> on

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
first thing typically on a blower on

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.450 
first thing typically on a blower on
your<00:00:28.820> bearing<00:00:29.239> you<00:00:29.390> have<00:00:29.539> a<00:00:29.570> locking<00:00:29.900> collar

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
your bearing you have a locking collar

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.860 
your bearing you have a locking collar
that<00:00:31.460> has<00:00:31.699> to<00:00:31.819> be<00:00:31.939> removed<00:00:32.239> before<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:32.720> can

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
that has to be removed before you can

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.660 
that has to be removed before you can
remove<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.290> bearing<00:00:33.620> so<00:00:34.100> that's<00:00:34.280> where<00:00:34.489> we'll

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
remove the bearing so that's where we'll

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.010 
remove the bearing so that's where we'll
start<00:00:35.469> usually<00:00:36.469> you<00:00:37.010> have<00:00:37.190> a<00:00:37.539> allen<00:00:38.539> key<00:00:38.780> to

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
start usually you have a allen key to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.000 
start usually you have a allen key to
loosen<00:00:39.230> on<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.129> locking<00:00:40.370> collar<00:00:41.859> we're<00:00:42.859> going

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
loosen on the locking collar we're going

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.720 
loosen on the locking collar we're going
to<00:00:43.070> loosen<00:00:43.789> that<00:00:43.910> up<00:00:46.929> and<00:00:48.309> usually<00:00:49.309> about<00:00:49.670> a

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
to loosen that up and usually about a

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.439 
to loosen that up and usually about a
quarter<00:00:50.120> turn<00:00:50.359> from<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:50.780> allen<00:00:51.140> key<00:00:51.410> is<00:00:51.649> a

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449 
quarter turn from the allen key is a

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.240 
quarter turn from the allen key is a
hole<00:00:53.449> that<00:00:53.480> you<00:00:53.780> could<00:00:53.929> use<00:00:54.170> to<00:00:54.199> jar<00:00:54.890> the<00:00:54.920> thing

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
hole that you could use to jar the thing

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.610 
hole that you could use to jar the thing
loose<00:00:55.460> because<00:00:56.239> it<00:00:56.600> actually<00:00:57.019> goes<00:00:57.260> on<00:00:57.410> their

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
loose because it actually goes on their

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.829 
loose because it actually goes on their
turns<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:58.219> locks<00:00:58.489> on<00:00:58.760> with<00:00:58.879> it<00:00:59.030> under<00:00:59.570> the

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
turns and locks on with it under the

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.840 
turns and locks on with it under the
bearing<00:01:00.199> itself<00:01:00.289> so<00:01:01.280> I'm<00:01:01.429> going<00:01:01.609> to<00:01:01.670> put<00:01:01.820> a

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
bearing itself so I'm going to put a

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.660 
bearing itself so I'm going to put a
screwdriver<00:01:02.149> in<00:01:02.570> this<00:01:02.719> little<00:01:03.019> hole<00:01:03.140> here

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
screwdriver in this little hole here

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.319 
screwdriver in this little hole here
we're<00:01:04.670> going<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.850> take<00:01:05.059> a<00:01:05.089> hammer<00:01:05.449> and<00:01:07.329> knock

we're going to take a hammer and knock
that<00:01:08.630> least<00:01:08.960> pull<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.680> right<00:01:09.920> off<00:01:10.960> I've

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960
