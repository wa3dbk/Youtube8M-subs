00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
looks like and I will put this in as

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.200 
looks like and I will put this in as
well<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.830> actually<00:01:20.130> fits<00:01:20.759> into

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
well and all of this actually fits into

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.020 
well and all of this actually fits into
this<00:01:21.630> credit<00:01:21.990> card<00:01:22.320> holder<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.759> blends

this credit card holder and it blends

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.390 
this credit card holder and it blends
but<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.720> tell<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.619> by<00:01:25.650> looking<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:26.250> it

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
but you can tell just by looking at it

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.030 
but you can tell just by looking at it
that<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.820> pretty<00:01:27.119> full<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:28.229> lot<00:01:28.860> can

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that it's pretty full so a lot can

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520 
that it's pretty full so a lot can
actually<00:01:29.340> fit<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> hadn't

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
actually fit into this and when I hadn't

actually fit into this and when I hadn't
originally<00:01:32.130> bought<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.640> thought<00:01:32.790> this

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
originally bought this I thought this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.130 
originally bought this I thought this
might<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.390> been<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.780> kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.619> grab-and-go

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
bought this a few months ago so I'm sure

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.650 
bought this a few months ago so I'm sure
the<00:02:31.200> price<00:02:31.380> isn't<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.860> much<00:02:32.010> different

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
the price isn't that much different

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.830 
the price isn't that much different
okay<00:02:33.660> so<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.890> was<00:02:35.310> also<00:02:35.489> asked<00:02:36.030> whether<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:36.690> not

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
pen lip gloss and my keys I will also

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.600 
pen lip gloss and my keys I will also
have<00:03:17.610> like<00:03:18.030> my<00:03:19.100> sunglasses<00:03:21.590> or<00:03:22.590> glasses<00:03:22.980> too

have like my sunglasses or glasses too

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.440 
have like my sunglasses or glasses too
that<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:23.970> would<00:03:24.480> carry<00:03:24.720> around<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:26.180> typically<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
that I would carry around so typically I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.990 
that I would carry around so typically I
would<00:03:28.230> just<00:03:28.380> carry<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.190> have<00:03:29.640> like<00:03:29.850> my

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
would just carry this and have like my

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.060 
would just carry this and have like my
glasses<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.600> my<00:03:30.660> sunglasses<00:03:30.900> at<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.500> top<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
glasses and my sunglasses at the top and

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.710 
glasses and my sunglasses at the top and
it<00:03:32.160> zips<00:03:32.400> up<00:03:32.700> pretty<00:03:33.180> nicely

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
it zips up pretty nicely

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.960 
it zips up pretty nicely
so<00:03:34.019> that's<00:03:34.769> without<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.130> credit<00:03:35.519> card<00:03:35.760> holder

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
so that's without the credit card holder

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.069 
so that's without the credit card holder
with<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:36.959> credit<00:03:37.500> card<00:03:37.769> holder<00:03:38.000> it

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
with the credit card holder it

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.509 
with the credit card holder it
definitely<00:03:40.079> fits<00:03:40.730> although<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.500> a<00:03:43.519> lot

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
definitely fits although it is a lot

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:53.300 
definitely fits although it is a lot
bulkier<00:03:45.269> and<00:03:50.570> I<00:03:51.570> would<00:03:51.780> say<00:03:52.260> with<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.890> credit

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
bulkier and I would say with the credit

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.750 
bulkier and I would say with the credit
card<00:03:53.579> holder<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:55.530> probably<00:03:56.040> aren't<00:03:56.340> able<00:03:56.609> to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
card holder you probably aren't able to

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.380 
card holder you probably aren't able to
get<00:03:57.209> your<00:03:57.600> sunglasses<00:03:58.290> in

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
get your sunglasses in

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.390 
get your sunglasses in
and<00:04:02.480> yeah<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.810> mean<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.110> just<00:04:04.680> don't<00:04:04.950> think<00:04:05.250> that

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
and yeah I mean I just don't think that

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.280 
and yeah I mean I just don't think that
I<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:06.180> don't<00:04:06.390> think<00:04:06.600> that<00:04:06.720> will<00:04:06.870> happen<00:04:06.900> I

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
I can I don't think that will happen I

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.940 
I can I don't think that will happen I
mean<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.650> can<00:04:07.830> definitely<00:04:08.240> cap<00:04:09.240> it<00:04:09.420> in<00:04:09.740> if<00:04:10.740> you

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
mean you can definitely cap it in if you

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.180 
mean you can definitely cap it in if you
only<00:04:11.730> use<00:04:11.910> maybe<00:04:12.360> one<00:04:12.780> phone<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.800> you<00:04:14.010> maybe

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
only use maybe one phone and you maybe

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.900 
only use maybe one phone and you maybe
took<00:04:14.760> up<00:04:14.970> this<00:04:15.209> like<00:04:16.190> Mikey<00:04:17.190> or<00:04:17.430> if<00:04:17.579> maybe<00:04:17.760> if

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
took up this like Mikey or if maybe if

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.190 
took up this like Mikey or if maybe if
you<00:04:17.970> don't<00:04:18.150> have<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.390> key<00:04:18.600> clay<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:18.989> try

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
you don't have a key clay that you try

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.930 
you don't have a key clay that you try
to<00:04:19.230> put<00:04:19.440> in<00:04:19.560> there<00:04:19.709> too<00:04:19.859> because<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.310> guess<00:04:20.519> I

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
to put in there too because I guess I

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.490 
to put in there too because I guess I
mean<00:04:21.419> if<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.630> had<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.780> credit<00:04:22.079> card<00:04:22.260> told<00:04:22.410> me

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
mean if you had the credit card told me

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.930 
mean if you had the credit card told me
you<00:04:22.560> probably<00:04:22.860> wouldn't<00:04:23.190> need<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.460> key<00:04:23.669> clay

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
you probably wouldn't need the key clay

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.409 
you probably wouldn't need the key clay
so<00:04:24.270> let<00:04:24.960> me<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.169> take<00:04:25.350> off<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.680> cue<00:04:25.890> clay<00:04:26.419> and

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
so let me just take off the cue clay and

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.240 
so let me just take off the cue clay and
just<00:04:27.600> kind<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.810> put<00:04:28.080> my<00:04:28.200> keys<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.680> there<00:04:28.830> so

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
just kind of put my keys in there so

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.750 
just kind of put my keys in there so
