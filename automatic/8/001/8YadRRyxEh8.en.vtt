 This is a modeling channel where you 

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.390

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.590
 customizations and we also do 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:19.930
 pieces and today he makes the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.789
 form of a certain shielding that these 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:27.880
 areas have been a miracle can be done 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:30.580
 in cotton ta and is very easy to 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.910
 I made a blue one and made one 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.910
 red 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.789
 she only needs if you do 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:45.190
 Side seams I can see locke and 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:47.850
 straight the bar and the coast is just coming to 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 little bar 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.210
 then you just need to mount one 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.159
 plaquinha you buy can tell 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.210
 story you can put what 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.210
 Do you want to decorate? 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.540
 so you need a non-mold 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.950
 need to put the cet nor the aviamento 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:12.759
 because the fabric has there then let's 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.640
 need waist measurements and that in the 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.829
 hip and hip and from this time on 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.950
 waist your hip your picture of your 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:25.829
 small quad to its poor though there 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.829
 start another video modeling lesson 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:36.810
 so here I will use a paper 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:40.060
 clear golden you will draw a line 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.070
 that will be your figure 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.009
 we will repeat all the measures by 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.890
 four because when opening windows and 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.020
 two parts and has more the two parts of 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.520
 back so that's why I split the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.310
 measured by 4 at my waist and 66 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.609
 because it's the high waist I use 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.890
 so you go as I'll put it here 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:04.890
 It's 16 and mail 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.459
 6/4 there you will now stand tall 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.850
 which has from your waist to your little 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.640
 hip and Celso which is up here 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.720
 that most people wear their skirts 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:29.180
 here I already use above the navel 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.550
 so here it is 15 inches below 15 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:38.770
 centimeters below a small frame and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.770
 eighty 80/4 is going to give 20 centimeters 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:53.930
 feeling 15 centimeters below the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:59.980
 small hip is my hip that goes 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:08.350
 give 22 and mail because I have 90 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:13.840

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:21.620

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:34.310
