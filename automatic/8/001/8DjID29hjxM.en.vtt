00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.510
 episode 67 with stalker mode what 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.200
 good if you do not know we're going to put a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.790
 moment 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.379
 f5 vikings of kleenex stalker that does not 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.320
 I know if you know what it is but it's good 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.590
 game that there is then / I tell you I have 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.619
 than doing it well the mod adds the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.869
 mods mainly this one here is worth and 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.490
 this one here will be here is in 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.759
 the normal world and this one is in 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.680
 the never I will put it here and good 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.500
 let's start to see this first of 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.260
 here and it burns with the sun so let's go 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.410
 to put it in the night 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.860
 and this bug here that is sucked not 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.480
 I know what's wrong 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.930
 He has a face like a stripper and well let's 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.500
 look one two three four five touches 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.090
 hard that more then we're going to put a 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.880
 moment 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.950
 in normal mode we are going to take something from 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.420
 armor if it hits a lot but I do not think 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.730
 that stick a lot is worth this is already 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.110
 to invoke this saying 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.090
 well now I came for you to hit you 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.680
 You see, it does not take away two things first with a 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.680
 peto de bueno removes an egg 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.600
 once you kill him, he will give you 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.920
 experience and has a lot has very little 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.820
 possibility that you touch this vale 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.090
 this what he does is like a kind of 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.900
 it returns sito little crazy guy and what 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.850
 What do you do when you put it on stone? 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.479
 he puts you a materials and we're going to take a 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.909
 peak of iron for example to put a mode 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 normal percent are going to forget to say 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.830
 what burns you 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 every time he uses so we go by 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.780
 the creative beige loose to throw the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.170
 erring man more possibility that 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.390
 touch coal but you can touch air 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:04.110
 let's see before I get a diamond 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.810
 how weird to look at a beige diamond listen 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.450
 that scary music that gives bad roll 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.910
 needs recreational and now for example 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.550
 you see we have a diamond so this 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.769
 material is pretty good what coal 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.060
 in lapis lazuli that although it is that they are 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.470
 materials the bad thing about this so that you 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.989
 you burn if you have to do it with water 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.269
 next simply that more good good 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.160
 educational this one is worth that 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.510
 It certainly would be that in eggs 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.189
 they have beige use 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.290
 they have like a bar that you're going to 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.599
 use are spent well with a 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.459
 egg you have enough materials so 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.680
 if you touch one that is difficult by the way 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.780
 already said so it will be good 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.260
 this is the medium bug that has more 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.260
 bad look 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.900
 that I feel transport albacete and be 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.299
 easier to touch the egg this 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.909
 what's up and well you can let go of that 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.510
 Also you can jump or materials 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:03.269
 nd can already be 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.010
 in the rack is the block that is 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.769
 can be this load virginia vale 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.590
 several things mainly and the egg 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.750
 this let's see now how much the 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.030
 bug this we are going to catch 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.850
 let's take a little apple for 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.430
 cure our food 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.200
 let's let go and well this has bad 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.410
 pint of the other 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.920
 It is vital for it soon 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.920
 shit 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.560
 it's worth another set of keys that is 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.570
 very easy without his lucky eggs 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.190
 However, the other costs more, this spear 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.550
 fireball for this from zorita charge 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.500
 virginia and nothing to forgive and also you 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.180
 release the measuring block but not 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.650
 always and good that makes this stone 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.870
 well simply but we work in a 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.170
 normal mode drama right button and you 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:52.750
 It also takes by certain it takes you to your 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.580
 payments or to your bed and you see used as 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.070
 half bar in creative will not be enough 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.670
 but the normal mode we're going to put a 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.670
 normal mode 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.220
 by the way I forgot to say that you 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.810
 can kill so it's not very effective 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.569
 but what works do you need a mine or 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.609
 whatever is 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.409
 you will remember things because no 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.500
 mainly the mote is this adds us 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.090
 many more things 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.799
 but good are two ways that 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.840
 you find randomly you do not have it 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.030
 to invoke or anything like that are 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.790
 there you can find it and about 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.080
 all the mop that you have been here is 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.600
 quite useful since for example 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.970
 get a diamond simply by 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.080
 killing a mod is pretty good so 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.210
 I recommend them quite logical in 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.520
 mediabase we did not find the clean of the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.700
 another is in some biomes in another more 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.160
 difficult to find European - let's see 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.800
 it's easier to find but 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.380
 mainly this is the mod 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.380
 I hope today what he speaks 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.740
 pickman then what 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.139
 OK 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.970
 well, well, at first glance, there's no 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.520
 none but they are out there with you 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.039
 they are not very frequent you have to admit it 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.860
 but when they appear they leave you 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.120
 your benefit and nothing I hope there 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.690
 liked the mountain I do not want to lengthen 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:19.240
 I was watching the lava fountain there and we 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.240
 we see the next video so goodbye
