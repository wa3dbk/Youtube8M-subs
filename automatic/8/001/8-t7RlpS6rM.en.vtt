00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.180
 hello everyone welcome on the 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.240
 catherine breaker capsule your 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.580
 coach a crazy stress and today I 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.700
 you speak live from guatemala I 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.420
 you receive in the beautiful house 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:32.220
 I had for a few weeks and the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:36.129
 place is so peaceful that I am 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:39.400
 inspired today to share you the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:42.370
 prayer or lemattre I repeat myself 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:45.730
 several times a day and that brings me 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.350
 so much inner peace and 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.449
 happiness 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.070
 you know in life there are two 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:57.940
 emotions you love or the page ago 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.040
 openness or resistance y'a 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.500
 acceptance or judgment will have everything 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.799
 instinctively we have the opportunity to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.810
 choose if we will go in love or 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.510
 in fear 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.579
 I do not know if you've ever heard 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.130
 the following expression is not the 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.680
 events that determines our life but 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.619
 it's our reaction to 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.310
 gold events hence the importance of good 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.950
 choose your thoughts and where does it matter 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.710
 becomes brown aware of his thoughts 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.670
 because our thoughts create our 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.579
 reality 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.590
 so before sharing my prayer I 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.250
 will give you three steps 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:45.009
 essential to be able to create 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.609
 space and transform one's thoughts 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.340
 negative then the first step is 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.350
 to become aware 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.409
 we must be aware of what we 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.109
 wants to transform because everything we 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.780
 resists ended up gaining momentum 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:05.229
 in our life or the first step 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.039
 it is to realize that we have a thought 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.880
 negative 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:13.660
 an emotion of stress or on the part of 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.110
 second step is to welcome his 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.230
 thoughts their this emotion 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.470
 again all that all that 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.710
 we resist loses 6 so the second 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.070
 step one must welcome the emotion the 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.520
 thought or judgment is the third 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:36.630
 step is the letting go 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.690
 we must release the emotion the judgment 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.180
 fear the stress if we want to create 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.280
 the space so that light can 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:51.959
 enter and that's where the prayer and I 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.420
 could say so important because 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.180
 that prayer helped us to liberate this 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.910
 then space will go up in my prayer 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.300
 I used the god, but if you 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.900
 please 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.550
 use the word that resonates with you 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.070
 so it's not a question of religion 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.800
 here but it's a question of energy 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.140
 for me the word god is a 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.880
 cosmic energy which is stronger and 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.310
 bigger than me then it's a word 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.489
 who resonates with me but for you if 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.590
 you want to choose the word angel universe 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.480
 if you want to talk to someone that 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.400
 you like but who died little 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.549
 matter what is important is that 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.930
 it sounds inside you then 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.200
 supporting me is this 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.060
 once I have identified the thought 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.989
 in negative quotation marks that cause me 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.680
 stress 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.510
 once I've welcomed this thought 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.769
 the young albert 1 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.340
 my god I give you this thought 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.709
 negative 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.830
 I give you the page I give you the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.470
 judgment please turn the 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.570
 in light and show me a new 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.260
 way of thinking 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.230
 show me how to choose love 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.220
 thank you to my god I give you this 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.769
 thought this stress this fear this judgment 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.620
 please turn them into 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.790
 light and show me a new 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.449
 way of 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:23.639

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:25.650
 love and me personally this 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:29.210
 prayer there I repeated several times 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.770
 per day and it's a mantra that 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.720
 brings me a lot of well being in 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.520
 my life brings me inner peace 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.130
 is what it is once again the 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.930
 that it creates space for the 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.139
 light can enter so that I can 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.470

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:49.919
