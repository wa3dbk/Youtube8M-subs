bowlers but their spinner wasn't good

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
bowlers but their spinner wasn't good
enough<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.480> they're<00:01:03.809> bad<00:01:04.110> they're<00:01:04.350> polar<00:01:04.619> in

the<00:01:04.979> top<00:01:05.220> six<00:01:05.489> wasn't<00:01:05.880> good<00:01:06.000> enough<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the top six wasn't good enough and

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.530

so<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> teams<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> Lourdes<00:01:13.080> they'll<00:01:13.200> be

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
so as the teams go to Lourdes they'll be

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
so as the teams go to Lourdes they'll be
looking<00:01:13.500> for<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.740> thing<00:01:13.890> they'll<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:14.909> looking

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
looking for one thing they'll be looking

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.370 
looking for one thing they'll be looking
for<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.360> surface<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.200> more

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
for a surface there's a little more

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.499 
for a surface there's a little more
responsive<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.369> they<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.610> play<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:17.820> bowlers

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
responsive so they can play for bowlers

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.130

India though that came out of Nottingham

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.850 
India though that came out of Nottingham
was<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> bowlers<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.290> capable<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
was that the bowlers are capable of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.219 
was that the bowlers are capable of
bowling<00:01:35.159> long<00:01:35.400> spells<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.450> Shanshan<00:01:36.840> ma<00:01:36.990> flag

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
bowling long spells the Shanshan ma flag

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.480 
bowling long spells the Shanshan ma flag

thirty eight overs boognish sure Kumar

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
thirty eight overs boognish sure Kumar
kept<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> long<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> only

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
kept going for a long time the only

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.730 
kept going for a long time the only
concern<00:01:42.390> I<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.899> India<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
concern I think for India is the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.039 
concern I think for India is the
consistency<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:45.030> Mohammad<00:01:45.509> Shah<00:01:45.720> me<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
consistency of of Mohammad Shah me and

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
consistency of of Mohammad Shah me and
I'm<00:01:46.350> sure<00:01:46.590> as<00:01:46.710> he<00:01:46.860> bowls<00:01:47.070> more<00:01:47.399> he<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.700> get

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
I'm sure as he bowls more he will get

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
I'm sure as he bowls more he will get
that<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.270> apart<00:01:49.079> from<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.350> balance<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.829> think

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
that so apart from the balance I think

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.920 
that so apart from the balance I think
both<00:01:50.520> teams<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:51.090> look<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.479> Test<00:01:51.720> match

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
both teams will look at this Test match

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.170 
both teams will look at this Test match
and<00:01:52.140> say<00:01:52.259> we've<00:01:52.439> got<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.890> big<00:01:53.100> majority<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and say we've got the big majority of

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.690 
and say we've got the big majority of
our<00:01:54.990> team<00:01:55.259> correct<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.399> need<00:01:56.579> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
our team correct now we just need to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.340 
our team correct now we just need to
tinker<00:01:57.090> around<00:01:57.119> with<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.600> balance<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
tinker around with the balance but that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.950 
tinker around with the balance but that
is<00:01:58.649> proving<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.610> an<00:01:59.790> issue<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.540> was<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> boy

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
is proving to be an issue it was a boy

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.289 
is proving to be an issue it was a boy
it<00:02:01.140> was<00:02:01.350> at<00:02:01.619> one<00:02:01.950> level<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.460> boring<00:02:02.820> Test<00:02:03.090> match

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it was at one level of boring Test match

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
it was at one level of boring Test match
because<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:05.009> wasn't<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> contest<00:02:05.670> between<00:02:05.820> bat

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
because it wasn't a contest between bat

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.760 
because it wasn't a contest between bat
and<00:02:06.299> ball<00:02:06.420> for<00:02:06.689> long<00:02:06.869> enough<00:02:07.140> other<00:02:07.350> than<00:02:07.560> just

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
and ball for long enough other than just

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.010 
and ball for long enough other than just
two<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.069> three<00:02:08.099> periods<00:02:08.640> over<00:02:08.819> five<00:02:09.209> days<00:02:09.539> at
