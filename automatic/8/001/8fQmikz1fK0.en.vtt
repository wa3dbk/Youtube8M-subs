see what you're typing so let me do a

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.300 
see what you're typing so let me do a
keyboard<00:03:29.079> test<00:03:29.380> for<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:29.950> we'll<00:03:30.040> see<00:03:30.160> how

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
keyboard test for you and we'll see how

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.949 
keyboard test for you and we'll see how
accurate<00:03:30.670> this<00:03:30.760> is<00:03:30.940> and<00:03:31.150> if<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.389> samsungs

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
accurate this is and if the samsungs

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.190 
accurate this is and if the samsungs
good<00:03:32.230> keyboards<00:03:32.769> have<00:03:33.310> held<00:03:33.639> up<00:03:33.880> on<00:03:34.200> the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
good keyboards have held up on the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.559 
good keyboards have held up on the
mythic<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.130> we'll<00:03:36.310> do<00:03:36.639> my<00:03:36.760> usual<00:03:36.819> thing<00:03:37.329> this

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
mythic so we'll do my usual thing this

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.740 
mythic so we'll do my usual thing this
is<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.780> test<00:03:37.989> and<00:03:38.200> see<00:03:38.319> how<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.470> works<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:43.600> can

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
is a test and see how it works you can

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.020 
is a test and see how it works you can
definitely<00:03:43.930> see<00:03:44.170> autocorrect<00:03:44.739> in<00:03:44.980> an<00:03:45.310> action

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
definitely see autocorrect in an action

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.360 
definitely see autocorrect in an action
there<00:03:46.180> this<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.049> tier<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.709> what<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.160> ended<00:03:48.190> up

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
there this is a tier is what I ended up

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.280 
there this is a tier is what I ended up
typing<00:03:48.730> not<00:03:48.970> entirely<00:03:49.269> accurate<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:49.959> i'm<00:03:50.109> not

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
typing not entirely accurate but i'm not

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.410 
typing not entirely accurate but i'm not
completely<00:03:51.160> familiar<00:03:51.459> with<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:51.970> keyboard<00:03:52.180> on

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
completely familiar with the keyboard on

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.729 
completely familiar with the keyboard on
the<00:03:52.450> device<00:03:52.720> i'm<00:03:52.930> not<00:03:53.049> used<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.590> yet<00:03:53.620> i

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
the device i'm not used to it yet i

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:54.870 
the device i'm not used to it yet i
think<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.100> one<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.280> those<00:03:54.400> things<00:03:54.459> as<00:03:54.760> you

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
think it's one of those things as you

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.789 
think it's one of those things as you
get<00:03:55.000> used<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.299> it<00:03:55.359> you'll<00:03:55.930> become<00:03:56.260> more<00:03:56.560> and

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
get used to it you'll become more and

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.309 
get used to it you'll become more and
more<00:03:56.889> accurate<00:03:57.609> so<00:03:58.540> overall<00:03:58.840> it's<00:03:59.230> a<00:03:59.290> pretty

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
more accurate so overall it's a pretty

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.280 
more accurate so overall it's a pretty
usable<00:03:59.739> keyboard<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.639> a<00:04:01.180> pretty<00:04:01.389> usable<00:04:01.630> OS

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
usable keyboard and a pretty usable OS

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.809 
usable keyboard and a pretty usable OS

so then you'll talk about the hardware

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.309 
so then you'll talk about the hardware
