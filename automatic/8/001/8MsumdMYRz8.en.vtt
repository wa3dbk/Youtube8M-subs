jonathan wilson and today i want to show
you<00:00:05.100> a<00:00:05.220> very<00:00:05.460> useful<00:00:05.700> little<00:00:05.940> add-on<00:00:06.450> anytime

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
you a very useful little add-on anytime

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.980 
you a very useful little add-on anytime
that<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.710> want<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.130> copy<00:00:08.780> attributes<00:00:09.780> from

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
that you want to copy attributes from

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.860 
that you want to copy attributes from
one<00:00:10.260> object<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.800> another<00:00:11.010> or<00:00:11.670> any<00:00:12.120> number<00:00:12.660> of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
one object to another or any number of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.169 
one object to another or any number of
other<00:00:13.110> objects<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> perfect<00:00:14.639> example<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
other objects so a perfect example is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.480 
other objects so a perfect example is
these<00:00:15.750> two<00:00:15.929> objects<00:00:16.260> i<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.500> here<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.279> one<00:00:17.430> on

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
these two objects i have here the one on

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.400 
these two objects i have here the one on
the<00:00:17.670> left<00:00:17.880> has<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> series<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.840> modifiers<00:00:19.230> on

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
the left has a series of modifiers on

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.140 
the left has a series of modifiers on
them<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.800> one<00:00:19.949> on<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.130> right<00:00:20.279> does<00:00:20.640> not<00:00:20.820> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
them the one on the right does not and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.390 
them the one on the right does not and
yet<00:00:21.630> they're<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.930> exact<00:00:22.470> same<00:00:22.590> mesh<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.310> if

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
yet they're the exact same mesh so if

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.250 
yet they're the exact same mesh so if
you<00:00:23.490> see<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.820> one<00:00:24.000> here<00:00:24.210> fairly<00:00:24.689> simple<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
you see this one here fairly simple and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.080 
you see this one here fairly simple and
then<00:00:25.800> there's<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:26.939> they're

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
then there's this one here so they're

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.570 
then there's this one here so they're
identical<00:00:27.539> meshes<00:00:28.080> but<00:00:28.590> one<00:00:28.830> has<00:00:29.099> modifiers

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
identical meshes but one has modifiers

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
identical meshes but one has modifiers
and<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.029> does<00:00:30.240> not<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.410> take<00:00:31.500> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
and one does not so if we just take a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.130 
and one does not so if we just take a
look<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.820> modifiers<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.989> can

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
look at the one with modifiers you can

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.110 
look at the one with modifiers you can
see<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.100> there's<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.790> bevel

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
see what we have there's just a bevel

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.389 
see what we have there's just a bevel
and<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.690> subdivision<00:00:37.020> surface<00:00:37.440> modifier<00:00:37.829> just

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and a subdivision surface modifier just

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.299 
and a subdivision surface modifier just
making<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.329> nice<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.840> crisp<00:00:40.260> so<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.219> i

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
making it really nice and crisp so if i

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.240 
making it really nice and crisp so if i
wanted<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.700> copy<00:00:42.480> these<00:00:42.840> modifiers<00:00:43.649> over<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
wanted to copy these modifiers over to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
wanted to copy these modifiers over to
this<00:00:44.370> object<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:45.329> really<00:00:45.719> not<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.960> big<00:00:46.200> deal

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
this object it's really not a big deal

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
this object it's really not a big deal
because<00:00:46.649> i<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:46.980> simply<00:00:47.280> select<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.910> i

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
because i can simply select this one i

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.959 
because i can simply select this one i
can<00:00:48.360> go<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> modifiers<00:00:49.350> add<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.710> bevel<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.760> set

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
can go to modifiers add a bevel and set

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.209 
can go to modifiers add a bevel and set
the<00:00:51.090> angle<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.840> something<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.559> thirty<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the angle was something like thirty the

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.189 
the angle was something like thirty the
width<00:00:53.399> i<00:00:53.550> think<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.629> segments<00:00:55.079> were

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
width i think was one the segments were

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.529 
width i think was one the segments were
three<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.949> then<00:00:56.699> i<00:00:56.789> could<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.120> go<00:00:57.329> ahead<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
three and then i could also go ahead and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.389 
three and then i could also go ahead and
add<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:58.020> subdivision<00:00:58.530> surface<00:00:58.980> modifier

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
add in a subdivision surface modifier

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.000 
add in a subdivision surface modifier
and<00:00:59.670> I'll<00:01:00.270> set<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> shading<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> smooth<00:01:01.109> okay

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
and I'll set the shading to smooth okay

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.340 
and I'll set the shading to smooth okay
so<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.430> gives<00:01:02.670> us<00:01:02.820> basically<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.870> similar

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
so this gives us basically a similar

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
so this gives us basically a similar
angle<00:01:04.530> although<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.369> had<00:01:05.519> optimal

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
angle although this one had optimal

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.929 
angle although this one had optimal
display<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.159> yeah<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.430> looks<00:01:08.640> pretty<00:01:08.700> much

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
display and yeah that looks pretty much

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.160 
display and yeah that looks pretty much
the<00:01:09.000> same<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:10.080> but<00:01:10.439> what<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.920> wanted<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:12.170> do

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
the same so but what if we wanted to do

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
the same so but what if we wanted to do
something<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.119> this

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
something like this

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780 
something like this
where<00:01:15.840> suddenly<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.070> lot<00:01:17.610> of

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
where suddenly we have a lot of

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.249 
where suddenly we have a lot of
different<00:01:18.119> objects<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.600> we<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> copy

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
different objects that we want to copy

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.560 
different objects that we want to copy
really<00:01:20.040> quickly<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.030> could<00:01:21.210> go<00:01:21.330> ahead<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
really quickly so we could go ahead and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.030 
really quickly so we could go ahead and
do<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> manually<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.830> not

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
do it manually and you know this is not

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.429 
do it manually and you know this is not
a<00:01:23.070> big<00:01:23.369> deal<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.290> might

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
a big deal to do these you know it might

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.340 
a big deal to do these you know it might
take<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.799> five<00:01:25.830> minutes<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.490> do<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> these

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
take you five minutes to do all of these

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
take you five minutes to do all of these
but<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.920> had<00:01:29.130> even<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.640> hundred<00:01:29.909> objects<00:01:30.420> or

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
but if you had even a hundred objects or

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.690 
but if you had even a hundred objects or
perhaps<00:01:31.320> rather<00:01:31.710> than<00:01:31.979> only<00:01:32.250> having<00:01:32.460> two

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
perhaps rather than only having two

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
perhaps rather than only having two
modifiers<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.630> ten<00:01:34.140> modifiers<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> here

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
modifiers you have ten modifiers on here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.550 
modifiers you have ten modifiers on here
which<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.490> not<00:01:35.640> all<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.180> uncommon<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.439> it

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
which is not all that uncommon then it

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
which is not all that uncommon then it
becomes<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.250> time-consuming<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
becomes really really time-consuming to

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.510 
becomes really really time-consuming to
copy<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> these<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.189> where<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
copy all of these so this is where the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
copy all of these so this is where the
copy<00:01:41.759> attributes<00:01:42.299> add-on<00:01:42.600> comes<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.470> let's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
copy attributes add-on comes in so let's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.249 
copy attributes add-on comes in so let's
just<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> our<00:01:44.280> user<00:01:44.490> preferences<00:01:45.200> go<00:01:46.200> to

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
just go to our user preferences go to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.870 
just go to our user preferences go to
the<00:01:46.380> add-ons<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> bundled<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.399> blender

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the add-ons this is bundled with blender

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
the add-ons this is bundled with blender
and<00:01:48.060> simply<00:01:48.930> search<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.140> copy<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.490> see

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and simply search for copy you can see

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.270 
and simply search for copy you can see
copy<00:01:51.060> attributes<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:51.990> we'll<00:01:52.200> enable<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:52.860> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
copy attributes so we'll enable it you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.710 
copy attributes so we'll enable it you
can<00:01:53.399> see<00:01:53.579> any<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> details<00:01:54.270> about<00:01:54.360> here

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
can see any of the details about here

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.770 
can see any of the details about here
and<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.350> creates<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> hotkey<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.369> for<00:01:56.640> ctrl<00:01:57.270> C

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and it creates a hotkey just for ctrl C

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
and it creates a hotkey just for ctrl C
so<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.649> does<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.130> first<00:01:59.490> select<00:01:59.909> all

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
so what it does is you first select all

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
so what it does is you first select all
the<00:02:00.360> objects<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> want<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.170> copy<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
the objects that you want to copy the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.620 
the objects that you want to copy the
attributes<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.729> we'll<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.119> select<00:02:03.240> all

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
attributes to so we'll just select all

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.700 
attributes to so we'll just select all
of<00:02:03.990> these<00:02:04.469> something<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.079> then

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
of these something like this and then

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.199 
of these something like this and then
you<00:02:07.829> select<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.220> copy<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.670> attributes<00:02:09.060> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
you select the copy the attributes that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.910 
you select the copy the attributes that
you<00:02:09.300> want<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.509> copy<00:02:09.690> from<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.319> useless<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.860> you

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
you want to copy from so useless so you

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.920 
you want to copy from so useless so you
select<00:02:11.310> your<00:02:11.610> master<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.569> case<00:02:12.750> we'll

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
select your master so in this case we'll

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.820 
select your master so in this case we'll
just<00:02:12.959> like<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> one

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
just like this one

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.590 
just like this one
while<00:02:14.130> holding<00:02:14.340> down<00:02:14.460> shift<00:02:14.820> so<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.420> makes

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
while holding down shift so that makes

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.840 
while holding down shift so that makes
it<00:02:15.750> active<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.440> now<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.100> just<00:02:17.190> hit<00:02:17.310> ctrl<00:02:17.820> C

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
it active and now we can just hit ctrl C

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.690 
it active and now we can just hit ctrl C
and<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.990> brings<00:02:19.170> up<00:02:19.410> our<00:02:19.620> menu<00:02:19.860> here<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.640> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
and it brings up our menu here so you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.800 
and it brings up our menu here so you
can<00:02:20.790> see<00:02:20.850> there's<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.120> lot<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.540> different

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
can see there's a lot of different

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.850 
can see there's a lot of different
things<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.020> we<00:02:22.230> can<00:02:22.350> copy

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
things that we can copy

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.640 
things that we can copy
we<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.190> copy<00:02:23.310> location<00:02:23.520> rotation<00:02:24.120> scale<00:02:24.990> we

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
we can copy location rotation scale we

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.050 
we can copy location rotation scale we
can<00:02:25.770> copy<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.130> mass<00:02:26.400> if<00:02:26.700> you're<00:02:26.820> doing<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
can copy the mass if you're doing a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.160 
can copy the mass if you're doing a
whole<00:02:27.180> bunch<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.390> rigid<00:02:27.660> body<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:27.930> this

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
whole bunch of rigid body so this

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.840 
whole bunch of rigid body so this
becomes<00:02:28.470> really<00:02:29.010> useful<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.580> you've<00:02:29.670> got<00:02:29.820> a

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
becomes really useful if you've got a

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.400 
becomes really useful if you've got a
whole<00:02:30.090> bunch<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.390> rigid<00:02:30.690> body<00:02:30.840> objects<00:02:31.260> and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
whole bunch of rigid body objects and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.600 
whole bunch of rigid body objects and
you<00:02:31.470> want<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.800> quickly<00:02:31.980> copy<00:02:32.340> some

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you want to just quickly copy some

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.820 
you want to just quickly copy some
attributes<00:02:33.000> from<00:02:33.210> them<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.590> case

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
attributes from them and in this case

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.320 
attributes from them and in this case
the<00:02:35.040> one<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.610> copy<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.030> the

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
the one that we want to copy is the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.970 
the one that we want to copy is the
modifiers<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.140> if<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.350> just<00:02:37.470> click<00:02:37.590> copy

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
modifiers so if we just click copy

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.490 
modifiers so if we just click copy
modifiers<00:02:38.460> give<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.210> second<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.660> there<00:02:40.350> we

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
modifiers give it a second and there we

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.950 
modifiers give it a second and there we
go<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:40.680> now<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.340> them<00:02:41.460> have<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.750> same

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
go so now all of them have the same

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.380 
go so now all of them have the same
modifiers<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.770> more<00:02:44.250> importantly<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:45.240> have

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
modifiers and more importantly they have

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.050 
modifiers and more importantly they have
the<00:02:45.510> exact<00:02:45.870> same<00:02:45.930> settings<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.460> can<00:02:47.850> also

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
the exact same settings so you can also

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.060 
the exact same settings so you can also
do<00:02:48.270> this<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.540> remove<00:02:48.810> modifiers<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.710> for

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
do this to remove modifiers so for

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.850 
do this to remove modifiers so for
example<00:02:50.570> let's<00:02:51.570> just<00:02:51.720> select<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.050> one<00:02:52.110> let's

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
example let's just select this one let's

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.590 
example let's just select this one let's
go<00:02:52.980> ahead<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.400> remove<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.940> modifiers<00:02:54.360> from

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
go ahead and remove the modifiers from

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.660 
go ahead and remove the modifiers from
it<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.990> then<00:02:55.650> let's<00:02:55.830> select<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.310> these

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
it and then let's select all of these

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.000 
it and then let's select all of these
noticing<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.690> have<00:02:57.959> my<00:02:58.170> my<00:02:58.470> ground<00:02:58.770> plane

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
noticing that I have my my ground plane

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.410 
noticing that I have my my ground plane
here<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.280> just<00:02:59.430> disabled<00:02:59.850> in<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.030> selection

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
here is just disabled in the selection

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.180 
here is just disabled in the selection
so<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:00.660> why<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> didn't<00:03:01.020> select<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.530> now

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
so that's why I didn't select and now

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.580 
so that's why I didn't select and now
I'll<00:03:02.310> hit<00:03:02.459> ctrl<00:03:03.000> C<00:03:03.030> once<00:03:03.690> more<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.170> I'll

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
I'll hit ctrl C once more and I'll

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.220 
I'll hit ctrl C once more and I'll
choose<00:03:04.860> copy<00:03:05.490> modifiers<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.300> it<00:03:06.690> removes<00:03:07.020> all

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
choose copy modifiers and it removes all

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.020 
choose copy modifiers and it removes all
of<00:03:07.290> them<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.100> can<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.280> really<00:03:08.520> useful<00:03:09.000> for

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
of them so this can be really useful for

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.540 
of them so this can be really useful for
those<00:03:09.750> kinds<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.170> things<00:03:10.410> but<00:03:11.010> let's<00:03:11.310> go<00:03:11.430> ahead

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
those kinds of things but let's go ahead

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.250 
those kinds of things but let's go ahead
and<00:03:11.640> undo<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.150> let's<00:03:12.450> bring<00:03:12.690> our<00:03:12.840> modifiers

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
and undo that let's bring our modifiers

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.650 
and undo that let's bring our modifiers
back<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.950> let's<00:03:14.610> look<00:03:14.700> at<00:03:14.850> one<00:03:15.060> more<00:03:15.090> thing

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
back and let's look at one more thing

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.040 
back and let's look at one more thing
something<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> will<00:03:16.560> commonly<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.370> is

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
something that will commonly do is

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.590 
something that will commonly do is
change<00:03:19.050> settings<00:03:19.500> so<00:03:20.100> say<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.700> go<00:03:21.330> ahead<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
change settings so say I go ahead and

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.820 
change settings so say I go ahead and
adjust<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.959> side<00:03:22.110> on<00:03:22.200> here<00:03:22.320> maybe<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.739> know

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
adjust a side on here maybe you know

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.009 
adjust a side on here maybe you know
just<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.250> sake<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.720> performance<00:03:24.720> maybe<00:03:24.900> I

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
just for the sake of performance maybe I

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.630 
just for the sake of performance maybe I
don't<00:03:25.110> want<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.530> have<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.739> at<00:03:25.920> two<00:03:26.130> for<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
don't want to have this at two for the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.520 
don't want to have this at two for the
viewport<00:03:27.180> so<00:03:27.600> I'll<00:03:27.690> go<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:27.930> change<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
viewport so I'll go and change that and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.170 
viewport so I'll go and change that and
maybe<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.370> for<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.580> sake<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.760> visualization

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
maybe just for the sake of visualization

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180 
maybe just for the sake of visualization
maybe<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.200> go<00:03:31.380> ahead<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.650> turn<00:03:31.739> on<00:03:31.980> the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
maybe I go ahead and turn on the

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.880 
maybe I go ahead and turn on the
wireframe<00:03:32.430> option<00:03:33.060> here<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:34.380> could<00:03:34.560> even

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
wireframe option here and I could even

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.890 
wireframe option here and I could even
adjust<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> object<00:03:35.880> color<00:03:36.120> if<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.600> wanted

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
adjust the object color if I wanted

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.750 
adjust the object color if I wanted
although<00:03:37.140> I<00:03:37.170> believe<00:03:37.530> actually<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.340> don't<00:03:38.459> know

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
although I believe actually I don't know

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.130 
although I believe actually I don't know
when<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.180> changes<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:39.900> we'll<00:03:40.019> just

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
when that changes but so we'll just

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.040 
when that changes but so we'll just
leave<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.500> as<00:03:40.739> is<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.940> we<00:03:42.209> can<00:03:42.330> do<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.959> know

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
leave that as is so we can do you know

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.690 
leave that as is so we can do you know
any<00:03:43.320> number<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.769> our<00:03:43.860> display<00:03:44.280> things<00:03:44.430> here

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
any number of our display things here

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.759 
any number of our display things here
and<00:03:44.850> again<00:03:45.269> we<00:03:45.450> want<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.660> copy<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.230> all<00:03:46.470> of

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
and again we want to copy it to all of

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.290 
and again we want to copy it to all of
our<00:03:46.890> other<00:03:47.040> objects<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:47.790> let's<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.180> select

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
our other objects so let's just select

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.970 
our other objects so let's just select
all<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.600> these<00:03:48.780> they<00:03:48.989> just<00:03:49.140> hit<00:03:49.230> B<00:03:49.410> for<00:03:49.709> my<00:03:49.800> box

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
all of these they just hit B for my box

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.790 
all of these they just hit B for my box
select<00:03:50.340> hit<00:03:50.820> control<00:03:51.269> C<00:03:51.540> first<00:03:52.260> I'll<00:03:52.500> copy<00:03:52.650> the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
select hit control C first I'll copy the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.650 
select hit control C first I'll copy the
modifiers<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.730> copies<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.090> settings

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
modifiers so it copies the settings

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.479 
modifiers so it copies the settings
within<00:03:54.959> those<00:03:55.260> modifiers<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:56.340> actually

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
within those modifiers so it actually

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.310 
within those modifiers so it actually
basically<00:03:57.300> removes<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.690> modifiers<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.230> then

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
basically removes the modifiers and then

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.110 
basically removes the modifiers and then
recopy<00:03:58.709> z'<00:03:58.860> them<00:03:59.010> but<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.640> this<00:03:59.730> case<00:03:59.940> it

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
recopy z' them but in this case it

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.490 
recopy z' them but in this case it
effectively<00:04:00.510> just<00:04:00.780> changes<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.200> settings

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
effectively just changes the settings

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.340 
effectively just changes the settings
and<00:04:01.739> then<00:04:02.250> we<00:04:02.519> can<00:04:02.670> also<00:04:02.880> copy<00:04:03.360> all<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:04.110> drawl

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
and then we can also copy all the drawl

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.680 
and then we can also copy all the drawl
types<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:04.950> we'll<00:04:05.100> hit<00:04:05.220> ctrl<00:04:05.580> C<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:06.060> choose

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
types so we'll hit ctrl C and choose

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.400 
types so we'll hit ctrl C and choose
copy<00:04:07.580> draw<00:04:08.580> options<00:04:09.090> right<00:04:09.450> here<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.870> that

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
copy draw options right here and that

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.500 
copy draw options right here and that
way<00:04:10.560> they<00:04:10.739> all<00:04:10.920> show<00:04:11.190> up<00:04:11.220> as<00:04:11.519> wireframe<00:04:12.360> and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
way they all show up as wireframe and

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.180 
way they all show up as wireframe and
you<00:04:13.019> know<00:04:13.080> if<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:13.230> look<00:04:13.380> again<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.799> can<00:04:14.010> see

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
you know if you look again you can see

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.620 
you know if you look again you can see
that<00:04:14.400> there's<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.610> lot<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.150> different<00:04:15.450> things

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
that there's a lot of different things

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.140 
that there's a lot of different things
that<00:04:15.780> we<00:04:15.930> can<00:04:16.229> copy<00:04:16.729> you<00:04:17.729> know<00:04:17.760> everything

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
that we can copy you know everything

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.670 
that we can copy you know everything
from<00:04:18.450> protected<00:04:18.900> transforms<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.590> the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
from protected transforms to the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.140 
from protected transforms to the
constraints<00:04:20.340> on<00:04:20.430> an<00:04:20.519> object<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.030> is

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
constraints on an object so this is

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.250 
constraints on an object so this is
really<00:04:21.299> useful<00:04:21.479> because<00:04:21.780> otherwise<00:04:22.080> you

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
really useful because otherwise you

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.500 
really useful because otherwise you
can't<00:04:22.289> do<00:04:22.680> that<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.640> can<00:04:23.760> copy<00:04:23.970> vertex

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
can't do that you can copy vertex

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.120 
can't do that you can copy vertex
weights<00:04:24.750> if<00:04:24.990> you've<00:04:25.110> got<00:04:25.260> matching<00:04:25.650> mesh<00:04:25.860> data

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
weights if you've got matching mesh data

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.530 
weights if you've got matching mesh data
so<00:04:26.700> really<00:04:27.240> really

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
so really really

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.870 
so really really
useful<00:04:27.780> add-on<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.380> copy<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:29.400> one<00:04:29.610> thing<00:04:29.790> to

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
useful add-on to copy the one thing to

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.630 
useful add-on to copy the one thing to
be<00:04:30.000> aware<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.510> is<00:04:30.660> that<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.990> does<00:04:31.200> override<00:04:32.100> the

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
be aware of is that it does override the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.750 
be aware of is that it does override the
copy<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.300> buffer<00:04:33.690> option<00:04:34.650> so<00:04:34.950> for<00:04:35.400> example<00:04:35.700> if

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
copy to buffer option so for example if

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.910 
copy to buffer option so for example if
we<00:04:35.910> disable<00:04:36.150> this<00:04:36.630> really<00:04:36.900> quick<00:04:37.140> and<00:04:37.350> I<00:04:37.800> hit

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
we disable this really quick and I hit

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.070 
we disable this really quick and I hit
ctrl<00:04:38.370> C<00:04:38.400> you<00:04:39.030> can<00:04:39.120> see<00:04:39.240> that<00:04:39.360> we<00:04:39.450> can<00:04:39.570> copy<00:04:39.840> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
ctrl C you can see that we can copy the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.380 
ctrl C you can see that we can copy the
selection<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.830> buffer<00:04:41.130> so<00:04:42.090> this<00:04:42.240> is

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
selection to the buffer so this is

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.890 
selection to the buffer so this is
actually<00:04:42.660> allows<00:04:42.840> us<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.230> copy<00:04:44.030> objects<00:04:45.030> into

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
actually allows us to copy objects into

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.990 
actually allows us to copy objects into
our<00:04:46.260> memory<00:04:46.650> to<00:04:46.920> then<00:04:47.040> actually<00:04:47.220> paste<00:04:47.610> either

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
our memory to then actually paste either

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.850 
our memory to then actually paste either
within<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.510> same<00:04:48.690> blender<00:04:48.990> version<00:04:49.320> or<00:04:49.470> to

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
within the same blender version or to

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.440 
within the same blender version or to
another<00:04:50.070> instance<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.550> blender<00:04:50.850> so<00:04:51.240> for

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
another instance of blender so for

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.870 
another instance of blender so for
example<00:04:51.780> if<00:04:51.840> I<00:04:51.930> just<00:04:51.960> hit<00:04:52.350> ctrl<00:04:52.740> C<00:04:52.770> copy<00:04:53.580> this

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
example if I just hit ctrl C copy this

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.110 
example if I just hit ctrl C copy this
and<00:04:54.150> maybe<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.930> will<00:04:55.050> jump<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.920> new<00:04:56.340> blank

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
and maybe I will jump to a new blank

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.700 
and maybe I will jump to a new blank
scene<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.630> I'll<00:04:57.720> just<00:04:57.810> go<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:57.990> new<00:04:58.260> and<00:04:58.440> hit

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
scene so I'll just go to new and hit

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.160 
scene so I'll just go to new and hit
control<00:04:59.070> V<00:04:59.250> paste<00:04:59.600> then<00:05:00.600> it's<00:05:00.750> gonna<00:05:00.840> paste

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
control V paste then it's gonna paste

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.960 
control V paste then it's gonna paste
that<00:05:01.350> object<00:05:01.740> in<00:05:01.920> in<00:05:02.190> its<00:05:02.340> original<00:05:02.820> location

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
that object in in its original location

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.540 
that object in in its original location
so<00:05:03.780> this<00:05:03.930> can<00:05:04.110> be<00:05:04.140> really<00:05:04.350> really<00:05:04.650> useful<00:05:04.920> so

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
so this can be really really useful so

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.240 
so this can be really really useful so
just<00:05:05.760> be<00:05:05.940> aware<00:05:05.970> that<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:07.110> copy<00:05:07.380> attributes

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
just be aware that the copy attributes

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.670 
just be aware that the copy attributes
menu<00:05:08.520> by<00:05:08.970> default<00:05:09.420> is<00:05:09.630> going<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.200> override

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
menu by default is going to override

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.040 
menu by default is going to override
that<00:05:10.890> if<00:05:11.310> you<00:05:11.880> don't<00:05:12.180> want<00:05:12.450> it<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.630> override

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
that if you don't want it to override

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.900 
that if you don't want it to override
that<00:05:13.320> then<00:05:13.740> you<00:05:13.830> can<00:05:13.980> simply<00:05:14.310> go<00:05:14.490> into<00:05:14.670> your

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
that then you can simply go into your

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.990 
that then you can simply go into your
user<00:05:15.120> preferences<00:05:15.390> first<00:05:16.380> enable<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:17.040> then

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
user preferences first enable this then

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.240 
user preferences first enable this then
go<00:05:18.120> into<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.420> input<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.080> somewhere<00:05:20.070> within

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
go into the input and somewhere within

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.420 
go into the input and somewhere within
the<00:05:20.580> 3d<00:05:21.180> view<00:05:21.450> probably<00:05:21.840> 3d<00:05:22.560> view<00:05:22.800> global

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
the 3d view probably 3d view global

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.280 
the 3d view probably 3d view global
there's<00:05:23.970> going<00:05:24.210> to<00:05:24.270> be<00:05:24.360> an<00:05:24.480> option<00:05:24.690> in<00:05:24.990> here

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
there's going to be an option in here

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.640 
there's going to be an option in here
for<00:05:25.740> control<00:05:26.370> see<00:05:26.670> that<00:05:27.270> then<00:05:27.480> is<00:05:27.630> set<00:05:27.900> to<00:05:28.230> the

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
for control see that then is set to the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.680 
for control see that then is set to the
the<00:05:29.160> copy<00:05:29.400> attributes<00:05:29.850> menu<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.330> if<00:05:30.420> you<00:05:30.450> just

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
the copy attributes menu and if you just

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.750 
the copy attributes menu and if you just
change<00:05:30.960> that<00:05:31.230> or<00:05:31.530> you<00:05:32.130> change<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.520> copy

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
change that or you change the copy

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.970 
change that or you change the copy
buffer<00:05:33.210> then<00:05:33.750> you'll<00:05:33.900> be<00:05:34.020> good<00:05:34.140> to<00:05:34.200> go<00:05:34.320> so

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
buffer then you'll be good to go so

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.490 
buffer then you'll be good to go so
that's<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:35.850> fairly<00:05:36.450> simple<00:05:36.960> little<00:05:37.200> add-on

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
that's it a fairly simple little add-on

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.140 
that's it a fairly simple little add-on
but<00:05:37.800> really<00:05:38.220> really<00:05:38.370> useful<00:05:38.760> I<00:05:38.820> know<00:05:38.910> that

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
but really really useful I know that

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.000 
but really really useful I know that
within<00:05:39.360> my<00:05:39.480> own<00:05:39.600> workflow<00:05:39.810> it<00:05:40.290> saves<00:05:40.590> an<00:05:40.860> awful

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
within my own workflow it saves an awful

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.830 
within my own workflow it saves an awful
lot<00:05:41.370> of<00:05:41.400> time<00:05:41.700> you<00:05:42.210> know<00:05:42.240> just<00:05:42.360> copying

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
lot of time you know just copying

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.270 
lot of time you know just copying
between<00:05:43.110> things<00:05:43.350> like<00:05:43.440> this<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.860> think<00:05:44.100> one<00:05:44.250> of

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
between things like this I think one of

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.740 
between things like this I think one of
the<00:05:44.400> most<00:05:44.520> extreme<00:05:45.000> cases<00:05:45.240> of<00:05:45.420> where<00:05:45.630> it's

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
the most extreme cases of where it's

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.750 
the most extreme cases of where it's
really<00:05:45.930> useful<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.560> anytime<00:05:47.280> you're<00:05:47.460> doing<00:05:47.580> a

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
really useful is anytime you're doing a

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.250 
really useful is anytime you're doing a
rigid<00:05:48.060> body<00:05:48.210> simulation<00:05:48.720> you<00:05:49.020> know<00:05:49.110> like<00:05:49.230> a

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
rigid body simulation you know like a

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.200 
rigid body simulation you know like a
perfect<00:05:49.620> example<00:05:50.010> is<00:05:50.130> if<00:05:50.310> you're<00:05:50.760> dropping

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
perfect example is if you're dropping

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.830 
perfect example is if you're dropping
say<00:05:52.130> 10000<00:05:53.130> cubes<00:05:53.490> or<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:54.510> know<00:05:54.600> even<00:05:54.630> just

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
say 10000 cubes or you know even just

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.440 
say 10000 cubes or you know even just
100<00:05:55.320> cubes<00:05:55.590> into<00:05:56.040> a<00:05:56.250> bowl<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:57.210> want<00:05:57.360> those

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
100 cubes into a bowl and you want those

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.330 
100 cubes into a bowl and you want those
all<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.900> be<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:58.380> know<00:05:58.470> breaking<00:05:58.800> apart<00:05:58.890> and

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
all to be you know breaking apart and

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.410 
all to be you know breaking apart and
doing<00:05:59.580> all<00:05:59.670> kinds<00:05:59.700> of<00:05:59.910> different<00:05:59.970> things<00:06:00.180> if

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
doing all kinds of different things if

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.060 
doing all kinds of different things if
you<00:06:00.870> suddenly<00:06:01.140> realize<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.530> you<00:06:01.680> wanted<00:06:01.980> to

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
you suddenly realize that you wanted to

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.850 
you suddenly realize that you wanted to
change<00:06:02.130> one<00:06:02.700> setting<00:06:03.150> on<00:06:03.360> all<00:06:03.930> of<00:06:04.140> them<00:06:04.350> that's

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
change one setting on all of them that's

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.880 
change one setting on all of them that's
really<00:06:05.400> cumbersome<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.390> do<00:06:06.570> without<00:06:07.560> this

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
really cumbersome to do without this

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.670 
really cumbersome to do without this
add-on<00:06:08.190> so<00:06:08.430> really<00:06:08.970> really<00:06:09.180> useful

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
add-on so really really useful

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.810 
add-on so really really useful
definitely<00:06:10.680> speeds<00:06:11.010> up<00:06:11.100> a<00:06:11.160> lot<00:06:11.280> of<00:06:11.370> things<00:06:11.580> in

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
definitely speeds up a lot of things in

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.640 
definitely speeds up a lot of things in
my<00:06:11.940> own<00:06:12.060> workflow<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.720> maybe<00:06:13.350> it'll<00:06:13.530> be

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
my own workflow and maybe it'll be

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.280 
my own workflow and maybe it'll be
useful<00:06:13.680> for<00:06:14.160> you
