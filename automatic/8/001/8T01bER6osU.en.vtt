 reviews here on the channel but let the 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.180
 visit the first book I received 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.840
 in December it was neuromancer in this edition 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.329
 Beautiful 30 year old and I got drooling 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.210
 in this one since I saw a post 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.610
 on facebook daleffe actually a box 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.559
 Let 's kinda take this little chain here and here. 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.600
 Do you see the spine of the book he is? 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.710
 stitched type it does not have a spine 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.440
 normal 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.260
 Look how beautiful people it's all network 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.689
 and it's also very good so 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.640
 I'm very afraid of reading ruining you. 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.189
 pass in you feel the glue here is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.400
 very cool this craft here 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.930
 inside me it's very cute pages 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.570
 and pages of things that are not good for 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.299
 Nothing, but we think it's beautiful, every beginning. 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.860
 of chapter it is different and so I 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.509
 I do not remember very well what you're talking about. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.210
 this book I know he is a dystopia 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.579
 mixed with science fiction and has 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.530
 hackers and programming everything that I 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.960
 I really like, I love this whole universe. 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.790
 so I'm sure I will, I do not know 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.490
 when I go because he is very big and 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.310
 I was told to hear about the black side of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.630
 internet it very complicated to read not 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.189
 I'll leave it to read a little bit more 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.040
 forward because now a whole 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.869
 that even the door does not heal 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.119
 human gender sedh william gibson 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.220
 next book is chris's new world 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.780
 boyce I bought when rafa here in 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.579
 town, we just hop in the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.079
 bookstore I said I was going to buy a book 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.399
 paths always there with three 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.970
 until then I did not have much interest 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.860
 because after all 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.050
 I like this cover I'm not much fan 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.630
 Her and Rafael spoke to me is the synopsis. 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.360
 which was the dystopic world of children and 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 adults died through a virus 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.200
 to a business and only the 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.870
 teens they will fax you between 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.840
 All fight or confusion then imagine 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.970
 a world governed by adolescents 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.980
 I'm really looking forward to the list here. 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 I had started there in the marathon but I heard 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.120
 This is a book that I like a lot. 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.340
 so I want him in my time I did not want to 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.380
 to rush in the end they ended up liking 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.150
 so much so I'll read it 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.310
 the next book is the last man in the 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.600
 tower of the era 20 the tip is the first 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.240
 thing that draws attention in this book 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.070
 It was this gorgeous gorgeous cover ever. 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.110
 I loved this cover I had seen and a half 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.700
 I do not see much talk at the top of the bookstore. 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.980
 about this book here on the internet then 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.840
 I decided to go in that 9 if I bought it 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.760
 without looking at the note on the brush first time 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.740
 in the life I do this story speaks 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.750
 about a building that the locals call 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.970
 The legal neighborhood is very good. 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.920
 although it is not a perfect building, right? 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.480
 running water from time to time a 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.640
 little SÃ£o Paulo here in this building 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.010
 but until there comes a woman washes 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.500
 very canvas magnate and she decides that he 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.660
 is a perfect place to build a 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.130
 luxury building over sakineh and the 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.410
 people are very angry I met her 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.060
 will have to combat the resistance of 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.340
 residents of this building because it does not 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.200
 want to be dumped there, then to 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.120
 to be a really cool book I found one 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.190
 single premise despite being one thing 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.080
 super from day to day yes another book that 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.780

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.239
 with rafa it was mysterious home kevin says 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.280

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.140
 about the marathon readings I will leave 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.360
 The link below this book speaks 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.799

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.810
 protagonist will find that these 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.060

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.040

 book is everything one day you should know 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.860
 I received this book from the new publisher. 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.049
 concept they sent me an action 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.470
 including luck in one 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.450
 their 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.890

 It's cool, same then, this is it, and another. 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.940

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.010
 of the adventures of the spell hunt I 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.080
 I just loved the first book of this 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.570

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.800
 excellent partnership with aleph publisher 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.720
 which was the best nando frank herbert 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.919
 I asked him because since I 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.380
 I discovered that it was one of the fictions 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.450
 so most acclaimed scientific one 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.400
 science fiction I had to read 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.320
 could not call me funk ever 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.690
 This book, I told you, our people are good. 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.250
 This book tells you what he's going through. 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.960
 by a test in the early days 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.550
 chapters he is obliged to leave the 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.040
 his planet to this planet 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.560
 called the book he is well 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.200
 dense if we find political houses 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.910
 fighting against other houses and empire 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.190
 a good thing so no one showed the 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.260
 nice saifi I already started and only two 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.450
 chapters but I have already seen that it will be a game 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.070
 very dense a little complicated he 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.500
 has many words in the original language 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.630
 which is the Arabs there that has a glossary 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.280
 that in the end giant but that I go 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.169
 take a little bit for him to 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.180
 fully understand why so far 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.890
 What I read I did not quite understand and 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.720
 last book to block the 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.409
 direct receipt of the author was the war 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.269
 power and victory 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.419
 and I was very wanted in this book since 

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:04.009
 I heard here on the canal gives bread miranda 12 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.169
 I was very interested because I found this 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.879
 Very beautiful story cover will speak 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:09.860
 about a case in which the former combatant 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:12.319
 was found dead in his bed and 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.909
 detective lapa investigating the case and see 

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.769
 that together with that body of an envelope 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:17.989
 with a threat that says that one more 

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:19.849
 person to die and in the hand of 

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.580
 died has a watch with this inscription 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.379
 war the power and the victory so I found 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.479
 the crime scene that this detective is going 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:28.279
 having to unravel the book is very short 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:30.079
 so I think I'll include in the 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:31.579
 readings because I'm very 

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:33.739
 curious to know what the 

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:35.479
 answers to what your life today 

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:37.579

 do not stop signing up and enjoy 

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:41.509
 Did you read any of these books? 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.339
 in the comments saying if they liked not 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:47.739
 A personal kiss, I'm going to stay here. 

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:47.739
 but we see in the next video such
