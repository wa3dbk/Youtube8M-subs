 on the right 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.480
 the site on the right is the most important 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.260
 if there is my husband my partner 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.650
 Whoever you want is that they are 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.070
 to the right that is the most important site the right is the most 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.920
 important always 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.070

 I omitted grandmother the person of greater remains if my grandmother was evidently my 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.340
 Grandma 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.069
 the highest category 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.860
 the categories by age 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.090
 by sex and by hierarchy 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.789
 in this beach and the Christmas holidays 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.199
 we assume that most of us are family 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.889
 If there is someone who is not a family, they are liquidated 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.690
 a more important category for 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.389
 to the right the attention a lady 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.510
 to the other side 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.409
 the second person of higher category 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.040
 on the contrary and is that here 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.550

 category that would possibly be the husband of the lady 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:35.809
 that if the lady helps then a gentleman of greater importance than not 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:38.829
 outside my father will be the third solar panel 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.549
 if I had it not because one day my husband did not meet and I 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.730
 but think that the appetite 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.470
 the important thing is the person of greater category to the right the second greater 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.109
 category the left 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.730

 this gentleman stops here 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.220
 in front of the door if the lady in front of the service door 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.999

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.359

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.150

 I also film the French presidency because because the center of the 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.229
 table 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:54.009

 nobody dares to children I have three children 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.139
 the children theory but the protocol books 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.120
 the chapter children and cattle animals 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.569
 it is empty that the girls pay them are wild 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.199
 and you have to educate them 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.169
 there are some parents who forget about this topic in education sevilla 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:05.689

 someday he teaches us real to his children to take place 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.110
 The reality is that conciliatory parties are the only thing that they get 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.620
 that we forgive each other continuously 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.210

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.960
 Poor children would also like 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960

 The Knights 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:16.000
 They are the last to sit down if I have a husband 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.330

 If you do not know how to do it, do not do it because many times it had to be based 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.590
