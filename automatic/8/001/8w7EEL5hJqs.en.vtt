00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:08.590
 Under section 2 thinking in 3 sections overall 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.160
 Same layer in the gradient middle section 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:15.850
 In the top section I will put a low layer of finger 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.060
 Outline has been said 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.060
 I'm putting under section 2 gradation here, though 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:29.090
 Below is the bottom of the under section in Figure 2 . 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:35.690
 Gradation comes into nature and a little movement and 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:38.690
 A moderate Mayan comes with Atsugi by example Here is 9 great names and it is too light 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.930
 Since there Toka layer Poku 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.150
 The gradation I just cut 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.260
 Together 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.260
 It is said that done in stainless steel 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.940
 Since the web section is where we make the whole form movement, the table that moves in the debt layer 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.710
 The whole is two finished but 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.830
 If you hate to a section 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:10.470
 The movement of the orbit section is stabbed here here is a home game to cup Akamatsu 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.470
 I will put in layers as nuances make 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 Here we entered layer is in but eh 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.640
 This house is good when you move backward 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.730
 Because it moves in good feeling 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 It becomes easy to get the atmosphere 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.570
 After deciding the length of this here first 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.310
 I will cut the inside 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.540
 The bangs must be 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.590
 Not straight lines 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.600
 Slightly round 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.619
 If I cut it too straight 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 As the connection gets worse, it looks like this 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.510
 It is middle to round, but Tayama lang 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.640
 In particular 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.150
 Women are all over here 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.150
 Sea 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.600
 of 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.890
 Place where there Yeah 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.890
 I'm Following 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.930
 Hmm 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:20.219
 In entertainment center out of the movement in the back of the ear 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.219
 Take advantage of the movement here 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.770
 Because there is not much volume 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.640
 Two are main stores too 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.530
 Where the fall in the days before 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.530
 Don't put too much ahead 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.790
 So for weeks 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 Slowly put on 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.210
 It is something with a little hold power 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.440
 I liked making 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:53.960
 This is the finished form, but it is not Femain 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:58.100
 I think that the style that really was really powerful without too much substitution is still the most in salon work 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:02.840
 Masu the Toka or too cut neatly Toka or knitted Volume 2 following in 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.420
 There is a feeling of relaxation relaxation that much when saying it is set too much 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.140
 Style is 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.140
 I think that is good
