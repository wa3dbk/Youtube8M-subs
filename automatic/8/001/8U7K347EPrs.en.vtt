00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
under right here the feet he put more

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.690 
under right here the feet he put more
electrical<00:04:12.220> tape<00:04:13.920> looks<00:04:14.920> like<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.220> pad<00:04:15.430> and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
electrical tape looks like the pad and

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.050 
electrical tape looks like the pad and
the<00:04:15.820> pad<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.269> some<00:04:16.450> also<00:04:16.870> cardboard<00:04:17.910> one<00:04:18.910> of

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
the pad is some also cardboard one of

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.550 
the pad is some also cardboard one of
the<00:04:19.180> hard<00:04:19.420> are<00:04:19.900> dumb<00:04:21.990> art<00:04:22.990> things<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:23.410> go

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
the hard are dumb art things you go

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.310 
the hard are dumb art things you go
about<00:04:23.710> this<00:04:23.920> custom<00:04:24.520> when<00:04:25.450> doing<00:04:25.720> this<00:04:25.900> custom

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
about this custom when doing this custom

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.360 
about this custom when doing this custom
is<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.620> hair<00:04:27.090> because<00:04:28.090> of<00:04:28.270> the<00:04:29.010> proportion<00:04:30.010> it

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
is the hair because of the proportion it

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.550 
is the hair because of the proportion it
doesn't<00:04:30.730> really<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.780> doesn't<00:04:35.050> really<00:04:35.910> make

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
doesn't really it doesn't really make

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.320 
doesn't really it doesn't really make
the<00:04:38.560> head<00:04:38.800> like<00:04:39.070> proportionate<00:04:39.790> to<00:04:39.820> the<00:04:40.030> body

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the head like proportionate to the body

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.159 
the head like proportionate to the body
so<00:04:40.990> it's<00:04:41.200> hard<00:04:41.470> to<00:04:42.090> make<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.270> ratio<00:04:43.690> right

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
so it's hard to make the ratio right

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.909 
so it's hard to make the ratio right
but<00:04:44.680> actually<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.930> look<00:04:47.140> it<00:04:47.410> looks<00:04:47.560> like<00:04:47.710> it's

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
but actually you look it looks like it's

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.720 
but actually you look it looks like it's
too<00:04:48.130> big<00:04:48.400> but<00:04:48.669> it's<00:04:48.850> actually<00:04:49.300> just<00:04:50.310> okay<00:04:52.020> and

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
too big but it's actually just okay and

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.960 
too big but it's actually just okay and
then<00:04:54.730> also<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.900> gloves<00:04:56.200> and<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:57.490> gauntlets

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
then also the gloves and the gauntlets

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.830 
then also the gloves and the gauntlets
is<00:04:58.450> really<00:04:58.780> um<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.680> had<00:04:59.830> a<00:04:59.890> hard<00:05:00.100> time<00:05:00.190> making

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
is really um you had a hard time making

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.659 
is really um you had a hard time making
this<00:05:01.840> one<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.050> think<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.380> is<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.740> second<00:05:03.130> try

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
this one I think this is the second try

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.540 
this one I think this is the second try
yeah<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.690> he<00:05:04.900> made<00:05:05.500> this<00:05:05.740> one<00:05:05.950> oh<00:05:06.070> yeah<00:05:06.280> Brian

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
yeah that he made this one oh yeah Brian

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
yeah that he made this one oh yeah Brian
is<00:05:06.820> um<00:05:07.030> actually<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.470> cameraman<00:05:12.270> yeah<00:05:13.270> that's

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
is um actually the cameraman yeah that's

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:22.780 
is um actually the cameraman yeah that's
he<00:05:14.260> has<00:05:14.350> all<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.860> dicta<00:05:15.340> lations

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.030 

and<00:05:23.330> this<00:05:23.660> one<00:05:23.840> is<00:05:23.960> actually<00:05:24.110> like<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.770> lock

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
and this one is actually like the lock

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:36.110 
and this one is actually like the lock
the<00:05:25.790> plastic<00:05:26.240> block<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:28.280> you<00:05:28.430> use

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:43.610 

and<00:05:39.020> size<00:05:40.020> comparison<00:05:41.010> is<00:05:41.430> a<00:05:41.810> Hot<00:05:42.810> Toys<00:05:43.050> Bruce

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
and size comparison is a Hot Toys Bruce

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:56.989 
and size comparison is a Hot Toys Bruce
Lee<00:05:46.220> so<00:05:47.220> is<00:05:47.810> it's<00:05:48.810> not<00:05:49.050> actually<00:05:49.530> that<00:05:50.090> far

00:05:56.989 --> 00:05:56.999 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.749 

they're<00:05:57.599> both<00:05:57.749> Asians<00:05:58.289> but<00:05:58.679> Bruce<00:05:59.549> Lee's

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
they're both Asians but Bruce Lee's

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.620 
they're both Asians but Bruce Lee's
short<00:06:00.689> I<00:06:01.159> think

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.129 

there

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:06.139 
there

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.189 
there
size<00:06:06.800> comparison

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:16.839 

yeah<00:06:10.830> so<00:06:11.490> also<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.930> head<00:06:13.169> is<00:06:13.409> actually<00:06:13.969> has<00:06:14.969> a

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849 
yeah so also the head is actually has a

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:20.089 
yeah so also the head is actually has a
as<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:17.879> magnet<00:06:18.539> since<00:06:19.020> we<00:06:19.169> had<00:06:19.289> to<00:06:19.439> cut<00:06:19.650> off<00:06:19.800> the

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
as a magnet since we had to cut off the

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.140 
as a magnet since we had to cut off the
head<00:06:20.340> because<00:06:20.849> I'm<00:06:21.710> the<00:06:22.710> true<00:06:22.949> type<00:06:23.129> 7<00:06:23.639> has<00:06:23.909> um

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
head because I'm the true type 7 has um

head because I'm the true type 7 has um
the<00:06:24.870> neck<00:06:25.110> with<00:06:25.409> it<00:06:25.849> but<00:06:26.849> the<00:06:26.969> body<00:06:27.289> already

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
the neck with it but the body already

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.850 
the neck with it but the body already
has<00:06:28.409> a<00:06:28.499> neck<00:06:29.120> so<00:06:30.120> it's<00:06:30.419> actually<00:06:30.599> magnet<00:06:31.289> right

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860
