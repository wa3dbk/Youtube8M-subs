00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.450 

that's<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.870> how<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:28.080> should<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.410> mustard<00:02:29.370> ice

and<00:02:35.520> quite<00:02:36.360> particular<00:02:36.660> about<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.980> way<00:02:38.100> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
and quite particular about the way that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.000 
and quite particular about the way that
I<00:02:38.310> think<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.700> ice<00:02:38.970> cream<00:02:39.150> should<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.450> served

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
I think that ice cream should be served

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.310 
I think that ice cream should be served
this<00:02:41.010> should<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.280> clean<00:02:42.030> they<00:02:42.720> should<00:02:42.900> melt<00:02:43.170> in

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
this should be clean they should melt in

this should be clean they should melt in

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
cream richer what's happening here is

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.480 
cream richer what's happening here is
the<00:03:53.840> sugars<00:03:54.200> mixing<00:03:54.680> with<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:54.890> proteins<00:03:55.310> in

the sugars mixing with the proteins in
the<00:03:55.520> egg<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.540> does<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:56.990> co<00:03:57.410> will

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620

size<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.650> reason<00:04:03.950> for<00:04:04.040> doing<00:04:04.100> this<00:04:04.340> is<00:04:04.730> that

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
size the reason for doing this is that

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.610 
size the reason for doing this is that
when<00:04:04.970> we<00:04:05.000> come<00:04:05.660> to<00:04:05.690> cook<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.290> eggs<00:04:06.440> which

when we come to cook the eggs which

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.430 
when we come to cook the eggs which
we'll<00:04:06.830> do<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.070> a<00:04:07.160> few<00:04:07.340> minutes<00:04:07.640> with<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.000> milk
