00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
because unfortunately I did lose another

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.319 
because unfortunately I did lose another
piece<00:03:27.980> of<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.220> time-lapse<00:03:28.609> I<00:03:28.849> know<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:29.000> said<00:03:29.299> I

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
piece of the time-lapse I know I said I

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.909 
piece of the time-lapse I know I said I
wouldn't<00:03:29.540> do<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.750> again<00:03:29.870> with<00:03:30.260> paragraph<00:03:30.620> but

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
wouldn't do it again with paragraph but

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.400 
wouldn't do it again with paragraph but
I<00:03:31.160> managed<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.669> do<00:03:31.849> it<00:03:32.049> again<00:03:33.049> in<00:03:33.230> this

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
I managed to do it again in this

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.610 
I managed to do it again in this
unfortunately<00:03:34.250> twice<00:03:34.879> actually<00:03:35.180> but<00:03:35.780> some<00:03:36.530> of

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
unfortunately twice actually but some of

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.900 
unfortunately twice actually but some of
the<00:03:36.680> biggest<00:03:36.859> things<00:03:37.220> and<00:03:37.459> then<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.790> most

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
the biggest things and then the most

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.580 
the biggest things and then the most
important<00:03:38.389> things<00:03:38.599> are<00:03:38.780> still<00:03:39.169> there

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
important things are still there

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.990 
important things are still there
so<00:03:39.739> I<00:03:39.769> think<00:03:39.889> we'll<00:03:40.099> be<00:03:40.190> making<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.609> jump

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
so I think we'll be making the jump

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.949 
so I think we'll be making the jump
right<00:03:41.629> about<00:03:42.560> now<00:03:43.720> maybe<00:03:44.720> in<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.930> couple

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
right about now maybe in a couple

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.720 
right about now maybe in a couple
seconds<00:03:45.440> yeah<00:03:45.949> right<00:03:46.129> now<00:03:46.370> yeah<00:03:47.150> there<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.079> go

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
seconds yeah right now yeah there we go
