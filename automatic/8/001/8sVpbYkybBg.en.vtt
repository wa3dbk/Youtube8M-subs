great<00:00:29.849> because<00:00:29.970> unlike<00:00:30.449> some<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.720> other

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
great because unlike some of the other

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.110 
great because unlike some of the other
rod<00:00:31.230> systems<00:00:31.679> these<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.399> adjustable<00:00:32.880> knobs

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
that allow you to slide the whole

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.530 
that allow you to slide the whole
configuration<00:00:34.920> forward<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.000> backwards<00:00:36.360> base

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
configuration forward and backwards base

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.660 
configuration forward and backwards base
of<00:00:36.719> where<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:36.930> want<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> rods<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> sit<00:00:37.800> so

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
of where you want the rods to sit so

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
of where you want the rods to sit so
they<00:00:39.000> also<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.510> 15<00:00:39.960> millimeter<00:00:40.350> odds<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
they also have 15 millimeter odds on the

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.380 
they also have 15 millimeter odds on the
side<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> want<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> mount<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.850> evf<00:00:42.239> you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
side so if you want to mount an evf you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.240 
side so if you want to mount an evf you
could<00:00:42.540> mount<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.809> there<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.770> there's<00:00:43.950> space

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
could mount that there but there's space

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.670 
could mount that there but there's space
60<00:00:44.820> millimeters<00:00:45.210> apart<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.110> essentially<00:00:46.620> what

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
60 millimeters apart so essentially what

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.779 
60 millimeters apart so essentially what
that<00:00:46.739> allows<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> do<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.760> have

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that allows you to do is if you have

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.459 
that allows you to do is if you have
like<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.390> Swiss<00:00:48.719> plate<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.140> want<00:00:49.260> amount

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
like a Swiss plate that you want amount

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.110 
like a Swiss plate that you want amount
like<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.680> had<00:00:49.770> some<00:00:49.800> power<00:00:50.039> battery<00:00:50.520> or<00:00:50.730> even

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
like it had some power battery or even

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.880 
like it had some power battery or even
build<00:00:51.270> out<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> cage<00:00:51.840> it<00:00:52.050> slides<00:00:52.649> it

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
build out to a cage it slides it

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.250 
build out to a cage it slides it
extremely<00:00:53.430> easy<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.030> fast<00:00:54.210> which<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:54.930> very

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
extremely easy and fast which is very

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
extremely easy and fast which is very
great<00:00:55.530> because<00:00:55.800> things<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:57.180> be<00:00:57.210> you

great because things that can be you
know<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.750> zoo<00:00:57.930> crew<00:00:58.079> dope<00:00:58.199> rocks<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
know with zoo crew dope rocks is that

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.869 
know with zoo crew dope rocks is that
they're<00:00:58.980> modular<00:00:59.399> stuff<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.850> bought

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
they're modular stuff that I bought

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.240 
they're modular stuff that I bought
three<00:01:00.600> four<00:01:00.780> years<00:01:00.960> ago<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.770> still<00:01:02.010> working

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
three four years ago is still working

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.560 
three four years ago is still working
with<00:01:02.370> everything<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.699> comes<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.239> which

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
with everything that comes out now which

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.760 
with everything that comes out now which
in<00:01:03.899> my<00:01:04.049> mind<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.159> great<00:01:05.430> investment<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.770> next

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
in my mind is a great investment so next

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.530 
in my mind is a great investment so next
thing<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> studio

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
thing we have is that with the studio

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
thing we have is that with the studio
base<00:01:09.720> plate<00:01:10.020> it's<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:10.710> bit<00:01:10.799> longer<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
base plate it's a little bit longer so

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.130 
base plate it's a little bit longer so
it<00:01:11.460> allows<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.970> go<00:01:12.090> from<00:01:12.119> tripod<00:01:12.840> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
it allows you to go from tripod to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
it allows you to go from tripod to
shoulder<00:01:13.500> mount<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:14.310> fast<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.760> easy<00:01:14.850> some

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
shoulder mount really fast and easy some

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
shoulder mount really fast and easy some
of<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> other<00:01:15.360> setups<00:01:15.659> hard<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.040> know

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
of the other setups hard to you know

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920 
of the other setups hard to you know
remove<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.549> Z<00:01:17.850> grips<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.150> front<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.750> just

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
done very quickly you know time is of
the<00:01:25.439> essence<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.210> one<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> other<00:01:27.479> things

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the essence so one of the other things

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.149 
the essence so one of the other things
that<00:01:27.689> we've<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:27.990> since<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.259> have<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> EVF<00:01:28.950> up

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that we've got since we have the EVF up

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.460 
that we've got since we have the EVF up
here<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.450> Z<00:01:30.600> focus<00:01:30.930> extender

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
here is we have the Z focus extender

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
here is we have the Z focus extender
which<00:01:31.680> is<00:01:32.310> normally<00:01:33.000> does<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.479> follow<00:01:33.689> focus

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
which is normally does your follow focus

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.870 
which is normally does your follow focus
is<00:01:34.229> farther<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> camera<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.340> no<00:01:35.460> not<00:01:35.729> only

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
is farther in the camera so no not only

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.460 
is farther in the camera so no not only
is<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> air<00:01:36.329> gonna<00:01:36.540> make<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.290> hard

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
is in that air gonna make but it's hard

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.749 
is in that air gonna make but it's hard
to<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.920> don't<00:01:38.070> have<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.250> first<00:01:38.579> or

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
second AC to be pulling focus if you're

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.749 
second AC to be pulling focus if you're
just<00:01:40.439> doing<00:01:40.590> yourself<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.670> very

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
just doing yourself so it's very

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
base plate is designed you know for

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.810 
base plate is designed you know for
tripod<00:02:27.470> over<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> shoulder<00:02:28.400> because<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.700> has

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
tripod over the shoulder because it has

rod to go through the front and back

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.320 
rod to go through the front and back
where<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.830> guerrilla<00:02:31.040> base<00:02:31.250> plate<00:02:31.490> has<00:02:31.700> spots

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
where the guerrilla base plate has spots

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.090 
where the guerrilla base plate has spots
for<00:02:32.510> 50<00:02:32.870> million<00:02:33.140> rides<00:02:33.320> for<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.860> front

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
for 50 million rides for just the front

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.320 
for 50 million rides for just the front
so<00:02:34.220> if<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.340> want<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.550> mount<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.910> follow<00:02:35.150> focus

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
so if you want to mount a follow focus

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.510 
so if you want to mount a follow focus
matte<00:02:35.720> box<00:02:35.990> it<00:02:36.500> also<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.860> 50<00:02:37.100> million<00:02:37.400> rad

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
matte box it also is a 50 million rad

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.550 
matte box it also is a 50 million rad
spot<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:37.970> side<00:02:38.180> for<00:02:38.450> an<00:02:38.570> EDF<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.170> then

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
spot on the side for an EDF and then

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.440 
spot on the side for an EDF and then
also<00:02:39.680> underneath<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.430> personally<00:02:41.000> like<00:02:41.270> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
also underneath it I personally like the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.120 
also underneath it I personally like the
target<00:02:42.290> shooter<00:02:42.470> set<00:02:42.650> up<00:02:42.740> but<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:42.920> could<00:02:43.010> also

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
target shooter set up but you could also

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.540 
target shooter set up but you could also
set<00:02:43.340> up<00:02:43.430> as<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> striker<00:02:43.910> as<00:02:44.090> well<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:46.310> works

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
set up as a striker as well this works

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.920 
set up as a striker as well this works
out<00:02:46.640> better<00:02:46.820> if<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.060> want<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.360> have<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.900> know

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
out better if you want to have you know

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.020 
out better if you want to have you know
smaller<00:02:48.320> footprint<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:48.800> if<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:48.950> say<00:02:49.310> you're<00:02:50.000> a

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
smaller footprint so if I say you're a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.550 
smaller footprint so if I say you're a
situation<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:50.810> can't<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.320> over<00:02:51.470> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
situation you can't have it over the
