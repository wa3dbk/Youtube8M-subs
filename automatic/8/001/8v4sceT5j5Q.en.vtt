00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
it will just kind of fall directly to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.859 
it will just kind of fall directly to
the<00:01:26.220> bottom<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.180> you're<00:01:27.270> gonna<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> red

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
the bottom so you're gonna have the red

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.039 
the bottom so you're gonna have the red
on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.140> bottom<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:29.100> orange<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.700> top<00:01:30.049> now

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
on the bottom the orange on the top now

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.359 
on the bottom the orange on the top now
I'm<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> same<00:01:31.619> idea<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.220> Blue

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I'm gonna do the same idea with the Blue

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.429 
I'm gonna do the same idea with the Blue
Curacao<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> Blue<00:01:33.360> Curacao<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.900> thin

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
Curacao because the Blue Curacao is thin

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.410 
Curacao because the Blue Curacao is thin
and<00:01:34.860> if<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.250> kind<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.490> run<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> over<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> cherry

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and if I kind of run it over the cherry

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510 
and if I kind of run it over the cherry
it<00:01:36.659> should<00:01:37.140> stick<00:01:37.500> on<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.770> top<00:01:37.799> because<00:01:38.340> it's

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it should stick on the top because it's

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.760 
it should stick on the top because it's
there<00:01:38.759> then<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> orange<00:01:39.360> juice<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> thick

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
there then the orange juice so the thick

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100 
there then the orange juice so the thick
liqueur<00:01:41.400> or<00:01:41.790> juice<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.540> gonna<00:01:42.689> stay<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
liqueur or juice is gonna stay in the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.289

middle and the thinner type of stuff

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.690 
middle and the thinner type of stuff
that's<00:01:45.509> less<00:01:45.720> dense<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.259> sit<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.439> top<00:01:46.700> so

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
that's less dense will sit on top so

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.859 
that's less dense will sit on top so
we're<00:01:47.790> gonna<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.060> ahead<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.329> put<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> Blue

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
Curacao on top carefully over the cherry

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.110 
Curacao on top carefully over the cherry
it<00:01:52.140> should<00:01:52.530> layer

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.820 

so<00:02:00.120> that<00:02:00.330> should<00:02:00.570> sync<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> stay<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.380> top<00:02:01.800> of

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
so that should sync and stay on top of

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.859 
so that should sync and stay on top of
the<00:02:02.130> red<00:02:02.510> as<00:02:03.510> it<00:02:03.750> slowly<00:02:04.410> slowly<00:02:04.920> settles
