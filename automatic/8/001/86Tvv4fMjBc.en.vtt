 yes 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.400
 video analysis batman arkham origins 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.350
 the arkham batman trilogy took for 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.180
 surprise of this generation when nobody 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.130
 I expected a licensed game to call 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.690
 even the attention in this last 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.430
 delivery the developer study 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.440
 rocksteady passed the post warner bros 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.940
 montreal a much younger study the 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.529
 which shaped this prequel that we 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.540
 would have one of the first adventures 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.340
 Bruce Wayne as the Overcast 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.870
 reason for the decision was not expressed 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.190
 openly but it's an open secret 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 this experiment had the 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.010
 intention that the saga would not stop 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.510
 have an annual delivery while 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.309
 rocksteady works in the first 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.110
 batman lesson adventure what 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.220
 surely they did not take into account is that 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.960
 many of the batman villains 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.030
 were born of failed experiments and this 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.650
 game is where a bad guy looks at it 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.850
 more being the eve of Christmas 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.920
 Batman discovers that black mask 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.750
 summoned 8 assassins with the promise of 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.310
 deliver 50 million dollars to whom 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.530
 can end his life this selection 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.180
 of villains a classic pair a pair class 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 by an invented bar they called our 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.210
 attention in different ways to 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.740
 fulfill its mission while the city 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.690
 whole is under criminal siege by 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.280
 some reason that is never explained being 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.660
 the best detective in our world 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.130
 work will be to get to the bottom of the core 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.630
 meeting us on the road with 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.070
 different predicaments while 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.810
 we go through the whole Gothic city 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.580
 in something that I refuse to call the world 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.880
 open but we could understand it as 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.570
 such 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.190
 batman can 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.870
 the city from end to end in what is 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.220
 thought as a natural progression to the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.260
 previous titles but ended 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.970
 staying short everywhere city 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.650
 Gothic is not only a redesign of the 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.940
 jail city of arkham city 'but that 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.710
 we will be forced to visit the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.119
 same places and places where no 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.310
 nothing is happening we will not find 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.510
 no type of content that justifies 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.520
 the dimensions of the game terrain 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.140
 to cross the city we will return to the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.850
 mechanics of planning which is not very 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.619
 consistent with the character and whose 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.330
 slowness bore enough but not us 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.430
 there is another one unless we want to use the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.570
 batwing which we do not control but 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.520
 It is a fast transfer method 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.990
 presented with a kinematics that takes 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.490
 more in loading the time that we 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.940
 I would end up taking our 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 destination 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.240
 added to this to enable this 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.500
 nonsense we must hack some 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.000
 radio antennas that prevent the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.130
 navigation of our vehicle in a 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.259
 calico mechanics of iu that had already been 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.300
 exhausted in assassin's creed of sabotaging 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.800
 and farc to ib3 just to name a few 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.270
 examples the mechanics that follows 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.010
 functioning is that of body combat 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.780
 body during the 10 or 12 hours that 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.340
 lasts the game we will spend three quarters 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.989
 of them delivering pineapples right and left 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.120
 sinister now after hordes of enemies 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.040
 be thieves or policemen who usually 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.870
 join to face them in combats without 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.549
 imagination as it happened in several 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.870
 infinite we will find new enemies 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.400
 in this delivery and if not 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.200
 your range can all use weapons 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 that others are dropping by doing 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.890
 of challenge a good exercise and inciting 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.390
 we like never before to use all 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.769
 the gadgets that we will collect 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.420
 now this mechanics of 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.430
 counterattacks patented by the arkham saga 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.110
 It is comfortable fluid and entertaining 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.610
 execute besides incorporate in this 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.409
 delivers new choreographies and 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.329
 eliminations with surroundings however not 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.950
 aged very well that we say since the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.540
 likelihood of the fights ends 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.459
 shattered when while we continue 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.930
 crushing buttons batman begins to 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.700
 bounce like a pinball ball by 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.319
 the whole scenario hitting different 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.030
 enemies no matter what they are 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.980
 100 meters away, one of the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.959
 another the counterpart to violence 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.519
 explicit was always the challenging mode 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.319
 predator where in very scenarios 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.879
 calculated we should eliminate so 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.340
 stealthy to our enemies using 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.049
 ventilation tubes gargoyles and grilles 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.730
 in our favor to everyone's surprise 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.440
 in this delivery the predator mode does not 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.909
 it just does not challenge us at any time 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.709
 but it seems counted as times 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.730
 fill in argument and it will not claim us 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.659
 that we raise our level 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.489
 stealth skills 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.170
 not once to be able to overcome said 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.489
 scenarios of swinging completely 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.079
 the two strongest mechanics in the game 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.790
 we could actually say that the 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.230
 mechanical are three if we count the new 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.579
 detective mode which puts us 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.380
 investigate a crime scene for 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.030
 rebuild with our viewer 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.620
 increased the events that happened 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.570
 giving us the necessary data to 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.070
 solve the cases however something that 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.750
 it could have been very funny 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.190
 it's not worth mentioning or naming them since 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.810
 for the people of warner bros montreal no 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.310
 we are very smart and all the clues to 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.930
 find are re marked with a large 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.820
 and bright red triangle taking us 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.380
 hand in hand throughout the process to 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.480
 As we move forward, the situation 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.160
 getting worse scenarios the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.720
 secondary missions the bosses and the 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.430
 challenges are traced from the game 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.320
 previous destroy the containers of 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.060
 drugs get from a tip of the map to the 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.740
 another in a certain time protect 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.420
 a hostage on a predatory map and so 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.950
 successively to the point that all 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.300
 these repetitions happen in the same 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.770
 scenarios in the previous game in the 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.570
 most of the cases giving us to understand 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.280
 that rocksteady between a data packet 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.930
 to the new company and said laburen 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.459
 above this the only thing this height 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.930
 could save the game from its history and 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.310
 somehow he does it but without 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.140
 However, he suffers a malady like one that looks 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.400
 followed in the cim lately where the 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.870
 half of the story everyone is 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.400
 forgot what they were counting and the 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.110
 argument turns to lead to the 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.060
 outcome of something that we had never been 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.620
 presented slowly and outside 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.670
 pace we are waiting for the majority 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.170
 of the villains hired to 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.910
 murder are not short and boring 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.560
 secondary missions to the point that one 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.300
 of these killers decide not to fight with 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.710
 us and ready your case is given by 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.430
 concluded and the fact that there is more 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.380
 villains 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.760
 would have to make us happy if not 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.500
 because they are the riddle with their 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.630
 tedious trophies to collect once 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.160
 more and the mad hatter in a scene 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.330
 drug induced as it was already done 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.130
 also in the two previous games 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.420
 just arriving at the sixth hour of 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.130
 game the story gets very 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.510
 interesting to the point that thanks to what 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.160
 what is happening and the design of the 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.900
 level that we are going through the game 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.030
 could end there and we would all be 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.740
 happy however after overcoming 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.240
 the scene the story goes to the most common 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.430
 of the places showing us something that already 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.260
 we saw a thousand times in all the comics of 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.190
 batman arrived here waiting for 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.260
 the inclusion of the multiplayer mode 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.810
 save the purchase sorry to disappoint 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.370
 the mechanics in theory is interesting 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.840
 the teams of villains a couple of 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.610
 heroes and an all against all with 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.870
 multiple objectives from capturing the 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.090
 bases to eliminate the opponents 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.010
 all in the same game unfortunately 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.780
 the controls do not respond the equipment 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.940
 are not leveled and the handling of weapons is 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.200
 incomprehensibly inaccurate but all 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.030
 this could even have 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.920
 partial credit if it were not because he suffers 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.690
 the evil that affects the whole game the 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.130
 bugs batman arkham origin is 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.170
 full of bugs in all versions 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.340
 which not only break the aesthetic 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.960
 but they can make us stay 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.640
 trapped when the walls that the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.230
 bosses do not move that the 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.790
 floor and until all the 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.540
 badly saved games that affected 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.670
 Many 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.470
 tell me that no lesser defect should not 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.580
 infer the game as works but still 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.230
 that we would not accept that freddie mercury 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.880
 I saw out of tune in the middle of bohemian 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.500
 rhapsody we can not tolerate that the game 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.300
 break constantly from the 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.280
 beginning until the final anti-climatic 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.020
 which after building a whole set 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.670
 of skills relieves the situation to a 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.860
 act that does not demand anything from us 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.270
 batman arkham origins was not going to compete 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.070
 for the game of the year but without place 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.330
 doubts should be the disappointment of 2013 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.980
 having the possibility to revitalize 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.870
 the franchise that had relapsed with 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.250
 arkham city 'or even experience 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.170
 different types of adventures he knew 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.640
 have batman in his 75 years 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.350
 the final decision was to make a dlc of 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.790
 over 10 hours so neglected that it does not 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.170
 they stopped in details of how the 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.370
 cinematics cut the rhythm of the 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.990
 narrative when activated in a manner 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.430
 random until you do not even do 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.440
 reference to the family in style 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.420
 argan in no time there is a formula 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.040
 it works and we like it's not bad that it 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.480
 repeat but if in addition to already have 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.520
 played to the satiety of the story 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.170
 no reward and bad programming we 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.850
 makes it impossible to experience what we are 

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.320
 talking about a failed product and the 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.300
 darker night for the overcast 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.600
 from the suit with george nipples 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.200
 clooney 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.550
 Maybe much of the story 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:59.510
 smooth gameplay the worst feels a 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:04.139
 from lcd to ians and repetitive pti full of 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:06.870
 bugs score 5
