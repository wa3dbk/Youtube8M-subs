00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.460
 good if you have android 2.3 and 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.050
 you have 400 megabytes of storage 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.170
 I recommend this game called star 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.880
 wars 2 an action shooter game 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.740
 pretty good that is surely going to 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.840
 surprise and you will have to install 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.040
 on your android phone good we 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.390
 we see this species as the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.920
 robot that has to rent to 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.530
 different someone are appearing 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.330
 so let's get on this side and while 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.650
 we annihilate any of these 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.940
 enemies let's see what we can 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.860
 collect some coins that we 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.750
 serve to reinforce us later by 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.840
 example reinforce our armor 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.340
 buy new weapons and so we 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.720
 we have to follow or carry out 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.490
 different missions and I for example 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.930
 pause here we see that here on the side 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.150
 left are the missions that I have 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.300
 what to do so let's continue with this 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.910
 side while you're watching the game 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.410

 this one called high speed racer like that 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.770
 who selected my level here we see that 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.869
 there are different levels that we have to 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.960
 overcome to thus pass each 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.890
 category we see that here is the race 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.000
 classic career 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.790

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 let's select this we see here play and 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.500
 let's start participating before 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.180
 start we can see that they show us a 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.890
 tutorial to teach us how to drive the 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.110
 vehicle so we simply press 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.710
 and we're going to start participating in this 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.210
 competition 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.340
 we see that then it has good graphics 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 so let's do that race that is 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.330
 the normal the classic that we have to 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.740
 compete against other opponents and 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.440
 moving the phone this way we're going to 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.180
 to be able to turn around in the curves that we're going 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.250
 watching while we go forward in the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.630
 road on the right side is the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.489
 accelerate button if you pressed it we see 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.590
 that we are going at great speed here in the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.720
 left part is the braking button 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.400
 and good also while we are moving forward 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.170
 on the road we are going to grab some 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.000
 liters like for example more speed 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.730
 some money and we can also 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.620
 collect tools to build 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.110
 our new vehicle pretty good 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.850
 so you need android 2.3 and if you 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.830
 like for the speed download it in your 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.600
 good android we continue with a game of 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.519
 platforms that requires android 2.3 that 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.380
 it's called soc and sao adventure so 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.360
 let us play here selected in 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.910
 our world and we are going to start playing 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.920
 after loading 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.360
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.160
 next we will see the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.260
 instructions to teach us how to manage 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.330
 or to control our character I press 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.650
 here and we begin to see that the part 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.120
 left is the button to scroll to 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.069
 my character and in the seen part the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.300
 shoot button to shoot since 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.819
 there are other activities that we can do 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.440
 we shoot water bullets or 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.209
 we are driving a water gun 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.040
 we see that different bugs appear or 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.810
 mosquitoes and mosquitoes as they want 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.640
 call attacking them so we have to 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.790
 annihilate the ones with our weapon 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.790
 lethal 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.650
 we can also use by 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.020
 example bombs we see that there is a bomb 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.000
 a kind of grenade 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.700
 so we move forward and we see that I also 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.560
 I can cover my defense is style 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.430
 turtle as we are seeing and here 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.930
 we can also throw punches 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.360
 while we move from looking to collect 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.860
 these gold coins and while also 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.840
 we advance we will see that there are mosquitoes or 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.100
 mosquitoes that bring weapons to improve 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.810
 for our arsenal for example this that 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.110
 we are seeing on the screen we see that 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.580
 Now I have a new weapon or more 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.380
 Sophisticated new highly recommended 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.660

 good phone and we continue with a flat 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.530
 pretty good logic game person 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.790
 so mole play here let's see the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.440
 different levels I am by this 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.020
 level but we select this level of 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.430
 here for us to look at was the dynamics of 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.410
 game we see that the game has 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.480
 dark type graphics as we can 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.820
 see we are this drawer but this drawer 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.080
 when we press this button we see that 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.060
 come on someone bambas are coming out 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.440
 different drawers or boxes that we have 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.500
 to accommodate in order to collect the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.360
 stars and be able to pass the level we see 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.700
 how can we not jump or give a big 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.480
 I jump to the other side we have to go 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.880
 accommodating these houses and until you reach the 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.310
 side to the next side which is the side 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.780
 where is the final door is a game 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.460
 of logic quite entertaining while 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.500
 you are advancing in each level you go to 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.540
 find new challenges that you have to 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.120
 find the logic to be able to overcome 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.500
 a pretty charming game so it's 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.080
 load it and enjoy it on your phone 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.970
 good android we continue with this game 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.710
 it's called red bull air race a game 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.990
 of light aircraft where we have to perform 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.670
 different acrobatics in the part 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.980
 right we can find the button 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.030
 accelerate our aircraft and in the part 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.400
 left so we can find the 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.140
 controls to be able to move around 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.000
 all these these points we 're going 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.590
 finding while we are moving forward 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.180
 we see that here we will be formed as 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.250
 a a path that we have to follow 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.280
 here it hits me so let's continue for this 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.810
 side and so we go forward doing everything 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.950
 type of acrobatics to avoid then the 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.350
 blows that I'm giving myself in these 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.150
 moments this game requires android 4.0 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.680
 so if you like this game 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.180

 good and we continue with blue command a 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.180

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.070
 the first one that came out on the console nes or 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.110
 be the classic metal gear we see that 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.960
 we started playing on the right side 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.400
 are the enemy attack buttons 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.820
 the jungle so we press the button 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.380
 to shoot 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.510
 and metro we are moving forward let's go 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:40.660

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.390
 there is also a button to throw 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.860
 grenades but he throws it wrong so let's go 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.710
 to throw the enemy 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.000
 and I gave him took his gun and followed 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.860
 fighting we see that we have to 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.180
 solve different missions and that is a 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.460

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.340
 to rotate by pressing several times on 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.070

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.870
 but this way we are finishing the 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.430
 enemies hitting them by throwing stars 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.920
 ninjas and all the weapons then that 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.450
 we have at our disposal that is 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.000
 highly recommended so download it 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.650
 and enjoy it here we see so much the life of the 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.570
 boss as the life we require 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.610
 Android 2.3 so have fun with this 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.110
 game that is quite entertaining and 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.580
 we finished with this casual bo 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.920
 call something like head jump like that 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.600
 that we press start and we're going to 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.740
 start playing we see that we are this 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.260
 sort of ball that has to go 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.880
 going up editing all kinds of traps 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.160
 and obstacles so as to be able to pass 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.330
 the level we see that there are many traps and 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.830
 obstacles and while we live we have 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.120
 to collect the gold coins then 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.410
 that we use to buy new 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.510

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.050
 fun if you like games 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.420
 casual if you like it because everything is not 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.980
 you have to overcome a level and that the 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.180
 another level is more difficult then it is 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.130

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.360
