 these others that you are going to put then 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.680
 now yes now if that you have to go 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.530
 to the folder as 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.049
 mods and there put the tower myers andreas 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.360
 for more good now pretty much I'm going to 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.350
 show how this goes 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.010
 well one of them in kraft we are here 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:58.380
 all you see are all here 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:04:01.500
 the tour but I do not know if you are 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.530
 well if that's what turrets are there 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.150
 that is the rifle from here to four 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.250
 files that have a distance 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.860
 Far as you see, they kill the mold 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.360
 and far away 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:18.380
 and then there's also the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:23.079
 of the laser and the flamethrower you know is the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.079
 flamethrower and s60 and good 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.110
 and now I'm going to put you 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:35.529
 so you can see how a zombie is killed 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:38.859
 they are not themselves 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:41.109
 and see what we put and how it does not leave me 

00:04:38.859 --> 00:04:43.839
 a second of respite from how well you 

00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:45.939
 I create the base but now I'm going to go more 

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:48.000
 there in the distance and you are going to see what 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:52.850
 I'm talking 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.850
 let's hope it does not get to yes no 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.820
 we put it and then the triumph here 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.040
 says to see all the information we 're going 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.420
 to throw and masters that is there there we 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.820
 puts the values ​​that are ammunition and everything 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.580
 that and here what does not need is worth having 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.340
 there 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.949
 and it says 32 projectiles what the torrent is 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.250
 between norms here 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.790
 we take it and supplications to the speakers 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.070
 As you can see, we started to get there 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.070
 and if it takes away life if not exploited 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.229
 well that place or I'm going to put here 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:35.259
 some zombies 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:38.950
 the thing of this kind that has this challenge 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:41.530
 and that is pretty good 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.910
 and that now I'm going to put other 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.840
 turrets but for you to see these 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:49.120
 First of all, what I'm talking about does not 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.560
 also has advantages for example if you 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.950
 you put 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.380

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.550
 ride I do not know what it is 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.550
 it's not something that is 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.000
 this west collector 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.409

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.840

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.979
 and for example one would be evicted that 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.979
 put here 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.040
 the chorus by logicians the pongo 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:48.639
