00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
people think it's just a biological

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.279 
people think it's just a biological
disease<00:00:19.980> period<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:21.420> we're<00:00:21.630> saying<00:00:21.869> that's

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
disease period but we're saying that's

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.040 
disease period but we're saying that's
part<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> psychological<00:00:24.300> factors

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
part of it but the psychological factors

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.439 
part of it but the psychological factors
and<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> social<00:00:25.920> factors<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.970> cultural

and the social factors and the cultural

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.650 
and the social factors and the cultural
factors<00:00:27.900> play<00:00:28.590> also<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> big<00:00:29.609> role<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.480> what

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
factors play also a big role and so what

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170

do we expect to happen well we're gonna

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.720 
do we expect to happen well we're gonna
see<00:00:33.450> if<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:34.230> get<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> sort<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> placebo<00:00:35.160> effect

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
