so<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:00.940> know<00:05:01.030> what<00:05:01.180> I'll<00:05:01.330> do<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.600> outers

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
so you know what I'll do the outers

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.420 
so you know what I'll do the outers
first<00:05:02.860> because<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.900> big<00:05:05.170> inner<00:05:05.500> is<00:05:05.800> I<00:05:06.100> don't

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
first because the big inner is I don't

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.250 
first because the big inner is I don't
know<00:05:07.380> this<00:05:08.380> one<00:05:09.240> they<00:05:10.240> are<00:05:10.270> all<00:05:10.390> exactly<00:05:10.840> the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
know this one they are all exactly the

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.810 
know this one they are all exactly the
same<00:05:11.410> all<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:11.860> way<00:05:12.010> around<00:05:12.280> so<00:05:12.430> there's<00:05:12.640> no

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
same all the way around so there's no

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.790 
same all the way around so there's no
higher<00:05:13.150> or<00:05:13.390> lower<00:05:13.570> spot<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.410> should<00:05:14.650> just

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
higher or lower spot so it should just

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:31.720 
higher or lower spot so it should just
slip<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:17.710> pop<00:05:18.220> in<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:19.260> camera<00:05:20.260> there

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.480 

now<00:05:32.730> there<00:05:32.880> are<00:05:33.060> some<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.570> I've<00:05:33.690> seen<00:05:33.960> that

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
now there are some that I've seen that

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.780 
now there are some that I've seen that
glue<00:05:35.490> in<00:05:35.670> I<00:05:36.530> don't<00:05:37.530> like<00:05:37.740> the<00:05:37.920> idea<00:05:38.040> of<00:05:38.310> gluing

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
glue in I don't like the idea of gluing

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.640 
glue in I don't like the idea of gluing
it<00:05:38.910> in<00:05:39.060> I<00:05:39.330> want<00:05:39.780> them<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:39.990> be<00:05:40.230> able<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.530> be

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
it in I want them to be able to be

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:56.930 
it in I want them to be able to be
removed<00:05:40.970> in<00:05:41.970> case<00:05:42.030> I<00:05:42.690> don't<00:05:43.110> like<00:05:43.410> them<00:05:55.940> okay

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
removed in case I don't like them okay

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.330 
removed in case I don't like them okay
so<00:05:57.300> there's<00:05:57.630> one<00:05:57.960> and<00:05:59.930> I<00:06:00.930> will<00:06:01.200> do<00:06:01.830> the<00:06:01.950> rest<00:06:02.160> of

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
so there's one and I will do the rest of

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.770 
so there's one and I will do the rest of
them<00:06:02.490> I<00:06:02.670> don't<00:06:03.180> think<00:06:03.330> it's<00:06:03.450> gonna<00:06:03.600> be<00:06:03.690> any

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
them I don't think it's gonna be any

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.970 
them I don't think it's gonna be any
different<00:06:05.630> it's<00:06:06.630> the<00:06:06.720> two<00:06:07.190> middle<00:06:08.190> ones<00:06:08.340> or<00:06:08.910> so

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
different it's the two middle ones or so

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.660 
different it's the two middle ones or so
this<00:06:10.980> phenomena<00:06:12.950> yeah<00:06:13.950> I'll<00:06:14.130> do<00:06:14.310> those<00:06:14.490> and

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:14.670 
this phenomena yeah I'll do those and

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.550 
this phenomena yeah I'll do those and
I'll<00:06:14.790> come<00:06:15.270> back<00:06:15.300> so<00:06:15.690> yeah<00:06:15.750> watch<00:06:16.140> me<00:06:16.170> fiddle

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
I'll come back so yeah watch me fiddle

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.590 
I'll come back so yeah watch me fiddle
through<00:06:16.830> this<00:06:16.920> whole<00:06:17.130> crap<00:06:17.520> back<00:06:18.180> in<00:06:18.390> one

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 
through this whole crap back in one

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.690 
through this whole crap back in one
minute<00:06:18.810> okay<00:06:21.290> actually<00:06:22.290> they<00:06:22.620> weren't<00:06:22.860> as<00:06:23.340> bad

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
minute okay actually they weren't as bad

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.350 
minute okay actually they weren't as bad
to<00:06:24.000> put<00:06:24.210> in<00:06:24.330> as<00:06:25.080> I<00:06:25.290> thought<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.710> outer<00:06:25.890> ones

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 
to put in as I thought the outer ones

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.430 
to put in as I thought the outer ones
because<00:06:27.360> they're<00:06:27.540> small<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:27.930> you<00:06:28.110> got<00:06:28.260> to<00:06:28.350> get

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
because they're small and you got to get

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.870 
because they're small and you got to get
your<00:06:28.590> fingers<00:06:28.950> for<00:06:29.130> the<00:06:29.190> edge<00:06:29.340> of<00:06:29.520> the<00:06:29.610> plastic

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 
your fingers for the edge of the plastic

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.600 
your fingers for the edge of the plastic
earth<00:06:30.330> a<00:06:30.630> bit<00:06:31.620> worse<00:06:31.800> I<00:06:31.980> think<00:06:32.010> from<00:06:32.460> when<00:06:32.580> I

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
earth a bit worse I think from when I

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.120 
earth a bit worse I think from when I
turn<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.060> camera<00:06:33.510> off<00:06:33.570> last<00:06:33.930> night<00:06:34.230> last<00:06:34.830> time

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
turn the camera off last night last time

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.900 
turn the camera off last night last time
to<00:06:35.370> now<00:06:35.550> has<00:06:35.760> been<00:06:35.810> less<00:06:36.810> than<00:06:37.110> five<00:06:37.350> minutes

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
to now has been less than five minutes

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.310 
to now has been less than five minutes
so<00:06:38.910> I'm<00:06:39.150> just<00:06:40.670> Dee<00:06:41.670> fingerprinting<00:06:42.480> the

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
so I'm just Dee fingerprinting the

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:51.310 
so I'm just Dee fingerprinting the
inside<00:06:43.770> of<00:06:43.920> the<00:06:44.040> plastic<00:06:48.170> that<00:06:49.170> matters

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
inside of the plastic that matters

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:59.210 
inside of the plastic that matters
that's<00:06:52.700> what<00:06:53.700> it<00:06:53.790> looks<00:06:54.000> like<00:06:54.180> and<00:06:57.920> I'll<00:06:58.920> slide

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
that's what it looks like and I'll slide

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.970 
that's what it looks like and I'll slide
it<00:06:59.340> back<00:06:59.490> on<00:06:59.700> the<00:06:59.820> gauge<00:07:00.000> cluster<00:07:00.600> and<00:07:01.020> you<00:07:01.800> can

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
it back on the gauge cluster and you can

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:22.670 
it back on the gauge cluster and you can
see<00:07:02.160> it<00:07:02.540> finish<00:07:03.540> cleaning<00:07:03.750> out<00:07:03.930> a<00:07:04.020> second

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.110 

I'm<00:07:23.680> not<00:07:23.860> gonna<00:07:23.980> snap<00:07:24.370> it<00:07:24.400> into<00:07:24.670> place<00:07:24.760> because

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
I'm not gonna snap it into place because

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.000 
I'm not gonna snap it into place because
I'm<00:07:25.270> gonna<00:07:25.420> continue<00:07:26.110> cleaning<00:07:26.350> the<00:07:26.500> plastic

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010 
I'm gonna continue cleaning the plastic

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:38.400 
I'm gonna continue cleaning the plastic
but<00:07:27.220> I<00:07:35.970> think<00:07:36.970> it<00:07:37.060> looks<00:07:37.240> a<00:07:37.360> lot<00:07:37.630> cooler<00:07:37.960> to<00:07:38.380> be

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:38.410 
but I think it looks a lot cooler to be

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.310 
but I think it looks a lot cooler to be
honest<00:07:39.240> some<00:07:40.240> people<00:07:40.540> might<00:07:40.690> not<00:07:40.720> like<00:07:40.900> it<00:07:41.110> but

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:41.320 
honest some people might not like it but

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.210 
honest some people might not like it but
I<00:07:41.680> do<00:07:42.130> you<00:07:42.390> anyway<00:07:43.390> hey<00:07:43.810> they're<00:07:44.220> removable

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
I do you anyway hey they're removable

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.280 
I do you anyway hey they're removable
the<00:07:45.400> reversible<00:07:46.150> because<00:07:46.630> these<00:07:46.780> ones<00:07:47.020> like<00:07:47.170> I

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290 
the reversible because these ones like I

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.480 
the reversible because these ones like I
said<00:07:47.470> aren't<00:07:47.620> glued<00:07:47.830> on<00:07:48.100> and<00:07:48.250> you're<00:07:48.400> gonna

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490 
said aren't glued on and you're gonna

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.790 
said aren't glued on and you're gonna
have<00:07:48.610> to<00:07:48.700> scrape<00:07:48.970> any<00:07:49.210> crappy<00:07:49.540> glue<00:07:49.990> or<00:07:50.590> tape

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 
have to scrape any crappy glue or tape

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.920 
have to scrape any crappy glue or tape
off<00:07:51.280> at<00:07:51.850> the<00:07:51.970> end<00:07:52.090> of<00:07:52.210> these<00:07:52.270> ones<00:07:52.480> just<00:07:52.690> clip

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930 
off at the end of these ones just clip

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.650 
off at the end of these ones just clip
in<00:07:53.160> I<00:07:54.160> think<00:07:54.880> they're<00:07:55.060> about<00:07:55.150> 30<00:07:55.450> bucks

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:55.660 
in I think they're about 30 bucks
