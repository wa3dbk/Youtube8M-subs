00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.439
 queen - there is a new edition of casier tv weekly purity 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.610
 entirely dedicated to the lesson space, it wakes up and gives a show 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.110
 after a long period of low activity last June 7th our star is 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.040
 was the protagonist of a strong coronal mass exposure 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.800
 to capture the phenomenon the sound probe benhom x set powers 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.550
 of nasa that has observed a solar flare 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.620
 middle class n 2 is a powerful coronary mass eruption the great one 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.590
 Particle cloud generated by the explosion has poured in and large part 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.480
 social itself includes about half the surface of the star 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.479
 but sda is not the only observers and keep an eye on our sun 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.839
 these are the images recorded by the probe so 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.399
 which show bright plasma and high-energy particles 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.140
 you can get out of the sun 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.030
 while thanks redes twin stereo vintage waves to outdoors 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.740
 positioned on two opposite sides of the sun 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.920
 it was possible to see the expansion of expansion on both sides 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.640
 of our star 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.350
 according to NASA calculations 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.159
 the jet is moving about 1400 kilometers per second and along its path 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.369
 terraced - the earth's magnetic field 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.040
 without causing damage 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.830
 the only visible effect on earth was an increase in activity of the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.220
 auroras at the poles 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.570
 we change page we were waiting with great curiosity and finally the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.560
 nasa has published the extraordinary snapshots taken by paolo nespoli lo 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.330
 last May 23 captured from a unique perspective that of the shuttle 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.500
 Russian Soyuz Apenas driven out by AIDS 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.479
 about to bring paolo and colleagues back home 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.730
 after 159 days of stay in orbit 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.160
 perfectly recognizable from the top nasa that we see hooked to the great 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.969
 orbiting laboratory weighing 418 tons 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.519
 perched in space 400 kilometers from the earth 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.209
 so beautiful and perfect 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.019
 not to seem true is spectacular photographs 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.249
 and the videos made by the Italian astronaut also have a historical value 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:26.480
 are the first images to portray I left the eur trend in this case 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.230
 joined in orbit at the international space station in its configuration 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.459
 ultimately 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.230
 to carry out the historic photo gallery the astronauts obtained a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.629
 special permission from nasa were thus the first in the world to perform 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.030
 complete tours around the station allowing medlar to make us the last one 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.290
 gift before returning to the ground and there is no doubt my crazy really worth it 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.079
 about the breathtaking images here are the first 2 works of art we remain signed 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.940

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.610
 has its eye on the southern sky 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.610
 to spy on the hidden wonders of the Milky Way 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.230
 and here is the swan nebula 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.879
 also known as hazy media, a stellar formation called 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.260

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.709
 the gas the dust and the stars that are inside the nebula do not 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.430

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.120

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.169

 incisura we remind you an appointment not to be missed the one set for 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.400
 Wednesday 15 June 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.560
 when the moon obscured by the shadow of our planet will dress dark 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.000
 giving us weather allowing the spectacle of a total eclipse 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:11.180
 the event will start at 21 and 22 to finish at 11 pm 3 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.509
 the maximum is definitely scheduled for 10 pm 12 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.659
 wishing everyone a good vision, the editorial staff can greet me and give you
