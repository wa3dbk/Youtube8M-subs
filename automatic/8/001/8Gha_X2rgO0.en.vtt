00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
well I'm from season seven so much my

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.509 
well I'm from season seven so much my
favorite<00:02:15.360> challenge<00:02:15.959> was<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> signature<00:02:17.190> look

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
favorite challenge was a signature look

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.520 
favorite challenge was a signature look
I<00:02:17.790> think<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.360> was<00:02:18.450> cuz<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:19.049> you<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.409> had

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
I think it was cuz you have you you had

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.080 
I think it was cuz you have you you had
a<00:02:19.560> chance<00:02:19.799> to<00:02:19.920> kind<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.250> brace<00:02:20.519> yourself<00:02:20.909> as<00:02:21.000> a

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
a chance to kind of brace yourself as a

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.699 
a chance to kind of brace yourself as a
designer<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.720> I<00:02:22.140> think<00:02:22.379> working<00:02:22.560> with

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
designer and I think working with

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.350 
designer and I think working with
another<00:02:22.980> signer<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.580> always<00:02:23.879> good<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.239> know

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
another signer is always good you know

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.640 
another signer is always good you know
because<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:24.720> cannot<00:02:24.900> influence<00:02:25.260> from<00:02:25.470> each

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
because you cannot influence from each

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.339 
because you cannot influence from each
other<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.670> say<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.659> tell<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:27.959> that's

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
other and so I say go tell it that's

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.470 
other and so I say go tell it that's
what's<00:02:28.650> going<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.099> with<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.519> when<00:02:30.239> are<00:02:30.360> you
