00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
bit what it feels like there are various

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.480 
bit what it feels like there are various
simulators<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.689> as<00:01:36.930> well<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.799> example<00:01:37.920> this

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
simulators here as well for example this

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.580 
simulators here as well for example this
one<00:01:38.759> gives<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.180> idea<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.229> sort<00:01:40.530> of

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
