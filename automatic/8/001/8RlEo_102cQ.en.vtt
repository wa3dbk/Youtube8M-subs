 hello everyone here i hate welcome

 in this comparative video between 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.820
 the iphone 5 and the galaxy s 4 2 phones 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.770
 touchy trendy in general one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.270
 hesitates between the two well I hope 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.189
 that this video will help you take 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.449
 your decision if you want to see 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 videos on these two products

 do not hesitate to go see my videos 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.189
 who will be in the description 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.720
 for those who do not know I am a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.460
 youtuber specialized in products to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 ios and now i'm going to start 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.719
 do more videos on android 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 so do not hesitate to subscribe on my 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.540
 youtube channel in this video we're going 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 talk about multiple criteria and for 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 each criterion I will assign a 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.600
 point to the winners regarding the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.910
 design both phones are all 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 two different the s4 of an appearance 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.680
 plastic with a back shell in 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.180
 polycarbonate the iphone 5 has by cons a 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.100
 biggest aspect as a smartphone 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.629
 high-end since it is composed by 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.879
 materials a little more noble like 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.949
 aluminum or glass finishing 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.359
 two devices is excellent at the level 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.980
 of the screen the iphone has a screen 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.290
 4-inch touch with a resolution 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.510
 from 1136 to 640 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.180
 unlike s 4 with a screen 5 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.150
 inches with a resolution of 1920 by 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.890
 1080 pixels and it's a full hd screen 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.320
 so we both have a screen 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.150
 very good quality but with a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.770
 better resolution for the s4 in this 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.000
 regarding the weight the iphone 5 is 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.790
 always win over others 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.979
 smartphones 112 g contrary to s 4 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.229
 with 135 grams for finesse 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 it's still the iphone 5 that is 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.650
 winner with its 7.6 mm but very little 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.630
 because the s4 is just 0.3 mm more 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.040
 are practically equivalent for the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.869
 design is often a point of view 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.549
 staff that we will give here for the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.740
 note so i'm going to assign the point to 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.680
 the iphone mainly on the fact that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 the s4 is plastic at the level 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.960
 of material the s4 bam there you have a 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.430
 soft back side that you can 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.170
 remove easily to gain access 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.820
 directly to the battery you 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.509
 so can easily change and 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.579
 quickly 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.799
 you have a location to add 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.810
 the memory can go up to 64 giga 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.640
 in micro sd at the performance level 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.770
 we have a dual core processor of 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.940
 1 ghz of giguère this for the iphone is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.039
 on the other hand it is much more powerful on 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.340
 the s4 with four clocked hearts 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.590
 up to 1.9 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.050
 giguère this for the part ramon to two 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.640
 gigas for the s4 1 gig for the iphone 5 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.280
 is now against there we go 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.440
 talk about the battery or there the s4 will have 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.010
 a much better capacity with its 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.480
 2600 milliamps while the iphone is 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.690
 practically past the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.940
 with its half 1400 40 min loses 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.700
 point here will be awarded of course 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.560
 os4 most powerful nfc chip the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.810
 possibility to put a 4g chip then 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.209
 that on the iphone 5 is until the hour 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.130
 chips the user is really more 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.840
 free since we can add some 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.500
 memory easily change its battery 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.260
 etc. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.480
 we will now talk about the camera on 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.610
 s4 has the back cover of 13 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.440
 megapixels whereas for the iphone 5 we 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.360
 remains on the 8 megapixel that now 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.310
 the basis in the world of smartphones 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.170
 I made some pictures and 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.819
 personally despite its 8 megapixels 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.129
 the photos of iphone 5 are of very 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.049
 good quality but I find that one 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.209
 s4 colors are a little bit 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.730
 more alive and video level it's 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.260
 like the s4 I find that quality a 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.359
 little better than the iphone 5 for the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.639
 little curious the party before cdu with 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.130
 2 megapixels for iphone 5 and 2 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:23.859
 megapixels for the s4 here I want 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.480
 awarded the point os 4 but the quality 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.370
 of photo for both devices is 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.139
 really good we'll talk 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.000
 now from the operating system 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.709
 here we really touch something 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.450
 tricky because as you know between 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.790
 ios and android it's a little war 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.109
 but know that if you have an idea of 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.329
 what you want to do with your 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.849
 portable you are definitely going 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.980
 find the one you like at the level 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.690
 from the iphone 5 on to the six we we 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.160
 have a fluid operating system 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.810
 and simple to understand 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.250
 at standard of living lockscreen we are 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.290
 show the time we can also open 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.940
 the camera quickly and for 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.829
 unlock we just slip with the 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.239
 little arrow in the springboard part 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.400
 it works through 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.660
 pages you have applications and everything 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.579
 on the left you can search a 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.959
 application and you have in pressing 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.569
 twice on the home button 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.500
 the multitasking mode and you even have a 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.569
 music player 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.590
 and when you receive information 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.329
 through your applications 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.790
 sms mails etc 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.979
 you will find them directly in the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.370
 notification center for the h4 one has a 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.389
 android 4.2.2 jelly bean via system 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.590
 more complex than the iphone 5 you have 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.939
 more features than some 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.530
 could call as a gadget that 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.030
 depends on your point of view at the level 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.979
 lockscreen we can always 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.110
 change but this base you have 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.150
 the time the date is to unlock 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.159
 we will slide on the screen you have 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.560
 also pages you will be able 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.719
 place your apps and widgets where 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.639
 you want and when you view the 

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.009
 party notification contrary to 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.919
 the iphone there you have the possibility 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.460
 to turn off the wi fi the 3g etc 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.779
 etc. 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.789
 there you can even change the 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:55.159
 brightness directly and all that without 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.479
 go through the settings here for the 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.189
 software part it's really a 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.110
 criterion more than personal it depends 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.909
 really of your needs me I attributed 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.879
 my fist a bone 4 because I like everything that 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.139
 is hack features gadgets and 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.460
 you will probably be able to talk about 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.169
 jailbreak that allows to have a big 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.689
 number of android features on 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.250
 ios is there I reject the jailbreak of 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:15.020
 this comparison I'm only going 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.560
 talk about what's basic about our 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.419
 appliances 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.659
 now to finish the price the iphone 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:23.449
 is offered at the price of 679 euros 90 with 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:27.349
 as a choice of white or black from 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.990
 of his giga and for the s4c 689 euros 90 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:31.610
 with also white or black from 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.830
 of 16 giga and you can add some 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.020
 memory the point here will be awarded 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.039
 logically to the iphone even if it is that 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.409
 10 euros difference 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.210
 and as the materials are a bit more 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.699
 noble on the iphone it's quite 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.120
 normal that the iphone wins this point for 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.889
 conclude the s4 wins the victory but 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.199
 of course there are still six months of 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.750
 difference compared to the iphone 5 and 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.039
 the s4 do not forget but what I 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.419
 can you give as advice it's the 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.969
 does that if you want a phone 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.389
 simple to use fast with a lot of 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:01.789
 contents 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.439
 I advise you to take the iphone 5 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.469
 on the other hand if you prefer everything 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.939
 which is more hack widgets 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:10.550
 features I advise you to 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.879
 take the s4 it really depends on your 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.649
 needs 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.360
 in any case I hope this video 

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:16.310
 you liked it I thank you for having it 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.930

 go out to subscribers on my youtube channel
