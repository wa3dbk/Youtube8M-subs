00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to make sure that we gave people

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
to make sure that we gave people
information<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.689> could<00:00:27.869> get

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
information so that we could get

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.779 
information so that we could get
feedback<00:00:28.650> as<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.160> whether<00:00:29.429> we're<00:00:29.640> doing

them wrong transparency leads to
self-correcting<00:00:34.950> behaviors<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> time

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
self-correcting behaviors this is a time

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.540 
self-correcting behaviors this is a time
in<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.380> economy<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:37.920> everybody

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
in the economy I think everybody

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.360 
in the economy I think everybody
recognizes<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> do<00:00:40.410> more<00:00:41.100> with

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
recognizes that we have to do more with

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.750 
recognizes that we have to do more with
less<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:43.410> city<00:00:43.680> we<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.250> shouldn't<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
less as the city we we shouldn't have to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
less as the city we we shouldn't have to
spend<00:00:45.239> money<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> interact<00:00:46.050> with<00:00:46.230> our<00:00:46.320> city<00:00:46.590> we

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
spend money to interact with our city we

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.240 
spend money to interact with our city we
already<00:00:47.219> pay<00:00:47.340> taxes<00:00:47.820> right<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.620> ideally<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.890> we

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
already pay taxes right so ideally if we

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.119 
already pay taxes right so ideally if we
can<00:00:50.629> somehow<00:00:51.629> provide<00:00:52.170> internet<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.949> free

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
can somehow provide internet for free

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.939 
can somehow provide internet for free
and<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:54.420> get<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> citizen<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> talk<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and get get the citizen to talk to the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.729 
and get get the citizen to talk to the
government<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.360> city<00:00:57.600> that'd<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.320> great

Hawaii<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.820> one<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> largest<00:01:00.840> adopters<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Hawaii is one of the largest adopters of

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.130 
Hawaii is one of the largest adopters of
mobile<00:01:02.129> technologies<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> country<00:01:03.660> so

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mobile technologies in the country so

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.200 
mobile technologies in the country so
the<00:01:04.290> citizen<00:01:04.650> starts<00:01:04.890> asking<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.549> more<00:01:05.670> for

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the citizen starts asking for more for

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.920 
the citizen starts asking for more for
more<00:01:06.330> data<00:01:06.590> crime<00:01:07.590> statistics<00:01:08.420> traffic<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
more data crime statistics traffic and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.020 
more data crime statistics traffic and
so<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.320> started<00:01:10.740> making<00:01:10.860> them<00:01:11.189> available<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
so we started making them available in a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.330 
so we started making them available in a
usable<00:01:12.570> format<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.799> enabled<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
usable format and that enabled the

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.570 
usable format and that enabled the
citizens<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> create<00:01:15.090> two<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.110> unique

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
citizens to create two really unique

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
citizens to create two really unique
applications<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.479> our<00:01:18.840> internal

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
applications they are on our internal

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
applications they are on our internal
file<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.979> them<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.340> run<00:01:20.490> those<00:01:20.670> applications

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
file for them to run those applications

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.410 
file for them to run those applications

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the goal of the DES basa app is to give

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810 
the goal of the DES basa app is to give
the<00:01:24.840> bus<00:01:25.049> riders<00:01:25.500> okay<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.220> they<00:01:26.520> don't<00:01:26.700> have

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the bus riders okay so they don't have

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
the bus riders okay so they don't have
to<00:01:26.939> guess<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.240> win<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> bus<00:01:28.020> when<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> next

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to guess about win the bus when the next

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.910 
to guess about win the bus when the next
bus<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> gonna<00:01:29.130> come<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.750> go<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.810> eliminate<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
bus is gonna come I go to eliminate that

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
bus is gonna come I go to eliminate that
gas<00:01:32.130> would<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:33.060> city<00:01:33.299> actually<00:01:33.450> provide<00:01:34.049> us

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
gas would the city actually provide us

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.240 
gas would the city actually provide us
the<00:01:34.860> open<00:01:35.159> API<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:36.420> allow<00:01:36.960> us<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.680> retrieve

the<00:01:55.890> application<00:01:56.520> makes<00:01:57.210> use<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.420> GIS<00:01:58.140> web

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
the application makes use of GIS web

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.459 
the application makes use of GIS web
services<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> base<00:01:59.790> map<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:01.140> outline

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
services so the base map is the outline

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.350 
services so the base map is the outline
of<00:02:01.500> oahu<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.939> top<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.869> over

of oahu on top of that we over
what<00:02:05.360> they<00:02:05.480> call<00:02:05.690> operational<00:02:06.350> layers<00:02:06.590> deaths

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
what they call operational layers deaths

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.030 
what they call operational layers deaths
would<00:02:07.820> be<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.300> pink<00:02:08.720> or<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.200> red<00:02:09.560> tsunami

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
would be the pink or the red tsunami
