00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
out monetizable views on mobile so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.910 
out monetizable views on mobile so
instead<00:00:21.480> they're<00:00:21.630> gonna<00:00:21.810> roll<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.380> metric

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
instead they're gonna roll that metric

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.120

into playback monetizable views the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.980 
into playback monetizable views the
estimated<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.119> they<00:00:27.210> give<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.480> YouTube

estimated one that they give you YouTube

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
estimated one that they give you YouTube
analytics<00:00:28.560> there<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.250> hopefully<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.820> can

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
analytics there and hopefully you can

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.099 
analytics there and hopefully you can
just<00:00:30.150> use<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.630> kind<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.840> figure<00:00:31.080> out

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
just use that to kind of figure out

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.500 
just use that to kind of figure out
which<00:00:31.800> views<00:00:32.099> are<00:00:32.340> monetizable<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.270> and

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.300 
you think that like doesn't every time
so<00:03:02.930> and<00:03:03.050> watch<00:03:03.170> one<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.410> my<00:03:03.530> videos<00:03:03.890> isn't<00:03:04.160> that

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so and watch one of my videos isn't that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.400 
so and watch one of my videos isn't that
a<00:03:04.340> monetizable<00:03:04.880> view<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.360> it's<00:03:05.690> not<00:03:05.930> really

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
a monetizable view and it's not really

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.530 
a monetizable view and it's not really
because<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:07.280> remember<00:03:07.580> like<00:03:07.670> I'm<00:03:07.850> Smart<00:03:08.180> TV

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
because you remember like I'm Smart TV

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.360 
because you remember like I'm Smart TV
sometimes<00:03:09.080> like<00:03:09.290> those<00:03:09.500> YouTube<00:03:09.920> apps<00:03:10.130> on

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
sometimes like those YouTube apps on

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.490 
sometimes like those YouTube apps on
those<00:03:10.520> devices<00:03:10.850> don't<00:03:11.330> play<00:03:11.630> pre-roll<00:03:12.260> ads

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
those devices don't play pre-roll ads

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.380 
those devices don't play pre-roll ads
there<00:03:12.980> could<00:03:13.130> be<00:03:13.160> other<00:03:13.340> third-party<00:03:13.970> apps

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
there could be other third-party apps

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.410 
there could be other third-party apps
for<00:03:14.840> YouTube<00:03:15.170> that<00:03:15.440> ignore<00:03:16.310> pre-roll<00:03:16.790> ads<00:03:17.090> and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
for YouTube that ignore pre-roll ads and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.880 
for YouTube that ignore pre-roll ads and
so<00:03:17.630> that's<00:03:17.750> becoming<00:03:18.080> less<00:03:18.230> and<00:03:18.590> less

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
so that's becoming less and less

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.860 
so that's becoming less and less
thankfully<00:03:19.760> but<00:03:19.940> there's<00:03:20.180> still<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.660> lot<00:03:20.840> of

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
thankfully but there's still a lot of

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.620 
thankfully but there's still a lot of
ways<00:03:21.230> to<00:03:21.530> not<00:03:22.130> monetize<00:03:22.670> views<00:03:23.030> out<00:03:23.239> there<00:03:23.450> if

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
ways to not monetize views out there if

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.150 
ways to not monetize views out there if
you<00:03:23.690> go<00:03:23.810> into<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.110> impression<00:03:24.530> space<00:03:24.739> report

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
you go into the impression space report

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.620 
you go into the impression space report
you'll<00:03:25.280> see<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.430> couple<00:03:25.670> of<00:03:25.760> things<00:03:26.090> there<00:03:26.269> such

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
you'll see a couple of things there such

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.290 
you'll see a couple of things there such
as<00:03:26.780> like<00:03:26.930> impressions<00:03:27.830> based<00:03:28.220> CPM<00:03:28.970> and<00:03:29.180> that's

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
as like impressions based CPM and that's

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.670 
as like impressions based CPM and that's
basically<00:03:29.690> how<00:03:30.019> much<00:03:30.200> money<00:03:30.500> you're<00:03:30.650> making

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
basically how much money you're making

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.000 
basically how much money you're making
per<00:03:31.360> thousand<00:03:32.360> ad<00:03:32.600> impressions<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.769> like<00:03:33.890> I

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
per thousand ad impressions so like I

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.500 
per thousand ad impressions so like I
said<00:03:34.220> remember<00:03:34.580> you<00:03:34.730> could<00:03:34.970> have<00:03:35.090> one<00:03:35.300> video

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
said remember you could have one video

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.330 
said remember you could have one video
play<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:35.959> shows<00:03:36.110> three<00:03:36.350> different<00:03:36.380> ads<00:03:36.800> so

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
play that shows three different ads so

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.100 
play that shows three different ads so
that's<00:03:37.610> that's<00:03:38.330> how<00:03:38.570> much<00:03:38.750> money<00:03:38.959> you're

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
that's that's how much money you're

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.350 
that's that's how much money you're
making<00:03:39.140> you<00:03:39.800> know<00:03:39.950> four<00:03:40.459> thousand<00:03:41.209> ad

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
making you know four thousand ad

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.790 
making you know four thousand ad
impressions<00:03:41.840> we<00:03:42.110> could<00:03:42.260> actually<00:03:42.380> spend<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
impressions we could actually spend a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.229 
impressions we could actually spend a
lot<00:03:42.950> of<00:03:42.980> time<00:03:43.250> digging<00:03:43.519> into<00:03:43.820> each<00:03:43.940> of<00:03:44.150> these

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
lot of time digging into each of these

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.550 
lot of time digging into each of these
and<00:03:44.540> I<00:03:44.600> know<00:03:44.660> there's<00:03:45.170> probably<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.440> lot<00:03:45.500> of

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
and I know there's probably a lot of

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.290 
and I know there's probably a lot of
questions<00:03:45.950> out<00:03:46.040> there<00:03:46.100> about<00:03:46.519> them<00:03:46.760> but<00:03:47.120> this
