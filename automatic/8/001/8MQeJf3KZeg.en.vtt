00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.740
 hey people what is already rehabilitated 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 welcome to another video too 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.360
 Grand Theft Auto 5 most of you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.580
 will probably have noticed 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 why many of the gta youtube no 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.060
 glitches more upload 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.340
 I would like to take a quick look anyway 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.619
 Talk it is just that rockstar 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 is from now on banned glitches on 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 to show youtube and include 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.300
 Glitches of any kind no matter if you are eclipse 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.370
 rp glitches or godsweet loetschers and 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.140
 Who violates this prohibition of 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 must expect a strike 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.059
 that means that the video from youtube 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.210
 is taken down and at three 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.640
 Strikes the entire channel is deleted 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 The rockstar is really serious about that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.829
 they already believe in one 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.930
 American gta youtuber proved the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.809
 has my message after this message 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.699
 clips uploaded and his channel was 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.039
 meanwhile closed with it the same 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.290
 not synonymous with my channel happened 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.290
 I will from now on no more glitches 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.750
 personally upload that misplaced 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.020
 pity since the glitches even more the rp 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.310
 and always matches extremely well to come 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 but we just have to 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.439
 may become alternative superior 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.500
 I shared with some other gta 5 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.100
 youtube on some fanny moments videos 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 record and information videos to gta 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.200
 5 general it will definitely continue 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.930
 for example, on my channel 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.549
 upcoming dlcs have just as a video 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 I also prepared for you today 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.320
 Today I want to talk about three vehicles and 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.329
 three weapons are already talking in the 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.329
 coaching has been discovered by gta 5 and 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.070
 which may with the next update in 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.869
 the game could come 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.329
 you can already do the next update 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.070
 appear within the next few weeks 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.470
 the last update is already 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.110
 months ago and you should not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.939
 resting too much on update 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.180
 because the hot missions were the goods 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.920
 played through pretty fast and now 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.770
 It's getting boring too 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 at the moment a dlc 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.200
 appear and to the vehicles in 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.230
 the dlc in 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.790
 to be in there 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.530
 Tuning parts found in the ground and so far 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.050
 It always was like that when you were 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.849
 Tuning parts to a vehicle in urine 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.099
 found that this vehicle too 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:27.739
 two to three weeks later already in 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.780
 game was in there and the vehicles too 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.700
 which tuning parts was found that it 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.560
 once the tank at which one can 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.170
 for example the roof of the exhaust and 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.000
 modify the roll cage and 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.400
 therefore one assumes that it is 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.900
 in this vehicle to a sports car 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.450
 then you still have that traded 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.940
 Rotting found there you can do that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.780
 change the roof and the exhaust and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.489
 some other little things and also the 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.709
 detonator has led you that sounds 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.019
 load a little in the right suv 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.349
 There you can open the roof and the exhaust 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.239
 change the side trim 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.890
 Then we come directly to the three 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.079
 wait for a new one 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.360
 I stand this normally in the coding 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.380
 in it because the wait makes it 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.910
 rockstar always so that they 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.030
 representative of the weapons 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.459
 Paying codes into the coaching skin 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.209
 so you do not know which ones 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.389
 arms on us with the next dlc 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.340
 waiting 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.130
 Nevertheless, some of you may know 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.470
 this picture is about one 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.019
 been posted and on the 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.569
 you see all the weapons with the 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.940
 next dlcs should appear and 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.709
 that it really is 99 percent of 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.170
 Weapons were done like 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.200
 For example, the caregivers are real 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.900
 with dlcs got into the game and only 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.540
 three of these weapons are not currently 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.450
 that's available in gta 5 online 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.090
 once the weapon called k once the 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.299
 sniper once a grenade launcher 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.670
 and exactly these three weapons could open up 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.069
 we wait with the next dlc 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.690
 think more information will be 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.220
 in any case in the 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.470
 next few days following that's it 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.540
 already so far from this video world war 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.290
 Smash liked the like button 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.290
 people and
