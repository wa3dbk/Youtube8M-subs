 for a French channel 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.480

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.300
 all the questions you asked me 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.850

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.079

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.109
 encouragements 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:13.319
 I do not know what else to say except 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:15.810
 thank you that of course bah I'm going 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.979
 continue serious that I still hope 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.689
 found lots of ideas for you 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.759
 counselor try to make videos 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.499
 who you like and who you are 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.639
 allow to truly understand what 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.109
 I want to tell you because I know that 

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.369
 it's not always obvious that I'm doing 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.770
 a lot of theories that I blablate 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.999
 a lot like me even if I know 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.130
 that there are some who like me 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.209
 it tires me in the sense that it does not 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 I'm bothered to do it but that 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.149
 personally I have trouble watching 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.009
 a video where it blablates during 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.020
 hours and where yet polio phyllis 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.340
 and that's theory so me when 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.479
 I'm talking about it actually what I'm doing 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.069
 it's that I try in quotation marks 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.029
 groggy but to chew you the job 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.439
 researches 

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:48.419
 that is, trying to simplify 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.700
 at most what to look for 

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:52.859
 coiro search how to search but 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.329
 it will never stop to make his 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.760
 own research to take time 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.410
 to see patient debt 2 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.160
 that's aquarium I say in 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.780
 one of the questions besides 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.610
 the aquarium hobby is mainly about 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.020
 my sense is the research is the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 project preparation this is the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.230
 building a folder because 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.390
 again they are animals 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.440
 alive that we will maintain that we 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.260
 made for our pleasure 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.450
 so for me from that moment on 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.860
 anyway it's ambiguous it's for 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.290
 what more and more and I say 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.490
 officially i'm going i'll continue 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.260
 to give my advice because it's 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.210
 important for me as advisers for 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.010
 that the fish are fine but of 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.470
 more and more more and more in the 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.000
 rescue frame so we are not 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.910
 exactly on the same step but in 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.340
 anyway that's it does not change much 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.440
 it even changes nothing to maintenance at 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.790
 drink respect on the contrary but 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.890
 I will be more in the case of rescue 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.120
 that is, I collect fish 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.400
 how do I do what are things 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.290
 important to take into account but we 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.580
 is on the same basis of knowing 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.959
 what they need how do they live 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.430
 and how do I do to satisfy them 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.950
 I take this opportunity to ask you a 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.750
 official question not for a faq not 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.600
 for all that just if that you 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.940
 would be interested to have an ebook that I 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.739
 that I could do to give the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.959
 basics of how well started in 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.430
 aquarium again this would 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.840
 in the rescue frame so no 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.770
 advice on pet shop not pad 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.120
 how are we doing to buy the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.610
 fish because that I'm against 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.959
 but how to accommodate 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.940
 fish what is quarantine 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.380
 how to mount an aquarium how to do 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.480
 research a brief an ebook that 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.709
 sums up pretty much everything i do not think 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.350
 because in this case it would be something 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.840
 pretty complete thing da it's tedious 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.430
 it would be a happiness one to do it but 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.720
 it would be something serious at 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.550
 quad so I do not think I can 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.720
 do it for free but it will not be a 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.610
 ride price 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.350
 it will really be a small price will be 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.940
 largely less than 10 euros but that's it 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.410
 would that interest you because 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.870
 that I will not do it if all the 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.920
 we do not care we agree 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.910
 so do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.769
 comments would interest you 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.880
 to have an ebook that would allow you to 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.160
 to walk around with like on your 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.080
 portable on your tablet or even 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.530
 the print but hey it's not very green 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.610
 or so they recycled paper so 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.180
 do not hesitate to tell me that in 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.920
 comments 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.450
 once again thank you all for your 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.650
 participation in this faq that was 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.269
 hyper long is almost a little 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.100
 embarrassing to do ten thousand videos buddy 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.600
 each and every way but in everything 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.130
 case I'm so clogged by all that 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.060
 I enjoyed myself so much to do same 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.709
 if it was enough 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.079
 as you could see it was 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.150
 high enough 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.709
 we felt it pass the faq that 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.959
 or quirky and all but it was really 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.730
 a happiness the next videos I have 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.870
 no idea of ​​the order in which they 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.310
 will be put online but it will be 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.910
 obviously the bonus of the tanks and 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.920
 aquariums 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.910
 there will obviously be a video about 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.810
 Orium trash bins because that makes 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.120
 for a long time I have not done it 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.350
 go see it's going to be pretty cool enough 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.270
 fast but in a way a little bit 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.430
 more to the warrior I wanted you 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.930
 to try like that and that's so bah I 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.190
 wish you a good weekend a good 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.510
 week I do not know where is that 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.280
 when will this video come out 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.730
 so I wish you all the happiness of the 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.860
 world 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.150
 and as usual I tell you to very 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.810
 soon for the next video 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.810
 Hi
