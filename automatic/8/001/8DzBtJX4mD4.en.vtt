lightweight strong pedal my earliest

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.009 
lightweight strong pedal my earliest
memory<00:00:45.970> was<00:00:46.030> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:48.010> I<00:00:48.100> was<00:00:48.339> in<00:00:48.370> fourth<00:00:48.760> grade

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.110 
memory was I think I was in fourth grade
and<00:00:50.019> I<00:00:50.199> basically<00:00:50.620> had<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.580> love<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.909> drum

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.580 

the<00:01:05.180> reason<00:01:05.510> that<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.660> think<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.140> many<00:01:06.170> players

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
the reason that I think so many players

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.740 
the reason that I think so many players
go<00:01:06.770> out<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.070> way<00:01:07.250> to<00:01:08.030> play<00:01:08.180> Ludwig<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.630> the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
go out of the way to play Ludwig is the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.020 
go out of the way to play Ludwig is the
sound<00:01:09.020> never<00:01:09.740> just<00:01:09.890> innovative<00:01:10.220> stainless

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
sound never just innovative stainless

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.180

steel<00:01:11.240> drums<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:12.170> know<00:01:12.260> drums<00:01:12.710> made<00:01:12.950> out<00:01:13.100> of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
steel drums you know drums made out of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.400 
steel drums you know drums made out of
plastic<00:01:13.790> plumbers<00:01:14.330> use<00:01:14.479> Ludwig<00:01:14.870> drums<00:01:15.020> rather

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
plastic plumbers use Ludwig drums rather

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.140 
plastic plumbers use Ludwig drums rather
for<00:01:15.650> the<00:01:15.740> same<00:01:15.950> reason<00:01:16.340> guitar<00:01:16.760> players<00:01:17.120> use

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
for the same reason guitar players use

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.630 
for the same reason guitar players use
fenders<00:01:18.020> or<00:01:18.229> Gibson<00:01:18.590> there's<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.950> warmth<00:01:19.460> and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
fenders or Gibson there's a warmth and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.700 
fenders or Gibson there's a warmth and
there's<00:01:20.119> a<00:01:20.210> brightness<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.200> it's<00:01:21.380> just<00:01:21.590> this

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
there's a brightness and it's just this

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.859 
there's a brightness and it's just this
beautiful<00:01:21.979> balance<00:01:22.700> there's<00:01:23.090> an<00:01:23.240> air<00:01:23.450> there's

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
beautiful balance there's an air there's

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.830 
beautiful balance there's an air there's
the<00:01:24.500> breeze<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:27.830> think<00:01:28.520> in<00:01:28.640> some<00:01:28.850> ways<00:01:29.060> it's<00:01:29.720> a

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
the breeze I think in some ways it's a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.630 
the breeze I think in some ways it's a
happy<00:01:30.170> accident<00:01:30.350> that's<00:01:30.950> pretty<00:01:31.190> easy<00:01:31.250> I

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
happy accident that's pretty easy I

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.889 
happy accident that's pretty easy I
think<00:01:31.940> it's<00:01:32.479> called
