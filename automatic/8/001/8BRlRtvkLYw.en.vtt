00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
is pretty good as well it's pretty good

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.380 
is pretty good as well it's pretty good
quality<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.399> does<00:00:35.640> limit<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.120> quite<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
quality but it does limit you quite a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.860 
quality but it does limit you quite a
lot<00:00:36.480> I'm<00:00:37.380> not<00:00:37.530> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.739> lie<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.879> also

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
lot I'm not going to lie so the also

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.360 
lot I'm not going to lie so the also
it's<00:00:39.989> very<00:00:40.260> expensive<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:40.860> about<00:00:40.980> three

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it's very expensive it's about three

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
it's very expensive it's about three
hundred<00:00:41.550> dollars<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.300> think<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.350> use<00:00:43.649> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
hundred dollars I think so I just use a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.290 
hundred dollars I think so I just use a
free<00:00:43.980> trial<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.280> 30<00:00:44.460> days<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.090> really

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
free trial for 30 days and I was really

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.819
