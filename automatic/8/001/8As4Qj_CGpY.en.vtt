 cristina, that's right we'll learn 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 to make a very easy potato that has 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.420
 several ways to do but I will 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.570
 bring to you the easiest and most 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.640
 faster to make it known then 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.739
 What are the crisis ingredients in 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.420
 You actually use lots of potatoes. 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.010
 that you need depending on the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.260
 quantity invited 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.150
 but if you are alone you can do 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.520
 individual potatoes is not because 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.540
 you will use it in the microwave 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.490
 so come on people get some potatoes washed 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.610
 and leave it well 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.369
 There we go and we'll stick it. 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.470
 all with fork 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.150

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.650
 I traveled united states they use 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.380
 very true, right? 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.930
 Americans are very practical and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.229
 generally there is no maid 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:46.590
 Stuff there I learned to do super think. 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.780
 cool people also use for example 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.750
 you have many guests you can 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.369
 make this potato in the oven and wrap it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.740
 with foil 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:01.409
 but in this case here we will do in 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:04.380
 microwave a double sheet of places in 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.619
 bottom and microwave leads - for 15 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.619
