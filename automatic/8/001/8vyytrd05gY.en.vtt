 drinks flavored with herbs and 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.739
 spices 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.740

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.449
 swallows with edible flowers a 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.939
 practice that increasingly wins 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.390

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.029
 aromatic with herbs and spices either 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.460

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.670
 mint today enjoys recognition 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.160
 global mint is really a 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.879
 variety of peppermint but both 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.769
 they have great similarity in shape and aroma 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.960
 can be used to decorate cocktails or 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.149
 to incorporate them into the mix and its 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.980
 refreshing aroma immediately invades the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.170
 taste of the drink 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.050
 at the time of macerating or crushing 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.420
 avoid destroying the plant just do 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.730
 pressure on the stem otherwise 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.129
 you will get a bitter substance that 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.650
 It will alter the taste of the drink and 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.930
 remember that herbs should be used in 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.879
 the day keep them in the fridge 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.980
 wrapped in a paper or on a cloth 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.890
 damp 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.590
 the leaves of cedrÃ³n for example are very 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.300
 sought as a natural sedative will 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.800
 we suggest you take the following steps 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:21.400
 to create an aromatic sherry with cedar 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:25.670
 dry 100 milliliters 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.930
 40 milliliter lemon-lime soda 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.930
 fresh cedron 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.740
 place the ingredients in a glass 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.740
 white wine with three or four ice cubes 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.509
 I used 100 milliliters of dry sherry 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.509
 very cold 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.520
 and complete with 40,000 liters of soda 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.520
 lemon lime 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.960
 decorate the cocktail with leaves or branches 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.960
 from cedar 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.900
 with a fresh branch of cedrÃ³n hit the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.379
 walls of the glass will manage to aromatize all 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.379
 the preparation 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.780
 then stir with a spoon 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.500
 do not 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.989
 this dry drink with notes of white wine 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.299
 well cold attached to the soda 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.400
 lime-lemon proposes a cocktail that can 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.709
 be consumed with some seafood 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.769
 or as a snack next to a 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.620
 pool regardless of the choice when 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.890
 you drink it everyone will envy your good 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.890
