this<00:04:13.129> is<00:04:13.280> Rimmel<00:04:13.819> in<00:04:14.739> natural<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.430> natural

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
this is Rimmel in natural the natural

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.010 
this is Rimmel in natural the natural
natural<00:04:17.810> natural<00:04:20.019> so<00:04:21.019> I<00:04:21.350> think<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:22.040> one<00:04:22.310> and

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
natural natural so I think this one and

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.260 
natural natural so I think this one and
this<00:04:24.020> one<00:04:24.490> looks<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.669> bit<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.880> same<00:04:26.060> but

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
this one looks a bit the same but

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.460 
this one looks a bit the same but
doesn't<00:04:26.540> really<00:04:26.570> matter<00:04:26.870> because<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.320> is<00:04:27.410> a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
doesn't really matter because this is a

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.520 
doesn't really matter because this is a
lip<00:04:27.650> liner<00:04:27.860> so<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:29.330> lip<00:04:29.539> gloss<00:04:29.870> it's<00:04:30.260> not<00:04:30.410> in

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
lip liner so the lip gloss it's not in
