00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.150 

it's<00:00:31.980> got<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> very<00:00:32.460> funky<00:00:33.649> and<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.829> can<00:00:34.980> see

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
it's got a very funky and if you can see

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.750 
it's got a very funky and if you can see
that<00:00:36.110> it's<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.230> little<00:00:37.530> computer<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.250> tells

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that it's a little computer on it tells

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.110 
that it's a little computer on it tells
you<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.180> many<00:00:39.329> shots<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.719> fired<00:00:40.879> how<00:00:41.879> heavy

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you how many shots you fired how heavy

the<00:00:42.239> load<00:00:42.420> was<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> also<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.579> temperature

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
the load was and also the temperature

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.279 
the load was and also the temperature
which<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:47.149> seems<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> tad<00:00:48.329> excessive<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.899> me<00:00:48.930> but

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.920 
which is seems a tad excessive to me but
that's<00:00:50.100> quite<00:00:50.280> cool<00:00:50.690> probably<00:00:51.690> something

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that's quite cool probably something

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.490
