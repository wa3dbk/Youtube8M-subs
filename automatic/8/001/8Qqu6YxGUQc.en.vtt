synopsis and my thoughts so this chapter

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.120 
synopsis and my thoughts so this chapter
was<00:00:15.330> combined<00:00:15.839> between<00:00:15.990> two<00:00:16.350> things<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.890> was

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
was combined between two things it was

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.510 
was combined between two things it was
the<00:00:17.730> QB<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.539> I<00:00:18.779> guess<00:00:19.109> reformed<00:00:20.010> based<00:00:20.310> on

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
the QB has I guess reformed based on

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.890 
the QB has I guess reformed based on
some<00:00:20.730> chakra<00:00:21.150> or<00:00:21.240> whatever<00:00:21.449> he's<00:00:21.720> been

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
some chakra or whatever he's been

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.960 
some chakra or whatever he's been
getting<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.260> Naruto<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.100> there<00:00:23.820> was<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
getting from Naruto and there was a

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
getting from Naruto and there was a
flashback<00:00:24.570> sequence<00:00:24.810> between<00:00:25.199> Naruto<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
thing that bothers me about Naruto is

because he kind of I'm sure it doesn't

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.940 
because he kind of I'm sure it doesn't

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
stuff because I always loved
interactions<00:01:42.509> between<00:01:42.659> Cuba<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.290> Naruto<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
interactions between Cuba and Naruto and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.609 
interactions between Cuba and Naruto and
I<00:01:44.430> wonder<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.479> maybe<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
I wonder it's just like maybe it's the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.260 
I wonder it's just like maybe it's the
first<00:01:46.890> steps<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.430> gnarled<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.939> finally

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
first steps of gnarled so finally

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.030 
first steps of gnarled so finally
controlling<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> QB<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.649> funny<00:01:49.860> because

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
controlling the QB it's funny because

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.310 
controlling the QB it's funny because
all<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> other<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:51.360> hottie<00:01:51.780> be<00:01:52.079> for<00:01:52.229> example

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
all the other like hottie be for example

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
all the other like hottie be for example
actually<00:01:53.070> listens<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.820> QB<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.390> seems<00:01:54.570> like

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
actually listens to QB and it seems like

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
actually listens to QB and it seems like
this<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> ninetails<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.820> lot<00:01:57.119> harder

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
this one the ninetails is a lot harder

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.819 
this one the ninetails is a lot harder
to<00:01:57.600> control<00:01:57.869> because<00:01:58.259> he's<00:01:58.409> probably<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.710> lot

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
to control because he's probably a lot

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.010 
to control because he's probably a lot
stronger<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.579> of<00:02:00.000> course<00:02:00.210> he's<00:02:00.390> nine<00:02:00.689> tails

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
stronger and of course he's nine tails

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
stronger and of course he's nine tails
that's<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.350> eight<00:02:01.500> tails<00:02:01.969> but<00:02:02.969> he<00:02:03.060> still

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
that's the eight tails but he still

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.670 
that's the eight tails but he still
seems<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.689> he's<00:02:03.840> up<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.229> something

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
seems like he's up to something

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.190 
seems like he's up to something
either<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.369> or<00:02:05.579> he's<00:02:05.939> turning<00:02:06.630> around<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.990> bit

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
either that or he's turning around a bit

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.300 
either that or he's turning around a bit
I<00:02:07.229> don't<00:02:07.439> know<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.680> hard<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.890> tell<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
I don't know it's hard to tell what the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.520 
I don't know it's hard to tell what the
nine<00:02:08.550> tails<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:09.179> he's<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.840> conforming<00:02:10.500> to

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
nine tails if he's like conforming to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.330 
nine tails if he's like conforming to
being<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.390> controlled

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
being a controlled

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.640 
being a controlled
tailed<00:02:13.489> beasts<00:02:13.760> or<00:02:13.970> whatnot<00:02:14.360> but<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.989> kind<00:02:15.590> of

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
tailed beasts or whatnot but I kind of

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650 
tailed beasts or whatnot but I kind of
think<00:02:15.830> he's<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> softy<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.819> way<00:02:16.940> because<00:02:17.269> if

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
think he's a softy in a way because if

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.210 
think he's a softy in a way because if
you<00:02:17.810> look<00:02:17.959> at<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.200> this<00:02:18.290> whole<00:02:18.500> time<00:02:18.709> he's<00:02:19.010> been

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
you look at it this whole time he's been

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.180 
you look at it this whole time he's been
lending<00:02:19.519> his<00:02:19.819> chakra<00:02:20.209> Naruto<00:02:20.739> granted<00:02:21.739> there

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
lending his chakra Naruto granted there

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.210 
lending his chakra Naruto granted there
was<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.610> thing<00:02:23.599> of<00:02:23.780> him<00:02:23.989> wanting<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.530> control

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
was the thing of him wanting to control

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.610 
was the thing of him wanting to control
Naruto<00:02:25.730> like<00:02:25.879> you<00:02:26.000> know<00:02:26.260> probably<00:02:27.260> I'll<00:02:27.410> give

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
Naruto like you know probably I'll give

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.440 
Naruto like you know probably I'll give
you<00:02:27.709> my<00:02:27.890> chakra<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:28.819> in<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.000> end<00:02:29.090> he<00:02:29.269> could

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
you my chakra so in the end he could

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.420 
you my chakra so in the end he could
control<00:02:29.750> him<00:02:30.019> but<00:02:30.620> still<00:02:30.830> nonetheless<00:02:31.040> he<00:02:31.400> was

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
control him but still nonetheless he was

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.940 
control him but still nonetheless he was
lending<00:02:31.700> him<00:02:31.910> chakra<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:33.080> guess<00:02:33.319> in<00:02:33.799> a<00:02:33.920> way

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
lending him chakra and I guess in a way

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.589 
lending him chakra and I guess in a way
he's<00:02:34.310> still<00:02:34.549> not<00:02:34.700> all<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.030> way<00:02:35.120> back<00:02:35.360> because

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
he's still not all the way back because

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.539 
he's still not all the way back because
when<00:02:36.019> you<00:02:36.080> see<00:02:36.260> his<00:02:36.470> hands<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.190> kind<00:02:37.400> of<00:02:37.430> like

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
when you see his hands it's kind of like

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.280 
when you see his hands it's kind of like
he's<00:02:37.790> missing<00:02:38.120> fur<00:02:38.360> on<00:02:38.540> his<00:02:38.629> hands<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.110> such

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
he's missing fur on his hands and such

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.920 
he's missing fur on his hands and such
but<00:02:40.129> you<00:02:40.190> know<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.549> guess<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.209> was<00:02:41.299> that<00:02:41.480> was

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
but you know I guess it was that was

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.990 
but you know I guess it was that was
really<00:02:42.200> awesome<00:02:42.349> to<00:02:42.560> see<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:42.860> QB<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.400> see

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
really awesome to see the QB and see

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.580 
really awesome to see the QB and see
that<00:02:44.150> Naruto<00:02:44.569> now<00:02:44.690> ain't<00:02:44.870> scared<00:02:45.140> him<00:02:45.319> no<00:02:45.440> more

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
that Naruto now ain't scared him no more

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.229 
that Naruto now ain't scared him no more
he's<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:45.890> being<00:02:46.370> bold<00:02:46.640> ever<00:02:46.849> since<00:02:47.060> he'd

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
he's like being bold ever since he'd

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.240 
he's like being bold ever since he'd
beat<00:02:47.480> him<00:02:47.690> in<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.930> fight<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.440> guess<00:02:49.069> he's

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
beat him in that fight I guess he's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.770 
beat him in that fight I guess he's
really<00:02:49.370> bold<00:02:49.700> now<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.150> cubing<00:02:50.510> it's

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
really bold now with the cubing it's

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.819 
really bold now with the cubing it's
like<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.049> know<00:02:51.140> he's<00:02:51.290> not<00:02:51.380> taking<00:02:51.739> nothing

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
like you know he's not taking nothing

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.190 
like you know he's not taking nothing
from<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.250> QB<00:02:52.579> but<00:02:53.510> let<00:02:53.750> me<00:02:53.810> know<00:02:53.930> what<00:02:53.959> you

from the QB but let me know what you

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.360

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
favorite part obviously it should be the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.710 
favorite part obviously it should be the
QB<00:03:00.709> stuff<00:03:00.950> because<00:03:01.250> nobody<00:03:01.879> really<00:03:02.030> cares<00:03:02.510> so

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
QB stuff because nobody really cares so
