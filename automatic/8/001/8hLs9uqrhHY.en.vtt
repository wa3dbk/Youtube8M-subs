00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
at this block right here it will face

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.140 
at this block right here it will face
through<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.230> block<00:03:10.530> into<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.310> hopper<00:03:11.670> then

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
through the block into the hopper then

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.480 
through the block into the hopper then
go<00:03:12.330> into<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.840> dispenser<00:03:13.380> right<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:13.950> that's

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
go into the dispenser right here that's

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.410 
go into the dispenser right here that's
what<00:03:14.580> we're<00:03:14.670> going<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.820> do<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.030> put<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> block

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
what we're going to do is put a block

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.180 
what we're going to do is put a block
right<00:03:15.630> next<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.020> your<00:03:16.170> dispenser<00:03:16.680> put<00:03:17.070> a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
right next to your dispenser put a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.520 
right next to your dispenser put a
comparator<00:03:17.820> coming<00:03:18.120> out<00:03:18.270> of<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.570> block<00:03:18.870> put

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
comparator coming out of this block put

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.110 
comparator coming out of this block put
a<00:03:19.560> repeater<00:03:19.920> coming<00:03:20.370> out<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.640> comparator

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a repeater coming out of the comparator

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.880 
a repeater coming out of the comparator
put<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> block<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:21.900> front<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.380> repeater<00:03:22.680> and

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
put a block in front of the repeater and

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.590 
put a block in front of the repeater and
then<00:03:23.370> we're<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.550> swing<00:03:23.820> for<00:03:24.090> redstone<00:03:24.480> dust

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
then we're to swing for redstone dust

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.260 
then we're to swing for redstone dust
going<00:03:24.870> this<00:03:24.989> way<00:03:25.140> one<00:03:25.380> two<00:03:25.739> three<00:03:26.310> four<00:03:27.060> like

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
going this way one two three four like

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.729 
going this way one two three four like
that<00:03:27.300> it<00:03:27.750> should<00:03:27.930> hook<00:03:28.140> into<00:03:28.320> the<00:03:28.470> side<00:03:28.620> of

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
that it should hook into the side of

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.140 
that it should hook into the side of
this<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:28.980> has<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.280> doing<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.790> then

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
this it has to be doing that and then

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
this it has to be doing that and then
put<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.330> block<00:03:30.690> next<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.230> your<00:03:31.380> dispenser<00:03:31.890> next

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
all we have to do is if you don't know

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.759 
all we have to do is if you don't know
if<00:03:57.300> it's<00:03:57.420> on<00:03:57.630> or<00:03:57.780> off<00:03:57.900> it's<00:03:58.110> very<00:03:58.170> easy<00:03:58.620> to

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
if it's on or off it's very easy to

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.110 
if it's on or off it's very easy to
realize<00:03:59.130> when<00:03:59.370> it's<00:03:59.489> on<00:03:59.610> or<00:03:59.730> off<00:03:59.820> because<00:03:59.970> if<00:04:00.060> I

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
realize when it's on or off because if I

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.100 
realize when it's on or off because if I
throw<00:04:00.300> my<00:04:00.450> item<00:04:00.750> at<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.050> will

throw my item at it it will

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.840 
throw my item at it it will
automatically<00:04:01.709> dispense<00:04:02.340> out<00:04:02.550> of<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
automatically dispense out of the

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.750 
automatically dispense out of the
dispenser<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:03.540> watch<00:04:03.780> OOP<00:04:04.610> see<00:04:05.610> how<00:04:05.670> it

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
dispenser so watch OOP see how it

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.190 
dispenser so watch OOP see how it
automatically<00:04:06.180> dispensed<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.750> dispenser

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
automatically dispensed out a dispenser

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.600 
automatically dispensed out a dispenser
that<00:04:07.230> means<00:04:07.620> it's<00:04:07.800> on<00:04:07.980> right<00:04:08.220> now<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.400> means

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
that means it's on right now that means

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.650 
that means it's on right now that means
it's<00:04:08.760> going<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.000> just<00:04:09.120> keep<00:04:09.239> popping<00:04:09.600> the

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660

it's going to just keep popping the
items<00:04:09.870> out<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.080> all<00:04:10.140> we<00:04:10.230> have<00:04:10.320> to<00:04:10.350> do<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.560> just

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
items out so all we have to do is just

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.560 
items out so all we have to do is just
flip<00:04:10.860> this<00:04:11.070> off<00:04:11.250> then<00:04:12.030> we<00:04:12.120> just<00:04:12.300> take<00:04:12.420> our

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
flip this off then we just take our

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.780 
flip this off then we just take our
armor<00:04:12.989> one<00:04:13.200> two<00:04:13.500> three<00:04:13.860> four<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:14.519> we<00:04:14.640> go<00:04:14.730> ahead

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
armor one two three four and we go ahead

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.820 
armor one two three four and we go ahead

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
and throw our armor inside our dispenser

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.110 
and throw our armor inside our dispenser
