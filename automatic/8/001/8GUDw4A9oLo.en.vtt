00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.200
 the polder hoogenboezem behind hastrecht 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.880
 has been redesigned as a water storage area 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.680
 in this piece of land on the border of utrecht 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.890
 and Zuid-Holland has the founder 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.470
 made work with work 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.689
 Every water board has three core tasks 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.879
 safe dikes dry feet and clean 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.000
 water and in this project we have two 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.120
 namely of the three tasks combined 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
 clean water and dry feet 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.840
 the purpose of the redesign of the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.790
 Hoogenboezem behind this hurry 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.799
 is to construct an area where we 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.540
 temporarily able to absorb water at 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.510
 high water time on the dutch 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.989
 and can go through an emergency 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.269
 to dive 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.370
 you can open can water through the 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.960
 let vlist flow into the area such that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.750
 the corrected Dutch IJssel 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070
 temporarily relieves the area 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.229
 divided into three parts 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.840
 and we're standing here at the wet part 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.549
 is always able to water even in normal 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.920
 circumstances but if there is the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.299
 diving diving open 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.930
 then another half would be in this area 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.970
 meters of water on top 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.680
 we also tested the area 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.270
 expect this area at times in the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 Will use for 5 years at high tide 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.340
 from the channeled Dutch 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.550
 IJssel water let in on the river 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.550
 the vlist 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 then the water flows through one 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 so-called diver the high bosom in this 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.010
 area is divided into three 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.840
 compartments with different 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.619
 nature types 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.300
 a total of 73,000 cubic meters is possible in 48 hours 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.650
 water are collected 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.670
 which is comparable to thirty 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.670
 olympic swimming pools 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.660
 when the water level drops again, it pumps 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.140
 pumping station sails the water back to 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.970
 the canalized Dutch IJssel 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.590
 because of the excess water in this way 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.340
 to store temporarily 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.340
 we keep our feet dry 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.269
 the founder works for the project 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.459
 Rhine countries closely with the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.609
 South Holland landscape that owns 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.959
 the area is the area is in three 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:27.609
 divided 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.319
 here behind me that's it too 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.750
 first compartment that is has 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.250
 nature objectives as wetlands 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.870
 I can do what goes under water first 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.280
 also have more and the other two 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.599
 compartments consist of whey and 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.129
 meadows 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.689
 Well there by mowing a try 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.370
 to develop flowery meadows and 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:44.370
 there is also room for meadow birds there 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.939
 The great thing about this area is that there are many 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.489
 alternation is between dry and wet 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.199
 They also share that they naturally have water levels 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.000
 more or less which is in the wind in 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.169
 higher water levels and low in the summer 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.939
 water levels 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.560
 that actually ensures that whole 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:02.169
 many plants that is being own 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.209
 find a place and that makes area already 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:06.870
 very quickly very rich in all kinds of species 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.870
 occur here 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.090
 special about this project is that the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.560
 have combined nature development 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.780
 with water storage 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.940
 but also with cultural history and 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.250
 recreation 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.080
 knows the high bosom behind hastrecht 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.670
 a long history in the field of 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.350
 water management 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.630
 as early as the fifteenth century 7 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.790
 mills for drainage 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.440
 from the 19th century a pumping station took over 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.690
 work over 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.970
 is with the redesign of the area 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.510
 the function of water storage 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.510
 restored
