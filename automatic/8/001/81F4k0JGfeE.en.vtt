it is kind of weird that there's only a

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.609 
it is kind of weird that there's only a
five-speed<00:01:23.659> gearbox<00:01:24.820> and<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.750> found<00:01:27.259> out<00:01:27.469> that

under<00:02:44.109> eighteen<00:02:45.109> thousand<00:02:45.829> or<00:02:45.950> seventeen<00:02:46.430> I

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
under eighteen thousand or seventeen I

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.580

corners<00:02:51.769> because<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.610> front<00:02:52.849> end<00:02:53.030> is

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
corners because the front end is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.660 
corners because the front end is
sticking<00:02:53.720> out<00:02:53.810> there<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.080> don't<00:02:54.170> know<00:02:54.410> all<00:02:54.670> the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
sticking out there I don't know all the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.400 
sticking out there I don't know all the
peripherals<00:02:56.360> about<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.870> rake<00:02:57.080> but<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.319> know

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
peripherals about the rake but I know

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.130 
peripherals about the rake but I know
the<00:02:57.620> front<00:02:58.099> wheels<00:02:58.250> out<00:02:58.459> there<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.959> it

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
the front wheels out there but it

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.770 
the front wheels out there but it
corners<00:03:01.069> well<00:03:01.099> it<00:03:01.550> feels<00:03:01.819> comfortable<00:03:02.450> it's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
corners well it feels comfortable it's

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.160 
corners well it feels comfortable it's
stable<00:03:03.410> it's<00:03:04.250> it's<00:03:04.790> just<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.239> really<00:03:05.599> really

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
the reach to the bars is perfect for me

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.890

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
again I was a little bit worried when I

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.280 
again I was a little bit worried when I
first<00:04:01.700> got<00:04:01.880> on<00:04:01.940> if<00:04:02.299> this<00:04:02.480> motorcycle<00:04:02.810> would<00:04:03.170> be

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
first got on if this motorcycle would be

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.930 
first got on if this motorcycle would be
unstable<00:04:03.709> because<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.280> front<00:04:04.549> ends<00:04:04.819> out

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
unstable because the front ends out

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.110 
unstable because the front ends out
there<00:04:05.180> but<00:04:05.720> it's<00:04:05.840> not<00:04:06.400> Yamaha<00:04:07.400> has<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.819> lot<00:04:08.090> of

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
there but it's not Yamaha has a lot of

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.750 
there but it's not Yamaha has a lot of
technology<00:04:08.870> in<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.049> motorcycle<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:10.459> frame

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
is diecast they do it in a vacuum
I<00:04:14.230> just<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:16.420> is<00:04:16.480> a<00:04:16.660> really<00:04:17.260> really<00:04:17.620> really
