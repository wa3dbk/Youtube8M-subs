map<00:00:39.120> i<00:00:39.239> lost<00:00:39.480> i<00:00:39.750> felt<00:00:40.290> i<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.590> ahead<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.340> then<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
map i lost i felt i was ahead and then I

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.430 
map i lost i felt i was ahead and then I
was<00:00:42.239> trying<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.600> clear<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> watchtower<00:00:43.260> with

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
was trying to clear the watchtower with

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.490 
was trying to clear the watchtower with
ones<00:00:43.649> out<00:00:44.120> but<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.750> some<00:00:45.930> reason<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
ones out but for some reason I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.360 
ones out but for some reason I
semi-hollow<00:00:47.190> me<00:00:47.430> i<00:00:47.579> miss<00:00:48.239> click<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.370> he

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
semi-hollow me i miss click there so he

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.069 
semi-hollow me i miss click there so he
caught<00:00:50.640> me<00:00:50.760> off<00:00:50.879> guard<00:00:50.910> killed<00:00:51.420> lots<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.780> units

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
caught me off guard killed lots of units

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
caught me off guard killed lots of units
and<00:00:52.340> that<00:00:53.340> has<00:00:53.460> happened<00:00:53.820> i<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:54.120> i<00:00:54.180> would

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and that has happened i think i would

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.360 
and that has happened i think i would
open<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.570> good<00:00:54.690> position<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> other<00:00:56.160> two

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
open a good position and the other two

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
open a good position and the other two
games<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.719> want<00:00:57.960> rather<00:00:58.199> convincingly

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
games I think I want rather convincingly

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.569 
games I think I want rather convincingly
against<00:00:59.370> him<00:01:00.170> against<00:01:01.170> him<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.340> first

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
against him against him see on the first

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.750 
against him against him see on the first
map<00:01:06.080> mmm<00:01:07.080> also<00:01:07.530> pretty<00:01:07.740> pretty<00:01:08.280> clear<00:01:08.549> when

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
map mmm also pretty pretty clear when

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.789 
map mmm also pretty pretty clear when
the<00:01:08.939> second<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.510> both<00:01:09.689> went<00:01:09.960> Phoenix<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.680> he

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
the second we both went Phoenix and he

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.160 
the second we both went Phoenix and he
just<00:01:11.040> knew<00:01:11.880> how<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> hello<00:01:12.600> situation<00:01:13.049> much

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
just knew how to hello situation much

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.539 
just knew how to hello situation much
better<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.880> third<00:01:15.869> map<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.799> did<00:01:17.189> some<00:01:17.369> early

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
better so on third map we did some early

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.950 
better so on third map we did some early
pressure<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> first<00:01:18.570> game

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
pressure and that was the first game

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.460 
pressure and that was the first game
where<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.400> played<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> bit<00:01:20.610> less<00:01:20.790> safe<00:01:21.030> um<00:01:21.470> that

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
where I played a bit less safe um that

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.960 
where I played a bit less safe um that
there<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.830> no<00:01:22.979> aggression<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.400> any<00:01:23.610> games

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
there was no aggression from any games

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.749 
there was no aggression from any games
before<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:25.170> playing<00:01:25.380> very<00:01:25.470> safe<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:27.259> I

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
before I was playing very safe so I

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.850 
before I was playing very safe so I
didn't<00:01:29.759> play<00:01:29.909> too<00:01:29.970> safe<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.020> which

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
didn't play too safe and then I which

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.249 
didn't play too safe and then I which
controlled<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.280> bit<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.640> was<00:01:33.030> first<00:01:33.720> small

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.350 
controlled a bit so that was first small
small<00:01:35.250> poke<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.970> was<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.420> bit<00:01:37.259> silly<00:01:37.500> but

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
small poke so that was a bit silly but

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.569 
small poke so that was a bit silly but
yeah<00:01:39.360> I'm<00:01:40.350> not<00:01:40.560> too<00:01:40.650> fond<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.920> pupae<00:01:41.220> anyway<00:01:41.520> so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.010 
her plan a bit cuz i sawy my daughter
guess<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.939> was<00:02:06.090> worried<00:02:06.299> about<00:02:06.360> an<00:02:06.600> all-in<00:02:06.899> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
guess I was worried about an all-in and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.800 
guess I was worried about an all-in and
then<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:08.129> bill<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.970> didn't<00:02:09.239> make<00:02:09.360> too<00:02:09.390> much

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
then my bill just didn't make too much

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330 
then my bill just didn't make too much
sense<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.289> also<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.530> think<00:02:10.619> against<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.129> good

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
sense and also I think against on a good

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.790 
sense and also I think against on a good
idea<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:12.830> big<00:02:13.830> advantage<00:02:14.599> in<00:02:15.599> my<00:02:16.260> games<00:02:16.530> cuz<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
idea I big advantage in my games cuz I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.190 
idea I big advantage in my games cuz I
played<00:02:17.040> him<00:02:17.129> in<00:02:17.250> an<00:02:17.910> arena<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.989> played<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
played him in an arena and I played a

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.440 
played him in an arena and I played a
rather<00:02:19.470> special<00:02:20.040> style<00:02:20.340> there's<00:02:21.060> in<00:02:21.180> some<00:02:21.360> of

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
rather special style there's in some of

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.930 
rather special style there's in some of
the<00:02:21.540> games<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:21.989> think<00:02:22.110> he<00:02:22.319> was<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:23.610> was<00:02:23.730> very

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
the games so I think he was it was very

chance to to see their players play in a
new<00:05:54.360> game<00:05:54.570> so<00:05:54.979> hopefully<00:05:55.979> especially<00:05:56.460> the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
new game so hopefully especially the

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.820

Korean<00:05:56.789> seen<00:05:57.030> hopefully<00:05:57.479> the<00:05:58.289> fan<00:05:58.470> base<00:05:58.620> of

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830

those<00:05:59.300> they<00:06:00.300> start<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.780> sucker<00:06:00.990> one<00:06:01.169> fan<00:06:01.350> base

those they start the sucker one fan base
is<00:06:02.300> like<00:06:03.300> I<00:06:03.510> think<00:06:04.050> this<00:06:04.200> kind<00:06:04.350> of<00:06:04.440> stuff

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
is like I think this kind of stuff

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.379 
is like I think this kind of stuff
health<00:06:04.800> helps<00:06:05.340> them<00:06:05.460> to<00:06:05.610> switch<00:06:05.850> over<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.120> suck

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
health helps them to switch over to suck

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:07.610 
health helps them to switch over to suck
