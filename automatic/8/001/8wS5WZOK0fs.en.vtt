turnip<00:02:54.040> greens<00:02:54.250> are<00:02:54.430> good<00:02:54.459> that<00:02:54.670> way<00:02:54.790> too<00:02:54.870> so

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
turnip greens are good that way too so

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.860 
turnip greens are good that way too so
like<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.079> said<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.319> does<00:02:56.439> well<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.829> cool<00:02:57.459> weather

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
like I said it does well in cool weather

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.690 
like I said it does well in cool weather
but<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.989> does<00:02:59.140> like<00:02:59.349> sunshine<00:02:59.650> partial<00:03:00.519> shade

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
but it does like sunshine partial shade

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.679 
but it does like sunshine partial shade
so<00:03:01.510> mustard<00:03:01.870> has<00:03:02.049> low<00:03:02.409> nutrient<00:03:03.099> requirements

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
so mustard has low nutrient requirements

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:08.550 
so mustard has low nutrient requirements
your<00:03:04.689> triple<00:03:05.379> your<00:03:05.819> nitrogen<00:03:07.379> phosphate<00:03:08.379> and

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
your triple your nitrogen phosphate and

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.000 
your triple your nitrogen phosphate and
potassium<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:10.510> haven't<00:03:11.049> found<00:03:11.650> any

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
potassium and I haven't found any

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.949 
potassium and I haven't found any
particular<00:03:12.640> numbers<00:03:13.090> but<00:03:13.359> whenever<00:03:13.659> i<00:03:13.870> do

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
particular numbers but whenever i do

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.979 
particular numbers but whenever i do
look<00:03:14.319> it<00:03:14.709> just<00:03:14.739> says<00:03:15.280> low<00:03:15.549> requirements<00:03:16.299> so

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
look it just says low requirements so

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.360 
look it just says low requirements so
that's<00:03:17.140> good<00:03:18.690> i<00:03:19.690> know<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.530> sure<00:03:20.680> responds<00:03:21.159> well

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
that's good i know it sure responds well

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.259 
that's good i know it sure responds well
after<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.730> good<00:03:22.409> compost<00:03:23.409> tea<00:03:23.650> feeding<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.730> an

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
after a good compost tea feeding and an

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.500 
after a good compost tea feeding and an
interesting<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.440> probably<00:03:26.920> useless<00:03:27.310> fact<00:03:27.670> or

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
interesting the probably useless fact or

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.410 
interesting the probably useless fact or
tidbit<00:03:29.019> would<00:03:29.769> be<00:03:29.889> that<00:03:30.129> cabbage<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.970> a<00:03:31.030> near

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
tidbit would be that cabbage is a near

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.199 
tidbit would be that cabbage is a near
relative<00:03:31.659> to<00:03:32.079> mustard<00:03:32.409> if<00:03:33.129> you're<00:03:33.459> doing<00:03:33.790> the

the video cut-ins that I'm only planting
one<00:03:45.549> per<00:03:45.730> square<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.900> that<00:03:47.079> was<00:03:47.319> uh<00:03:47.349> because

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
one per square and that was uh because

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.270 
one per square and that was uh because
at<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.519> point<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.939> hadn't<00:03:49.239> quite<00:03:49.389> figured<00:03:49.629> out

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
at that point I hadn't quite figured out

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.099 
at that point I hadn't quite figured out
the<00:03:51.280> best<00:03:51.459> way<00:03:51.730> to<00:03:51.790> lay<00:03:51.970> out<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.599> plants<00:03:52.989> in

the in the Square Foot Gardening system
uh<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:56.620> think<00:03:56.769> since<00:03:57.129> that<00:03:57.280> point<00:03:57.430> I<00:03:57.549> actually

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
uh I think since that point I actually

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.409 
uh I think since that point I actually
went<00:03:58.239> down<00:03:58.359> and<00:03:58.599> bought<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.750> book<00:03:58.989> and<00:04:00.419> figured

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
went down and bought a book and figured

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.809 
went down and bought a book and figured

going to sustain it you need to look at

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.950 
going to sustain it you need to look at
Oh<00:05:15.700> what<00:05:16.700> are<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:16.850> things<00:05:16.940> where<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.810> things

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
going to be waste of time growing stuff

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.040 
going to be waste of time growing stuff
that<00:05:21.620> you<00:05:21.710> won't<00:05:21.920> eat<00:05:22.100> for<00:05:22.340> me<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.480> mustard<00:05:23.750> is

that you won't eat for me the mustard is

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.920 
that you won't eat for me the mustard is
one<00:05:24.230> of<00:05:24.290> those<00:05:24.410> things<00:05:24.590> that<00:05:24.770> will<00:05:25.730> eat<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.150> so

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930

we're<00:05:27.080> going<00:05:27.170> to<00:05:27.260> put<00:05:27.320> I'm<00:05:27.800> going<00:05:27.980> to<00:05:28.070> do<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.280> lot

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
we're going to put I'm going to do a lot

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.660 
we're going to put I'm going to do a lot
of<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:28.790> in<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.030> springs<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:30.650> lot<00:05:31.250> of<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.460> in<00:05:31.550> the

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
of it in the springs a lot of it in the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.590 
of it in the springs a lot of it in the
fall<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.180> then<00:05:32.900> it'll<00:05:33.169> be<00:05:33.230> canned<00:05:33.590> frozen

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
fall and then it'll be canned frozen

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.080 
fall and then it'll be canned frozen
probably<00:05:35.600> can<00:05:35.750> more<00:05:36.110> of<00:05:36.320> it<00:05:36.760> just<00:05:37.760> for<00:05:38.060> the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
probably can more of it just for the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.920 
probably can more of it just for the
simple<00:05:38.450> fact<00:05:38.480> if<00:05:38.840> we<00:05:39.320> lose<00:05:39.919> power<00:05:40.419> I<00:05:41.419> don't

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
simple fact if we lose power I don't

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.050 
simple fact if we lose power I don't
need<00:05:42.080> power<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.710> keep<00:05:42.830> the<00:05:42.980> cans<00:05:43.250> good<00:05:43.580> i'll

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
need power to keep the cans good i'll

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.500 
need power to keep the cans good i'll
probably<00:05:44.240> have<00:05:44.419> a<00:05:44.480> quite<00:05:45.470> a<00:05:45.500> few<00:05:45.710> beds<00:05:45.980> and<00:05:46.510> in

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
probably have a quite a few beds and in

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.330 
probably have a quite a few beds and in
the<00:05:47.690> one<00:05:47.870> designated<00:05:48.169> area<00:05:48.740> where<00:05:48.919> i<00:05:48.950> do<00:05:49.070> a<00:05:49.190> lot

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
the one designated area where i do a lot

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.460 
the one designated area where i do a lot
of<00:05:49.400> a<00:05:49.790> lot<00:05:50.480> of<00:05:50.600> the<00:05:50.660> greens<00:05:50.900> like<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.320> the

of a lot of the greens like that the

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.170 
of a lot of the greens like that the
turnips<00:05:52.390> salads<00:05:53.390> spinach<00:05:54.200> mustard<00:05:55.180> stuff

turnips salads spinach mustard stuff
like<00:05:56.330> that<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:57.050> enough<00:05:57.560> about<00:05:57.820> mustard<00:05:58.820> itself

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
like that so enough about mustard itself

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.570 
like that so enough about mustard itself
for<00:05:59.540> now<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:02.030> whole<00:06:02.210> point<00:06:02.480> is<00:06:03.460> getting<00:06:04.460> down

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
for now the whole point is getting down

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.670 
for now the whole point is getting down
the<00:06:04.790> detail<00:06:05.180> what<00:06:05.419> you<00:06:05.600> do<00:06:05.780> knowing<00:06:06.560> your

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
technology so that you can sustain it so

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.770 
technology so that you can sustain it so
that<00:06:10.310> you<00:06:10.520> can<00:06:10.640> get<00:06:10.790> build<00:06:11.330> yourself<00:06:11.450> up

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
that you can get build yourself up

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.080 
that you can get build yourself up
systems<00:06:12.320> where<00:06:12.500> everything<00:06:12.830> becomes<00:06:13.190> kind<00:06:14.060> of

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
systems where everything becomes kind of

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.510 
systems where everything becomes kind of
streamlined<00:06:14.630> you<00:06:14.780> get<00:06:14.900> a<00:06:16.540> good<00:06:17.540> work<00:06:17.780> flow<00:06:18.520> so

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
streamlined you get a good work flow so

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.980 
streamlined you get a good work flow so
