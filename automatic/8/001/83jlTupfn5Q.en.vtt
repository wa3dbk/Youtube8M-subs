00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.160
 The app we introduce today is good 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.090
 I took a photo 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.469
 It is an application introduction that will process it beautifully 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.469
 Let's process it immediately 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:21.350
 Choose the direction of processing and choose a photo from the camera roll 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.670
 At first from whitening and smooth 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:28.980
 Zooming like this when processing 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:34.120
 The part gets bigger and easier to see 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.520
 Smoothing up makes the skin surface smoother 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.520
 Muse is recommended of about roughly 70 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:49.500
 It is whitening in a beard and it becomes quite unnatural if 200 is too white , so about 20 to about Yamanaka 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.500
 It is recommended 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.930
 The tone can adjust the white balance 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:05.059
 Now all the rehab effects are over 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:09.730
 When you press the right eye comparison to compare after the first before and now after 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.730
 You can compare before and after 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.260
 The next is bear erasion It will come out under the eyes by all means 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.260
 I can erase the bear 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:29.570
 If you choose the size of the arm, the bear disappears just by tracing the bear under the eyes 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.350
 Dozens of times when I thought that I could not disappear 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.549
 When you erase the stack 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.549
 What we heard we will 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.200
 It is complete if we set up the other side 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.000
 Press the upper right comparison again this time 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.000
 Let's compare before and after 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.340
 Hmm 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.550
 The last is science eye processing 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.500
 How large to enlarge 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.080
 Just select the site and then just feed 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.080
 Will grow to a natural size 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.120
 Let's compare and compare 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.120
 Four days 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.450
 Well then all the steps are complete 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.290
 This is what it looks like by comparing the completed drawing of the before and horse's wreck with the top right 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.319
 Yes i feel like this 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.440
 Top photo 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.810
 Car with an app that will process beautifully soon 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.810
