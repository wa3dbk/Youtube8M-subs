select music I'm gonna select the
defaults<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.320> you'll<00:00:22.769> see<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.340> come

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
defaults and you'll see that when I come

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.269 
defaults and you'll see that when I come
in<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.630> controller<00:00:25.080> setup<00:00:25.500> already<00:00:25.859> in

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
in I have a controller setup already in

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.980 
in I have a controller setup already in
this<00:00:26.789> particular<00:00:27.060> case<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.449> setup<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.960> in

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this particular case that setup is in

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.019 
this particular case that setup is in
the<00:00:28.170> lighter<00:00:28.320> Rama<00:00:28.560> controller<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the lighter Rama controller now what I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.550 
the lighter Rama controller now what I
need<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.359> do<00:00:30.480> before<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.900> even<00:00:31.019> set<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.380> any

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
need to do before I even set up any

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.110 
need to do before I even set up any
controllers<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.250> need<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> set<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
controllers is I need to set up the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.630 
controllers is I need to set up the
methods<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:34.020> used<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.500> output<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
methods that can be used for output to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.490 
methods that can be used for output to
those<00:00:35.820> controllers<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.989> we're<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.230> go<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
those controllers so we're gonna go to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.319 
those controllers so we're gonna go to
edit<00:00:38.129> preferences<00:00:39.530> Network<00:00:40.530> preferences<00:00:41.329> now

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
edit preferences Network preferences now

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.500 
edit preferences Network preferences now
the<00:00:42.780> first<00:00:42.989> tab<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.680> lor<00:00:44.160> now<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:45.120> can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the first tab we have is lor now you can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.770 
the first tab we have is lor now you can
run<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.170> lor<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:47.039> dmx<00:00:47.910> network<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
run the lor and dmx network so if you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.470 
run the lor and dmx network so if you
have<00:00:48.989> existing<00:00:49.260> lor<00:00:50.160> networks<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.300> would

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
have existing lor networks you would

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
have existing lor networks you would
normally<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.170> comport<00:00:52.890> here<00:00:53.160> selected

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
normally have a comport here selected

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.600 
normally have a comport here selected
that<00:00:53.820> would<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.420> lor<00:00:55.050> dongle<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.800> you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
that would go to your lor dongle and you

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.150 
that would go to your lor dongle and you
would<00:00:56.760> run<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.120> simultaneously<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.680> if<00:00:58.980> there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
would run it simultaneously as if there

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.369 
would run it simultaneously as if there
are<00:00:59.219> two<00:00:59.399> separate<00:00:59.760> networks<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> just

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
are two separate networks but just

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.860 
are two separate networks but just
different<00:01:01.620> protocols<00:01:02.359> in<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.600> particular

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
different protocols in this particular

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.200 
different protocols in this particular
case<00:01:04.199> I'm<00:01:04.439> not<00:01:04.710> using<00:01:04.920> any<00:01:05.220> lor<00:01:05.700> network<00:01:06.030> so

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
case I'm not using any lor network so

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.130 
case I'm not using any lor network so
I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> go<00:01:06.510> ahead<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> select<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
I'm going to go ahead and select the

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.690 
I'm going to go ahead and select the

here in this picture we can see that we

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.340 
here in this picture we can see that we
have<00:02:23.580> two<00:02:23.820> DMX<00:02:24.270> controllers<00:02:24.840> they're

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
have two DMX controllers they're

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.470 
have two DMX controllers they're
controlled<00:02:25.800> with<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.130> active<00:02:26.580> dongle<00:02:26.970> then

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
controlled with the active dongle then

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.970

two controllers in now an RGB Channel is
three<00:02:34.470> DMX<00:02:35.010> channels<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.730> need<00:02:35.970> red<00:02:36.300> green

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
three DMX channels you need red green

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.380 
three DMX channels you need red green
and<00:02:36.720> blue<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.140> form<00:02:37.470> an<00:02:37.680> RGB<00:02:38.580> Channel<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.240> we're

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
and blue to form an RGB Channel so we're

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.390

going to go ahead and add those now each
of<00:02:41.430> these<00:02:41.640> two<00:02:41.850> controllers<00:02:42.270> here<00:02:42.600> they're

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
of these two controllers here they're

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.250 
of these two controllers here they're
three<00:02:43.770> channels<00:02:44.190> each<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.260> three

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
three channels each and they have three

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.400 
three channels each and they have three
champ<00:02:46.650> three<00:02:47.010> color<00:02:47.420> RGB<00:02:48.420> LEDs<00:02:48.870> hooked<00:02:49.140> up<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
champ three color RGB LEDs hooked up to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.020 
champ three color RGB LEDs hooked up to
them<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.800> we're<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.489> go<00:02:50.610> ahead<00:02:50.820> and<00:02:50.910> say

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
them so we're going to go ahead and say

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.240 
them so we're going to go ahead and say
insert<00:02:51.630> RGB<00:02:52.290> Channel<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:52.890> we're<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.040> gonna

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
insert RGB Channel so we're just gonna

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.820 
insert RGB Channel so we're just gonna
say<00:02:53.430> above<00:02:53.700> here<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.810> we<00:02:55.290> see<00:02:55.590> what<00:02:55.800> appears

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
say above here now we see what appears

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.440 
say above here now we see what appears
to<00:02:56.160> be<00:02:56.220> one<00:02:56.310> Channel<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.030> you'll<00:02:57.120> notice<00:02:57.330> that

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
to be one Channel and you'll notice that

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.210 
to be one Channel and you'll notice that
it<00:02:57.690> differs<00:02:58.020> from<00:02:58.050> normal<00:02:58.590> channels<00:02:59.010> let's

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
it differs from normal channels let's

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.670 
it differs from normal channels let's
say<00:02:59.430> on<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.640> lor<00:03:00.120> controller<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.959> that<00:03:01.500> it's

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
say on a lor controller and that it's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.190 
say on a lor controller and that it's
black<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.340> it's<00:03:02.580> got<00:03:02.760> little<00:03:03.060> red<00:03:03.660> green<00:03:03.900> blue

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
black and it's got little red green blue

off<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.709> left<00:03:04.940> what<00:03:05.940> we're<00:03:06.030> gonna<00:03:06.120> do<00:03:06.300> is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
off to the left what we're gonna do is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.270 
off to the left what we're gonna do is

and<00:03:10.590> assign<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.420> type<00:03:12.420> of<00:03:12.450> network<00:03:12.840> so

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
and assign it the type of network so

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.110 
and assign it the type of network so
we're<00:03:13.440> gonna<00:03:13.530> select<00:03:13.799> the<00:03:14.130> device<00:03:14.340> type<00:03:14.610> DMX

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
we're gonna select the device type DMX

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.000 
we're gonna select the device type DMX
and<00:03:15.299> because<00:03:15.959> they're<00:03:16.110> all<00:03:16.290> together<00:03:16.590> it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and because they're all together it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.740 
and because they're all together it
selects<00:03:17.340> them<00:03:17.519> all<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:17.790> DMX<00:03:18.239> they're<00:03:18.450> all<00:03:18.570> in

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
selects them all as DMX they're all in

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.960 
selects them all as DMX they're all in
the<00:03:18.840> same<00:03:18.870> universe<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.709> now<00:03:20.340> I<00:03:20.370> need<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.790> do

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
the same universe and now I need to do

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.030 
the same universe and now I need to do
is<00:03:21.090> select<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.540> controller<00:03:21.930> address<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.620> one<00:03:23.010> of

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
is select a controller address so one of

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.220 
is select a controller address so one of
these<00:03:23.160> controllers<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.850> 123<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:25.019> I'll<00:03:25.080> just

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
these controllers is 123 so I'll just

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.770 
these controllers is 123 so I'll just
come<00:03:25.410> down<00:03:25.560> here<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.799> 123<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:27.360> can<00:03:27.540> see

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
come down here to 123 and you can see

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.039 
come down here to 123 and you can see
that<00:03:28.049> 123<00:03:28.489> automatically<00:03:29.489> becomes<00:03:29.790> 123<00:03:30.420> 124

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
that 123 automatically becomes 123 124

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.250 
that 123 automatically becomes 123 124
and<00:03:31.380> 125<00:03:32.299> sequentially<00:03:33.299> creating<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.900> RGB

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and 125 sequentially creating the RGB

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.820 
and 125 sequentially creating the RGB
addresses<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.580> we'll<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:35.790> ahead<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.030> click<00:03:36.150> OK

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
addresses so we'll go ahead and click OK

make sure that you do have the lor

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.100 
make sure that you do have the lor
control<00:03:50.040> panel<00:03:50.519> running<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.330> your<00:03:51.660> computer

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
control panel running in your computer

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.009 
control panel running in your computer
and<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.260> it<00:03:52.470> is<00:03:52.590> functional<00:03:53.720> you'll<00:03:54.720> see

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
and that it is functional you'll see

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.900 
and that it is functional you'll see
something<00:03:55.350> that<00:03:55.560> appears<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.760> you

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
something that appears like this and you

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.120 
something that appears like this and you
can<00:03:57.090> see<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.690> listening<00:03:58.560> what<00:03:59.040> is

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
can see that it's listening what is

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.220 
can see that it's listening what is
happening<00:03:59.580> is<00:03:59.730> is<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.180> lor<00:04:00.480> sequencer

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
happening is is that the lor sequencer

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.949 
happening is is that the lor sequencer
is<00:04:01.440> outputting<00:04:02.070> data<00:04:02.100> and<00:04:02.640> then<00:04:03.299> this<00:04:03.510> smaller

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
is outputting data and then this smaller

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.259 
is outputting data and then this smaller
application<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:05.010> listening<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.150> that

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
application is listening to that

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.360 
application is listening to that
application<00:04:06.799> converting<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.100> then

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
application converting it and then

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.840 
application converting it and then
outputting<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.890> acted<00:04:10.890> on<00:04:11.070> board<00:04:11.340> so

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
outputting it to the acted on board so

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.500 
outputting it to the acted on board so
make<00:04:12.390> sure<00:04:12.420> that<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.019> have<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.410> running<00:04:13.769> in

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
make sure that you have this running in

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.820 
make sure that you have this running in
your<00:04:14.659> system<00:04:15.049> trained<00:04:15.290> then<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.590> shows

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
your system trained then it shows

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.250 
your system trained then it shows
enabled<00:04:16.489> with<00:04:16.639> little<00:04:16.880> blue<00:04:17.090> icon<00:04:17.389> not<00:04:18.139> the
