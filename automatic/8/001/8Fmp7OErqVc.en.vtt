00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.680
 Welcome to the Sch roberts 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.120
 the extraordinary art 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.950
 We want a bike on the road 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 what have long been there wood and 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.120
 cobweb 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.260
 beatrice addition was a lifesaver 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.700
 we have the motorcycle also never 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.570
 seen as well as for us it is one 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.060
 premiere 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.449
 Did you want to tell the world ? 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.449
 on road 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.940
 Now I'll tell you how to do it 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.700
 this idea has come 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.980
 At the bikers meeting sat a few buddies 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.590
 and me together and looked at each other 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.900
 passing motorcycles 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.820
 suddenly an old cx 500 came to us 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.590
 over and out of the background that came 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.220
 agree such a thing I have in 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.230
 cellar for years since I came here so 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.880
 a crazy idea 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.400
 in the summer, such a card is not alive 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.810
 profit 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.670
 somehow the whole thing is then 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.800
 oblivion fall 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.539
 until we at a strength an old 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.539
 x650 offered 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.830
 as I said 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.830
 we have never seen the motorcycle 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.460
 let us surprise 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.370
 So people would suspect your motorcycle 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.890
 and that is not an individual case we stand 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.390
 many motorcycles somewhere behind wood in 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.460
 any scales in any 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.160
 cellars really waiting for it 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.030
 to find someone who activates them 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.700
 have found one 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.260
 we dig them out now and leave us 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:41.870
 Surprise what the state on us 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:43.340
 you get going so now we were 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.030
 let's see what's on us 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.030
 get 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 so 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.010
 location 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.780
 Duke we have the good piece 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.780
 Now you can get out again 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.730
 So the first step is to be done 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.900
 the motorcycle picked up 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.030
 Yes 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.640
 has determined that babies the vehicle 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.030
 was now nine years 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.030
 Oh yeah 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.930
 We will live the thing again 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.930
 brought
