mountaineering ski it's light enough for
ascension<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.330> sturdy<00:00:30.330> enough<00:00:30.509> for<00:00:30.890> kind<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
ascension and sturdy enough for kind of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.260

your powder conditions to your variable
conditions<00:01:26.070> snow<00:01:26.369> with<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.149> plumb<00:01:27.390> giving

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
conditions snow with the plumb giving

the the teeth all in the ski gives it a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.260 
the the teeth all in the ski gives it a
lot<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.259> torsional<00:01:31.619> rigidity<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
lot of torsional rigidity and the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
lot of torsional rigidity and the
traditional<00:01:33.689> camber<00:01:34.200> gives<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.859> a<00:01:34.890> lot<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
traditional camber gives it a lot of

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.179 
traditional camber gives it a lot of
energy<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.880> comes<00:01:36.119> back<00:01:37.100> measurements<00:01:38.100> on

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
energy that comes back measurements on

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
energy that comes back measurements on
the<00:01:38.310> ski<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:38.880> you've<00:01:39.179> got<00:01:39.979> 128<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.280> front<00:01:41.810> 94

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the ski here you've got 128 up front 94

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.859 
the ski here you've got 128 up front 94
in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.990> waist<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.409> 117<00:01:44.039> in<00:01:44.219> the<00:01:44.310> tail<00:01:44.569> so<00:01:45.569> with

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
in the waist and 117 in the tail so with

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.690 
in the waist and 117 in the tail so with
94<00:01:46.469> that's<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.039> kind<00:01:47.219> of<00:01:47.280> an<00:01:47.399> all-mountain

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
94 that's really kind of an all-mountain

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.910 
94 that's really kind of an all-mountain
type<00:01:48.090> with<00:01:48.359> with<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> ski<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.710> have

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
type with with the ski you do have

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.010 
type with with the ski you do have
hollow<00:01:50.130> tech<00:01:50.429> in<00:01:50.639> the<00:01:50.700> tip<00:01:50.969> and<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.780> tail

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
hollow tech in the tip and the tail

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.719 
hollow tech in the tip and the tail
which<00:01:52.350> reduces<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.009> swing<00:01:53.249> weight<00:01:53.429> of<00:01:53.609> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
which reduces the swing weight of the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
which reduces the swing weight of the
ski<00:01:54.259> further<00:01:55.259> reducing<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.039> overall<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.609> to

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
ski further reducing the overall way to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.450 
ski further reducing the overall way to
the<00:01:56.819> ski<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:58.200> you're<00:01:58.380> looking<00:01:58.679> for<00:01:58.920> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the ski so if you're looking for you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.110 
the ski so if you're looking for you
know<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.819> ski<00:02:00.209> that<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.600> handle
