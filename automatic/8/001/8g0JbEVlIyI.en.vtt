00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.709 

let<00:00:34.950> me<00:00:35.040> try<00:00:35.250> zooming<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.000> George

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:46.549 

this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.989> about<00:00:40.260> 2.2<00:00:41.160> X<00:00:43.309> 3.0<00:00:44.309> 4.0<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.780> that's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
this is about 2.2 X 3.0 4.0 and that's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.100 
this is about 2.2 X 3.0 4.0 and that's
the<00:00:46.649> max<00:00:46.860> assume<00:00:47.219> right<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> surprisingly

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the max assume right now so surprisingly

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.189 
the max assume right now so surprisingly
in<00:00:49.260> 4k<00:00:49.820> zoom<00:00:50.850> isn't<00:00:51.449> bad<00:00:51.629> considering<00:00:52.050> its

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
in 4k zoom isn't bad considering its

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.470 
in 4k zoom isn't bad considering its
digital<00:00:52.559> zoom<00:00:52.739> which<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> always<00:00:53.190> awful<00:00:53.480> it's

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
digital zoom which is always awful it's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.670 
digital zoom which is always awful it's
pretty<00:00:54.719> impressive<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> videos<00:00:58.350> I'll<00:00:58.559> be

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
pretty impressive so the videos I'll be

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.529 
pretty impressive so the videos I'll be
uploading<00:00:59.129> will<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.520> taking<00:00:59.850> this<00:00:59.969> exact<00:01:00.390> same

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
uploading will be taking this exact same

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.349 
uploading will be taking this exact same
spot<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.050> guys<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.410> see<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.949> their

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
spot so you guys can see them in their

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.520 
spot so you guys can see them in their
original<00:01:03.359> quality<00:01:03.899> compared<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
original quality compared to what it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.780 
original quality compared to what it
looks<00:01:04.650> like<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.830> YouTube<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.280> suppose<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
okay so here's this front camera sample

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.390 
okay so here's this front camera sample
I<00:01:54.049> wanted<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.680> mention<00:01:54.799> about<00:01:54.979> something<00:01:55.369> very

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
I wanted to mention about something very

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.070 
I wanted to mention about something very
quickly<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.880> case<00:01:55.940> anyone's<00:01:56.479> not<00:01:56.600> aware<00:01:56.810> is

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
quickly in case anyone's not aware is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.840 
quickly in case anyone's not aware is
that<00:01:57.590> if<00:01:58.040> you're<00:01:58.159> watching<00:01:58.280> YouTube<00:01:58.700> on<00:01:58.820> a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
that if you're watching YouTube on a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.640 
that if you're watching YouTube on a
computer<00:01:59.330> there's<00:01:59.990> actually<00:02:00.200> an<00:02:00.259> option<00:02:00.409> to

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
computer there's actually an option to

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.330 
computer there's actually an option to
switch<00:02:00.830> over<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.420> 2160p<00:02:02.420> which<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.140> 4k<00:02:03.350> before

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
switch over to 2160p which is 4k before

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.039 
switch over to 2160p which is 4k before
you<00:02:04.430> only<00:02:04.549> had<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.729> cap<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:05.119> like<00:02:05.270> 1080p<00:02:05.780> blonde

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
you only had a cap of like 1080p blonde

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.020 
you only had a cap of like 1080p blonde
computing<00:02:06.440> actually<00:02:06.650> switch<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.030> 2160p

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
computing actually switch it to 2160p

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.900 
computing actually switch it to 2160p
but<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.989> problem<00:02:09.380> is<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:09.979> must<00:02:10.160> have<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.369> 4k

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
but the problem is you must have a 4k

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.850 
but the problem is you must have a 4k
display<00:02:11.090> so<00:02:12.080> if<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.319> don't<00:02:12.470> even<00:02:12.620> have<00:02:12.800> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
display so if you don't even have that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.500 
display so if you don't even have that
you<00:02:13.280> can't<00:02:13.489> get<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.730> full<00:02:13.850> potential<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
you can't get the full potential the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.600 
you can't get the full potential the
rear<00:02:14.840> facing<00:02:15.110> camera<00:02:15.500> what<00:02:16.100> I'm<00:02:16.190> using<00:02:16.340> now<00:02:16.520> is

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
rear facing camera what I'm using now is

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.699 
rear facing camera what I'm using now is
a<00:02:16.670> fun<00:02:16.910> facing<00:02:17.209> camera<00:02:17.510> which<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.780> only<00:02:17.959> 1080p

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
a fun facing camera which is only 1080p

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.090 
a fun facing camera which is only 1080p
anyway<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:20.270> performs<00:02:20.600> okay<00:02:21.100> nothing

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
anyway and it performs okay nothing

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.470 
anyway and it performs okay nothing
special<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.520> I'm<00:02:22.820> not<00:02:22.940> gonna<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.300> much

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
special so I'm not gonna do this much

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.890 
special so I'm not gonna do this much
longer

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
longer

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.310 
longer
um<00:02:24.080> I'm<00:02:24.830> just<00:02:25.040> gonna<00:02:25.130> switch<00:02:25.430> over<00:02:25.730> back<00:02:25.910> to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
um I'm just gonna switch over back to

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
comparison I get between having the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.050 
comparison I get between having the

exactly<00:03:07.600> pitch<00:03:07.870> black<00:03:08.200> with<00:03:08.620> my<00:03:08.710> own<00:03:08.980> eyes<00:03:09.190> I

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
exactly pitch black with my own eyes I

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.120 
exactly pitch black with my own eyes I
can<00:03:09.610> still<00:03:09.850> make<00:03:10.450> out<00:03:10.630> my<00:03:10.780> shed<00:03:11.080> which<00:03:11.800> is<00:03:11.920> only

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
can still make out my shed which is only

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.440 
can still make out my shed which is only
pointing<00:03:12.490> out<00:03:12.610> right<00:03:12.760> now<00:03:12.910> I'm<00:03:13.210> in<00:03:13.360> my

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
backyard I can see the flower pot just

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.090 
backyard I can see the flower pot just
vaguely<00:03:16.690> from<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.620> light<00:03:17.800> being<00:03:18.040> emitted

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
vaguely from the light being emitted

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.190 
vaguely from the light being emitted
from<00:03:18.370> inside<00:03:18.880> my<00:03:19.000> house<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.840> I'm<00:03:19.900> gonna<00:03:20.050> switch

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
from inside my house so I'm gonna switch

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.440 
from inside my house so I'm gonna switch
over<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.500> having<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.250> flash<00:03:21.760> on<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:22.150> guys<00:03:22.270> can

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
over to having the flash on you guys can

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.810 
over to having the flash on you guys can
see<00:03:22.630> how<00:03:22.810> far<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.380> flash<00:03:23.680> range<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.340> okay<00:03:24.730> so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
see how far the flash range it okay so

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.190 
see how far the flash range it okay so
this<00:03:25.030> time<00:03:25.240> you<00:03:25.360> can<00:03:25.480> see<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.720> fence<00:03:25.930> just

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
this time you can see the fence just

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.030 
this time you can see the fence just
vaguely<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.030> left<00:03:28.240> corner<00:03:28.690> I<00:03:29.410> haven't

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
vaguely on the left corner I haven't

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.500 
vaguely on the left corner I haven't
moved<00:03:30.160> from<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.550> spot<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:30.940> mean<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.150> exact

moved from the spot I mean the exact
same<00:03:31.660> spot<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.900> was<00:03:32.020> before<00:03:32.380> this<00:03:32.530> time<00:03:32.710> with

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
same spot I was before this time with

make out the fence I can make out the a
frame<00:03:43.270> of<00:03:43.450> our<00:03:43.570> gazebo<00:03:44.220> there's<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.310> shed<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.850> can

see it on the screen there's a lot of

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.020 
see it on the screen there's a lot of
noise<00:03:47.620> on<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.950> picture<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:48.850> low

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
noise on the picture but it's low

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.750 
noise on the picture but it's low
lighting<00:03:49.620> situations<00:03:50.620> was<00:03:51.100> expected<00:03:51.610> and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
lighting situations was expected and

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.990 
lighting situations was expected and
that's<00:03:52.390> the<00:03:52.510> flower<00:03:52.810> pot<00:03:53.050> home<00:03:53.290> oh<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.460> right

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
that's the flower pot home oh so right

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.260 
that's the flower pot home oh so right
now<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.240> flower<00:03:55.570> pot<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.020> would<00:03:56.170> say<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:57.270> 10

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
now the flower pot I would say is 10

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.820 
now the flower pot I would say is 10
feet<00:03:58.480> away<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:59.760> that<00:04:00.760> section<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.930> gazebo

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
feet away and that section of the gazebo

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.030 
feet away and that section of the gazebo
over<00:04:03.130> there<00:04:03.310> obviously<00:04:04.090> is<00:04:04.210> approximately<00:04:05.040> 12

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
over there obviously is approximately 12

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.520 
over there obviously is approximately 12
to<00:04:06.400> 13<00:04:06.910> feet<00:04:07.090> away<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:07.840> I<00:04:07.870> have<00:04:08.110> to<00:04:08.260> say<00:04:08.410> that

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
to 13 feet away so I have to say that

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.160 
to 13 feet away so I have to say that
the<00:04:08.650> flash<00:04:08.950> on<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.670> galaxy<00:04:10.150> s5<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.570> one<00:04:11.020> of<00:04:11.080> the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
the flash on the galaxy s5 is one of the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.350 
the flash on the galaxy s5 is one of the
best<00:04:11.470> I've<00:04:11.680> seen<00:04:11.710> on<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> smartphone<00:04:12.460> so<00:04:12.850> pretty

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
best I've seen on a smartphone so pretty

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.600 
best I've seen on a smartphone so pretty
impressive<00:04:13.690> okay<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:14.740> this<00:04:14.980> is<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.160> last<00:04:15.310> part

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
impressive okay so this is the last part

impressive okay so this is the last part
of<00:04:15.730> my<00:04:15.790> low<00:04:16.000> lighting<00:04:16.210> test<00:04:16.600> and<00:04:17.020> I<00:04:17.859> know<00:04:17.890> it<00:04:18.400> is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
of my low lighting test and I know it is

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.860 
of my low lighting test and I know it is
a<00:04:18.549> lot<00:04:18.670> of<00:04:18.700> light<00:04:18.940> here<00:04:18.970> for<00:04:19.299> nothing<00:04:19.540> with<00:04:19.750> my

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
a lot of light here for nothing with my
