00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
construction in the building and it's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000 
construction in the building and it's
going<00:00:41.750> to<00:00:41.810> be<00:00:41.900> really<00:00:42.050> allowed<00:00:42.380> unless<00:00:42.740> I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
going to be really allowed unless I

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.260 
going to be really allowed unless I
kitchen<00:00:43.280> in<00:00:43.400> like<00:00:43.550> this<00:00:43.670> tiny<00:00:43.940> little<00:00:44.060> window

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
kitchen in like this tiny little window

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.420 
kitchen in like this tiny little window
where<00:00:44.570> they're<00:00:44.690> obviously<00:00:45.140> not<00:00:45.410> quite<00:00:46.040> set<00:00:46.250> up

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
where they're obviously not quite set up

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.160 
where they're obviously not quite set up
yet<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:46.790> also<00:00:46.910> I<00:00:47.060> think<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.420> put<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.720> kettle<00:00:47.930> on

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
yet and also I think I put the kettle on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.200 
yet and also I think I put the kettle on
for<00:00:48.230> tea<00:00:48.740> so<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.370> should<00:00:49.580> probably<00:00:49.610> do<00:00:50.180> this

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
for tea so I should probably do this

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.020 
for tea so I should probably do this
before<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.230> kettle<00:00:51.800> boils<00:00:52.130> lastly<00:00:52.730> I<00:00:52.910> will

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
before the kettle boils lastly I will

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.630 
before the kettle boils lastly I will
have<00:00:53.750> a<00:00:53.780> chair<00:00:54.260> it<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:54.710> very<00:00:54.860> awkward<00:00:55.100> standing
