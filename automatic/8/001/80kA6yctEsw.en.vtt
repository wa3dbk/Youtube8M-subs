few other of these characters now what I

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.750 
few other of these characters now what I
like<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.590> said<00:03:29.860> what<00:03:30.130> when<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.310> think<00:03:30.580> of<00:03:30.640> the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
like I said what when I think of the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.790 
like I said what when I think of the
lost<00:03:30.970> MC<00:03:31.360> I<00:03:31.390> think<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:31.900> these<00:03:32.050> guys<00:03:32.320> now<00:03:32.740> the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
lost MC I think of these guys now the

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.580 
lost MC I think of these guys now the
lost<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.700> I<00:03:33.940> guess<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.810> could<00:03:34.930> consider<00:03:35.320> that

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
lost is I guess you could consider that

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.470 
lost is I guess you could consider that
their<00:03:35.830> fall<00:03:36.190> because<00:03:36.700> at<00:03:36.910> the<00:03:37.030> end<00:03:37.240> and<00:03:37.450> I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
their fall because at the end and I

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.820 
their fall because at the end and I
don't<00:03:37.540> really<00:03:37.780> want<00:03:37.990> to<00:03:38.050> spoil<00:03:38.320> anything<00:03:38.440> if

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
don't really want to spoil anything if

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.070 
don't really want to spoil anything if
you<00:03:38.890> guys<00:03:39.010> haven't<00:03:39.280> played<00:03:39.520> GTA<00:03:39.880> 4<00:03:40.210> GTA<00:03:40.630> 5<00:03:40.930> and

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
that storyline you should because that's

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.060

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
up a little bit and then they just go

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.949 
up a little bit and then they just go

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.469 
these members from the the lost MC in
GTA<00:04:23.590> 5<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:24.160> this<00:04:24.340> inner<00:04:24.520> circle<00:04:24.820> like<00:04:25.240> I<00:04:25.270> said

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
GTA 5 that this inner circle like I said

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.220 
GTA 5 that this inner circle like I said
they<00:04:25.570> get<00:04:25.660> taken<00:04:25.840> out

they get taken out

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.000 
they get taken out
but<00:04:26.580> overall<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.700> would<00:04:28.060> say<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.480> the<00:04:29.440> lost<00:04:29.650> MC
