last kind of setup video is this mic and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.339 
last kind of setup video is this mic and
then<00:04:36.159> the<00:04:36.340> audio<00:04:36.699> interface<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.539> i<00:04:37.569> have<00:04:37.780> an<00:04:37.930> 18

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
then the audio interface so i have an 18

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.279 
then the audio interface so i have an 18
20<00:04:38.530> 35<00:04:39.069> so<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.729> is<00:04:39.819> not<00:04:39.909> the<00:04:40.030> 18<00:04:40.389> 20<00:04:40.599> 20<00:04:40.900> they
