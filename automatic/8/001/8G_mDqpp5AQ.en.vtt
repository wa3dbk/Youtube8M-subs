00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.920 
them very much now I have to do is find
a<00:00:02.100> clue<00:00:02.399> which<00:00:02.639> is<00:00:02.760> quite<00:00:05.150> obscure<00:00:06.150> really<00:00:06.779> i

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
a clue which is quite obscure really i

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.570 
a clue which is quite obscure really i
also<00:00:07.319> need<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.589> go<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.890> second<00:00:08.280> floor<00:00:08.370> is

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
also need to go to the second floor is

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.360 
also need to go to the second floor is
this<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.910> secret<00:00:09.120> library<00:00:09.950> i'm<00:00:10.950> assuming

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
this the secret library i'm assuming

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.160 
this the secret library i'm assuming
that<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.179> secret<00:00:12.389> library<00:00:12.660> so<00:00:12.960> if<00:00:13.080> i

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
that this is the secret library so if i

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.630 
that this is the secret library so if i
go<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> second<00:00:13.950> floor<00:00:15.619> liquid<00:00:16.619> all<00:00:19.640> i'm

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
go to the second floor liquid all i'm

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.830 
go to the second floor liquid all i'm
not<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> go<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.300> just<00:00:21.600> yet<00:00:21.720> though

not going to go in there just yet though
let's<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.109> where<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.260> goes<00:00:25.350> let's<00:00:25.890> see

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
let's just see where it goes let's see

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.009 
let's just see where it goes let's see
where<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.279> goes<00:00:27.019> no<00:00:29.630> that's<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> way<00:00:30.869> out

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
where it goes no that's the way out

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.380 
where it goes no that's the way out
that's<00:00:31.650> good<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> need<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.210> will

know<00:01:41.040> recommend<00:01:41.670> further<00:01:41.880> study<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.509> builders

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
know recommend further study so builders

cups<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.829> par<00:01:44.159> also<00:01:44.820> might<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.390> well

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
cups one that par also might be one well

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.010 
cups one that par also might be one well
probably<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> we've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.579> two<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> them

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
probably is so we've got two of them

00:01:50.020 --> 00:02:03.990 
probably is so we've got two of them
I<00:01:59.939> find<00:02:00.939> this<00:02:01.060> map<00:02:02.520> should<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.729> map

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
I find this map should be a map

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.209 
I find this map should be a map
somewhere<00:02:04.329> I<00:02:04.539> want<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.079> map<00:02:05.319> well<00:02:05.890> that's<00:02:06.039> been

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
somewhere I want to map well that's been
