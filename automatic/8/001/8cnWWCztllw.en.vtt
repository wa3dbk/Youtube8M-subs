evoke<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.930> gracefulness<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.890> nature<00:01:56.840> that's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
evoke the gracefulness of nature that's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.289 
evoke the gracefulness of nature that's
around<00:01:58.170> us<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.710> when<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> build<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.549> pieces<00:02:00.149> I

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
around us so when I build my pieces I

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.499 
around us so when I build my pieces I
want<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.020> grace<00:02:02.149> included<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.299> don't

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
want it to be a crashing chaotic machine

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.070 
want it to be a crashing chaotic machine
I<00:02:08.160> wanted<00:02:08.489> to

around us and of course the birds the
mysterious<00:02:17.110> how<00:02:18.100> they<00:02:18.310> fly<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.660> when<00:02:20.410> I

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
mysterious how they fly and so when I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.990 
mysterious how they fly and so when I
create<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> piece<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.720> simulates<00:02:23.500> flight

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
create a piece and it simulates flight
