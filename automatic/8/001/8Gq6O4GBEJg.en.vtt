you'll be fighting him right away his
attack<00:02:16.770> patterns<00:02:17.190> are<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.640> unpredictable<00:02:18.090> -

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
attack patterns are so unpredictable -

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.290 
attack patterns are so unpredictable -
it'll<00:02:19.170> swim<00:02:19.500> from<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:19.770> side<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.610> then<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
it'll swim from one side and then to the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.930 
it'll swim from one side and then to the
other<00:02:21.680> yeah<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.069> he's<00:02:23.280> not<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:23.610> hard<00:02:23.760> to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
other yeah so he's not all that hard to

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.420 
other yeah so he's not all that hard to
figure<00:02:24.150> out<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.690> avoid<00:02:25.050> but<00:02:25.770> your<00:02:25.890> Spears<00:02:26.160> take

expensive<00:03:21.650> for<00:03:21.770> every<00:03:22.010> increase<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.550> get<00:03:22.760> you

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
expensive for every increase you get you

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.720 
expensive for every increase you get you
can<00:03:23.900> reach<00:03:24.080> a<00:03:24.230> maximum<00:03:24.410> power<00:03:24.890> level<00:03:25.310> of<00:03:25.460> nine

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
but you don't really even need half of

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.470 
but you don't really even need half of
that<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.770> kill<00:03:27.980> Jaws<00:03:28.310> it's<00:03:28.670> just<00:03:28.940> easier<00:03:29.330> as

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480

all it takes is one hit and you're dead
you<00:04:14.480> get<00:04:14.600> three<00:04:14.840> lives<00:04:15.080> but<00:04:15.440> each<00:04:15.709> time<00:04:15.890> you

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
you get three lives but each time you

so risking a life to chase the shell

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.560 
so risking a life to chase the shell
isn't<00:04:25.130> really<00:04:25.280> worth<00:04:25.490> it<00:04:25.700> especially<00:04:26.030> since

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
isn't really worth it especially since

isn't really worth it especially since

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
and he'll swim all over the place so you

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.370 
and he'll swim all over the place so you
have<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.550> get<00:05:19.699> the<00:05:19.820> timing<00:05:20.060> right<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.630> then

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
have to get the timing right and then

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.600 
have to get the timing right and then
when<00:05:21.500> he's<00:05:21.590> spinning<00:05:21.919> around<00:05:22.039> you<00:05:22.340> have<00:05:22.490> to

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
when he's spinning around you have to

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.100 
when he's spinning around you have to
make<00:05:22.759> sure<00:05:22.789> that<00:05:23.030> you<00:05:23.240> spear<00:05:23.570> him<00:05:23.750> while<00:05:23.960> the
