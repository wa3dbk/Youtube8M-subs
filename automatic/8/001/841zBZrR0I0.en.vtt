00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.879
 I read that nice kitchen idea 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.609
 today's recipe is caramel panna cotta 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.640
 Crown ketchup ingredients for four people are 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.250
 half a liter of fresh cream 120 grams of sugar 10 grams of isinglass 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.859
 mendel vanilla pod 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.919
 100 ml of caramel 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.919
 mica the preparation pour the milk into a saucepan 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.390
 digiamolo w 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.400
 not even the vanilla cut in half and from which road in drawings 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.210
 you like the pod too 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.080
 place the saucepan on the stove 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.720
 and let us weld photo sandals a general not lesson 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 in the meantime, I make the fish paste 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.930
 we have completely covered it with cold water 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 this to make it soften 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.080
 the incest takes ten minutes 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.830
 notes in the thesis is triggered well if the sugar has melted we can 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.830
 add the isinglass which in the meantime has softened 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.710
 let's mince that of a compound day 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.480
 then keep stirring 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.480
 I'm going to melt completely 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 so at this point we can tax everything 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.550
 now we can fill the exchanges that can be instant and disposable in 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.550
 aluminum to me the silicone molds as in this case 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.640
 to facilitate this operation I preferred to put the mixture in one 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 carafe 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.210
 poppies you have instant we put the panna cotta firm in the fridge 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.990
 it will take about 3 4 hours to be ready 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.540
 pedal prepare also the day before 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.149
 don't make the panna cotta and it is solidified well we can pass the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.429
 atheist service sites 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.469
 therefore to shape it well from the molds he engraves hook with a small knife around the 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.549
 board 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.289
 in we submerge partially in water to warm 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.909
 from teramo a few seconds 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.009
 but we remain on the plate 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.439
 this when we can decorate it if we want that we also add some 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 fruit 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.769
 a few mint leaves 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.769
 and caramel 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.709
 and for comaita lol but if not dispenser 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.689
 there is a dusting of with will play hair 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.159
 I wasn't born ready 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.239
