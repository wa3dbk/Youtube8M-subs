three-in-one cleanser so that means it's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.090

a<00:00:36.899> toner<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.530> don't<00:00:37.739> need<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> toner<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
a toner you don't need a toner but I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.069

just<00:00:41.910> love<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> because<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:45.079> have

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just love this because it's really have

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.500 
just love this because it's really have
one<00:00:46.379> bottle<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.879> really<00:00:48.090> helped<00:00:48.329> clear

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
one bottle like it's really helped clear

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.889 
one bottle like it's really helped clear
up<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.840> skin<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:50.730> made<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.120> really<00:00:51.510> smooth

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
up my skin it's made it really smooth

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.700 
up my skin it's made it really smooth
because<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> has<00:00:53.600> what<00:00:54.600> does<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.140> 2%

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.740 
because it has what does I think it's 2%
salicylic<00:00:55.949> acid<00:00:57.320> now<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.739> also<00:00:59.750> 100%

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
salicylic acid now this is also 100%

fragrance free and it's non comedogenic

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
fragrance free and it's non comedogenic
which<00:01:05.040> means<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> doesn't<00:01:05.549> won't<00:01:06.210> clog<00:01:06.479> your

thought honestly if you like any other
drugstore<00:01:47.310> toner<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:48.360> I've<00:01:48.479> tried<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.899> has

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
drugstore toner that I've tried that has

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.359 
drugstore toner that I've tried that has
2%<00:01:49.680> salicylic<00:01:49.950> acid<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.860> this<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:52.920> just
