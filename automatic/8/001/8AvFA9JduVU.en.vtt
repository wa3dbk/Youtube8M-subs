this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.950> flat<00:00:05.190> for<00:00:05.339> me<00:00:05.490> here<00:00:05.609> um<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.629> that's

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
this is flat for me here um and that's

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.410 
this is flat for me here um and that's
an<00:00:07.529> electric<00:00:07.830> central<00:00:08.760> heating<00:00:08.940> water

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
an electric central heating water

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.629 
an electric central heating water
it's<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.110> white<00:00:10.320> system<00:00:10.769> boiler<00:00:11.130> in<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.519> we've

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
it's a white system boiler in that we've

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.089 
it's a white system boiler in that we've
still<00:00:11.820> got<00:00:12.000> my<00:00:12.179> neighbors<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.920> water

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
still got my neighbors and it's a water

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.529 
still got my neighbors and it's a water
the<00:00:14.370> same<00:00:14.599> as<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.660> gas<00:00:15.980> or<00:00:16.980> an<00:00:17.460> old<00:00:17.609> boiler<00:00:17.970> or

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
the same as a gas or an old boiler or

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.620 
the same as a gas or an old boiler or
even<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.930> sunny<00:00:19.680> fuel<00:00:19.949> wood<00:00:20.250> burner<00:00:20.630> but

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
even a sunny fuel wood burner but

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870 
even a sunny fuel wood burner but
basically<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.170> uses<00:00:22.560> elements<00:00:23.070> I'd<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
basically it uses elements I'd like to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.140 
basically it uses elements I'd like to
show<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.300> boiler<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> one<00:00:25.320> here<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.609> if

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
show you this boiler is one here and if

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.250 
show you this boiler is one here and if
I<00:00:27.300> bring<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.599> into<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.900> there

splitting this flat for a while and been
working<00:00:42.899> fine<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.680> good<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.910> can<00:00:45.030> see

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
working fine really good as you can see

working fine really good as you can see
there's<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> flow<00:00:45.600> comes<00:00:45.899> off<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> top<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.469> it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
there's the flow comes off the top of it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590 
there's the flow comes off the top of it
there<00:00:46.800> it's<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.399> two<00:00:47.550> simple<00:00:47.969> pipes<00:00:48.270> one

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
there it's just two simple pipes one

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.049 
there it's just two simple pipes one
there<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.469> return<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.829> comes<00:00:50.280> into<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
there and the return that comes into the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.760 
there and the return that comes into the
bottom<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> boiler<00:00:51.750> there<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.649> can

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
bottom of the boiler there and you can

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.770 
bottom of the boiler there and you can
see<00:00:52.860> already<00:00:52.980> associated<00:00:53.489> plumbing<00:00:54.059> that's

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
see already associated plumbing that's

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610 
see already associated plumbing that's
been<00:00:55.050> piped<00:00:55.410> into<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.600> save<00:00:57.989> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
been piped into it and I can I save it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.619 
been piped into it and I can I save it
for<00:00:58.800> experience<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.489> been<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.059> six

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
for experience it's been in for six

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.619 
for experience it's been in for six
years<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.230> proved<00:01:02.100> flawless<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.480> always

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
years it's proved flawless it always

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.929 
years it's proved flawless it always
goes<00:01:03.960> obviously<00:01:04.260> not<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> cheap<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.790> run

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
goes obviously not that cheap to run

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.500 
goes obviously not that cheap to run
because<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.830> obviously<00:01:07.830> electric<00:01:08.729> beneath

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
because it is obviously electric beneath

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.030 
because it is obviously electric beneath
are<00:01:09.689> there's<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> wet<00:01:10.080> radiators<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.950> see

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
are there's a wet radiators you can see

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
are there's a wet radiators you can see
all<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> what<00:01:12.119> we<00:01:12.240> call<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> wet<00:01:12.689> system<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
all the what we call a wet system on the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.460 
all the what we call a wet system on the
radiators<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.780> say<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:15.930> little<00:01:16.080> boiler

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
radiators and say this little boiler

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.590 
radiators and say this little boiler
this<00:01:16.590> does<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> job<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:18.060> handy<00:01:18.330> if

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this does the job so it's handy if

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.109 
this does the job so it's handy if
you've<00:01:18.720> got<00:01:18.869> no<00:01:19.110> gas<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.700> don't<00:01:20.880> like

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
you've got no gas and if you don't like

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.280 
you've got no gas and if you don't like
oil<00:01:21.799> always<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:23.130> expensive<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.790> guess<00:01:24.290> this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
oil always just expensive I guess this

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.090 
oil always just expensive I guess this
thing<00:01:25.590> works

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
thing works

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.670 
thing works
I<00:01:26.189> mean<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.670> flats<00:01:26.880> got<00:01:27.180> y'all<00:01:27.720> behind<00:01:28.259> me<00:01:28.409> or

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
I mean it's flats got y'all behind me or

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.710 
I mean it's flats got y'all behind me or
anyway<00:01:29.009> that's<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> slot<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.540> old

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
anyway that's got a slot for the old

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.590 
anyway that's got a slot for the old
come<00:01:30.990> tab<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.340> therefore<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.420> good

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
come tab so therefore this is a good

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080 
come tab so therefore this is a good
idea<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> rented<00:01:34.829> property<00:01:35.090> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
idea for this is a rented property and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
idea for this is a rented property and
they<00:01:36.240> can<00:01:36.420> use<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.780> as<00:01:36.960> much<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.290> little<00:01:37.770> as

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they can use it as much as little as

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.370 
they can use it as much as little as
they<00:01:37.950> want<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.490> obviously<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.900> does<00:01:40.140> cost

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
they want but obviously it does cost

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.550 
they want but obviously it does cost
more<00:01:40.950> money<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.369> run<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.200> overall<00:01:43.200> from

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
more money to run but overall from

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.460 
more money to run but overall from
reliably<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.460> can<00:01:44.670> say<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.810> elements<00:01:46.229> can<00:01:46.439> be

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
reliably I can say the elements can be

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.219 
reliably I can say the elements can be
changed<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.159> go<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.820> yep<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:49.020> been<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
changed if they go and yep it's been a

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 
changed if they go and yep it's been a
top<00:01:49.710> class<00:01:49.920> system<00:01:50.430> Masaya<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:51.210> trying<00:01:51.509> code
