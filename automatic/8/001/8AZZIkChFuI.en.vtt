00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
down the road

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.430 
down the road
and<00:02:15.420> many<00:02:16.420> of<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.630> players<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.170> played

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
and many of the players that I played

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.830

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
I don't feel that that's a really a

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.870 
I don't feel that that's a really a
measure<00:02:46.300> one<00:02:46.720> success<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.470> all<00:02:48.190> terms<00:02:48.610> of
