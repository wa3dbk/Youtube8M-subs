that we all have a purpose some people

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.470 
that we all have a purpose some people
you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.680> say<00:02:23.890> their<00:02:24.070> purpose<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.670> smaller<00:02:25.030> or

you can say their purpose is smaller or
bigger<00:02:26.470> than<00:02:26.770> others<00:02:27.100> but<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.270> purpose<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.840> a

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
bigger than others but a purpose is a

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.710 
bigger than others but a purpose is a
purpose<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.560> mean<00:02:30.550> an<00:02:30.730> eraser<00:02:31.090> has<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.300> purpose

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
purpose I mean an eraser has a purpose

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.380 
purpose I mean an eraser has a purpose
and<00:02:31.960> people<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:32.740> oh<00:02:33.040> well<00:02:33.520> that's<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.000> small

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
and people think oh well that's so small

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.510 
and people think oh well that's so small
but<00:02:34.780> really<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.410> try<00:02:35.620> writing<00:02:36.100> with<00:02:36.250> a<00:02:36.280> pencil

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
but really you try writing with a pencil

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.040 
but really you try writing with a pencil
and<00:02:36.820> then<00:02:36.970> when<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.210> mess<00:02:37.390> up<00:02:37.420> tell<00:02:37.810> me<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
and then when you mess up tell me that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.380 
and then when you mess up tell me that
small<00:02:38.260> again<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.710> think<00:02:39.220> everybody<00:02:39.910> just<00:02:40.180> has

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
small again I think everybody just has

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.380 
small again I think everybody just has
different<00:02:40.810> roles<00:02:41.350> for<00:02:41.560> different<00:02:41.770> purposes

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
different roles for different purposes

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.270 
different roles for different purposes
so<00:02:43.390> let's<00:02:43.570> just<00:02:43.750> take<00:02:43.930> my<00:02:44.200> purpose<00:02:44.650> want<00:02:45.040> one

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
so let's just take my purpose want one

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.330 
so let's just take my purpose want one
of<00:02:45.400> my<00:02:45.520> purposes<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.300> example<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.980> believe

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
of my purposes for example is I believe

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.190 
of my purposes for example is I believe
that<00:02:48.370> I<00:02:48.610> have<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> purpose<00:02:49.270> for<00:02:49.630> watching
