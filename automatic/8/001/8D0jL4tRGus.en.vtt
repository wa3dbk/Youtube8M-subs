00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
that and then we have Billy star beam

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.420 
that and then we have Billy star beam
it's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.140> pretty<00:01:28.320> cool<00:01:28.560> name<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.189> guy<00:01:29.310> I

it's a pretty cool name for this guy I

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.660

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
think there's the front and there's the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.789 
think there's the front and there's the
back<00:01:37.220> he's<00:01:38.220> also<00:01:38.400> got<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:38.970> faces<00:01:39.500> there's<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
one face and he shut the mask on on this

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.830 
one face and he shut the mask on on this
face<00:01:47.750> and<00:01:49.640> last<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.000> certainly<00:01:51.180> lock

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
face and last but certainly lock

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.889 
face and last but certainly lock
certainly<00:01:52.649> not<00:01:53.009> least<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.700> his<00:01:54.450> robot

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
certainly not least is his robot

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.760 
certainly not least is his robot
sidekick<00:01:55.340> which<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> really<00:01:56.850> cool<00:01:57.000> he<00:01:57.240> has<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
sidekick which is really cool he has a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.830 
sidekick which is really cool he has a
extremely<00:01:58.770> unique<00:01:59.250> headpiece<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.719> i

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
extremely unique headpiece there which i

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.929 
extremely unique headpiece there which i
think<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.110> really<00:02:01.259> cool<00:02:01.619> he's<00:02:02.189> also<00:02:02.369> got<00:02:02.700> these

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
think is really cool he's also got these

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.569 
think is really cool he's also got these
energy<00:02:03.600> blades<00:02:03.899> which<00:02:04.890> i<00:02:05.040> think<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.369> also

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
energy blades which i think are also

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.719 
energy blades which i think are also
very<00:02:06.030> cool<00:02:06.299> i<00:02:06.829> like<00:02:07.829> these<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.069> lot

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
very cool i like these a lot

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.040 
very cool i like these a lot
I<00:02:09.410> hope<00:02:10.410> Lego<00:02:10.770> makes<00:02:11.069> more<00:02:11.280> pieces<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:12.000> this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
I hope Lego makes more pieces like this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.020 
I hope Lego makes more pieces like this
in<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.560> future<00:02:13.890> more<00:02:14.130> weapons<00:02:14.490> like<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.850> and

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
in the future more weapons like this and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
in the future more weapons like this and
everything<00:02:15.330> because<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.630> think<00:02:15.780> they're

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
everything because I think they're

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.380 
everything because I think they're
awesome

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
awesome

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.470 
awesome
he's<00:02:18.390> also<00:02:18.600> got<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> rocket<00:02:20.580> pack<00:02:21.000> they're

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
he's also got like a rocket pack they're

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.380 
he's also got like a rocket pack they're
on<00:02:21.840> his<00:02:21.990> back<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.590> guess<00:02:23.460> for<00:02:23.670> him<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:23.880> fly<00:02:24.030> with

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
on his back I guess for him to fly with

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.950 
on his back I guess for him to fly with
I<00:02:24.630> would<00:02:24.870> assume<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:27.000> anyway<00:02:27.240> those<00:02:27.450> are<00:02:27.660> your

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
I would assume so anyway those are your

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.460 
I would assume so anyway those are your
minifigures<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:30.680> then<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:33.110> Billy<00:02:34.110> star

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
minifigures and then we have Billy star

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.360 
eyes out and then you can actually put
your<00:05:26.520> musky<00:05:27.150> toyed<00:05:27.389> in<00:05:27.629> right<00:05:28.229> there<00:05:28.469> kind<00:05:29.310> of

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
your musky toyed in right there kind of

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:37.029 
your musky toyed in right there kind of
fly<00:05:29.639> this<00:05:29.699> I<00:05:30.120> guess<00:05:30.330> I<00:05:31.550> close<00:05:32.550> back<00:05:32.819> like<00:05:33.000> that

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.159 

and<00:05:38.039> you've<00:05:38.250> also<00:05:38.399> got<00:05:38.669> the<00:05:38.819> wings<00:05:39.449> right<00:05:39.779> here

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
and you've also got the wings right here

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.619 
and you've also got the wings right here
that<00:05:40.860> are<00:05:41.099> adjustable<00:05:41.729> you<00:05:41.939> can<00:05:42.120> move<00:05:42.389> them

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:42.629 
that are adjustable you can move them

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:45.469 
that are adjustable you can move them
like<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:43.319> and<00:05:43.620> you<00:05:44.279> can<00:05:44.430> also<00:05:44.460> fold<00:05:45.270> them

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
like that and you can also fold them

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.129 
like that and you can also fold them
back<00:05:45.509> or<00:05:46.639> you<00:05:47.639> know<00:05:47.729> adjust<00:05:48.089> them<00:05:48.330> however<00:05:48.960> you

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
back or you know adjust them however you

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.499 
back or you know adjust them however you
want<00:05:49.349> to<00:05:49.849> so<00:05:50.849> this<00:05:51.029> is<00:05:51.089> a<00:05:51.240> pretty<00:05:51.659> neat<00:05:51.990> set<00:05:52.409> I

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
want to so this is a pretty neat set I

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:57.200 
want to so this is a pretty neat set I
think<00:05:54.509> it's<00:05:54.839> definitely<00:05:55.139> worth<00:05:55.529> the<00:05:55.740> value

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
think it's definitely worth the value

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.749 
think it's definitely worth the value
besides<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.349> bug<00:05:58.589> obliterator<00:05:59.339> I<00:05:59.460> would

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
besides the bug obliterator I would

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.779 
besides the bug obliterator I would
probably<00:06:00.029> say<00:06:00.719> this<00:06:00.930> is<00:06:01.080> my<00:06:01.580> second<00:06:02.580> favorite

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
probably say this is my second favorite

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.929 
probably say this is my second favorite
of<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.449> galaxy<00:06:03.870> squad<00:06:04.050> sets<00:06:04.520> if<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.669> saw<00:06:05.819> my
