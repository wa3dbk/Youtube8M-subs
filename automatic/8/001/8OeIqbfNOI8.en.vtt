commented on the other Queens video that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.419 
commented on the other Queens video that
they<00:01:07.109> didn't<00:01:07.380> they<00:01:07.530> hadn't<00:01:08.100> heard<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:08.429 
they didn't they hadn't heard of a

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.310 
they didn't they hadn't heard of a
quince<00:01:08.670> tree<00:01:08.850> before<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.810> bizarre<00:01:10.289> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
quince tree before which is bizarre to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.719 
quince tree before which is bizarre to
me<00:01:10.619> because<00:01:10.799> I've<00:01:10.950> kind<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.219> grown<00:01:11.340> up<00:01:11.429> with

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
me because I've kind of grown up with

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.450 
me because I've kind of grown up with
them<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.179> I've<00:01:12.719> always<00:01:13.049> had<00:01:13.170> them<00:01:13.320> around<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
them so I've always had them around but

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.889 
them so I've always had them around but
I<00:01:14.490> guess<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.820> stands<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> reason<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.749> this

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
I guess it stands to reason like this

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.480 
I guess it stands to reason like this
heaps<00:01:16.319> of<00:01:16.499> different<00:01:16.590> fruits<00:01:17.039> and<00:01:17.310> whatever

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
heaps of different fruits and whatever

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.209 
heaps of different fruits and whatever
at<00:01:17.789> different<00:01:18.090> countries<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.749> just

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
at different countries that you just

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.440 
at different countries that you just
don't<00:01:20.219> aren't<00:01:20.579> aware<00:01:20.789> of<00:01:20.850> they're<00:01:21.149> not<00:01:21.179> grown

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
don't aren't aware of they're not grown

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.779 
don't aren't aware of they're not grown
in<00:01:21.479> another<00:01:21.749> country<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.399> this<00:01:23.399> is<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.670> good

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
in another country so this is the good
