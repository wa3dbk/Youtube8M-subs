think it sounds cool and the lightning

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.510 
think it sounds cool and the lightning
rounds<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> crazy<00:01:37.320> once<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.829> gets<00:01:37.979> firing<00:01:38.400> if

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
rounds is crazy once it gets firing if

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.999 
rounds is crazy once it gets firing if
you<00:01:38.610> hold<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> trigger<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.360> too<00:01:39.659> long

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
you hold down the trigger for too long

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.649 
you hold down the trigger for too long
makes<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.130> almost<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.729> useful<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.360> fire

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
makes it almost like not useful to fire

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.530 
makes it almost like not useful to fire
that<00:01:42.869> fast<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.649> still<00:01:43.950> very<00:01:44.820> very<00:01:45.240> cool
