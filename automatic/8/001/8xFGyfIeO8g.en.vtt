00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
is why i use this because it has a

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.740 
is why i use this because it has a
little<00:02:39.920> bit<00:02:40.100> of<00:02:40.160> salicylic<00:02:40.610> acid<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.240> here<00:02:41.540> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
little bit of salicylic acid in here and

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.440 
little bit of salicylic acid in here and

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
because of the salicylic acid it kind of

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.110 
because of the salicylic acid it kind of
helps<00:02:44.810> prevent<00:02:45.410> me<00:02:45.710> from<00:02:45.740> breaking<00:02:46.340> out<00:02:46.700> and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
helps prevent me from breaking out and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.900 
helps prevent me from breaking out and

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
dumb in hydrogen peroxide I know right

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.870 
dumb in hydrogen peroxide I know right
if<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:55.100> are<00:03:55.660> young<00:03:57.580> get<00:03:58.580> your<00:03:58.700> parents

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
telling you what's worked out for me

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.180 
telling you what's worked out for me
like<00:04:08.570> I<00:04:08.840> have<00:04:09.050> tried<00:04:09.380> a<00:04:09.440> whole<00:04:09.860> bunch<00:04:10.070> of<00:04:10.130> stuff

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
like I have tried a whole bunch of stuff

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.420 
like I have tried a whole bunch of stuff
and<00:04:11.950> this<00:04:12.950> is<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.340> cheapest<00:04:13.850> and<00:04:14.180> the<00:04:14.959> best

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
and this is the cheapest and the best

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.340 
and this is the cheapest and the best
the<00:04:16.430> best<00:04:16.669> this<00:04:17.630> is<00:04:18.459> volume<00:04:19.459> 10<00:04:19.970> it's<00:04:20.350> three

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
the best this is volume 10 it's three

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.110 
the best this is volume 10 it's three
percent<00:04:21.770> now<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.430> thing<00:04:22.520> about<00:04:22.730> hydrogen

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
percent now the thing about hydrogen

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.960 
percent now the thing about hydrogen
peroxide<00:04:23.620> three<00:04:24.620> percent<00:04:25.010> means<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.880> is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
peroxide three percent means that is

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.330 
peroxide three percent means that is
mostly<00:04:26.270> water<00:04:26.410> so<00:04:27.410> it's<00:04:27.740> not<00:04:27.919> that<00:04:27.980> dangerous

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
mostly water so it's not that dangerous

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.900 
mostly water so it's not that dangerous
don't<00:04:29.000> go<00:04:29.150> drinking<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.910> hydrogen

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
don't go drinking it and hydrogen

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.430 
don't go drinking it and hydrogen
peroxide<00:04:32.360> is<00:04:32.480> exposed<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.110> air<00:04:33.230> it

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
peroxide is exposed to the air it

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.680 
peroxide is exposed to the air it
creates<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.860> bright<00:04:34.070> product<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.669> water<00:04:35.360> and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
creates a bright product of water and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.440 
creates a bright product of water and
oxygen<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.410> water<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:37.190> oxygen<00:04:37.280> are<00:04:37.729> already

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
oxygen and water and oxygen are already

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.969 
oxygen and water and oxygen are already
naturally<00:04:38.600> occurring<00:04:39.169> in<00:04:39.290> our<00:04:39.380> bodies<00:04:39.740> so

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
naturally occurring in our bodies so

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:40.839 
naturally occurring in our bodies so
it's<00:04:40.100> not<00:04:40.250> harmful

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
it's not harmful

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.809 
it's not harmful
for<00:04:41.029> us<00:04:41.179> they<00:04:41.449> do<00:04:41.599> is<00:04:42.499> after<00:04:42.770> i<00:04:42.979> wash<00:04:43.159> my<00:04:43.189> face<00:04:43.490> I

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:43.819 
for us they do is after i wash my face I

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.419 
for us they do is after i wash my face I
take<00:04:44.779> I<00:04:45.580> take<00:04:46.580> a<00:04:46.909> cotton<00:04:47.209> pad<00:04:47.509> like<00:04:48.379> this<00:04:48.409> and<00:04:48.889> I

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:49.429 
take I take a cotton pad like this and I

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:50.820 
take I take a cotton pad like this and I
just<00:04:49.610> fill<00:04:49.849> it<00:04:49.969> up<00:04:50.029> with<00:04:50.089> hydrogen<00:04:50.569> peroxide

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
just fill it up with hydrogen peroxide

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.119 
just fill it up with hydrogen peroxide
and<00:04:51.830> then<00:04:51.979> what<00:04:52.849> I<00:04:52.879> do<00:04:53.089> so<00:04:53.659> take<00:04:53.869> it<00:04:53.899> and<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.949> just

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
and then what I do so take it and I just

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.629 
and then what I do so take it and I just
work<00:04:55.339> upwards<00:04:55.610> on<00:04:56.089> my<00:04:56.629> face<00:04:56.839> like<00:04:57.169> that<00:04:57.709> and

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
work upwards on my face like that and

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.169 
work upwards on my face like that and
then<00:04:58.909> this<00:04:59.179> way<00:04:59.469> always<00:05:00.469> work<00:05:00.679> upwards

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:01.179 
then this way always work upwards

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:03.939 
then this way always work upwards
doesn't<00:05:02.179> come<00:05:02.330> around<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.749> go<00:05:02.869> this<00:05:03.050> way<00:05:03.199> be

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
doesn't come around and go this way be

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.529 
doesn't come around and go this way be
careful<00:05:04.399> though<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.879> not<00:05:04.909> getting<00:05:05.330> in<00:05:05.419> your

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:23.179 
don't want to do that you put hydrogen

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:24.999 
don't want to do that you put hydrogen
peroxide<00:05:23.659> on<00:05:23.689> your<00:05:23.899> face<00:05:24.080> what<00:05:24.499> it<00:05:24.619> does<00:05:24.800> is

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
peroxide on your face what it does is

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.709 
peroxide on your face what it does is
that<00:05:25.219> it<00:05:25.279> oxygenates<00:05:25.699> your<00:05:26.119> pores<00:05:26.389> and<00:05:26.599> it

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
kills the bacteria that causes acne and

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.909 
kills the bacteria that causes acne and
that<00:05:29.149> way<00:05:29.330> it<00:05:29.569> prevents<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:30.199> acne<00:05:30.529> from

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
that way it prevents the acne from

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.399 
that way it prevents the acne from
coming<00:05:31.459> back<00:05:31.490> and<00:05:31.849> scarring<00:05:32.779> it's<00:05:33.199> really

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:33.409 
coming back and scarring it's really
