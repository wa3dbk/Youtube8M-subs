00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
we're gonna talk a little bit about the

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.799 
we're gonna talk a little bit about the
ingredients<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:33.910> are<00:00:33.970> in<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.600> are<00:00:34.629> in

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
ingredients that are in it that are in

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.410 
ingredients that are in it that are in
this<00:00:34.989> m5<00:00:35.410> product<00:00:35.830> the<00:00:36.580> main<00:00:36.790> focus<00:00:37.030> that<00:00:37.300> they

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
this m5 product the main focus that they

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.479 
this m5 product the main focus that they
put<00:00:37.600> on<00:00:37.690> creatine<00:00:37.989> magnetar<00:00:38.680> now<00:00:39.309> that

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
put on creatine magnetar now that

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.700 
put on creatine magnetar now that
creatine<00:00:39.790> is<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> buffered<00:00:40.750> solution<00:00:41.020> which<00:00:41.590> is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
creatine is a buffered solution which is

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.110 
creatine is a buffered solution which is
better<00:00:41.860> than<00:00:42.010> a<00:00:42.070> monohydrate<00:00:42.610> it's<00:00:42.820> bitterly

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
better than a monohydrate it's bitterly

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.630 
better than a monohydrate it's bitterly
absorbing<00:00:43.840> your<00:00:43.870> body<00:00:44.170> and<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.250> bypasses

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
absorbing your body and so it bypasses

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.400 
absorbing your body and so it bypasses
your<00:00:45.970> digestive<00:00:46.480> system<00:00:46.540> that<00:00:47.170> in<00:00:47.290> your

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
your digestive system that in your

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.990 
your digestive system that in your
stomach<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.829> pH<00:00:48.070> levels<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> acid<00:00:48.910> that

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
stomach the pH levels the acid that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.970 
stomach the pH levels the acid that
breaks<00:00:49.059> down<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.420> monohydrate<00:00:50.110> and<00:00:50.320> so

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
breaks down to monohydrate and so

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.350 
breaks down to monohydrate and so
usually<00:00:51.399> when<00:00:51.489> you<00:00:51.579> take<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.730> monohydrate

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
usually when you take a monohydrate

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.120 
usually when you take a monohydrate
usually<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.110> just<00:00:53.140> love<00:00:53.410> your<00:00:53.530> body<00:00:53.710> absorbs

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.130 
usually you just love your body absorbs

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.560 
usually you just love your body absorbs
and<00:00:54.250> doesn't<00:00:54.550> even<00:00:54.579> take<00:00:54.850> it<00:00:55.000> in<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.270> to<00:00:55.390> use

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
and doesn't even take it in and to use

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.780 
and doesn't even take it in and to use
it<00:00:55.719> it<00:00:55.840> just<00:00:55.870> breaks<00:00:56.380> it<00:00:56.590> down<00:00:56.680> as<00:00:56.920> depleted<00:00:57.550> in

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
it it just breaks it down as depleted in

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.119 
it it just breaks it down as depleted in
an<00:00:58.120> m5<00:00:58.510> when<00:00:58.719> you're<00:00:58.840> on<00:00:58.930> a<00:00:58.960> creatine<00:00:59.260> Magna

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
an m5 when you're on a creatine Magna

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.220 
an m5 when you're on a creatine Magna
power<00:01:00.309> which<00:01:00.610> is<00:01:00.820> basically<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.480> fancy<00:01:01.809> term

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
power which is basically a fancy term

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.310 
power which is basically a fancy term
for<00:01:02.290> creatine<00:01:03.040> magnesium<00:01:03.640> chelate<00:01:04.140> its<00:01:05.140> gonna

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
for creatine magnesium chelate its gonna

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.719 
for creatine magnesium chelate its gonna
break<00:01:05.710> its<00:01:05.890> going<00:01:06.190> to<00:01:06.280> go<00:01:06.369> through<00:01:06.580> your

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
break its going to go through your

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.070 
break its going to go through your
digestive<00:01:06.880> system<00:01:07.210> at<00:01:07.479> lower<00:01:07.600> intestine

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
digestive system at lower intestine

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.660 
digestive system at lower intestine
where<00:01:08.560> it's<00:01:08.710> going<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:08.890> be<00:01:08.979> digested<00:01:09.490> more

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
where it's going to be digested more

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.910 
where it's going to be digested more
fully<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:10.180> it's<00:01:10.720> going<00:01:10.810> to<00:01:10.869> it's<00:01:11.200> why<00:01:11.770> they

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
fully and it's going to it's why they

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.010 
fully and it's going to it's why they
call<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.130> creatine<00:01:12.580> magnesium<00:01:13.150> chelate<00:01:13.630> is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
call it creatine magnesium chelate is

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.200 
call it creatine magnesium chelate is
because<00:01:14.320> it's<00:01:14.470> it's<00:01:14.920> hooked<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.400> magnesium

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
because it's it's hooked to magnesium

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.780 
because it's it's hooked to magnesium
which<00:01:16.720> is<00:01:16.900> an<00:01:17.049> enzyme<00:01:17.229> in<00:01:17.590> your<00:01:17.710> body<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:18.130> is

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
which is an enzyme in your body that is

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.850 
which is an enzyme in your body that is
a<00:01:18.820> muscle<00:01:19.299> nutrient<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:20.590> once<00:01:20.770> it

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
a muscle nutrient and so once it

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.649 
a muscle nutrient and so once it
connects<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.250> that<00:01:21.520> you<00:01:22.240> can<00:01:22.360> just<00:01:22.479> imagine

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
connects it to that you can just imagine

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.030 
connects it to that you can just imagine
the<00:01:22.900> creatine<00:01:23.260> getting<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.740> muscle

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
the creatine getting to the muscle

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.100 
the creatine getting to the muscle
tissue<00:01:24.220> and<00:01:24.520> providing<00:01:25.210> that<00:01:25.330> maximum<00:01:25.960> energy

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
tissue and providing that maximum energy

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.740 
tissue and providing that maximum energy
and<00:01:26.590> pump<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.700> force<00:01:28.060> that<00:01:28.299> you<00:01:28.420> need<00:01:28.570> in<00:01:28.659> the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
and pump and force that you need in the

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.690 
and pump and force that you need in the
gym<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.619> got<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:29.890> ultimate<00:01:30.280> force<00:01:30.549> like

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
gym and you got that ultimate force like

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.399 
gym and you got that ultimate force like
I<00:01:30.790> said<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.150> will<00:01:31.210> be<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:31.479> Yoda<00:01:31.810> putting<00:01:32.320> up

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
the book is I just took it tonight and I

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.780 
the book is I just took it tonight and I
feel<00:01:38.200> amazing<00:01:38.290> like<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:39.009> could<00:01:39.220> go<00:01:39.340> hit<00:01:39.670> it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
feel amazing like I could go hit it

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.249
