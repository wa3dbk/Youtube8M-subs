00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
plan on going back and doing a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.069 
plan on going back and doing a
beginner's<00:01:00.090> guide<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.329> destruction<00:01:00.870> and

beginner's guide to destruction and

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.750 
beginner's guide to destruction and
demonology<00:01:01.469> where<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> go<00:01:02.250> over<00:01:02.399> spell

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
demonology where I go over spell

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.990 
demonology where I go over spell
priorities<00:01:03.390> specs<00:01:04.110> glyphs<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.189> demon<00:01:05.760> choice

priorities specs glyphs and demon choice

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
priorities specs glyphs and demon choice
so<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> out<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.619> way<00:01:07.680> let's<00:01:07.770> get

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
so with that out of the way let's get

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.700 
so with that out of the way let's get
started<00:01:08.479> so<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.840> biggest<00:01:10.110> changes<00:01:10.409> without<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
started so the biggest changes without a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
started so the biggest changes without a
doubt<00:01:10.979> improved<00:01:11.310> soul<00:01:11.549> fire<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:12.030> most<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
doubt improved soul fire as most of you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
doubt improved soul fire as most of you
may<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.590> soul<00:01:13.920> fires<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.369> spell<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.939> was

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
may know soul fires a spell that was

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.999 
may know soul fires a spell that was
being<00:01:15.240> used<00:01:15.479> by<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:15.930> three<00:01:16.110> warlock<00:01:16.619> specs

being used by all three warlock specs

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.910 
being used by all three warlock specs
because<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.490> improves<00:01:17.700> soul<00:01:18.000> fire<00:01:18.920> but

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
because it improves soul fire but

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.230 
because it improves soul fire but
however<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
however that's just not going to be the

be really bad for reflection and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.670 
be really bad for reflection and
demonology<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.110> actually<00:01:58.229> not<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:58.619> bad

as<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.040> thought<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.219> would<00:01:59.369> be<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> flexion

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
now this changes most likely and by most

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.180 
now this changes most likely and by most
likely<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.080> mean<00:02:18.290> assuredly<00:02:19.150> based<00:02:20.150> on<00:02:20.360> PvP<00:02:21.190> but

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
likely I mean assuredly based on PvP but

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.510 
likely I mean assuredly based on PvP but
it<00:02:22.580> does<00:02:22.850> have<00:02:23.090> PvE<00:02:23.480> repercussions<00:02:24.520> since

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
it does have PvE repercussions since

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.340 
it does have PvE repercussions since

of exhaustion as utility and some

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.090 
of exhaustion as utility and some
encounters<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:30.590> mean<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:30.920> to<00:02:31.010> be<00:02:31.070> a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
encounters that mean it's going to be a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.640 
encounters that mean it's going to be a
little<00:02:31.310> less<00:02:31.459> useful<00:02:31.760> but<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.870> really<00:02:33.470> don't

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
little less useful but I really don't

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.520

wanting it anymore it's still going to

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.530 
wanting it anymore it's still going to
be<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.209> useful<00:02:38.450> spell<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.730> demonology<00:02:41.360> got<00:02:41.510> a
