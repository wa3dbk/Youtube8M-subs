stood ran into a major problem and that

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.140 
stood ran into a major problem and that
is<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:10.820> need<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.849> do<00:00:12.840> some<00:00:13.080> things<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.559> this

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
is I need to do some things to this

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.950 
is I need to do some things to this
before<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.389> put<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.719> my<00:00:15.839> car<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.770> there's<00:00:17.039> no

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
before I put it in my car but there's no

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.529 
before I put it in my car but there's no
power<00:00:18.960> option<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> nice<00:00:20.970> wiring

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
power option it's got a nice wiring

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.089 
power option it's got a nice wiring
harness<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.170> hooks<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:24.240> gives<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:24.750> the

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
harness that hooks up that gives all the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.279 
harness that hooks up that gives all the
speaker<00:00:26.099> wire<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.550> different<00:00:26.880> colors<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
speaker wire in different colors so it

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.160 
speaker wire in different colors so it
can<00:00:28.410> play<00:00:28.529> easily<00:00:28.830> into<00:00:29.279> your<00:00:29.539> car<00:00:30.539> truck<00:00:31.050> or

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
can play easily into your car truck or

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.139 
can play easily into your car truck or
whatever<00:00:31.260> with<00:00:32.250> unless<00:00:33.469> was<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> called

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
whatever with unless was that called

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.930 
whatever with unless was that called
cable<00:00:36.149> converter<00:00:36.739> so<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.610> don't<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.850> to

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
cable converter so you don't have to

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.490 
cable converter so you don't have to
hack<00:00:39.120> into<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.480> wires<00:00:39.719> inside<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.290> your

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
hack into the wires inside of your

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.729 
hack into the wires inside of your
vehicle<00:00:41.460> but<00:00:41.870> if<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.989> want<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> turn<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.590> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
vehicle but if I want to turn it on in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.090 
vehicle but if I want to turn it on in
my<00:00:43.829> living<00:00:44.070> room<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.610> don't<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.920> an

my living room I don't really have an

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.459 
my living room I don't really have an
out-of-the-box<00:00:47.550> solution<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.750> posted

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
out-of-the-box solution so I posted

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.450 
out-of-the-box solution so I posted
something<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:50.100> their<00:00:50.250> forum<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:51.510> my<00:00:52.129> III<00:00:53.129> iOS

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
something on their forum on my III iOS

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.299 
something on their forum on my III iOS
forum<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:54.329> them<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.660> don't<00:00:55.440> think<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.920> really

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

understood<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.090> talking<00:00:57.300> about

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
understood what I was talking about

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.720 
understood what I was talking about
because<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:58.980> pointed<00:00:59.280> me<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.520> something

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
because they pointed me to something

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.569 
because they pointed me to something
that<00:00:59.879> looked<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.890> amplifier<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.340> ham

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that looked like a amplifier for a ham

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.890 
that looked like a amplifier for a ham
radio<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.199> 200<00:01:04.680> bucks<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.900> got

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
radio that was like 200 bucks so I got

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380 
radio that was like 200 bucks so I got
to<00:01:06.990> thinking<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.670> might<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.820> able<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to thinking I might be able to do this

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.960 
to thinking I might be able to do this
and<00:01:09.689> realized<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.460> know<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.790> basically

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and realized you know this is basically

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.649 
and realized you know this is basically
a<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:14.490> car<00:01:15.210> head<00:01:15.450> unit<00:01:15.780> at<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.080> point<00:01:16.549> so<00:01:17.659> how

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
a a car head unit at this point so how

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.810 
a a car head unit at this point so how
would<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.960> power<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.560> car<00:01:19.890> head<00:01:20.159> unit<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.670> my

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
would I power a car head unit in my

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.060 
would I power a car head unit in my
house<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.900> found<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.439> course<00:01:22.590> found<00:01:22.890> some

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
house and I found of course found some

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.590 
house and I found of course found some
nice<00:01:23.659> videos<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.840> YouTube<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:26.600> they

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
nice videos on YouTube and they

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.569 
nice videos on YouTube and they
recommended<00:01:28.340> using<00:01:29.340> at<00:01:29.610> PSU<00:01:30.710> from<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:32.040> computer

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
recommended using at PSU from a computer

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.789 
recommended using at PSU from a computer
so<00:01:33.570> when<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> picked<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.590> for

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
so when you picked one of these up for

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.969 
so when you picked one of these up for
like<00:01:34.890> 25<00:01:35.250> bucks<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> central<00:01:37.619> computers<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
like 25 bucks the central computers and

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.920 
like 25 bucks the central computers and
on<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> little<00:01:42.140> female<00:01:43.280> to<00:01:44.280> male<00:01:44.460> connector<00:01:45.030> cut

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
on a little female to male connector cut

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.319 
on a little female to male connector cut
it<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.170> half<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.680> wouldn't<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.149> mess<00:01:48.149> up

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it in half so I wouldn't have to mess up

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.969 
it in half so I wouldn't have to mess up
my<00:01:48.479> pretty<00:01:48.930> wires<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.409> could<00:01:49.530> use<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
my pretty wires I could use this in the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.160 
my pretty wires I could use this in the
future<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.490> basically<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:52.460> just<00:01:53.460> made<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.990> quick

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.940 

jump<00:01:58.170> in<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.920> cable<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.670> this<00:01:59.820> green<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> black

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
jump in the cable so this green to black

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.490 
jump in the cable so this green to black
to<00:02:01.950> make<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.430> fake<00:02:03.149> sending<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.689> signal<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
to make to fake sending a signal that

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.620 
to make to fake sending a signal that
the<00:02:04.590> computers<00:02:05.009> on<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> just<00:02:06.420> gave

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the computers on and then I just gave

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.699 
the computers on and then I just gave
the<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.799> head<00:02:08.009> unit<00:02:08.340> 12<00:02:09.300> volts<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.629> power

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
the you know head unit 12 volts of power

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.780 
the you know head unit 12 volts of power
to<00:02:10.709> both<00:02:10.890> its<00:02:11.190> power<00:02:11.700> line<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.030> its

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
to both its power line and its

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.410 
to both its power line and its
sir<00:02:12.969> Eli<00:02:13.239> meaning<00:02:13.599> that's<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.989> one<00:02:14.170> tells<00:02:15.069> the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
sir Eli meaning that's the one tells the

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
that the battery is available and then

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.039 
that the battery is available and then
grounded<00:02:20.859> it<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:24.359> I've<00:02:25.359> got<00:02:25.569> one<00:02:25.780> make

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.970 
grounded it out and I've got one make
sure<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.909> my<00:02:27.909> PS<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.079> had<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> power<00:02:29.709> switch

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
sure that my PS you had a power switch

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.440 
sure that my PS you had a power switch
to<00:02:30.280> make<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.549> easy<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:34.420> should<00:02:35.290> work

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
to make this easy so this should work

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.160 
to make this easy so this should work
perfectly

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
perfectly

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.610 
perfectly
I<00:02:38.200> mean<00:02:38.769> plug<00:02:39.159> this<00:02:39.489> wiring<00:02:40.420> harness<00:02:40.870> in<00:02:41.049> here

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.210 

okay<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.290> see<00:02:50.500> that<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.739> fans<00:02:50.980> are

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
okay and you can see that the fans are

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.149 
okay and you can see that the fans are
not<00:02:51.340> on<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.989> don't<00:02:52.989> have<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.319> PSU<00:02:53.709> on<00:02:53.859> so<00:02:54.099> I'm

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
not on I don't have the PSU on so I'm

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.149 
not on I don't have the PSU on so I'm
going<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.310> switch<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.519> on<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.870> spinning<00:02:56.829> fan

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
going to switch it on the spinning fan

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.089 
going to switch it on the spinning fan
obviously<00:02:57.489> means<00:02:57.939> that<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.329> getting<00:02:58.510> power

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
obviously means that it's getting power

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:12.300 
obviously means that it's getting power
that's<00:03:00.099> what<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.340> little<00:03:00.549> jump<00:03:00.790> does<00:03:01.120> and

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.300 

got<00:03:12.880> some<00:03:13.060> deepen<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.600> some<00:03:14.010> video<00:03:15.010> that's

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
got some deepen and some video that's

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:25.480 
got some deepen and some video that's
always<00:03:15.490> good

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.900 

Hey

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.490 

cool<00:03:34.210> so<00:03:35.210> several<00:03:35.480> ways<00:03:35.720> to<00:03:35.750> go<00:03:36.020> and<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:36.260> also

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
cool so several ways to go and this also

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.530 
cool so several ways to go and this also
figured<00:03:36.890> out<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.220> uh<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:39.230> can<00:03:39.410> see

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
figured out that uh you can see

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:48.100 
figured out that uh you can see
multi-touch<00:03:41.540> works<00:03:43.240> that<00:03:44.240> just<00:03:44.510> work<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:47.110> turn

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
multi-touch works that just work I turn

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.040 
multi-touch works that just work I turn
this<00:03:48.230> on<00:03:48.350> earlier<00:03:48.860> obviously<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:50.930> can

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
this on earlier obviously and you can

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.160 
this on earlier obviously and you can
see<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.550> swiping<00:03:52.550> works<00:03:52.820> I've<00:03:53.600> got<00:03:53.810> some<00:03:54.080> of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
see that swiping works I've got some of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.900 
see that swiping works I've got some of
my<00:03:54.290> apps<00:03:54.530> starting<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.010> sink<00:03:55.280> in<00:03:55.520> finally<00:03:56.920> and

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.320 

what<00:04:01.910> else

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
what else

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.210 
what else
I<00:04:02.360> think<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.200> boot<00:04:03.380> time<00:04:03.590> on<00:04:03.740> that<00:04:03.830> wasn't<00:04:04.010> bad

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
I think the boot time on that wasn't bad

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.320 
I think the boot time on that wasn't bad
at<00:04:04.340> all<00:04:07.840> it's<00:04:08.840> tough<00:04:09.020> to<00:04:09.200> work<00:04:09.350> with<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:10.060> UI<00:04:11.060> it

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
at all it's tough to work with the UI it

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.030 
at all it's tough to work with the UI it
sees<00:04:11.810> that<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.260> how<00:04:12.410> I'm<00:04:12.530> going<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.710> set<00:04:12.920> this

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
sees that the how I'm going to set this

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.820 
sees that the how I'm going to set this
thing<00:04:13.310> out<00:04:14.140> to<00:04:15.140> make<00:04:15.320> it<00:04:15.410> something<00:04:15.620> that's

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
thing out to make it something that's

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.699 
thing out to make it something that's
actually<00:04:16.010> usable<00:04:16.640> in<00:04:16.730> the<00:04:16.760> cart<00:04:17.060> but<00:04:17.840> some<00:04:18.650> of

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
actually usable in the cart but some of

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.570 
actually usable in the cart but some of
the<00:04:18.770> buttons<00:04:18.920> have<00:04:19.070> already<00:04:19.280> been<00:04:19.400> programmed

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
the buttons have already been programmed

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.370 
the buttons have already been programmed
you<00:04:20.570> can<00:04:22.330> for<00:04:23.330> example<00:04:23.630> this<00:04:23.720> is<00:04:23.930> we'll<00:04:24.200> just

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
you can for example this is we'll just

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.830 
you can for example this is we'll just
start<00:04:24.560> home<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:30.070> some<00:04:31.070> other<00:04:31.220> pieces<00:04:31.460> so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
start home and some other pieces so

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.550 
start home and some other pieces so
first<00:04:32.840> step<00:04:33.050> power

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
first step power

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.250 
first step power
done<00:04:33.950> next<00:04:34.370> step<00:04:34.750> figuring<00:04:35.750> out<00:04:35.840> how<00:04:35.930> to<00:04:35.960> power

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
done next step figuring out how to power

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.900 
done next step figuring out how to power
and<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.830> just<00:04:36.980> be<00:04:37.130> have<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.370> side<00:04:37.640> of<00:04:37.670> my<00:04:37.850> truck

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
and you just be have a side of my truck

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.130 
and you just be have a side of my truck
because<00:04:38.300> this<00:04:38.480> thing<00:04:38.660> doesn't<00:04:38.690> have<00:04:38.960> enough

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
because this thing doesn't have enough
