00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.070
 economic and feasible to eat with 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.610

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:39.949
 green tomatoes this let's put us 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.170
 in boiling water if it's painted I did not put 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.359
 so much water many times we place 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.729
 too much water to boil the elements 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.129
 not even necessary I'm going to tear you 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.079
 the tail to a serrano chile care 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.449
 because they do not like the spicy I'm going to 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.620
 add a piece of garlic also for 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.809
 You have not seen all my recipes 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.699
 punished but here is this tip that 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.670
 I have given them several times this is 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.620
 my cilantro lives in the refrigerator 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.019
 and it's very happy, all I do is that 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.030
 when he bought cilantro this today a 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.799
 salad and then a container what 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.960
 I put with water and leave it as if it were 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.299
 a little plant and lived inside the fridge 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.890
 it lasts about a month because 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.810
 you see later it stays in the little bag 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.789
 super moment and not down in the drawer and 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.880
 advise rows subtract all blacks 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.189
 I have a friend who returns on paper 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.380
 Aluminum wound LIDES would curdle me in 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.930
 the ardor there are these steps are very beautiful 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.909
 people and he tells me that he already wraps 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.740
 in foil and take it hard 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.770
 quite on the reverse that the latter 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.100
 I'm going to put a piece of coriander this 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.649
 I saw her sauce recently when I did not see her 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.840
 I tasted beautiful as for the weekend 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.330
 and he is missing to discover the secret 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.090
 because I did not know any different and I was not 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.850

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.459
 boil and suddenly with this when 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.170
 are already cooked their take and twice 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:02:01.390
 the other ingredients are going to 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:04.600
 add look i have a page in 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.670

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.780
 well here you can see I'm uploading 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.730
 constantly information for example 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.459

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.109
 tilapia that I put on the internet 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.910

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.200
 experimenting to get new recipes 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.030
 just like tips for example you knew 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.940
 that there are certain artificial sweeteners 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.680
 that can be toxic at the time of 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.750
 submit them to expensive monk then 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.640
 I understand using your food and so a 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.099
 lots of information some recipes 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.500
 word that happened to write the videos 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:43.360
 and especially the comments of others 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.519
 people and questions that maybe 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.099
 can solve their own problems and 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.060
 Well, look here, let's mix 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.340
 our ingredients 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.520
 we are adding everything remember well those 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.890
 cilantro as a general they go to the bottom and 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.810
 I'm going to add a bit of this same water 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.870
 Care that is hot and then already 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.000
 I'm going to close this with sea salt 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.430
 more of these salts that is not processed 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.349
 so try to find the room very rich 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.209
 the food that is to use less quantity 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.830
 as you well know it is tomatillo and everything is 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.989
 hot the mouth is going to put like this 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.660
 that was never projected by this step my 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.430

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.040
 we add 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.040
 If the table is more resistant than 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.630
 been observing a good spicy care 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.180
