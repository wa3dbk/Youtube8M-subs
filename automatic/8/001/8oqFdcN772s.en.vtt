00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:09.909 
who could have done the transition she
may<00:05:08.750> have<00:05:08.840> probably<00:05:09.110> done<00:05:09.259> a<00:05:09.319> good<00:05:09.500> job<00:05:09.560> but

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
may have probably done a good job but

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.950 
may have probably done a good job but
since<00:05:10.069> I<00:05:10.250> don't<00:05:10.460> speak<00:05:11.300> Italian<00:05:11.419> I'd<00:05:11.840> be

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
since I don't speak Italian I'd be

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.420 
since I don't speak Italian I'd be
curious<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.319> know<00:05:12.560> how<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.740> compares<00:05:13.220> to<00:05:13.310> the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
curious to know how it compares to the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.010 
curious to know how it compares to the
original

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.200 

but<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.860> think<00:05:17.950> Italian<00:05:18.640> and<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:18.880> language

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
but I think Italian and the language

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.150 
but I think Italian and the language
probably<00:05:19.600> has<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.780> capacity<00:05:20.080> to<00:05:20.530> express<00:05:21.010> the

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
probably has a capacity to express the

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.450 
probably has a capacity to express the
same<00:05:21.370> kind<00:05:21.670> of<00:05:22.620> miracle<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.650> huge<00:05:23.920> people<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.340> can

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
same kind of miracle a huge people I can

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.400 
same kind of miracle a huge people I can

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
India itself this certain flavor the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.900 
India itself this certain flavor the

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
language has a certain playfulness a

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.720 
language has a certain playfulness a
certain<00:05:28.360> you<00:05:28.480> know<00:05:28.710> it's<00:05:29.710> not<00:05:29.890> overly<00:05:30.190> soft<00:05:30.520> it

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
certain you know it's not overly soft it

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.140 
certain you know it's not overly soft it
can<00:05:30.880> have<00:05:31.060> an<00:05:31.210> edge<00:05:31.360> which<00:05:31.630> is<00:05:31.780> you<00:05:32.590> know<00:05:32.740> I

don't know how to quite explain but I

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.680 
don't know how to quite explain but I
suspect<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.920> Italian<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.550> able<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:37.000> capture

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
suspect that Italian is able to capture

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.810 
suspect that Italian is able to capture
the<00:05:37.960> nuance
