netball field hockey but love they love
the<00:00:32.070> game<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.279> didn't<00:00:33.270> really<00:00:33.510> intend<00:00:33.809> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the game and didn't really intend to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.420 
the game and didn't really intend to
become<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.140> coach<00:00:34.440> but<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:35.070> my<00:00:35.190> passion

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
become a coach but I think my passion

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
become a coach but I think my passion
this<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.120> took<00:00:36.180> over<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.050> he<00:00:37.350> was

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
this you know took over and so he was

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
this you know took over and so he was
right<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.890> mean<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.070> think<00:00:38.100> trends<00:00:38.700> trends<00:00:39.390> cross

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
right I mean I think trends trends cross

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.500 
right I mean I think trends trends cross
genders<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.530> know<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:40.860> think<00:00:41.070> there<00:00:41.280> are

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
genders you know and I think there are

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.910 
genders you know and I think there are
you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.660> think<00:00:42.719> transitions<00:00:43.469> becoming

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you know I think transitions becoming

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.529 
you know I think transitions becoming
more<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.280> part<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> our<00:00:44.730> game<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.210> think<00:00:45.270> it's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
more of a part of our game I think it's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.680 
more of a part of our game I think it's
very<00:00:45.719> much<00:00:45.809> established<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> men's<00:00:46.890> game

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
very much established in the men's game

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.209 
very much established in the men's game
so<00:00:48.690> yeah<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> mean<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.350> will<00:00:49.649> always<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:50.039> looking

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so yeah I mean we will always be looking

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
so yeah I mean we will always be looking
at<00:00:50.430> different<00:00:50.730> ways<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> doing<00:00:51.090> things<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
at different ways of doing things you

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.389 
at different ways of doing things you
know<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.840> simple<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.320> do<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> put<00:00:52.949> players<00:00:53.160> on

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
know as simple as do you put players on

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
know as simple as do you put players on
the<00:00:53.579> post<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> corner<00:00:54.480> kick<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.170> know

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the post on a corner kick to you know

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.689 
the post on a corner kick to you know
different<00:00:55.620> nuances<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.309> things<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> that

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
different nuances like things like that

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
different nuances like things like that
but<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.329> think<00:00:57.750> part<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:57.960> its<00:00:58.109> being<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.379> fan

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
but I think part of its being a fan

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.139 
but I think part of its being a fan
apartment<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.370> obviously<00:00:59.699> looking<00:01:00.030> at

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
apartment is obviously looking at

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
apartment is obviously looking at
different<00:01:00.420> ways<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:00.870> anytime<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
different ways and I think anytime you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
different ways and I think anytime you
watch<00:01:02.010> again<00:01:02.340> you're<00:01:02.879> looking<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.270> learn<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
watch again you're looking to learn and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.969 
watch again you're looking to learn and
pick<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.930> big<00:01:04.110> things<00:01:04.350> up<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
pick the big things up and I think the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.560 
pick the big things up and I think the
players<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.400> interested<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.880> not<00:01:06.240> just<00:01:06.299> being

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
players are interested in not just being

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.000 
players are interested in not just being
a<00:01:06.689> fan<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.110> looking<00:01:07.350> at<00:01:07.439> different<00:01:07.710> certain

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
a fan but looking at different certain

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.230 
a fan but looking at different certain
things<00:01:10.250> we<00:01:11.250> won't<00:01:11.340> talk<00:01:11.549> about<00:01:11.610> refereeing

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
things we won't talk about refereeing

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.390 
things we won't talk about refereeing
decisions<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.380> actual<00:01:13.650> overall<00:01:13.740> play

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
decisions but the actual overall play

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.450 
decisions but the actual overall play
you<00:01:15.390> know<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.680> guess<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.830> honestly<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> expect<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you know I guess so honestly I expect a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.649 
you know I guess so honestly I expect a
little<00:01:17.520> bit<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:17.970> Brazil<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.479> thought

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
little bit more from Brazil I thought

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.490 
little bit more from Brazil I thought
was<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> choppy<00:01:19.080> game<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.210> think<00:01:21.500> it's

was a choppy game you know I think it's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
was a choppy game you know I think it's
an<00:01:22.680> opening<00:01:22.950> game<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.790> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
an opening game so I know with that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
an opening game so I know with that
comes<00:01:24.299> nerves<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.869> expectations<00:01:25.619> being<00:01:25.950> on

comes nerves and expectations being on
the<00:01:26.159> home<00:01:26.310> team<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.570> expect<00:01:27.900> for

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
the home team so I would expect for

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.499 
the home team so I would expect for
Brazil<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.710> know<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:29.490> well<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> win<00:01:30.360> this

in this first camp has been super
positive<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.979> think<00:02:06.369> everybody<00:02:06.759> feels<00:02:07.030> like

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
they have a huge opportunity and I feel

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.150 
they have a huge opportunity and I feel
like<00:02:09.310> our<00:02:09.459> preparation<00:02:10.119> kind<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.080> started<00:02:11.470> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
like our preparation kind of started and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.580 
like our preparation kind of started and
it's<00:02:12.400> starting<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:12.849> this<00:02:12.970> camp<00:02:13.239> and<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.410> think

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
it's starting in this camp and I think

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.780 
it's starting in this camp and I think
we're<00:02:14.709> all<00:02:14.829> familiar<00:02:15.099> with<00:02:15.370> each<00:02:15.610> other

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
we're all familiar with each other

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.819 
we're all familiar with each other
especially<00:02:16.060> with<00:02:16.390> Jill<00:02:16.599> she<00:02:17.440> fits<00:02:17.650> in

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
especially with Jill she fits in

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:19.470 
especially with Jill she fits in
perfectly<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.849> I<00:02:18.879> think<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.299> pretty

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
perfectly so I think it's pretty

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.050 
perfectly so I think it's pretty
seamless<00:02:20.049> in<00:02:20.349> that<00:02:20.470> transition<00:02:21.040> but<00:02:21.579> in<00:02:21.819> terms

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
seamless in that transition but in terms

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.339 
seamless in that transition but in terms
of<00:02:22.269> getting<00:02:22.480> out<00:02:22.629> on<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.870> field<00:02:23.049> I<00:02:23.140> think

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
of getting out on the field I think

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.930 
of getting out on the field I think
everything<00:02:23.739> everybody<00:02:24.459> has<00:02:24.610> something<00:02:24.790> to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
everything everybody has something to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.789 
everything everybody has something to
prove<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.360> everybody's<00:02:25.840> trying<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.560> make

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799
