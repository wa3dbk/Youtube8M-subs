00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
directional you EV like this but this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.020 
directional you EV like this but this
doesn't<00:01:07.290> involve<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.640> isn't

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
doesn't involve that and but this isn't

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300

an<00:01:09.150> objective<00:01:09.630> game<00:01:09.869> mode<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> guess<00:01:11.040> I'm

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
an objective game mode so I guess I'm

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.710 
an objective game mode so I guess I'm
kind<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> helping<00:01:11.820> my<00:01:11.939> team<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.360> by<00:01:12.390> getting

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
kind of helping my team up by getting

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.940 
kind of helping my team up by getting
loads<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.049> kills<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.409> guess<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.710> could<00:01:13.860> argue

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
loads of kills I guess you could argue

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
loads of kills I guess you could argue
but<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.939> when<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.360> all<00:01:15.630> three<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:16.080> these

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
but it when you have all three of these

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
but it when you have all three of these
streaks<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.250> same<00:01:17.340> time<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
streaks in there at the same time it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.570 
streaks in there at the same time it
just<00:01:18.030> creates<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> perfect<00:01:19.049> trio<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.340> just

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
just creates the perfect trio of just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
just creates the perfect trio of just
destruction<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.689> it's<00:01:22.049> absolutely<00:01:22.229> amazing

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
destruction and it's absolutely amazing

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.560 
destruction and it's absolutely amazing
i<00:01:23.220> really<00:01:23.580> recommend<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> try<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.420> out

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
i really recommend that you try it out

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080 
i really recommend that you try it out
but<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.040> weakness<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:26.580> would<00:01:26.700> say<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
but it's one weakness i would say is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.660 
but it's one weakness i would say is
it's<00:01:27.869> only<00:01:28.110> weakness<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> enemy

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
it's only weakness is that if the enemy

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
it's only weakness is that if the enemy
hide<00:01:29.880> inside<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.079> avoid<00:01:31.470> them

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
hide inside they can kind of avoid them

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.649 
hide inside they can kind of avoid them
but<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:32.729> why<00:01:32.880> i<00:01:32.909> recommend<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> use

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
but that's why i recommend that you use

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
but that's why i recommend that you use
an<00:01:33.869> outside<00:01:34.079> map<00:01:34.619> air<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.130> carry<00:01:35.490> on

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
an outside map air like carry on

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.490 
an outside map air like carry on
Nuketown<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.479> turbine<00:01:36.960> or<00:01:37.020> something

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
Nuketown or turbine or something

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.890 
Nuketown or turbine or something
something<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.659> don't

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
something like these and but they don't

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.060 
something like these and but they don't
conflict<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:40.530> each<00:01:40.710> other<00:01:40.829> which<00:01:41.040> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
conflict with each other which is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
conflict with each other which is
amazing<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.610> have<00:01:41.700> only<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.570> same<00:01:42.810> time

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
amazing you have only at the same time

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
amazing you have only at the same time
and<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.310> perfect<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.820> stealth

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and that it's just perfect the stealth

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.609 
and that it's just perfect the stealth
chopper<00:01:45.450> will<00:01:45.600> stay<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.049> fixed<00:01:46.470> location

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.670 
chopper will stay like a fixed location
and<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:48.180> choice<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.960> spawn<00:01:49.409> trap

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
highest air this restraints back and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.030 
highest air this restraints back and
forward<00:02:03.270> around<00:02:03.630> three<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.110> five<00:02:04.320> runs<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.920> its

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
forward around three to five runs of its

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
their chain guns and missiles and it's

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.719 
their chain guns and missiles and it's
it<00:02:07.500> does<00:02:07.710> actually<00:02:07.860> vary<00:02:08.250> depending<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.610> how

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
it does actually vary depending on how

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.089 
it does actually vary depending on how
many<00:02:08.940> runs<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.330> does<00:02:09.539> if<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.319> does<00:02:10.530> very<00:02:10.860> well

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
many runs it does if it does very well

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.800 
many runs it does if it does very well
and<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.459> gets<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.819> like<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.060> quad<00:02:12.420> feed<00:02:12.629> or

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
and it gets you like a quad feed or

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.700 
and it gets you like a quad feed or
something<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.140> that

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
something like that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.810 
something like that
we'll<00:02:13.770> probably<00:02:13.920> only<00:02:14.100> do<00:02:14.310> about<00:02:14.460> three

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
we'll probably only do about three

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.940 
we'll probably only do about three
straight<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.600> not<00:02:15.870> doing<00:02:16.200> too<00:02:16.380> well<00:02:16.410> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
straight but it's not doing too well and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.860 
straight but it's not doing too well and
it<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:17.160> keep<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.610> going<00:02:18.000> until<00:02:18.090> until<00:02:18.750> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
it will keep on going until until it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.750 
it will keep on going until until it
gets<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> good<00:02:19.590> amount<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:20.070> kills<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.520> won't

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
gets you a good amount of kills it won't

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.570 
gets you a good amount of kills it won't
give<00:02:21.030> up<00:02:21.180> until<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.990> gets<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.440> some<00:02:22.950> nice<00:02:23.190> sets

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
give up until it gets you some nice sets

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.790 
give up until it gets you some nice sets
and<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.910> skills<00:02:24.240> but<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.380> look<00:02:25.500> at<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.620> map

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
and I skills but if you look at the map

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.560 
and I skills but if you look at the map
it<00:02:26.010> will<00:02:26.100> be<00:02:26.190> completely<00:02:26.370> covered<00:02:27.060> and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
it will be completely covered and

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.180 
it will be completely covered and
enemies<00:02:28.080> won't<00:02:28.260> be<00:02:28.470> able<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.710> shoot<00:02:28.890> them<00:02:29.040> down

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
enemies won't be able to shoot them down

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.310 
enemies won't be able to shoot them down
this<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.550> what<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> love<00:02:30.120> about<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.630> enemies

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
this is what I love about this enemies

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.470 
this is what I love about this enemies
will<00:02:31.500> pretty<00:02:31.800> much<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.390> disabled<00:02:33.390> from

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
will pretty much be disabled from

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.360 
will pretty much be disabled from
shooting<00:02:33.840> these<00:02:33.900> down<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:35.010> they<00:02:35.160> take

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
shooting these down because if they take

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
shooting these down because if they take
are<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.880> save<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.330> escort<00:02:36.870> drove<00:02:37.050> for

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
are like to save you escort drove for

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.080 
are like to save you escort drove for
example<00:02:37.740> then<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.250> stealth<00:02:38.610> dropper<00:02:38.940> might

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
example then the stealth dropper might

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.880 
example then the stealth dropper might
shoot<00:02:39.300> them<00:02:39.510> or<00:02:39.960> if<00:02:40.080> they<00:02:40.170> try<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.530> shoot<00:02:40.710> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
shoot them or if they try and shoot the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.770 
shoot them or if they try and shoot the
Warthog<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:41.700> maybe<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> escort<00:02:42.450> drone<00:02:42.660> will

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
Warthog then maybe the escort drone will

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.150 
Warthog then maybe the escort drone will
shoot<00:02:43.020> them<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.380> it's<00:02:43.920> just<00:02:43.980> these

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
shoot them and it's just these

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.010 
shoot them and it's just these
combinations<00:02:44.550> if<00:02:45.120> they<00:02:45.210> try<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.540> take<00:02:45.690> one

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
combinations if they try and take one

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.990 
combinations if they try and take one
then<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.770> awful<00:02:47.040> prob<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.520> just<00:02:47.700> killed<00:02:47.910> in

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
then the awful prob you just killed in

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.280 
then the awful prob you just killed in
because<00:02:48.150> there<00:02:48.240> are<00:02:48.300> three<00:02:48.660> school<00:02:48.960> streets

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
because there are three school streets

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.380 
because there are three school streets
in<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.680> air<00:02:49.800> all<00:02:50.340> trying<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.700> shoot<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.150> and

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
in the air all trying to shoot you and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.720 
in the air all trying to shoot you and
it<00:02:51.960> is<00:02:52.080> very<00:02:52.110> very<00:02:52.560> hard<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:52.890> take<00:02:53.160> these<00:02:53.400> down

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
it is very very hard to take these down

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.180 
it is very very hard to take these down
and<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.050> stealth<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.650> self<00:02:55.920> dropper

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
and so the stealth the self dropper

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.460 
and so the stealth the self dropper
takes<00:02:56.430> at<00:02:56.700> two<00:02:57.000> stingers<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:58.110> can't<00:02:58.320> see

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
takes at two stingers and you can't see

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
takes at two stingers and you can't see
on<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> mini<00:02:58.770> maps<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.100> makes<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.400> pretty

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
on the mini maps that makes it pretty

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.370
