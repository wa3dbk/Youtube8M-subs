00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.440
 the recovery of the Brest stadium is 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.809
 extremely spectacular these last 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.210
 weeks five wins out of the seven 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.830
 last matches and after a series of 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.230
 six games without defeats the bretons 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.919
 had to bow 10 to metz during the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.020
 last day 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.330
 this match against the haven the opportunity to 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.160
 check that momentum is not 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.929
 completely broken because a defeat on 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.180
 the leader's field must not change 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.070
 the face of this brest team who 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.710
 will be for this meeting facing the harbor 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.640
 last private suspended martial and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.440
 Bernard Mendy 100 injured Brest is 13th 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.260
 with 5 points of progress on the red zone 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.330
 now the harbor is 11th with six 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.010
 advanced points on the first relegable 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.750
 the normans had good results 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.699
 on some sequences this season 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.059
 but not enough to be really 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.059
 quiet 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.260
 attention to this opportunity for 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.739
 brest with a very clear shot that 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.739
 misses 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.909
 opportunities are being 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.490
 multiply for the bretons they are 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.090
 very offensive and still do not have the 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.920
 reward at the half time 0 0 rather a 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.500
 good point outside for the 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.460
 Norman of the Le Havre still deprived of 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.509
 yohann river and river 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.160
 the harbor team that's pretty good at 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.330
 the outside that only suffered three 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.950
 defeats away this season 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.080
 a lot of draws 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:36.500
 that's what they're still doing 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.580
 make the harbor team that's doing too much 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.090
 draws in general in this 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.740
 championship that limits the breakage and who 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.479
 remain on six matches without defeat this is 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.490
 rather interesting and who could do 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.440
 better by winning because there is the opening 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.259
 of the sign signed maxime the merchant 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.800
 in the 52nd minute is his second goal 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.750
 of the season 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.869
 the former Stade Rennes defender and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.630
 lets the hac and believe it and brest himself 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.950
 find in trouble some Breton who 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.229
 try to benefit from this mess 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.410
 in the surface to come back and this is the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.450
 case thanks to alexander alphonse at the 72nd 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.890
 minute also inscribed his second 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.690
 purpose of the season he was injured during 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.630
 a long moment 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.810
 a goal that relieves the whole stadium 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.810
 Brest 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.630
 watch out for this end-of-end scuffle 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:29.270
 match the referee stÃ©phane jochem tries 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.280
 to calm the spirits and this sequence 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.630
 which shows how much the points are worth 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.040
 dear to a few days from the end of 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.840
 the season 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.220
 brest will not manage to win the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.180
 good point for the outside haven 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.180
 final score a goal everywhere
