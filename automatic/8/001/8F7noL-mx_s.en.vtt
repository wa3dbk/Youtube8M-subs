strengthen the connection between

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.789 
strengthen the connection between
assessment<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.879> instruction<00:04:09.620> yeah<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.650> think

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
assessment and instruction yeah I think

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.490 
assessment and instruction yeah I think
the<00:04:11.010> mentor<00:04:11.280> texts<00:04:11.729> have<00:04:11.940> have<00:04:12.389> made<00:04:13.290> the

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
the mentor texts have have made the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.250 
the mentor texts have have made the
biggest<00:04:13.709> difference<00:04:14.479> in<00:04:15.479> our<00:04:15.720> writing<00:04:15.959> time

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
biggest difference in our writing time

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.800 
biggest difference in our writing time
because<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:17.010> shows<00:04:17.489> them<00:04:17.849> it<00:04:18.479> makes<00:04:18.690> it

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
because it shows them it makes it

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.899 
because it shows them it makes it
transparent<00:04:19.560> how<00:04:19.739> how<00:04:20.099> to<00:04:20.159> write<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.700> way

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
transparent how how to write that way

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.200 
transparent how how to write that way
and<00:04:21.599> that<00:04:21.810> fits<00:04:22.109> beautifully<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.919> what

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
and that fits beautifully to what

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.779 
and that fits beautifully to what
already<00:04:23.509> doing<00:04:23.660> yeah<00:04:24.139> yeah<00:04:24.740> it'll<00:04:25.490> be<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.639> good

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
already doing yeah yeah it'll be a good

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:33.089 
already doing yeah yeah it'll be a good
transition<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:31.220> know<00:04:31.310> there's<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.759> lot<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.210> do
