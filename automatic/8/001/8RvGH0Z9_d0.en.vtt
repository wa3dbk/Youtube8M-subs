I'm Erin with golfer breaking systems
and<00:00:01.770> today<00:00:01.860> we<00:00:02.220> are<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.460> to<00:00:02.520> do<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.669> little

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
and today we are going to do a little

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.350 
and today we are going to do a little
install<00:00:03.480> on<00:00:03.750> some<00:00:04.680> brake<00:00:04.859> rotors<00:00:07.519> so<00:00:08.519> what<00:00:09.240> we

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
install on some brake rotors so what we

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.720 
install on some brake rotors so what we
wanted<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.660> start<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> bear<00:00:10.920> wheel<00:00:11.160> no

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730

because<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.350> will<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.650> reusing<00:00:25.949> those<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
because you will be reusing those you

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.070 
because you will be reusing those you
want<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> take<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.269> Loctite<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:27.930> comes

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
want to take the the Loctite that comes

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320 
want to take the the Loctite that comes
stock<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.560> those<00:00:28.710> off<00:00:28.890> normal<00:00:29.820> wire<00:00:30.000> brush

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
stock on those off normal wire brush

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.440 
stock on those off normal wire brush
will<00:00:30.539> work<00:00:30.570> for<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.850> as<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.149> we

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
will work for that as you can see we

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.900 
will work for that as you can see we
already<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.870> have<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.320> rotor<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.800> on<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
already do have one rotor on on the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.060 
already do have one rotor on on the
backside<00:00:36.329> here<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:37.170> show<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.860> we're

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
backside here to show you how we're

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
backside here to show you how we're
going<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.640> offset<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> other

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
going to do the offset with the other

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.690 
going to do the offset with the other
side<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.170> want<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> make<00:00:40.530> sure<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
side we want to make sure that the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.220 
side we want to make sure that the
rotors<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.120> offset<00:00:42.420> from<00:00:42.600> side<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> side<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
rotors are offset from side to side and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.990 
rotors are offset from side to side and
what<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.530> does<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:43.980> you're<00:00:44.760> going

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
what that does is because you're going

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
what that does is because you're going
from<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.329> round<00:00:45.660> rotor<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> wave<00:00:46.500> rotor

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
from a round rotor to a wave rotor

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.450 
from a round rotor to a wave rotor
there's<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.160> different

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
there's going to be different

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
there's going to be different
characteristics<00:00:48.059> between<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.539> two<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.989> we

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
characteristics between the two and we

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.600 
characteristics between the two and we
want<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> make<00:00:49.739> sure<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> wave<00:00:50.250> pattern

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
want to make sure that the wave pattern

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.920 
want to make sure that the wave pattern
is<00:00:50.730> offset<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.750> any

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
is offset so that you don't have any

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
is offset so that you don't have any
type<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> vibration<00:00:52.379> once<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> rotors

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
type of vibration once we put the rotors

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.229 
type of vibration once we put the rotors
on<00:00:55.280> so<00:00:56.280> we're<00:00:56.370> gonna<00:00:56.489> lay<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> down

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
on so we're gonna lay it down

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.389 
on so we're gonna lay it down
you've<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.260> your<00:00:58.469> rotor<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> rotors

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
you've got your rotor now the rotors

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.670 
you've got your rotor now the rotors
that<00:00:59.430> we're<00:00:59.699> using<00:00:59.879> today<00:01:00.149> are<00:01:00.480> our<00:01:00.680> Superbike

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that we're using today are our Superbike

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.979 
that we're using today are our Superbike
rotors<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.399> they<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.640> directional<00:01:03.180> if<00:01:03.870> you

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
rotors so they are directional if you

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.810 
rotors so they are directional if you
have<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> standard<00:01:04.470> set<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.640> going<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
have the standard set it's not going to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
have the standard set it's not going to
matter<00:01:05.970> which<00:01:06.270> side<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> put<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.170> first<00:01:07.409> left

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
matter which side you put on first left

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.050 
matter which side you put on first left
or<00:01:07.860> right<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:08.939> no

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
or right there because there's no

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.000 
or right there because there's no
direction<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:10.200> with<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.710> already

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
direction but with this one we already

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.609 
direction but with this one we already
have<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.659> right<00:01:12.659> side<00:01:12.900> rotor<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.500> right

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
have the right side rotor on so right

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.810 
have the right side rotor on so right
now<00:01:13.770> we're<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> put<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> left<00:01:14.460> side<00:01:14.670> on

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
now we're going to put the left side on

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.960 
now we're going to put the left side on
the<00:01:16.310> Superbike<00:01:17.310> rotors<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.939> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the Superbike rotors do have a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.429 
the Superbike rotors do have a
directional<00:01:18.450> arrow<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.869> them<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.200> you'll<00:01:19.320> be

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
directional arrow on them so you'll be

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.690 
directional arrow on them so you'll be
able<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> tell<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.280> arrow<00:01:20.490> is

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
able to tell them that that arrow is

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.920 
able to tell them that that arrow is
going<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:20.970> going<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> direction<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
going to be going in the direction that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.210 
going to be going in the direction that
the<00:01:22.170> wheel<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.560> spinning<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> want

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
the wheel will be spinning so you want

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.109 
the wheel will be spinning so you want
to<00:01:26.280> line<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.640> holes

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
to line up your holes

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.480 
to line up your holes
now<00:01:27.659> when<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.840> say<00:01:28.049> offset<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.130> want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> make

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
now when I say offset you want to make

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.179 
now when I say offset you want to make
sure<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> outside<00:01:30.180> wave<00:01:30.659> pattern<00:01:31.189> from

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
sure that the outside wave pattern from

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.710 
sure that the outside wave pattern from
the<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:32.729> side<00:01:32.939> rotor<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.420> left<00:01:33.600> side

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
the right side rotor to the left side

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.630 
the right side rotor to the left side
rotor<00:01:33.990> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.860> make<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
rotor if you can make it so that the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
rotor if you can make it so that the
peak<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> rotor<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.689> both<00:01:36.990> sides<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
peak of the rotor on both sides is

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.249 
peak of the rotor on both sides is
offset<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.400> say<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.210> your<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:40.079> left

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
offset so say this is your your left

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
offset so say this is your your left
side<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.770> right<00:01:40.890> side<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> want<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.610> peak

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
side on the right side you want the peak

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.910 
side on the right side you want the peak

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that if the carrier lines up in the in

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.389 
that if the carrier lines up in the in
the<00:01:54.149> center<00:01:54.390> here<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:55.890> offset<00:01:56.250> one

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the center here so that your offset one

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.230 
the center here so that your offset one
way<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:56.640> another

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
way or another

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.319 
way or another
install<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> new<00:01:58.079> rotor

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.370 

now<00:02:03.329> when<00:02:03.479> you're<00:02:03.600> taking<00:02:03.810> them<00:02:03.929> down<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.259> do

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
now when you're taking them down you do

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.050 
now when you're taking them down you do
want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> use<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.340> know<00:02:05.399> similar<00:02:05.729> pattern

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
want to use a you know similar pattern

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
want to use a you know similar pattern
to<00:02:06.090> when<00:02:06.329> your<00:02:06.479> roof<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:07.319> know<00:02:07.409> removing<00:02:07.740> or

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
to when your roof you know removing or

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.880 
to when your roof you know removing or
putting<00:02:08.610> your<00:02:08.789> wheel<00:02:08.940> back<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.179> your<00:02:09.479> car<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
putting your wheel back on your car and

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.360 
putting your wheel back on your car and
and<00:02:10.890> use<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.940> star<00:02:12.150> type<00:02:12.390> pattern

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and use a you know the star type pattern

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.400 
and use a you know the star type pattern
so<00:02:14.810> we're<00:02:15.810> just<00:02:15.840> going<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.080> torque<00:02:16.290> them<00:02:16.349> down

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so we're just going to torque them down

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.750 
so we're just going to torque them down
a<00:02:16.560> little<00:02:16.709> bit<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.069> begin<00:02:17.160> with<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.700> then

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
a little bit to begin with and then

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.050 
a little bit to begin with and then
we'll<00:02:17.970> we'll<00:02:18.569> use<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.160> OEM<00:02:20.160> spec<00:02:20.549> from<00:02:20.910> then

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
we'll we'll use the OEM spec from then

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.780 
we'll we'll use the OEM spec from then
on<00:02:26.569> so<00:02:27.569> we've<00:02:28.440> got<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.190> second<00:02:29.670> rotor

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
on so we've got the the second rotor

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.199 
on so we've got the the second rotor
installed<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.769> can<00:02:31.890> see<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:33.060> wave

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
installed and you can see that the wave

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.180 
installed and you can see that the wave
pattern<00:02:33.599> itself<00:02:33.870> is<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.590> slightly<00:02:34.860> off<00:02:35.160> but

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
pattern itself is is slightly off but

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.059 
pattern itself is is slightly off but
the<00:02:35.940> center<00:02:36.239> section<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.690> carrier<00:02:37.019> is<00:02:37.230> is

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
the center section the carrier is is

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.830 
the center section the carrier is is
offset<00:02:38.579> from<00:02:38.760> one<00:02:39.000> side<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.390> other<00:02:39.480> side

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
offset from one side to the other side

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.920 
offset from one side to the other side
and<00:02:40.709> that's<00:02:40.920> again<00:02:41.519> is<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:42.000> minimize<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
and that's again is to minimize the

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.030 
and that's again is to minimize the
amount<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.200> vibration<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.739> you're<00:02:43.890> going<00:02:44.010> to

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
amount of vibration that you're going to

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.949 
amount of vibration that you're going to
feel<00:02:44.280> from<00:02:44.549> actual<00:02:44.849> pattern<00:02:45.299> itself<00:02:45.599> on<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
feel from actual pattern itself on the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.990 
feel from actual pattern itself on the
brake<00:02:46.170> pads<00:02:46.379> another<00:02:47.129> step<00:02:47.430> when<00:02:47.640> doing<00:02:47.910> an

brake pads another step when doing an
install<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.660> want<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.840> make<00:02:48.930> sure<00:02:48.959> that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
install you want to make sure that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.990 
install you want to make sure that
they're<00:02:49.349> offset<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.190> do<00:02:50.340> want<00:02:50.519> to<00:02:50.579> have<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
they're offset you do want to have the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000 
they're offset you do want to have the
wheel<00:02:51.239> rebalance<00:02:51.870> most<00:02:52.109> the<00:02:52.230> times<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.920> know

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
wheel rebalance most the times you know

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.860 
wheel rebalance most the times you know
guys<00:02:53.459> will<00:02:53.640> change<00:02:53.879> their<00:02:54.060> tires<00:02:54.329> at<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.660> same

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
guys will change their tires at the same

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.630 
guys will change their tires at the same
time<00:02:55.079> when<00:02:55.260> they're<00:02:55.349> doing<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.709> install<00:02:56.069> so

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
time when they're doing this install so

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.789 
time when they're doing this install so
it's<00:02:56.940> always<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.390> perfect<00:02:57.780> time<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
it's always a perfect time to have the

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.110 
it's always a perfect time to have the
wheel<00:02:58.950> rebalanced<00:03:01.040> okay<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.099> now<00:03:02.640> we<00:03:02.700> have<00:03:02.940> our

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
wheel rebalanced okay so now we have our

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.339 
wheel rebalanced okay so now we have our
rotor<00:03:03.299> torque<00:03:03.599> down<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.139> OEM
