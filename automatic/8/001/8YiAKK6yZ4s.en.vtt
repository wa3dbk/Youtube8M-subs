Isaac I can smell the contaminated air
from<00:00:13.530> here<00:00:13.849> it's<00:00:14.849> spreading<00:00:15.389> faster<00:00:15.870> than<00:00:15.900> I

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
from here it's spreading faster than I

from here it's spreading faster than I
expected<00:00:16.230> I'm<00:00:16.890> trying<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.940> isolate<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.510> but

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260

it's<00:00:19.410> not<00:00:19.560> going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.770> buy<00:00:19.920> us<00:00:20.070> much<00:00:20.250> time<00:00:20.660> we

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it's not going to buy us much time we

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.470 
it's not going to buy us much time we
have<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.199> thing<00:00:22.350> off<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.920> ship<00:00:23.480> the
