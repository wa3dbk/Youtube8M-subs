00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the core players and then you realize

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.310 
the core players and then you realize
that<00:01:26.060> about<00:01:27.140> 18,000<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:29.070> 40,000<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:31.290> i

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that about 18,000 out of 40,000 that i

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.499 
that about 18,000 out of 40,000 that i
would<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.740> say<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.009> example<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.790> 80,000

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
would just say for example not 80,000

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.530 
would just say for example not 80,000
but<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.079> 40,000<00:01:34.920> maybe<00:01:35.070> like<00:01:35.450> 18,000<00:01:36.450> are

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
but out of 40,000 maybe like 18,000 are

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.499 
but out of 40,000 maybe like 18,000 are
in<00:01:36.689> core<00:01:36.960> gameplay<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:38.210> guess<00:01:39.210> what<00:01:39.390> I'm<00:01:39.479> saying

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
in core gameplay I guess what I'm saying

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.160 
in core gameplay I guess what I'm saying
here<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.579> that<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:42.180> sell<00:01:42.479> yourself<00:01:42.659> short

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
here is that don't sell yourself short

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.580 
here is that don't sell yourself short
on<00:01:43.890> playing<00:01:44.790> call<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> duty<00:01:45.180> ghosts<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:46.439> have

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
on playing call of duty ghosts you have

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.550 
on playing call of duty ghosts you have
to<00:01:46.740> remember<00:01:47.009> call<00:01:47.399> duty<00:01:47.640> ghost<00:01:48.149> was<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.170> game

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
to remember call duty ghost was the game

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.429

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.380 
it they got rid of that and people
actually<00:02:01.229> die<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.829> mean<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> bug<00:02:02.610> there<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
actually die I mean the bug there that

was a bug in the game in that was

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
was a bug in the game in that was
created<00:02:06.689> by<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> trailer<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.649> which<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.129> know
