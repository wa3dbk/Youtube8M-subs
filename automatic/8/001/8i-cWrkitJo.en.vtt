cinematic director on this project

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.930 
cinematic director on this project
basically<00:00:34.930> when<00:00:35.769> we<00:00:35.890> started<00:00:36.250> on<00:00:36.370> Episode<00:00:36.730> two

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
basically when we started on Episode two

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.049 
basically when we started on Episode two
we<00:00:37.480> went<00:00:37.690> back<00:00:37.989> to<00:00:38.320> the<00:00:38.890> drawing<00:00:39.160> board<00:00:39.400> forced

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
we went back to the drawing board forced

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.229 
we went back to the drawing board forced
to<00:00:40.180> decide<00:00:40.540> a<00:00:40.870> new<00:00:41.739> scenario<00:00:42.430> in<00:00:42.790> your<00:00:42.820> mission

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
to decide a new scenario in your mission

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.500 
to decide a new scenario in your mission
and<00:00:43.420> we<00:00:44.350> kind<00:00:44.830> of<00:00:44.979> looked<00:00:45.250> at<00:00:45.850> player<00:00:46.239> feedback

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
and we kind of looked at player feedback

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.500 
and we kind of looked at player feedback
for<00:00:46.960> episode<00:00:47.260> 1<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:48.820> looked<00:00:49.000> at<00:00:49.119> like<00:00:49.299> what

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
for episode 1 and we looked at like what

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.539 
for episode 1 and we looked at like what
can<00:00:49.720> we<00:00:49.839> do<00:00:49.989> better<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.500> I<00:00:50.589> think<00:00:50.830> when<00:00:51.129> things

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:51.549 
can we do better and I think when things

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:54.960 
can we do better and I think when things
be<00:00:51.839> noticed<00:00:52.839> immediately<00:00:53.080> was<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:54.519> most<00:00:54.850> of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
be noticed immediately was that most of

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.820 
be noticed immediately was that most of
our<00:00:55.119> encounters<00:00:55.629> in<00:00:55.659> episode<00:00:56.110> 1<00:00:56.320> while<00:00:56.650> they

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
our encounters in episode 1 while they

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.549 
our encounters in episode 1 while they
were<00:00:56.890> pretty<00:00:57.159> fun<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.729> they<00:00:58.449> gave<00:00:58.629> plenty<00:00:59.350> of

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
were pretty fun and they gave plenty of

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.130 
were pretty fun and they gave plenty of
bang<00:00:59.860> for<00:00:59.890> your<00:01:00.220> buck<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:01.600> were<00:01:01.659> pretty

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
bang for your buck they were pretty

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.600 
bang for your buck they were pretty
linear<00:01:02.500> there<00:01:02.949> wasn't<00:01:03.220> a<00:01:03.280> lot<00:01:03.430> of<00:01:03.549> different

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
linear there wasn't a lot of different

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.109 
linear there wasn't a lot of different
options<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:05.070> tackle<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.159> certain<00:01:06.460> encounter<00:01:06.939> so

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
options to tackle a certain encounter so

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.330 
options to tackle a certain encounter so
we<00:01:07.960> really<00:01:08.140> want<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.530> try<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.830> nail<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.280> down

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
we really want to try and nail that down

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.490 
we really want to try and nail that down
during<00:01:10.150> our<00:01:10.360> modeling<00:01:10.780> case<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.380> would

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
during our modeling case you would

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.230 
during our modeling case you would
really<00:01:11.680> start<00:01:11.860> from<00:01:12.009> small<00:01:12.340> roughs<00:01:12.610> on<00:01:12.880> any

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
really start from small roughs on any

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.390 
really start from small roughs on any
one<00:01:13.480> of<00:01:13.540> our<00:01:13.720> views<00:01:13.990> views<00:01:14.290> this<00:01:15.040> gives<00:01:15.280> us

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
one of our views views this gives us

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.130 
one of our views views this gives us
complete<00:01:15.910> control<00:01:16.270> over<00:01:16.390> how<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.780> level

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
complete control over how the level

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.050 
complete control over how the level
plays<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.650> allows<00:01:17.830> us<00:01:17.980> to<00:01:18.100> modify<00:01:18.400> it<00:01:18.550> easily

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
plays and allows us to modify it easily

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.720 
plays and allows us to modify it easily
and<00:01:19.090> improve<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.600> layout<00:01:20.010> editor<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.490> we've

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
and improve the layout editor to we've

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.100 
and improve the layout editor to we've
really<00:01:21.970> pushed<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.270> limit<00:01:22.480> for<00:01:22.630> how<00:01:22.780> big<00:01:22.990> are

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
really pushed the limit for how big are

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.940 
really pushed the limit for how big are

were<00:01:35.470> several<00:01:35.620> main<00:01:36.430> encounters<00:01:37.360> actually

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
were several main encounters actually

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.770 
were several main encounters actually
where<00:01:38.050> we<00:01:38.170> even<00:01:39.100> completely<00:01:39.490> scrapped<00:01:40.300> what

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
where we even completely scrapped what

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.070 
where we even completely scrapped what
we<00:01:40.960> had<00:01:41.140> when<00:01:41.620> were<00:01:41.770> simply<00:01:42.159> not<00:01:42.310> have<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:43.080> we

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
we had when were simply not have you we

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.710 
we had when were simply not have you we
would<00:01:44.229> start<00:01:44.500> completely<00:01:45.130> over<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.880> think

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
would start completely over I think

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.540 
would start completely over I think
fally<00:01:46.990> battle<00:01:47.500> which<00:01:47.740> is<00:01:47.860> one<00:01:48.040> of<00:01:48.070> our<00:01:48.280> main

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
fally battle which is one of our main

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.410 
fally battle which is one of our main
larger<00:01:49.479> scale<00:01:50.050> vehicle<00:01:50.650> battles<00:01:51.460> I'm<00:01:52.180> not

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
larger scale vehicle battles I'm not

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.000 
larger scale vehicle battles I'm not
sure<00:01:52.630> how<00:01:52.780> much<00:01:52.900> time<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.290> actually<00:01:53.440> redid<00:01:53.950> it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
sure how much time to actually redid it

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.820 
sure how much time to actually redid it
but<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.060> was<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.180> lot<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.420> times<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:55.990> think<00:01:56.290> in<00:01:56.710> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
but it was a lot of times I think in the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.980 
but it was a lot of times I think in the
end<00:01:56.890> it<00:01:57.430> took<00:01:57.610> us<00:01:57.729> an<00:01:57.909> extra<00:01:57.970> time<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.780> get

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
end it took us an extra time to get

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.280 
end it took us an extra time to get
everything<00:01:59.770> down<00:02:00.370> to<00:02:00.580> a<00:02:00.970> certain<00:02:01.810> quality

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
everything down to a certain quality

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.370 
everything down to a certain quality
level<00:02:02.740> that<00:02:02.830> we<00:02:02.950> want<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.250> reach<00:02:03.520> but<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.810> was

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
level that we want to reach but I was

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.480 
level that we want to reach but I was
definitely<00:02:05.530> worth<00:02:06.010> it

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
definitely worth it

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.400 
definitely worth it

a<00:02:16.319> cinematic<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:17.040> look<00:02:17.250> at<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> script<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.090> I

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
a cinematic I look at the script and I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.510 
a cinematic I look at the script and I
think<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.319> how<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.530> writer<00:02:19.860> would<00:02:20.400> have

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
think about how the writer would have

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.250 
think about how the writer would have
wanted<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> look<00:02:21.240> like<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.720> then<00:02:21.750> I'll

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
wanted it to look like and then I'll

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.890 
wanted it to look like and then I'll
think<00:02:22.470> about<00:02:22.500> how<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:23.040> wanted<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.459> look<00:02:23.580> like

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
think about how I wanted to look like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.820 
think about how I wanted to look like
combined<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.110> what's<00:02:25.380> actually<00:02:25.590> possible

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
combined with what's actually possible

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.370 
combined with what's actually possible
to<00:02:26.370> do<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.450> resources<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.170> tagged

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
to do with the resources and tagged
