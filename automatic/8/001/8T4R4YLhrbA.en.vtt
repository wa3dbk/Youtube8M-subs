web<00:03:26.920> loops<00:03:27.220> on<00:03:27.520> each<00:03:27.670> side<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:32.610> then<00:03:34.860> we

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
web loops on each side and then we

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.770 
web loops on each side and then we
connect<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:38.040> top<00:03:39.040> strap<00:03:39.370> together<00:03:39.780> now

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
connect that top strap together now

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.680 
connect that top strap together now
these<00:03:40.989> straps<00:03:41.410> here<00:03:42.270> determine<00:03:43.270> how<00:03:43.450> close

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
these straps here determine how close

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.810 
these straps here determine how close
the<00:03:44.050> bones<00:03:44.230> pockets<00:03:44.650> are<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.010> chair<00:03:45.310> so<00:03:45.610> if<00:03:45.700> you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
the bones pockets are to chair so if you

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.430 
the bones pockets are to chair so if you
want<00:03:46.000> a<00:03:46.120> bit<00:03:46.239> more<00:03:46.269> air<00:03:46.570> gap<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.050> can<00:03:47.230> loosen

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
want a bit more air gap you can loosen

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.500 
want a bit more air gap you can loosen
those<00:03:47.680> off<00:03:47.860> a<00:03:47.890> bit<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:48.550> they<00:03:48.670> hang<00:03:48.850> forward<00:03:49.180> and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
those off a bit so they hang forward and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.190 
those off a bit so they hang forward and
there's<00:03:50.200> an<00:03:50.290> air<00:03:50.440> gap<00:03:50.620> here<00:03:51.900> same<00:03:52.900> on<00:03:53.080> the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
there's an air gap here same on the

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.500 
there's an air gap here same on the
other<00:03:53.230> side

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.080 

and<00:03:57.599> these<00:03:58.470> straps<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.430> don't<00:03:59.670> need<00:03:59.909> to

and these straps you don't need to

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.490 
and these straps you don't need to
tighten<00:04:01.370> they're<00:04:02.370> just<00:04:02.610> there<00:04:03.599> so<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.409> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
tighten they're just there so that the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.110 
tighten they're just there so that the
balance<00:04:04.769> pockets<00:04:05.189> are<00:04:05.400> easier<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:05.790> put<00:04:06.000> on

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
balance pockets are easier to put on

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.850 
balance pockets are easier to put on
their<00:04:06.360> vertical<00:04:06.769> when<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:08.390> put<00:04:09.390> them<00:04:09.540> on<00:04:09.860> last

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
their vertical when you put them on last

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.580 
their vertical when you put them on last
thing<00:04:11.220> to<00:04:11.430> do<00:04:11.579> is<00:04:12.799> to<00:04:15.049> clip<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.229> sternum

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
thing to do is to clip the sternum

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.099

straps<00:04:16.889> together<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.780> next

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
straps together in the next

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.850 
straps together in the next
configuration<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:21.109> need<00:04:22.109> to<00:04:22.229> loosen<00:04:22.440> it<00:04:22.710> off<00:04:22.830> a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
configuration I need to loosen it off a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.710 
configuration I need to loosen it off a
bit<00:04:24.050> these<00:04:25.050> straps<00:04:25.440> are<00:04:26.060> it's<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.180> continuous

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
bit these straps are it's a continuous

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.439 
bit these straps are it's a continuous
loop<00:04:28.100> sternum<00:04:29.100> strap<00:04:29.400> up<00:04:29.789> to<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> shoulder

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
loop sternum strap up to the shoulder

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.950 
loop sternum strap up to the shoulder
strap<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.910> so<00:04:32.910> if<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.120> tighten<00:04:33.360> this<00:04:33.690> you're

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
strap and so if you tighten this you're

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.810 
strap and so if you tighten this you're
tightening<00:04:34.169> both<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.979> chest<00:04:35.250> strap<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.729> the

tightening both the chest strap and the
shoulder<00:04:36.180> strap<00:04:36.449> so<00:04:36.710> normally<00:04:37.710> we<00:04:37.800> loosen

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
shoulder strap so normally we loosen

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.129 
shoulder strap so normally we loosen
that<00:04:38.370> off<00:04:38.580> before<00:04:38.850> we<00:04:39.150> put<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.419> back<00:04:39.570> on<00:04:39.600> and

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
that off before we put the back on and

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.219 
that off before we put the back on and
this<00:04:40.979> system<00:04:41.160> allows<00:04:41.610> us<00:04:41.639> to<00:04:41.880> move<00:04:42.229> completely

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
this system allows us to move completely

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.100 
this system allows us to move completely
freely<00:04:44.160> and<00:04:44.880> yet<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> PEC<00:04:45.419> is<00:04:45.570> completely

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
freely and yet the PEC is completely

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.260 
freely and yet the PEC is completely
stable<00:04:46.350> on<00:04:46.650> your<00:04:46.680> back<00:04:48.470> now<00:04:49.470> we<00:04:49.530> can<00:04:50.090> get<00:04:51.090> at

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270
