00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.480
 I 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.440
 hello people stay here romy commenting and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.969
 good that what I bring you today 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.789
 I bring a film by teams 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.410
 totally to russian of a spectacular 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.869
 For me, it cost me a lot 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.250
 get me out the truth is that we stay in 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 this was going to raise a water for the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
 same week it delays me a bit or it's me 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.250
 the delayed and did not delay me worth or 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.140
 I do not know, I'm climbing marshall 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.730
 as I'm taking out the sub 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.589
 because you already know that I have a lot of 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.989
 fashions but what I want is to go up more 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:40.890
 quite how to remove a difficulty 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.629
 added ok we're in spite of what 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.600
 what I told you is total usera 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.269
 diving to sack I take the app 90 m 1 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.030
 silenced with extended chargers worth 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:53.070
 is a clear killing weapon is not going to be 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.510
 a weapon to throw flowers there is vis that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.129
 I was barely there to kill myself, you bastard 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.409
 as a single team in Dolo 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.439
 they are all the time like this they throw the biggest 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.140
 of the part most of the game 

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:05.430
 like rats is worth hidden and what's said 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.049
 this is a very difficult game 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.549
 because and you will say good because it is difficult 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.820
 be it by teams are all banks 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.110
 Well were not as Mancos ballet 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.060
 press a little banks but the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 difficulty is that your team has 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.400
 that kill little 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.570
 and you do not fail one and all the time or 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.310
 it is all broken killing because 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.840
 you know that there are 75 casualties in total that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.010
 you have to make an ip or one should 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.080
 validate but in the end 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.730
 surely he had dropped the r1 what 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.230
 I would have to put it later when it was over 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.030
 the game because he did not know how to shoot 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.130
 well let's see what we said 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.930
 here are two moments of tension 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.550
 pretty fat but the truth is that 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.900
 where is a quite difficult map for 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 take out a motorcycle and more doing it for 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.830
 teams said what I was telling you 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.330
 there are 75 casualties that the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.180
 team in total then you have to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.190
 do 24 and without dying once you die 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.780
 it is almost impossible because for example 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.340
 now I die and I could not have to 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.420
 do the other casualties that remain in the 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.979
 I start there we see another one is and nothing 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.600
 he is a master I speak that said I love 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.410
 ok I loved it when I took it out 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.410
 I liked it 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.300
 But first a small subsection 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.759
 to explain what I downloaded a 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.490
 osa downloaded in created an application 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.770
 where you download it and it 's for 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.210
 google chrome and for firefox and warns you 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.550
 when you have uploaded a video and so on it is a 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.170
 icon that appears above on the right in 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.460
 the search engine and I will not leave it in the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.530
 description to download it from a 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.870
 video about it and nobody else 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.870
 nonsense we open in what we are 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.840
 it's a very, very, very fast I think it's 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.909
 in less than three minutes 50 if not 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.280
 I think it is wrong that haunts 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.620
 there the video lasts 4 minutes so 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.269
 if that is more or less what lasts here 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.650
 we see that caught the gentlemen back 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.420
 because I knew they were here in the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.250
 backing from him answer dome is pretty 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.760
 laser it simple map very 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.170
 small the responsos very fast and like 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.730
 You see there was someone you know who knew 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.290
 play and of course it was quite difficult 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.960
 catch them all in the back 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.330
 then I played a lot like now 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.920
 villains in front then it's the worst 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.930
 you can go to get you a love 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.710
 you have to catch respawn not catch 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.840
 response 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.900
 as for example now that time could 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.150
 have killed and their 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.430
 at your command and we will see what you 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.530
 he said is very difficult and try to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.360
 catch it always in the back here 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.220
 I think I was missing now and I'm missing 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.540
 one and it's the typical moment of tension not 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.900
 he was telling us but he knew that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.579
 there were a few little ones and we have 6,900 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.290
 points are missing four losses and I say but 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.580
 what do I do here if I leave here grave I'm going to 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.560
 go for them because if I do not take it out 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.470
 I take it out to kim and islam or the shot 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.650
 they kill me and the game ends badly is the 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.270
 worst game the worst end of a game 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.580
 what can you expect but good is 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.770
 pretty good to me I like love are 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.720
 very fast very much russes is 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.880
 incredible I liked very comfortable 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.680
 that unexpected ending that I did not 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.180
 I was not expecting it because I knew that 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.650
 behind me there was nobody but I think 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.780
 that there is a stray bullet out there that I 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.580
 kill I have no idea but I hope 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.140
 what you liked is pretty good 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.330
 very cool, I think she was entertained in 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.739
 to vote it and the mirrors I hope the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.090
 next fashions next week a 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.090
 greeting and see you later
