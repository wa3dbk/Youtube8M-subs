00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
time being it like i just said and the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.060 
time being it like i just said and the
mall<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.600> america<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.140> huge<00:02:31.560> it's<00:02:31.800> got<00:02:31.950> like

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
mall of america is huge it's got like

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.680 
mall of america is huge it's got like
four<00:02:32.340> or<00:02:32.430> five<00:02:32.490> levels<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.150> an<00:02:33.270> absolutely

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
four or five levels it's an absolutely

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.810 
four or five levels it's an absolutely
gianormous<00:02:34.110> place<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.460> was<00:02:35.610> kind<00:02:35.730> of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
gianormous place and so I was kind of

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.210 
gianormous place and so I was kind of
overwhelmed<00:02:36.540> by<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.720> entire<00:02:37.110> thing<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.560> for

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
overwhelmed by the entire thing and for

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.620 
overwhelmed by the entire thing and for
some<00:02:38.370> reason<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.850> thought<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.240> would<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> good

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
some reason I thought it would be a good

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.540 
some reason I thought it would be a good
idea<00:02:39.720> to<00:02:39.990> go<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.620> food<00:02:40.770> court<00:02:40.830> first<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
idea to go to the food court first and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.680 
idea to go to the food court first and
I'm<00:02:41.670> all<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.910> I've<00:02:42.030> never<00:02:42.240> been<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.600> before
