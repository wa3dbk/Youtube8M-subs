00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.370 

looks<00:02:16.760> really<00:02:17.060> easy<00:02:17.180> on<00:02:17.540> your<00:02:17.930> mouth<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.680> um

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.220 

so<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:28.550> trick<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.300> is<00:02:29.510> when<00:02:29.900> you're<00:02:30.020> coming

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
so the trick to it is when you're coming

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.470 
so the trick to it is when you're coming
back<00:02:30.350> up<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.800> put<00:02:31.010> your<00:02:31.160> hand<00:02:31.460> in<00:02:32.090> between

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
back up you put your hand in between

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.500 
back up you put your hand in between
your<00:02:32.840> legs<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.770> that<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.670> one<00:02:37.940> hand<00:02:38.180> still

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
your legs like that and one hand still

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:50.290 
your legs like that and one hand still
on<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.870> ground<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:43.570> put<00:02:44.710> like<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:49.790> gets<00:02:50.090> all

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
on the ground and put like it gets all

00:02:50.300 --> 00:03:07.840 
on the ground and put like it gets all
your<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.930> lot<00:03:06.500> of<00:03:06.650> weight<00:03:06.800> on<00:03:06.830> your<00:03:07.070> back<00:03:07.250> which

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
your a lot of weight on your back which

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.630 
your a lot of weight on your back which
isn't<00:03:08.030> good<00:03:08.330> for<00:03:08.570> it<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:13.160> was<00:03:13.370> pretty

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
isn't good for it so that was pretty

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.350
