PV 90s and I have to say I kind of
thought<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.510> for<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.500> bit<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
thought about this for a little bit I

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.160 
thought about this for a little bit I
experimented<00:00:33.149> around<00:00:33.600> with<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> kimball

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
experimented around with the kimball

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.490 
experimented around with the kimball
fmg9<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.610> was<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:36.210> best<00:00:36.420> attempt<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.050> did

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079

this<00:00:40.230> series<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.590> all<00:00:40.800> about<00:00:40.829> but<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.420> my

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this series is all about but this was my

fmg9 s and I have to say it's very
tricky<00:00:46.800> there<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.280> number<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.550> their<00:00:47.730> ways

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
here but there's I would say two

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.410 
here but there's I would say two

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
frustrating but you have to keep in mind

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.719 
frustrating but you have to keep in mind
that<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> get<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> MOAB<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.460> have

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that if you want to get a MOAB you have

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.359 
that if you want to get a MOAB you have

three minutes left I'm not really that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.999 
three minutes left I'm not really that
nervous<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:02.280> now<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:03.299> strategy<00:02:03.600> is

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
nervous right now this strategy is

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.649 
nervous right now this strategy is
basically<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.820> thought<00:02:06.149> throughout<00:02:06.509> this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
basically what I thought throughout this

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.570 
basically what I thought throughout this
game<00:02:06.840> play<00:02:07.049> was<00:02:07.200> alright<00:02:07.560> eventually<00:02:07.680> they're

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
game play was alright eventually they're

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.010 
game play was alright eventually they're
going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.849> start<00:02:09.000> coming<00:02:09.300> about<00:02:09.450> halfway<00:02:09.750> up

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
going to start coming about halfway up

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.630 
going to start coming about halfway up
this<00:02:10.410> ramp<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.190> that's

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
this ramp here and that's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.400 
this ramp here and that's
we'll<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.970> able<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.240> have<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> good<00:02:13.110> clear<00:02:13.380> shot

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
we'll be able to have a good clear shot

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.800 
we'll be able to have a good clear shot
a<00:02:13.770> nice<00:02:14.220> range<00:02:14.580> I'll<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.240> able<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.450> pick<00:02:15.600> off<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
a nice range I'll be able to pick off a

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.350 
a nice range I'll be able to pick off a
few<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.530> maybe<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> time<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.300> I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
few and maybe if the time is right if I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.090 
few and maybe if the time is right if I
have<00:02:18.480> enough<00:02:18.660> time<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> have<00:02:19.230> enough<00:02:19.470> ammo

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
have enough time and have enough ammo

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.740 
have enough time and have enough ammo
and<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:20.790> they're<00:02:20.880> coming<00:02:21.000> fast<00:02:21.330> enough<00:02:21.450> I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
and if they're coming fast enough I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.510 
and if they're coming fast enough I
could<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.230> able<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.470> get<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> MOAB<00:02:22.950> now<00:02:23.459> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
could be able to get a MOAB now the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520 
could be able to get a MOAB now the
other<00:02:23.819> strategy<00:02:24.510> like<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.110> said<00:02:25.170> there's<00:02:25.380> two

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
other strategy like I said there's two

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.080 
other strategy like I said there's two
different<00:02:25.680> strategies<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.370> strategy<00:02:26.850> and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
different strategies this strategy and

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.360 
different strategies this strategy and
then<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.360> other<00:02:27.390> strategy<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.340> what<00:02:29.959> OTB

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
then the other strategy is what OTB

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.370 
then the other strategy is what OTB
Doogie<00:02:32.370> OTB<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.420> what<00:02:33.840> he's<00:02:33.959> doing<00:02:34.230> down<00:02:34.350> there

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
Doogie OTB is what he's doing down there

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.770 
Doogie OTB is what he's doing down there
he<00:02:34.950> actually<00:02:35.160> ends<00:02:35.640> up<00:02:35.730> getting<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.180> MOAB<00:02:36.420> in

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
he actually ends up getting a MOAB in

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.290 
he actually ends up getting a MOAB in
this<00:02:36.930> game<00:02:37.110> play<00:02:37.290> as<00:02:37.440> well<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> I'm<00:02:38.730> very<00:02:39.120> very

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
this game play as well and I'm very very

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.780 
this game play as well and I'm very very
very<00:02:40.080> surprised<00:02:40.650> he<00:02:40.890> survived<00:02:41.250> as<00:02:41.400> long<00:02:41.430> as<00:02:41.700> he

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
very surprised he survived as long as he

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.260 
very surprised he survived as long as he
did<00:02:42.000> any<00:02:42.510> time<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:42.989> am<00:02:43.350> down<00:02:43.560> there<00:02:43.860> halfway

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
did any time I am down there halfway

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.970 
did any time I am down there halfway
down<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.330> ramp<00:02:45.720> or<00:02:46.020> farther<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.620> know<00:02:46.709> closer

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
down the ramp or farther you know closer

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.520 
down the ramp or farther you know closer
toward<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> map<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.880> end<00:02:48.690> up<00:02:48.840> getting<00:02:49.110> throwing

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
toward the map I end up getting throwing

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.220 
toward the map I end up getting throwing
knife<00:02:49.709> or<00:02:50.300> somehow<00:02:51.300> knifes<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.110> know

knife or somehow knifes you know
randomly<00:02:52.800> they<00:02:53.220> end<00:02:53.340> up<00:02:53.459> jumping<00:02:54.000> toward<00:02:54.390> me

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
randomly they end up jumping toward me

going about this this this whole

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.090 
going about this this this whole
strategy<00:03:42.030> completely<00:03:42.690> wrong<00:03:42.930> as<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.799> can<00:03:43.890> see

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
strategy completely wrong as you can see

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.440 
strategy completely wrong as you can see
there's<00:03:44.340> only<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.549> minute<00:03:44.970> left<00:03:45.000> in<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.360> game

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
there's only a minute left in this game

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.569 
there's only a minute left in this game
and<00:03:45.810> right<00:03:46.350> about<00:03:46.590> here<00:03:46.920> i<00:03:46.980> started<00:03:47.519> getting

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
and right about here i started getting

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.199 
and right about here i started getting
very<00:03:48.030> nervous<00:03:48.269> because<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:49.370> I<00:03:50.370> can't<00:03:50.850> really

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
very nervous because I I can't really

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.390 
very nervous because I I can't really
get<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> MOAB<00:03:51.840> in<00:03:52.260> a<00:03:52.380> minute<00:03:52.650> by<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.190> way<00:03:53.370> I

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
get a MOAB in a minute by the way I

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.860 
get a MOAB in a minute by the way I
didn't<00:03:53.670> put<00:03:53.760> my<00:03:53.850> seat<00:03:54.060> for<00:03:54.299> about<00:03:54.480> half<00:03:54.630> way<00:03:54.810> up

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870

didn't put my seat for about half way up
the<00:03:54.959> map<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.290> should<00:03:55.470> have<00:03:55.560> called<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:55.980> a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
the map I should have called it in a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.310 
the map I should have called it in a
little<00:03:56.250> bit<00:03:56.340> later<00:03:56.549> on<00:03:56.640> hopefully<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.959> get<00:03:58.260> a

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
little bit later on hopefully to get a

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.569 
little bit later on hopefully to get a
couple<00:03:58.560> more<00:03:58.650> kills<00:03:58.920> but<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.160> was<00:03:59.340> starting<00:03:59.549> to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
this quickly in a long time so I was

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.199 
this quickly in a long time so I was
very<00:04:04.350> very<00:04:04.890> concerned<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.549> very<00:04:05.760> nervous<00:04:05.910> and

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.949 
i'm kind of burst firing right now i'm
not<00:04:14.130> holding<00:04:14.310> anything<00:04:14.609> down<00:04:14.970> trying<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.780> save
