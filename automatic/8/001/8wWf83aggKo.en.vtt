through each other this makes his his

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.200 
through each other this makes his his
squid<00:00:33.239> tanks<00:00:33.660> look<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.320> bit<00:00:35.090> murky<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
squid tanks look a little bit murky and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.780 
squid tanks look a little bit murky and
he<00:00:36.420> doesn't<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.050> water<00:00:37.290> color<00:00:38.280> through

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
he doesn't like the water color through

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.840 
he doesn't like the water color through
the<00:00:38.940> ice<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.770> squids<00:00:40.770> artist<00:00:41.370> visible

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.760 
the ice and the squids artist visible
and<00:00:42.149> yeah<00:00:42.510> such<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.170> such<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:45.410> fixed<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.500> for

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and yeah such and such so I fixed it for

BAM<00:00:51.329> da<00:00:52.079> da<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:53.480> can<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> used<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.289> glass<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
BAM da da I can I used a glass is the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.799 
BAM da da I can I used a glass is the
advice<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.469> my<00:00:58.469> fix<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.809> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
advice because my fix for this and the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.260 
advice because my fix for this and the
ice<00:01:01.020> didn't<00:01:01.559> quite<00:01:01.829> work<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.340> had<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.670> use<00:01:02.699> glass

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
ice didn't quite work I had to use glass

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.810 
ice didn't quite work I had to use glass
for<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> unfortunately<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.129> works<00:01:05.460> pretty

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
for it unfortunately but it works pretty

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.270 
for it unfortunately but it works pretty

some nice little greenery stuff down
there<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.439> squid<00:01:13.740> is<00:01:13.920> swimming<00:01:13.950> around

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
there and the squid is swimming around

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.950 
there and the squid is swimming around
happily<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.630> their<00:01:15.810> invisible<00:01:16.380> water<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
happily in their invisible water and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.940 
happily in their invisible water and
there's<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.049> little<00:01:19.200> bit<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.500> bug<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.799> can

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
there's a little bit of a bug you can

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
there's a little bit of a bug you can
see<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> water<00:01:20.430> showing<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.840> edges

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
see the water showing up at the edges

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
see the water showing up at the edges
there<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.790> did<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.270> actually

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
there but the way I did this actually

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.920 
there but the way I did this actually
was<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.350> these<00:01:25.619> guys<00:01:26.299> this<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.540> an<00:01:27.659> invisible

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
was with these guys this is an invisible

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.590 
was with these guys this is an invisible
map<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.270> they<00:01:30.270> are<00:01:30.570> made<00:01:30.900> Oh<00:01:31.729> message<00:01:32.729> yay<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
map and they are made Oh message yay and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.450 
map and they are made Oh message yay and
these<00:01:34.259> maps<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:34.770> made<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:36.380> creating<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.560> map<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
these maps are made by creating a map in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.480 
these maps are made by creating a map in
the<00:01:38.759> nether<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.689> make<00:01:40.619> might<00:01:40.829> even<00:01:41.070> work<00:01:41.280> in

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the nether or or make might even work in

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.190 
the nether or or make might even work in
the<00:01:41.640> end<00:01:41.759> as<00:01:41.909> well<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.750> leather<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the end as well but the leather is the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
the end as well but the leather is the
easiest<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.950> guess<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.790> create<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> map<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.689> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
easiest I guess you create a map in the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.690 
easiest I guess you create a map in the
nether<00:01:46.020> then<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.799> surround<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.189> map<00:01:47.460> with

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
nether then you surround that map with

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 
nether then you surround that map with
paper<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.299> make<00:01:48.329> enlarge<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.710> don't

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
paper to make enlarge it but you don't

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.190 
paper to make enlarge it but you don't
look<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> anymore<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.509> nether<00:01:51.720> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
look at it anymore in the nether you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.760 
look at it anymore in the nether you
bring<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:54.630> overworld<00:01:55.350> or

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
bring it with you to the overworld or

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.940 
bring it with you to the overworld or
yeah<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.960> when<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.049> look<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.740> here

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
yeah and when you look at it over here

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
yeah and when you look at it over here
since<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.640> didn't<00:01:59.880> look<00:02:00.000> at<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
since you didn't look at it in the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.190 
since you didn't look at it in the
nether<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.420> nothing<00:02:03.420> there<00:02:03.630> there's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
nether it is now nothing there there's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.709 
nether it is now nothing there there's
nothing<00:02:04.469> there<00:02:04.799> because<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.549> didn't<00:02:06.360> record

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
nothing there because it didn't record

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.190 
nothing there because it didn't record
any<00:02:07.099> information<00:02:08.099> onto<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.459> map<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
any information onto the map so what you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.830 
any information onto the map so what you
have<00:02:10.229> here<00:02:10.379> is<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.770> completely<00:02:11.280> clear<00:02:11.640> map<00:02:11.910> that

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
have here is a completely clear map that

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.880 
have here is a completely clear map that
you<00:02:13.110> can<00:02:13.319> if<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
you can if you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.980 
you can if you
if<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.430> put<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.710> item<00:02:16.710> frame<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.990> becomes

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
if you put it in a item frame it becomes

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.350 
if you put it in a item frame it becomes
invisible<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:20.340> has<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.730> nice<00:02:21.120> little

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
invisible and it has this nice little

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.570 
invisible and it has this nice little
fact<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.080> actually<00:02:22.260> makes<00:02:22.709> water<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
fact that it actually makes water and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.260 
fact that it actually makes water and
ice<00:02:24.200> invisible<00:02:25.200> too<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:26.459> i<00:02:26.670> remove<00:02:27.000> say

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
ice invisible too so if i remove say

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.449 
ice invisible too so if i remove say
these<00:02:27.480> two<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.780> can<00:02:27.990> see<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.560> ice

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
these two you can see that there is ice

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.630 
these two you can see that there is ice
there<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.480> there's<00:02:30.660> water<00:02:31.100> where<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.310> squids

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
there and there's water where the squids

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.360 
there and there's water where the squids
are<00:02:32.880> swimming<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:34.020> it<00:02:34.140> gives<00:02:34.320> put<00:02:34.680> these<00:02:34.980> back

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
are swimming so it gives put these back

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.020 
are swimming so it gives put these back
and<00:02:36.140> there<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.580> reason<00:02:38.730> why

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and there you have it and the reason why

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.870 
and there you have it and the reason why
i<00:02:39.060> didn't<00:02:39.420> use<00:02:39.600> ice<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.610> you

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
i didn't use ice for this you can you

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.809 
i didn't use ice for this you can you
can<00:02:42.060> see<00:02:42.180> works<00:02:42.570> in<00:02:42.810> all<00:02:42.989> directions<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.069> the

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
can see works in all directions and the

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.729 
can see works in all directions and the
reason<00:02:44.970> why<00:02:45.180> didn't<00:02:45.450> use<00:02:45.540> ice<00:02:45.780> is<00:02:46.050> because<00:02:46.590> you

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
reason why didn't use ice is because you

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.290 
reason why didn't use ice is because you
can<00:02:46.860> see<00:02:46.980> here<00:02:47.100> there<00:02:47.280> I'll<00:02:47.520> squid<00:02:47.820> down<00:02:48.060> there

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
can see here there I'll squid down there

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.680 
can see here there I'll squid down there
but<00:02:48.600> if<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.930> look<00:02:49.140> down<00:02:49.380> oh<00:02:49.940> now<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.090> look<00:02:51.300> now

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
but if you look down oh now it look now

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.180 
but if you look down oh now it look now
you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.080> one<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.350> them<00:02:52.440> that's<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.010> little

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
you can see one of them that's a little

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.500 
you can see one of them that's a little
bit<00:02:53.280> weird<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:54.739> because<00:02:55.739> normally<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.209> fill

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
bit weird and because normally if I fill

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.759 
bit weird and because normally if I fill
this<00:02:57.660> up<00:02:58.700> as<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.910> can<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:00.410> one<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.530> them<00:03:01.620> is

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
this up as you can see one of them is

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.080 
this up as you can see one of them is
visible<00:03:02.190> for<00:03:02.370> some<00:03:02.550> reason<00:03:02.850> though<00:03:02.940> i<00:03:02.970> don't

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
they're almost only one of the squid is

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.030 
they're almost only one of the squid is
visible<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.570> don't<00:03:21.810> know<00:03:21.959> why<00:03:22.140> is<00:03:22.350> that<00:03:22.620> one

pretty well here there's a little bit
you<00:03:30.600> know<00:03:30.660> if<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:31.049> jump<00:03:31.500> down<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:32.100> you

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
you know if I jump down like this you

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.520 
you know if I jump down like this you
can<00:03:32.549> sometimes<00:03:33.209> some<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.049> squid<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:34.380> can

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
can sometimes some of the squid you can

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.229 
can sometimes some of the squid you can
see<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.829> one<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.070> instance<00:03:35.220> get<00:03:35.579> oh<00:03:35.760> that

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
see that one for instance get oh that

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.060 
see that one for instance get oh that
one<00:03:36.420> to<00:03:36.600> get<00:03:37.260> cut<00:03:37.620> in<00:03:37.650> half<00:03:37.860> by<00:03:39.890> when<00:03:40.890> it's

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
one to get cut in half by when it's

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.440 
one to get cut in half by when it's
touching<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.579> eyes<00:03:41.640> if<00:03:41.910> you<00:03:42.060> look<00:03:42.269> at<00:03:42.420> it

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
touching the eyes if you look at it

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.090 
touching the eyes if you look at it
through<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.840> eyes<00:03:42.989> through<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.890> glass

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
through the eyes through the glass

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.800 
through the eyes through the glass
through<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.700> map<00:03:45.079> but<00:03:46.079> from<00:03:46.829> up<00:03:46.950> here<00:03:47.130> if<00:03:47.310> you

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
through the map but from up here if you

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.390 
through the map but from up here if you
keep<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.959> like<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.530> works<00:03:49.890> perfectly

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
keep it like this it works perfectly

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.520 
keep it like this it works perfectly
except<00:03:51.239> for<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:51.510> small<00:03:51.750> buggy<00:03:52.049> at<00:03:52.380> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
except for this small buggy at the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.100 
except for this small buggy at the
intersect<00:03:53.040> yes<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.310> can<00:03:53.400> see<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.880> water<00:03:54.480> on

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
intersect yes you can see the water on

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.680 
intersect yes you can see the water on
the<00:03:55.230> left<00:03:55.440> side<00:03:55.650> there<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:56.209> visible<00:03:57.209> when<00:03:57.600> you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
the left side there is visible when you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.479 
the left side there is visible when you
do<00:03:57.810> like<00:03:57.959> this<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.350> wasn't<00:03:58.799> like<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
do like this it wasn't like that the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.759 
do like this it wasn't like that the
last<00:03:59.519> snapshots<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.870> it's<00:04:01.170> something<00:04:01.500> that

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
last snapshots so it's something that

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.009 
last snapshots so it's something that
has<00:04:01.950> been<00:04:02.160> introduced<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:02.760> week<00:04:03.060> so

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
has been introduced this week so
