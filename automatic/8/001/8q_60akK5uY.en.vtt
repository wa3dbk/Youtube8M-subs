00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
 huh 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.780
 batista70phone friends, 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.480
 today we have been offered this video on youtube which they compare 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.429
 speed of 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.289
 alpone 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.470
 motorola martone 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.089
 hernest on others can see 4 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.990
 follow me it seems very strange to me is what 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.460
 mail with alice mail loaded site - she 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.990
 let's try to do the same thing 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.290
 now I got pregnant on the site 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.820
 it seems to me that the loading is much faster than what they are 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.470
 showing them 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.290
 in fact the almost finished fondue here we are not even half here we are halfway 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.210
 yet I'm still in the loading phase as you are seeing 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.300
 even if the sliding is already quite fluid 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.670
 and we're still uploading, let's see how long it takes 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 webcam text lyrics here is not that they throw great confidence 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.070
 it's true we are still in the loading phase but we are not so far away 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.630
 from the end as they make us see d 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.490
 luca impressive the loading speed of baked I made some 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.530
 first home comparisons ok 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.320
 has now finished motorola 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.409
 there is no two years for me as they rightly fail me 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.120
 on some it brings choices on the other two no and in any case it does not even take us to the farm 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.420
 all this time 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.850
 how to see 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.680
 I don't know for this text they don't seem very reliable check this is 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.500
 one of opinion 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.790
 with this I conclude undertone with respect 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.790
 aka batista70 for batista70phone 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.290
