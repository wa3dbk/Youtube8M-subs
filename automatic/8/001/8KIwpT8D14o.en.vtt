 he has gone through a war with this europe 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.560
 but more attractive to her 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.560
 That's a bit I didn't think I had recorded the traffic 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.499
 are even there to see his work anyway 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.579
 I thought you know what I would like to mix a new movie on we have to get rid of 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:23.829
 watched the pigeon land for three weeks 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:28.189
 and i can show you there is none of it before the best mister blinkers 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.509
 distract you and there you have major concerns 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.850
 but there are various products to look at and clean iran 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.130
 for example states wipes and you have and he went chickens faster 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.339
 cleansing lotion 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.170
 and you also like to go the game on only the basic eleven that you still like that 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.150
 must stand 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.390
 and the eu a personal and raised I have three stars 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.250
 To give Granderson a head on a record manager I have nobody want this 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.670
 user year 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.480
 express cleansing it is a nice big bottle 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 it is very much in and that is both for normal true face 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.180
 heineken was before your eye with the party it is now too early for that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.170
 because at tops and I always get that pre-clinical oncology hole I can 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.540
 me 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.960
 cycling very well against 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.490
 and competition things odik basic fabrics and calling costs so I soon find faith 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.190
 and can work there if i feel i've had it best and i know there again 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.010
 well then whatever 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.260
 I feel that that is so distracted and not good package and that's why I use it 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.730
 the most essential tasks based on water 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.530
 when your eyes are numbered 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.740
 look to settle there 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.070
 the quarterfinals 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.729
 I got this one in April 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.010
 van beek they are enjoying themselves 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.800
 and they are really very good quality and nice and thick 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.300
 and gentle on the eyes if you think it would be fine but i used it 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.310
 could really use it in the nick of time 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.780
 specially for it actually on a shrink because the fact that a lot of money and too much 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
 freedom in your eyes with different stuff 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.990
 and he is called that he wants you as little as possible 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.770
 say you can just take it away from the quietest possible way 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.180
 and sometimes i am real 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.880
 To change the place the place is changed a village 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.150
 And that's really not good what you're kidding 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.640
 but never has a watery game that sit in your eyes and you get 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.220
 of course also at the fair the earlier happened quot this forest I mean 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.820
 you get all the space you get message from laughing gas limits 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.309
 when you release all the dishes 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.939
 then Jada Pinkett keeps lapping on, he doesn't let a ticket out so about 40 50 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:22.709
 sam 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.349
 I think it is very bad 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.679
 do you know you're leaving you see we're bad sign 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.829
 I have this morning 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.500
 I think it's a decision no vision no 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.339
 So eighty percent is 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:38.439
 but what you do how often the sun sets how happy that your house or you picked up 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.899
 photos wetering 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.849
 83 percent increase external factors that cause heath 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.489
 and what condition he appears 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.919
 so the street they could just as well take care of 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.909
 what i do my suit just a chat and my game 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.259
 and there 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:56.559
 by the great shows pride 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.650
 I actually make you quite wet but actually quite a lot 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.489
 I just keep an eye on it 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.939
 and I'm just wearing it a bit 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.779
 but I leave that there 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.009
 not sit at all but just a few seconds 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.009
 and that road map gone 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.819
 de vries a beard 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.819
 belga dea who have become embarrassing what you see 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.959
 then the great team and wine from the French government do that, by the way 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:27.480
 but also 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.480
 because it is so busy imposing 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.269
 little bit together 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.569
 and against that 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.919
 we go 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.949
 that you always have is that there is still around your eye 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.949
 so that share is me what you hear about that 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.459
 such a stunt 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.459
 the come eye 

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:55.539
 9 so calm up 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:58.639
 that once had the ball 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.289
 with this is a beer 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:02.099
 and that while 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.099
 for the corners of the eye 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.590
 I myself have the freedom it is important to thirteen he could be your eyes 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.680
 and the three with an immigrant not only for older people 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.590
 that is actually actually for everyone to use with this, as already said 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.340
 read the 12 and against kruibeke on your eyes impression also I really have none 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.999
 Unnecessary luxury 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:31.039
 but yes yes everyone should know of course but I think so 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.509
 It is important to also free 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.110
 specially with a high and to care for 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.400
 currently using is potentially getting too high I am fit 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.889
 it is not yet for sale in the store lists only in two months 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.099
 but I'm already looking forward to testing 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.520
 I think he says I am very satisfied with your sport 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.569
 there is also a heart disease 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.120
 cloth in it 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.520
 we're just sitting out ourselves 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.639
 what you do your grabs with your child 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.439
 a little bit of cream 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.419
 taken on 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.620
 and why not find that is 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.690
 Research has shown that the fingers are ticking 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.389
 the pressure on your eye 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.009
 does not exercise too hard or too soft 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.009
 and that you do is you can handle it just like that 

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:24.850
 You must know that is beyond dispute 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.789
 exactly to make you always right 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.159
 but no pain felt no bid 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.089
 there are no sebaceous glands 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:36.039
 and parties this didn't make much sense to get out there even if you were up for it 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.319
 that is used against balls on salt because your skin can't do anything there 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.139
 record 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.719
 so what you don't do is feel 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.409
 in the collision that is mine 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:45.689
 and 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:46.620
 and there 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.180
 that's where the skin starts 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.469
 that can impose the crane 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.320
 it's like standing for example 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.320
 I've used dozens or so 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:58.650
 out there 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.759
 apply 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.849
 and then with light beating motion 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.669
 this way ensure that the circulation also improves 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.669
 and therefore not even if it is that millimeter between the two fires already 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.629
 less obvious everything actually just an accumulation 

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:12.930
 yes the plans of 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.270
 blood and therefore it is also fc groningen 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.540
 but there are different types of immigrants, and there are reinforcing ones 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:20.569
 Hoogkerk is 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:23.400
 moisturizer 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.029
 creams and against attacks 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:28.189
 i this is a moisturizer 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:29.740
 that's just a bunch of that 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.710
 the height taken the lines 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.970
 that mission then you just well cared for if you are afraid it is 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.119
 actually not to apply a moisturizer 

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:40.460
 because that it correctly caused the number 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.340
 a bit fatter under the eyes 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.349
 already part of it in the last six years 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.110
 buy specifically done 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.110
 that is made to counter balls 

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:53.259
 But this is just a matter of there in these markets 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:57.149
 and that is of course also very easy with a kind of product 

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:59.680
 or just a decline with 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.069
 a sort of beating anyway 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:03.180
 so was 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.389
 just to stimulate that number 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.910
 That can also be a whole story that I said years ago this is not the victory and opera 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:14.090
 paul kemp mix of all ages but if you just japan people want your eye with 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.009
 the used 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:17.559
 isa eye cream actually can 

00:07:17.559 --> 00:07:19.320
 on behalf of not yet saying but 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.520
 It is important that you close well for the extra good in front of your eyes 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.090
 can be very interesting to see in a calm way with the calf embankment 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.420
 and if you are still applying the cream because that is the most 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.260
 people to Nijmegen and have a good look at a program from stoch 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.569
 are property yes 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:38.349
 the eyes are just very important m there are the first signs of it 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:39.919
 old age you don't see that 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.559
 you think you are yourself 

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:44.029
 best yes it is important that you are well cared for 

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:48.499
 anp i hope you get this video busy with ivonne and handy and dovo version
