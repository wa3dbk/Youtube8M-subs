not<00:01:28.479> a<00:01:28.509> module<00:01:29.140> because<00:01:29.799> the<00:01:30.609> university's

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
not a module because the university's

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.989 
not a module because the university's
module<00:01:31.990> menu<00:01:32.409> was<00:01:33.630> messing<00:01:34.630> this<00:01:34.780> thing<00:01:35.020> up<00:01:35.200> so

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
module menu was messing this thing up so

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.239 
module menu was messing this thing up so
we<00:01:36.999> just<00:01:37.240> made<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.509> so<00:01:37.899> like<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.770> it's<00:01:39.009> not<00:01:39.189> a

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.249 
we just made it so like this it's not a

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.130 
we just made it so like this it's not a
module<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:39.999> can<00:01:40.030> plop<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.539> like<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.780> but<00:01:40.990> it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
module you can plop it like this but it

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.580 
module you can plop it like this but it
functions<00:01:41.770> like<00:01:41.890> any<00:01:42.280> other<00:01:42.640> school<00:01:43.499> for<00:01:44.499> the

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
functions like any other school for the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.800 
functions like any other school for the
university<00:01:45.280> so<00:01:45.700> it's<00:01:45.969> not<00:01:46.179> any<00:01:46.390> different

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
university so it's not any different

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.139 
university so it's not any different
just<00:01:46.899> the<00:01:47.439> fact<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.829> it's<00:01:48.159> not<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.399> module<00:01:48.939> and

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
just the fact that it's not a module and

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.789 
just the fact that it's not a module and
you<00:01:49.960> plop<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.380> like<00:01:50.530> that<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.810> costs<00:01:53.469> just<00:01:53.530> as

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
you plop it like that it costs just as

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.109 
you plop it like that it costs just as
much<00:01:54.009> as<00:01:54.189> any<00:01:54.340> other<00:01:54.460> wing<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:56.409> in<00:01:57.399> some<00:01:57.819> cases

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
much as any other wing but in some cases

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.309
