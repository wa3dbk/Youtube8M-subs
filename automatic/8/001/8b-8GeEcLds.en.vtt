00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.880
 The theme of design is becoming more and more popular nowadays 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.559
 more important for me personally too 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.120
 I really admit it when I think of myself 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.530
 should buy device synonymous chic 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.290
 look and I have already seen that 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.980
 Samsung Galaxy S 6 E Plus looks very much 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.230
 send out 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.310
 that definitely just have them 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.230
 to learn very, very nice and unite 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.640
 mega easy it is very light 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.500
 she is the display is again 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.939
 have become much bigger if it is me 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.460
 Once you're done, you can take the camera 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.179
 It is also very thin and that is 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.129
 just 6 9 millimeters I turn 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.199
 it just gets into the camera one will 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.410
 I see that the light is very nice 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.839
 report is sparkle because nice sparkle 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.760
 effect and as the name already reveals it 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.420
 six edge plus means of course 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.809
 become 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.760
 only alex cream and this screen has 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.620
 Of course I also like functions 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.960
 will demonstrate once and that 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.329
 just about this time frame 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.859
 deleted and I now see mine 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.900
 most important contacts yes I have 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.520
 created yourself and who says it 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.909
 junior over it is of course also with 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.909
 there 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.799
 once pressed on it and now I can 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.420
 see that I can call you that 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:17.140
 I can tick an e-mail directly or 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.909
 also message eg and then more 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.009
 added features, and that simple 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.439
 once painted to the right and now 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.729
 I can see my main apps here 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.759
 I've put on my own 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.320
 favorites deposited and so I do not care 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.240
 where I am currently in the device if I'm in 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.710
 I am at surfing internet server 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.700
 I'm always just google maps 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.700
 a maximum of two steps from these mean 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.729
 favorites away super and club 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.770
 totally time saving in the next 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.619
 Of course, I also ask myself step by step 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.909
 if I get such a device like 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.439
 certainly the country that's the best 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.820
 So if it comes down to me 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.950
 for example, it's not the same 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.469
 it can break anybody, of course 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.250
 most of the time the device happens 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.130
 probably on the floor 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.130
 another one is a very robust one 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.570
 glass used gorilla glass 4 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.340
 but you get that once too 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.890
 In addition, it wants to protect 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.170
 Of course , I have one for that 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.700
 old one 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.710
 preview case brought and indeed 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.840
 I put that six edge it once 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.360
 in and it is protected at the corners 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.820
 but the pages stay free so I 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
 continue to use the dual screen 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.060
 Of course, that function is ours 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.250
 continue to be available 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.390
 the whole once closed then is 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.080
 the display again in addition 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.450
 protected 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.370
 but I have through this cover 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.570
 Nevertheless, the possibility of the most important 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.570
 to see information 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.340
 For example, who is calling and then 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.500
 i could just call this call too 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.280
 accept without opening the cover 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.170
 ok great thanks jonathan i am absolutely 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.730
 Convinced of the design I like 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.770
 very good but that was natural 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.580
 not yet find all other features 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.580
 Describe them under
