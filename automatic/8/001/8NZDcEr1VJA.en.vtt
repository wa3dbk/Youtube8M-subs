00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello today on netbook news we see the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:12.900
 video unbox first impressions for the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:14.370
 dell xps 12 this is an ultrabook e 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.139
 the latest ultrabook of dell 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.690
 and it is the model with touchscreen 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.240
 windows 8 availability of the few 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.740
 weeks I get in this pack 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.810
 bigger inside if these two 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.550
 packages let's start seeing it 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.769
 the small one where there is only the 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.140
 our feeder here it is 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.180
 quite small and very similar to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.850
 that of the ultraportables and in this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.790
 quite heavy packaging I have to say 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.180
 that inside integrates contains the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.660
 our xps todi takes a moment from 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.280
 part 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.230
 then we'll see there is nothing else 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.530
 inside if not the documentation 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.870
 classic paper hate documentation 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 this is actually is a model of is a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.559
 demo sample is possible that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.480
 in real packaging and there are others 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.199
 accessory that when they are present e 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.030
 anyway this is our ultrabook is 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.400
 manufactured with three main materials 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.950
 there is carbon fiber in the part 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.110
 upper and back there is aluminum 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.530
 all around the body and there is the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.560
 magnesium inside for the interior of the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:20.369
 of the frame as I said it is a 12.5 inches 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.189
 to a full HD screen then 1080p 1900 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.340
 20 x 1080 pixels at windows 8 has one 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.680
 enough backlit keyboard 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.939
 large and the building with a quality 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 really really constructive 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.640
 superlative you see the aluminum here all 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 around the touchpad it is with a button 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.530
 integrated so it's all one 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.200
 button basically we see the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.619
 doors quickly to the right we have two 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.180
 usb 1 and usb 3.0 the mini displayport the 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.340
 power connector this is 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.860
 the small button to see the status of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.950
 Battery charge is one of the two 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.680
 of the two speakers the right speaker 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.579
 and then had dinner here on the back side not 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.560
 we have nothing 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.840
 in the other side we have the button 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.460
 switch on see with led on 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.950
 this moment because it is in suspension 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.810
 combo jack for microphone and headphone e 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 this other little button that we will then see a 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.840
 what will this be for the other one 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.030
 speaker we owe him 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.400
 stereo speakers placed on the sides of the 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.099
 peculiarity of this laptop 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.440
 beyond the build quality e 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.099
 of the technical card of which then 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.840
 we'll talk 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:30.870
 this is the possibility of being 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.720
 rotated and converted to tablet mode 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.450
 here it is this way with a simple 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.360
 pass the overall thickness of the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.390
 everything closed is less than 2 cm then 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.019
 at about 20 mm it's absolutely not 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.190
 often for sure to see him so live 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.650
 the finishes are of an absolute level 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.470
 palm rest which wrist rest is 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.810
 manufactured in one in the same finish 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.390
 that we had in the xps 13 that I have 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.640
 reviewed last year like this 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.830
 like that among other things also this one has 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.590
 a screen protected by gorilla glass 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.989
 glass then a glass that covers it all 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.129
 screen and reaches the edges towards the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:18.720
 I turn on because I see how much is here 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:21.810
 here the joint and magnetic is enough 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.379
 getting a little close to the frame is 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.510
 his screen is shielded 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.260
 position I'm going to turn it on and here we are 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.950
 with windows 8 active these are in the 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.230
 new interface 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.060
 but I want to go back a moment on the 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.420
 backlit keyboard with the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.860
 possibility then to be regulated ops is 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.420
 the display started 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.430
 then I also increase to the maximum 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.739
 adjust the brightness to maximum 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.019
 display which is a 400 nit then 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.090
 quite bright enough too 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.879
 viewing angles and maybe to let you 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.560
 see see here you are here though 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.080
 clearly you can see better if 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.510
 we put it in the tablet mode 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.159
 viewing angles are absolutely 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.280
 good is not a ps but the visual angles 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:07.650
 there are 260 steps we are very close 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.200
 there is a front camera of course 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.620
 for video calls here in the part 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.720
 high 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.620
 I have excellent impressions from the point 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.019
 qualitative view 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.500
 I repeat it because the quality really is 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.780
 exceptional there are no pushups 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.090
 obviously very very stable there too 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.360
 a particular rubberized border some 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.230
 rise slightly including these too 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.850
 two feet on the sides serve to raise a 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.350
 distance the screen from the rest 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.060
 perhaps so that it does not go to crush 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.220
 the keyboard when using the mode 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.590
 tablet this configuration is that 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:44.180
 more powerful the top of the range agreed to 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:47.330
 server 8gb ram ssd disk 256gb 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.280
 then to wifi bluetooth and wii 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.350
 obviously also the tpm chip 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.000
 this is the most powerful configuration that 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.510
 available to buy right now 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.690
 on the coast website at around 1,300 euros 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.960
 but the configurations start at 999 euros 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.110
 plus VAT therefore â‚¬ 1,199 for those with 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.450
 however, core high five is always 40 of 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:13.240
 ram and ssd disk we just do a test 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.240
 web browsing we pass on msn 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.960
 indeed we put it in tablet mode and 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.290
 see full screen resolution 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.000
 hd how small it actually makes the 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.030
 site that is not optimized has hit 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.740
 absolutely fluid zoom looks like 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.390
 being on ipad from this point of view 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.530
 after all the processor power 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.270
 intel ivy bridge is not new to us 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.130
 we will come back to the full review 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.350
 given the period seen the short time a 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.880
 provision before holidays 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.760
 will arrive in a few days the 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.370
 battery is a 47 v h so it should 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.380
 also be here to offer good good 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.120
 performance in the next few days contained 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.210
 to follow netbooknews.it for the 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.210
 full review of dell xps 12
