00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello Raikin with you , this video is about 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.730
 how to draw the first page in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.950
 his personal diary 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.809
 twisted you choose a personal custodian 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.690
 I have already chosen a diary and, accordingly, 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.780
 choose your photo that you paste me 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.730
 Of course, too, chose and I cut them 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 There are direct on a path because I want 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.760
 arrange in a very cool morskoy style 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.820
 my page 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.500
 first and yes here and here it came out here and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.119
 consider glue on which path is this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.680
 I will use the case 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.260
 use this cool one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.090
 paper which is then glued, that is, one 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.950
 comes off the thing and all this 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.629
 Wonderfully glued, I of course you 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.059
 pie and stuck not only down here 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.890
 such a cool paper but that's so 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.489
 somehow there was a nickname conclusion or something 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.670
 enough to stick the pictures themselves 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:01:09.630
 printouts and let's get started 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:11.820
 [music] 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.829
 here I did it by the way yes many 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.960
 They say that I take off too far 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.090
 this is what this is the ideal distance 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.220
 there is not you also gives you something like that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.950
 like that all the same I want to some 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.990
 background seems to me personally I look often 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.840
 seen when about in this setting 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.810
 so than dogs on the table yes here and me 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.049
 really like it and now we need can 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.049
 say create a personal diary entry 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.860
 number and accordingly number number 7 in 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.509
 my case is paper owner they 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.069
 small set large I did not 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.899
 take the perfect sheet and because 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.849
 small set i have is very gentle and from 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.130
 finite shades and it seems to me they 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.649
 very cool fit here true 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.349
 we got in general, I forgot to say 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.689
 why is it even necessary to 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:01.890
 this thing and glue enough then 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.090
 and write on it another nick number and what 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:22.009
 shame and disgrace 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:22.009
 [music] 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:30.830
 ready and now need to do can 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.740
 say more cloud 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:39.610
 and I will make sure I will write two clouds in 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:44.239
 first hello i am the mistress of this money 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.100
 I study here and I am a guardian angel 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.350
 this diary since on the show he 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.120
 angel in general, everything is very cool coming off and 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.710
 first write the text itself about it and 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:10.419
 enter into the cloud 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:03:10.419
 [music] 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.250
 we get this design and I 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.250
 the plot is left to fill the page 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.830
 I advise you to write about yourself 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.530
 by what 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.989
 you can say hobby involve and and yes and 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.420
 merge ld in the cell then I advise you to write in 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.420
 each cell seems to me here I am personal 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.519
 I'll try to write after so yes here at home 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.670
 I like it in general let me 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:51.780
 quick pages 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:54.000
 [music] 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.610
 this is how we got the triple kaido 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.830
 I wanted to say what do you have in 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.560
 ruler 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.840
 notebook and it is too wide that is yes 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.640
 many don't like this let's say 5 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.180
 to which I climbed on speaking through 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.130
 month there is literally no way he has 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.500
 me in the line and there it is very small as 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.440
 here is this cell so I wrote in every 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.350
 that is, yes it is if you allow both 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.760
 two cells then I advise you to write a husband 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.000
 say in one space between 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.340
 rulers for two lines can be as 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.290
 so well that it will turn off neatly if 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.050
 you have such a terrible handwriting as mine 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:35.180
 then I now try to write so to it were 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.800
 much better I thought I said to myself 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.130
 I think to stick a few stickers in 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:53.290
 general yes let's get started 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:53.290
 [music] 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.190
 we got stickers on topics too 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.230
 that is, on the subject of the text everything is like this 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.910
 that was happening yes you are here let 's say I 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.440
 alloc tell nothing picture 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.700
 sticking more precisely king york in general yes and 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.010
 such a cool car turned out 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.810
 I personally like it was convenient 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.420
 writing from on this state of the country is recessed a 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.340
 But to Talay also here it is not so convenient 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:23.320
 but the sheets will stand up to me without a difference 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.090
 myself honestly many lead this on removable 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.280
 blocks as they do not lead 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.590
 they have no difference where it turns out 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.300
 Awesome and think what I have too 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.550
 it will be cool because itâ€™s not 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.800
 it matters what notebook you have no matter what 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.300
 in general, on the cover of this matter there 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.160
 grandmother object sense they glue 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:48.010
 put on the cover and insert the picture there 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.360
 just paste here and yes you I told you 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.440
