basically like herb AoE sort of attack
like<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:41.930> know<00:02:42.050> just<00:02:42.200> around<00:02:42.770> you<00:02:43.540> talk<00:02:44.540> a

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
like you know just around you talk a

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.760 
like you know just around you talk a
little<00:02:44.690> spinning<00:02:45.080> slash<00:02:45.290> sort<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.620> thing

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
little spinning slash sort of thing

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.540 
little spinning slash sort of thing
which<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:46.700> deals<00:02:46.880> damage

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
which just deals damage

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.960 
which just deals damage
and<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.930> can<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.620> can<00:02:50.680> be<00:02:51.190> used<00:02:51.400> as<00:02:51.490> a<00:02:51.550> slow<00:02:51.850> as

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
and it can it can be used as a slow as

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.870 
and it can it can be used as a slow as
well<00:02:52.770> and<00:02:53.770> then<00:02:53.950> it's<00:02:54.100> all<00:02:54.190> on<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.430> desk<00:02:54.580> mark

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
well and then it's all on that desk mark

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.090 
well and then it's all on that desk mark
basically<00:02:55.750> you<00:02:55.900> dash<00:02:56.110> towards<00:02:56.620> an<00:02:56.740> enemy

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
basically you dash towards an enemy

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.280 
basically you dash towards an enemy
marking<00:02:57.970> them<00:02:58.090> you<00:02:58.300> are<00:02:58.450> in<00:02:58.600> shadow<00:02:58.840> form<00:02:59.140> so

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
marking them you are in shadow form so

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.140 
marking them you are in shadow form so
you<00:02:59.320> can't<00:02:59.590> take<00:02:59.770> damage<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.640> mark<00:03:00.880> them<00:03:01.030> and

you can't take damage you mark them and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.850 
you can't take damage you mark them and
then<00:03:01.240> you<00:03:01.330> also<00:03:01.480> leave<00:03:01.690> another<00:03:01.960> shadow<00:03:02.320> next

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
then you also leave another shadow next

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.250 
then you also leave another shadow next
to<00:03:03.070> them<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.670> deal<00:03:03.850> extra<00:03:04.060> damage<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.630> but

to them to deal extra damage with but

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.500 
to them to deal extra damage with but
also<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:06.430> can<00:03:06.610> teleport<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.120> change<00:03:07.300> place

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
also you can teleport and change place

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.120 
also you can teleport and change place
with<00:03:07.660> shadow<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.170> also<00:03:08.410> after<00:03:08.710> a<00:03:08.740> free

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
with shadow and also after a free

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.280 
with shadow and also after a free
seconds<00:03:09.670> the<00:03:10.150> mark<00:03:10.360> will<00:03:10.510> detonate<00:03:10.690> dealing

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
seconds the mark will detonate dealing

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.580 
seconds the mark will detonate dealing
damage<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:12.930> well<00:03:13.930> I'll<00:03:14.050> start<00:03:14.320> off<00:03:14.410> by

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
damage and well I'll start off by

showing you the W because that's where

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.440 
showing you the W because that's where
everything<00:03:17.260> gets<00:03:17.380> interesting<00:03:18.060> there's<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.120> w

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
everything gets interesting there's a w

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.640 
everything gets interesting there's a w
you<00:03:19.540> push<00:03:19.720> out<00:03:19.930> down<00:03:20.140> and<00:03:20.290> look<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.500> can

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
you push out down and look you can

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.530 
you push out down and look you can
freely<00:03:20.830> share<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.130> kind<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.520> both<00:03:21.700> will<00:03:22.030> or<00:03:22.240> you

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
freely share a kind of both will or you

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.910 
freely share a kind of both will or you
can<00:03:22.690> usually<00:03:23.020> in<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.530> profile<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:26.620> obviously

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
can usually in the profile so obviously

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.890 
can usually in the profile so obviously
everything<00:03:27.520> that<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:27.940> do<00:03:28.150> with<00:03:28.480> that<00:03:28.510> shadow

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
everything that you do with that shadow

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.640 
everything that you do with that shadow
that<00:03:29.260> does<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.010> with<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:32.200> obviously

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
that does it with you so like obviously

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.930 
that does it with you so like obviously
the<00:03:32.770> shadow<00:03:32.980> don't<00:03:33.220> run<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.580> your<00:03:33.730> own<00:03:33.820> turf

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
the shadow don't run with your own turf

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.580 
the shadow don't run with your own turf
in<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.120> stays<00:03:34.330> on<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:34.570> spot<00:03:34.810> so<00:03:35.080> it'll<00:03:35.380> have<00:03:35.410> to

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
in it stays on the spot so it'll have to

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.950 
in it stays on the spot so it'll have to
be<00:03:35.680> used<00:03:36.690> well<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.600> that's<00:03:40.600> what<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.810> say

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
be used well but like that's what I say

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.960 
be used well but like that's what I say
it<00:03:41.200> can<00:03:41.380> be<00:03:41.560> handy<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:41.980> just<00:03:42.310> travel<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:42.850> as

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
it can be handy to just travel with as

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.520 
it can be handy to just travel with as
well<00:03:43.120> cause<00:03:43.270> up<00:03:43.360> for<00:03:43.510> example<00:03:43.840> if<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.380> throw

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
well cause up for example if you throw

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.380 
well cause up for example if you throw
out<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.860> can<00:03:44.980> just<00:03:45.130> like<00:03:45.280> switch<00:03:45.910> position

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
out you can just like switch position

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.330 
out you can just like switch position
with<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.750> then<00:03:46.840> sure<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.920> tell<00:03:48.130> so

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
with it and then sure can tell so

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.190 
with it and then sure can tell so
whatever<00:03:48.670> heat<00:03:48.790> it<00:03:48.910> keeps<00:03:49.630> my<00:03:49.720> shuriken<00:03:50.050> toss

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
whatever heat it keeps my shuriken toss

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.270 
whatever heat it keeps my shuriken toss
but<00:03:51.510> it's<00:03:52.510> just<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.560> hard<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.860> explain<00:03:54.040> with

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
but it's just it's hard to explain with

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.940 
but it's just it's hard to explain with
this<00:03:54.430> guy<00:03:54.580> he's<00:03:54.820> like<00:03:55.260> he's<00:03:56.260> an<00:03:56.380> assassin<00:03:56.620> but

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
this guy he's like he's an assassin but

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.380 
this guy he's like he's an assassin but
not<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.220> sense<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.489> stale<00:03:57.790> friend<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.270> note

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
not in a sense of stale friend for note

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.720 
not in a sense of stale friend for note
that<00:03:58.570> it's<00:03:58.750> more<00:03:58.989> trickery<00:03:59.380> if<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.550> use<00:04:00.700> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
that it's more trickery if you use the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.520 
that it's more trickery if you use the
trickery<00:04:01.180> right<00:04:01.420> then<00:04:01.630> you'll<00:04:01.780> do<00:04:01.989> really

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
trickery right then you'll do really

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.949 
trickery right then you'll do really
well<00:04:02.800> with<00:04:03.010> him<00:04:03.300> here's<00:04:04.300> his<00:04:04.420> ultimate<00:04:04.870> as

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
well with him here's his ultimate as

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.630 
well with him here's his ultimate as
well<00:04:07.290> there<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.380> are<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.680> then<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.310> leaves<00:04:09.459> a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
well there we are and then it leaves a

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.040 
well there we are and then it leaves a
mark<00:04:09.850> on<00:04:10.030> which<00:04:10.180> is<00:04:10.300> going<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.450> blow<00:04:10.630> up<00:04:10.750> and

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
mark on which is going to blow up and

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.560 
mark on which is going to blow up and
also<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:12.130> photo<00:04:12.670> she<00:04:12.790> reckons<00:04:13.150> all<00:04:13.270> around

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
also the photo she reckons all around

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.830 
also the photo she reckons all around
and<00:04:13.780> I'll<00:04:14.500> just<00:04:14.650> quickly<00:04:14.830> and<00:04:15.220> cap<00:04:16.060> for<00:04:16.450> the

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
and I'll just quickly and cap for the
