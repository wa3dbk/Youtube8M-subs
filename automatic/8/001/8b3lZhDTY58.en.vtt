nice little ornament here I'll show you
how<00:02:54.829> to<00:02:54.950> do<00:02:55.040> this<00:02:55.159> with<00:02:55.310> foam<00:02:55.489> board<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:55.819> can

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
how to do this with foam board you can

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.420 
how to do this with foam board you can
do<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.060> with<00:02:56.150> cardboard<00:02:56.389> to<00:02:57.159> you<00:02:58.159> know<00:02:58.250> cut<00:02:58.400> a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
do it with cardboard to you know cut a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.970 
do it with cardboard to you know cut a
piece<00:02:58.609> to<00:02:58.790> size<00:02:59.440> and<00:03:00.440> then<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.709> get<00:03:00.799> it<00:03:00.920> to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
piece to size and then you get it to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.160 
piece to size and then you get it to
curve<00:03:01.220> but<00:03:01.430> without<00:03:01.579> buckling<00:03:02.299> or<00:03:02.480> folding<00:03:03.049> or

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
curve but without buckling or folding or

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.770 
curve but without buckling or folding or
bending<00:03:03.500> like<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:04.940> it's<00:03:05.060> gonna<00:03:05.150> curve<00:03:05.480> on

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
bending like this so it's gonna curve on

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.250 
bending like this so it's gonna curve on
there<00:03:06.019> it<00:03:06.440> looks<00:03:06.590> really<00:03:06.829> nice<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.930> do<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.139> cut

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
took more foam out so it's actually
