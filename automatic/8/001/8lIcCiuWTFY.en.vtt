guilty of it to pass myself I would have

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.560 
guilty of it to pass myself I would have
definitely<00:00:36.800> used<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.280> wrong<00:00:37.370> gasket<00:00:37.940> here<00:00:38.510> I

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
definitely used the wrong gasket here I

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.910 
definitely used the wrong gasket here I
already<00:00:38.750> have<00:00:38.870> mine<00:00:39.170> set<00:00:39.470> but<00:00:39.620> I'll<00:00:39.710> show<00:00:39.890> you

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
already have mine set but I'll show you

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.900 
already have mine set but I'll show you
how<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.160> do<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.399> anyway

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
how to do it anyway

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.020 
how to do it anyway
this<00:00:41.720> one<00:00:41.899> is<00:00:42.020> a<00:00:42.370> six<00:00:43.370> millimeter<00:00:43.610> based

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
this one is a six millimeter based

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.280 
this one is a six millimeter based
gasket<00:00:44.480> which<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:44.899> which<00:00:45.440> is<00:00:45.590> what<00:00:45.739> I<00:00:45.770> needed

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
gasket which is which is what I needed

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.530 
gasket which is which is what I needed
you<00:00:48.290> need<00:00:48.440> an<00:00:48.530> assortment<00:00:48.829> of<00:00:49.040> gaskets<00:00:49.579> needed

piston without the ring that way because

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.819 
piston without the ring that way because
you<00:00:56.570> can<00:00:56.660> have<00:00:56.719> taken<00:00:57.020> on<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.230> off<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.469> get<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
you can have taken on and off to get the

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.490 
you can have taken on and off to get the
right<00:00:57.980> gaskets<00:00:58.460> probably<00:00:58.910> torque<00:00:59.899> down<00:01:00.110> the

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
right gaskets probably torque down the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.479 
right gaskets probably torque down the
cylinder<00:01:01.510> nuts<00:01:02.770> but<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:03.800> take<00:01:04.129> your<00:01:04.309> little

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
cylinder nuts but you take your little

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.730 
cylinder nuts but you take your little
bit<00:01:04.610> kite<00:01:04.790> tool<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.570> ridges<00:01:06.049> up<00:01:06.260> because<00:01:06.590> this

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
bit kite tool the ridges up because this

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.980 
bit kite tool the ridges up because this
the<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:07.280> ridge<00:01:07.460> portion<00:01:07.970> is<00:01:08.150> for<00:01:08.659> setting

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
the the ridge portion is for setting

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.469 
the the ridge portion is for setting
your<00:01:09.770> timing<00:01:10.190> all<00:01:10.820> right<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.060> go<00:01:11.210> ahead<00:01:11.240> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
your timing all right you go ahead and

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.580 
your timing all right you go ahead and
place<00:01:11.690> that<00:01:11.720> on<00:01:12.110> there

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
place that on there

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.680 
place that on there
and<00:01:12.680> then<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.490> can<00:01:13.610> rotate<00:01:13.820> your<00:01:14.090> flywheel

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
and then you can rotate your flywheel

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.500 
and then you can rotate your flywheel
and<00:01:15.320> then<00:01:16.159> turn<00:01:16.760> which<00:01:16.970> will<00:01:17.150> move<00:01:17.360> your

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
and then turn which will move your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.660 
and then turn which will move your
piston<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.260> you<00:01:19.130> want<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.369> get<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.580> until

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
piston and you want to get it until

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.399 
piston and you want to get it until
there's<00:01:19.939> no<00:01:20.119> gap<00:01:20.360> but<00:01:20.600> it's<00:01:20.750> not<00:01:20.900> pushing<00:01:21.140> on

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
there's no gap but it's not pushing on

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.789 
there's no gap but it's not pushing on
it<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:21.920> have<00:01:22.100> that<00:01:22.250> done<00:01:22.540> now<00:01:23.540> to<00:01:24.290> set<00:01:24.530> the

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
it and I have that done now to set the

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.030 
it and I have that done now to set the
timing<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:25.850> go<00:01:26.450> ahead<00:01:26.540> and<00:01:26.930> rotate<00:01:27.740> the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
timing you go ahead and rotate the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.289 
timing you go ahead and rotate the
flywheel<00:01:29.380> put<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.560> ridged<00:01:30.830> portion<00:01:31.430> down<00:01:32.060> in

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
flywheel put the ridged portion down in

and then you can go ahead and loosen the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.020 
and then you can go ahead and loosen the
three<00:02:07.020> stator<00:02:07.470> bolts<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.580> turn<00:02:08.729> that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
three stator bolts and you can turn that

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.800 
three stator bolts and you can turn that
just<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.229> this<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.250> you're<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.660> have

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
just like this so that you're you have

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.250 
just like this so that you're you have
the<00:02:12.930> correct<00:02:13.140> timing<00:02:14.090> again<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.420> measure<00:02:16.080> my

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the correct timing again I measure my

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.140 
the correct timing again I measure my
gaskets<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.070> everything<00:02:17.430> with<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> digital

Harbor<00:02:20.310> Freight<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.550> think<00:02:20.880> that's<00:02:21.000> probably

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
Harbor Freight I think that's probably
