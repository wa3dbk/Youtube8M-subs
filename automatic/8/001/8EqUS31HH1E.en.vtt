you know a hard to get legendary items
safe<00:00:53.649> harness<00:00:54.039> just<00:00:54.399> an<00:00:54.489> example<00:00:54.609> um<00:00:55.109> and<00:00:56.459> you

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:57.459 
safe harness just an example um and you

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:58.919 
safe harness just an example um and you
get<00:00:57.819> one<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.089> drop<00:00:58.329> but<00:00:58.539> it's<00:00:58.659> you<00:00:58.809> know<00:00:58.839> it's

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
tough to get one of the new idea and

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.489 
tough to get one of the new idea and
it's<00:01:00.999> just<00:01:01.179> normal<00:01:01.449> it's<00:01:01.749> not<00:01:01.899> ancient<00:01:02.079> so

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
it's just normal it's not ancient so

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.130 
it's just normal it's not ancient so
it's<00:01:02.619> not<00:01:02.769> good<00:01:03.100> you<00:01:03.879> could<00:01:04.059> reroll<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.600> now<00:01:04.750> so

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
it's not good you could reroll it now so

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.960 
it's not good you could reroll it now so
you<00:01:05.199> could<00:01:05.650> re<00:01:05.830> roll<00:01:06.040> it<00:01:06.190> over<00:01:06.310> and<00:01:06.640> over<00:01:06.760> and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
you could re roll it over and over and

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.970 
you could re roll it over and over and
over<00:01:07.090> again<00:01:07.330> until<00:01:07.450> it<00:01:08.080> becomes<00:01:08.470> an<00:01:08.620> ancient

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
over again until it becomes an ancient

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.740 
over again until it becomes an ancient
one<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.310> then<00:01:09.640> if<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:09.850> get<00:01:10.000> another<00:01:10.270> furnace

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
one and then if you get another furnace

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.570 
one and then if you get another furnace
to<00:01:10.870> drop<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.260> could<00:01:11.440> re<00:01:11.620> roll<00:01:11.860> that<00:01:12.040> over<00:01:12.310> and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
to drop you could re roll that over and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.390 
to drop you could re roll that over and
over<00:01:12.640> until<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.960> becomes<00:01:14.290> an<00:01:14.440> ancient<00:01:14.890> better

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
over until it becomes an ancient better

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.400 
over until it becomes an ancient better
than<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.790> one<00:01:15.910> you<00:01:16.090> have<00:01:16.120> so<00:01:16.780> it's<00:01:16.930> an<00:01:17.050> upgrade

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
than the one you have so it's an upgrade

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.490 
than the one you have so it's an upgrade
and<00:01:17.560> then<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.860> can<00:01:18.010> reroll<00:01:18.400> another<00:01:18.730> one<00:01:19.000> and

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
and then you can reroll another one and

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.010 
and then you can reroll another one and
it<00:01:20.500> seems<00:01:20.740> like<00:01:21.120> gear<00:01:22.120> progression<00:01:22.720> will<00:01:22.900> be

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
it seems like gear progression will be

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.290 
it seems like gear progression will be
more<00:01:23.290> steady<00:01:23.710> less<00:01:24.100> random<00:01:24.640> this<00:01:24.790> way<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.240> I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
more steady less random this way and I

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.750 
more steady less random this way and I
think<00:01:25.540> it's<00:01:25.660> a<00:01:25.810> really<00:01:26.050> good<00:01:26.170> system<00:01:26.650> so<00:01:26.920> I'm

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
think it's a really good system so I'm

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.400 
think it's a really good system so I'm
really<00:01:27.970> looking<00:01:28.300> forward<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.630> that<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.170> then

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
really looking forward to that and then

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.630 
really looking forward to that and then
there's<00:01:29.620> another<00:01:29.860> thing<00:01:30.130> where<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.460> could

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
there's another thing where you could

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.210 
there's another thing where you could
break<00:01:30.910> down<00:01:31.120> items<00:01:31.720> and<00:01:32.140> get<00:01:32.320> their<00:01:32.530> legendary

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
break down items and get their legendary

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.660 
break down items and get their legendary
bonus<00:01:33.940> effects<00:01:34.300> and<00:01:34.600> use<00:01:35.350> that<00:01:35.380> as<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.830> passive

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
bonus effects and use that as a passive

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.610 
bonus effects and use that as a passive
on<00:01:36.910> your<00:01:37.390> character<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.110> you<00:01:38.170> could<00:01:38.410> break

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
on your character so you could break

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.090 
on your character so you could break
down<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:38.920> furnace<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.640> you'll<00:01:40.300> get<00:01:41.100> sorry

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
apparently this doesn't stack so you

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.899 
apparently this doesn't stack so you
can't<00:01:50.770> break<00:01:50.980> down<00:01:51.190> a<00:01:51.220> furnace<00:01:51.580> use<00:01:51.760> the

it<00:02:59.730> seems<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.299> they're<00:03:01.010> making<00:03:02.010> mobs<00:03:02.250> more

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
it seems and they're making mobs more

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.030 
it seems and they're making mobs more
immune<00:03:03.690> or<00:03:03.959> less<00:03:04.349> susceptible<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.250> CC<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:07.040> like

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
immune or less susceptible to CC so like

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.210 
immune or less susceptible to CC so like
a<00:03:08.069> like<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.549> boss<00:03:08.819> mob<00:03:09.150> or<00:03:09.420> a<00:03:09.450> rift<00:03:09.780> boss<00:03:10.319> would

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
a like a boss mob or a rift boss would

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.319 
a like a boss mob or a rift boss would
not<00:03:11.609> be<00:03:11.819> able<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:12.209> constantly<00:03:12.930> be<00:03:13.170> cc'd<00:03:14.329> there

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
not be able to constantly be cc'd there

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.170 
not be able to constantly be cc'd there
I<00:03:15.359> believe<00:03:16.049> they're<00:03:16.200> applying<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.799> now<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
I believe they're applying that now to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.509 
I believe they're applying that now to
all<00:03:18.180> enemies<00:03:18.569> so<00:03:19.349> it<00:03:20.099> could<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.280> really

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
all enemies so it could be really

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.940 
all enemies so it could be really
interesting<00:03:20.669> it's<00:03:21.450> gonna<00:03:21.569> change<00:03:22.500> up<00:03:22.769> things

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
interesting it's gonna change up things

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.129 
interesting it's gonna change up things
quite<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> bit<00:03:23.489> right<00:03:23.819> here<00:03:23.849> that's<00:03:24.840> where<00:03:25.049> it

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
quite a bit right here that's where it

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.289 
quite a bit right here that's where it
says<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:25.500> they<00:03:25.889> also<00:03:26.069> add<00:03:26.400> new<00:03:26.730> torment
