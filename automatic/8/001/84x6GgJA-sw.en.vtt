00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
the history is as you know very

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.460 
the history is as you know very
convoluted<00:01:05.239> I<00:01:05.720> think<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:06.200> there<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.440> a

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
convoluted I think that there is a

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.760 
convoluted I think that there is a
definite<00:01:07.250> mutual<00:01:07.670> respect<00:01:08.060> I<00:01:08.450> know<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.560> Sam

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
definite mutual respect I know that Sam

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.650 
definite mutual respect I know that Sam
is<00:01:10.390> darn<00:01:11.390> good<00:01:11.690> at<00:01:11.900> what<00:01:12.140> he<00:01:12.260> does<00:01:12.410> I<00:01:13.330> also<00:01:14.330> know

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
is darn good at what he does I also know

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.840 
is darn good at what he does I also know
that<00:01:14.690> there<00:01:15.140> are<00:01:15.410> logistical<00:01:16.040> ways<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.730> do

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
that there are logistical ways to do

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.000 
that there are logistical ways to do
things<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.480> make<00:01:17.660> sense<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.530> me<00:01:18.710> I'm<00:01:18.980> very

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
things that make sense to me I'm very

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.610 
things that make sense to me I'm very
analytical<00:01:19.910> it's<00:01:20.360> not--<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:21.080> plus<00:01:21.380> this

analytical it's not-- this plus this

equals<00:01:21.950> this<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:22.940> is<00:01:23.090> what<00:01:23.240> we've<00:01:23.360> been

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
equals this this is what we've been

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.270 
equals this this is what we've been
instructed<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:24.020> do<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:24.380> therefore<00:01:24.800> we<00:01:24.950> must<00:01:25.130> do

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
instructed to do so therefore we must do

instructed to do so therefore we must do
this<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.480> highest<00:01:26.660> risk<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.440> no<00:01:27.620> we

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
this this is the highest risk so no we

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.290 
this this is the highest risk so no we
shouldn't<00:01:28.100> do<00:01:28.190> that<00:01:28.340> we<00:01:28.520> should<00:01:28.580> do<00:01:28.790> this<00:01:29.000> and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
shouldn't do that we should do this and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.810 
shouldn't do that we should do this and
