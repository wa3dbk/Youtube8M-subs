00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
out by bringing the bingo to them each

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.810 
out by bringing the bingo to them each
game<00:01:15.869> has<00:01:16.170> six<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.860> trays<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
game has six of these trays in it and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.030 
game has six of these trays in it and
they<00:01:18.180> look<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.630> cookie<00:01:18.810> sheets<00:01:19.290> because

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
they look like cookie sheets because

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
they look like cookie sheets because
they<00:01:20.220> are<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.210> they've<00:01:21.360> got<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.780> handles<00:01:22.229> or

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the ledges on them it's metal so it's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.580 
the ledges on them it's metal so it's
magnetic<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.159> each<00:01:26.460> tray<00:01:26.850> has<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.930> bingo
