so<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> pilot<00:00:31.529> upgrade<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.520> first

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so for the pilot upgrade the first

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.560 
so for the pilot upgrade the first
upgrade<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.780> can<00:00:34.230> use<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.710> stealth<00:00:35.570> stealth

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
upgrade we can use is stealth stealth

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.549 
upgrade we can use is stealth stealth
increases<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.649> time<00:00:37.860> enemy<00:00:38.760> locks<00:00:39.660> take<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
increases the time enemy locks take on

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.670 
increases the time enemy locks take on
you<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.540> example<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.440> time

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you so for example you have more time

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.970 
you so for example you have more time
until<00:00:44.280> stingers<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.210> soft<00:00:45.960> lung<00:00:46.200> or<00:00:46.410> air

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
until stingers or soft lung or air

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.180 
until stingers or soft lung or air
rockets<00:00:47.430> lock<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.120> not<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> bad<00:00:49.379> perk<00:00:49.649> but

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
rockets lock you not a bad perk but

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.180 
rockets lock you not a bad perk but
let's<00:00:50.550> take<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> look<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> others<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.719> well

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
let's take a look at the others as well

let's take a look at the others as well
auto<00:00:53.190> loader<00:00:53.989> reduces<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.320> time<00:00:55.530> your

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
auto loader reduces the time your

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.900 
auto loader reduces the time your
pilot's<00:00:56.309> rockets<00:00:57.000> need<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.600> reload<00:00:58.910> proximity

and you can make them attackable for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.789 
and you can make them attackable for
javelins<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.470> guided<00:01:38.130> shells<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.590> last

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
javelins or guided shells the last

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
javelins or guided shells the last
upgrade<00:01:41.009> we<00:01:41.369> could<00:01:41.549> choose<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:42.000> guided<00:01:42.420> rocket

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
upgrade we could choose is guided rocket

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.710 
upgrade we could choose is guided rocket
and<00:01:43.250> guided<00:01:44.250> rocket<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.240> perk<00:01:45.450> I

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and guided rocket is the perk I

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
and guided rocket is the perk I
recommend<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.460> guided<00:01:48.060> rocket<00:01:48.360> perk

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
recommend so the guided rocket perk

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.499 
recommend so the guided rocket perk
greatly<00:01:49.229> increases<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.159> accuracy<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.850> your

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
greatly increases the accuracy of your

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.340 
greatly increases the accuracy of your
pilot<00:01:52.200> Rockets<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.549> will<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.880> able<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.350> do

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
pilot Rockets you will be able to do

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.800 
pilot Rockets you will be able to do
much<00:01:55.590> more<00:01:55.829> damage<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.340> distance<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.509> much

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
much more damage on distance it's much

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.749 
much more damage on distance it's much
easier<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.380> take<00:01:58.619> out<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.759> example<00:01:59.969> tanks<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
easier to take out for example tanks and

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.209 
easier to take out for example tanks and
it<00:02:02.759> also<00:02:02.909> works<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.479> bit<00:02:03.630> on<00:02:03.750> infantry<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:05.040> so

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
it also works a bit on infantry not so

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.700 
it also works a bit on infantry not so
great<00:02:05.490> but<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:06.060> still<00:02:06.810> better<00:02:06.990> than<00:02:07.140> without

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
great but it's still better than without

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.550 
great but it's still better than without
this<00:02:07.950> work<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.970> first<00:02:09.360> perk<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.899> recommend

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
this work so as first perk I recommend

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.350 
this work so as first perk I recommend
guided<00:02:11.250> rocket

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
helicopter is burning the ECM Gemma will

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.610 
helicopter is burning the ECM Gemma will
will<00:02:49.140> make<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.470> impossible<00:02:49.650> for<00:02:51.200> enemy<00:02:52.200> units

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
will make it impossible for enemy units

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.210 
will make it impossible for enemy units
to<00:02:52.860> lock<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.520> on<00:02:53.670> for<00:02:54.120> certain<00:02:54.750> time<00:02:55.220> this

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
to lock you on for certain time this

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.390 
to lock you on for certain time this
works<00:02:56.459> for<00:02:56.940> stingers<00:02:57.720> air<00:02:58.050> air<00:02:58.650> rockets<00:02:59.160> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
works for stingers air air rockets and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.070 
works for stingers air air rockets and
very<00:03:00.239> important

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
very important

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.570 
very important
it<00:03:01.290> works<00:03:01.620> on<00:03:01.860> laser<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.620> works<00:03:04.890> on<00:03:05.070> soft

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
it works on laser so it works on soft

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.090 
it works on laser so it works on soft
lumps<00:03:05.760> for<00:03:06.060> example<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.450> second<00:03:09.450> perk<00:03:09.690> I

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
lumps for example so a second perk I

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.699 
lumps for example so a second perk I
recommend<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.370> ECM<00:03:12.239> Gemma<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:13.170> gives<00:03:13.560> you

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
recommend the ECM Gemma it gives you

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.820 
recommend the ECM Gemma it gives you
much<00:03:14.070> more<00:03:14.280> time<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.790> operate<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
much more time to operate on the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.990 
much more time to operate on the
battlefield<00:03:17.750> much<00:03:18.750> more<00:03:18.959> time<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:20.000> engage

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
battlefield much more time to engage

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.259 
battlefield much more time to engage
targets<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.950> also<00:03:23.160> gives<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.209> the

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
targets and it also gives you the

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.620 
targets and it also gives you the
opportunity<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.560> get<00:03:26.370> out<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.880> combat<00:03:27.150> quite

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
opportunity to get out of combat quite

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.960 
opportunity to get out of combat quite
well<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.799> second<00:03:29.250> perk<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.610> clearly

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
well so a second perk I clearly

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.770 
well so a second perk I clearly
recommend<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.840> ECM<00:03:31.230> jammer<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:32.390> pilot<00:03:33.390> weapon

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
recommend the ECM jammer as pilot weapon

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.979 
recommend the ECM jammer as pilot weapon
we<00:03:34.350> don't<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.769> much<00:03:35.100> choice<00:03:35.430> we<00:03:36.239> just<00:03:36.750> have

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
we don't have much choice we just have

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.800 
we don't have much choice we just have
the<00:03:37.200> heat<00:03:37.470> seekers<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:39.030> heat<00:03:39.269> seekers<00:03:39.630> our

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
the heat seekers the heat seekers our

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.850 
the heat seekers the heat seekers our
air<00:03:40.410> rockets<00:03:40.830> but<00:03:41.700> they<00:03:42.390> are<00:03:42.570> quite<00:03:43.320> good<00:03:43.530> so

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
air rockets but they are quite good so

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.509 
air rockets but they are quite good so
we<00:03:44.820> will<00:03:45.000> choose<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:45.390> perk<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.810> course<00:03:46.519> so

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
we will choose this perk of course so

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.080 
we will choose this perk of course so
let's<00:03:47.970> take<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.330> look<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.989> gun<00:03:49.170> out<00:03:49.290> grades

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
let's take a look at the gun out grades

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.759 
let's take a look at the gun out grades
first<00:03:51.090> gonna<00:03:51.360> upgrade<00:03:51.570> we<00:03:52.080> could<00:03:52.320> take<00:03:52.500> as

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
first gonna upgrade we could take as

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.400 
first gonna upgrade we could take as
stealth<00:03:53.280> it's<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.209> same<00:03:54.450> as<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.049> pilot

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
stealth it's the same as the pilot

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.509 
stealth it's the same as the pilot
stealth<00:03:57.380> second<00:03:58.380> upgrade<00:03:58.500> we<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.040> take<00:03:59.250> is

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
stealth second upgrade we can take is

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.539 
stealth second upgrade we can take is
the<00:03:59.880> autoloader<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:01.170> outer<00:04:01.350> loader<00:04:01.769> reduces

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
the autoloader the outer loader reduces

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.430 
the autoloader the outer loader reduces
the<00:04:02.850> time<00:04:03.090> your<00:04:03.420> machine<00:04:03.900> gun<00:04:04.080> needs<00:04:04.260> to

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
the time your machine gun needs to

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.140 
the time your machine gun needs to
reload<00:04:06.170> proximity<00:04:07.170> scan<00:04:07.579> same<00:04:08.579> like<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
reload proximity scan same like the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.610 
reload proximity scan same like the
pilots<00:04:09.810> proximity<00:04:10.590> scan<00:04:12.230> maintenance<00:04:13.230> also

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
pilots proximity scan maintenance also

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.890 
pilots proximity scan maintenance also
the<00:04:14.220> same<00:04:14.430> like<00:04:14.640> pilots<00:04:15.060> maintenance<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:17.900> as

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
the same like pilots maintenance so as

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.099 
the same like pilots maintenance so as
Ghana<00:04:19.229> upgrade<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:21.180> first<00:04:21.390> book<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.870> would

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
Ghana upgrade and the first book I would

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.440 
Ghana upgrade and the first book I would
recommend<00:04:22.140> stare<00:04:22.860> basically<00:04:23.640> it's<00:04:23.880> important

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
recommend stare basically it's important

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.970 
recommend stare basically it's important
to<00:04:24.660> have<00:04:24.780> stealth<00:04:25.260> on<00:04:25.470> your<00:04:25.650> head

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
to have stealth on your head

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.850 
to have stealth on your head
the<00:04:26.250> one<00:04:26.940> time<00:04:27.150> it<00:04:28.140> will<00:04:28.320> give<00:04:28.500> you<00:04:28.650> much<00:04:28.800> more

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
the one time it will give you much more

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.370 
the one time it will give you much more
time<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.990> operate<00:04:31.130> on<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.280> battlefield<00:04:32.850> and

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
time to operate on the battlefield and

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.710 
time to operate on the battlefield and
you<00:04:34.380> have<00:04:34.530> much<00:04:34.770> more<00:04:34.800> time<00:04:35.130> until<00:04:35.720> enemy

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
you have much more time until enemy

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.820 
you have much more time until enemy
locks<00:04:36.960> are<00:04:37.260> locked<00:04:37.890> on<00:04:38.160> you

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
locks are locked on you

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.500 
locks are locked on you
so<00:04:40.830> as<00:04:41.300> second<00:04:42.300> gonna<00:04:42.810> work<00:04:43.170> organic<00:04:43.800> edge<00:04:43.950> it

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
so as second gonna work organic edge it

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.950 
so as second gonna work organic edge it
you<00:04:45.510> could<00:04:45.720> use<00:04:46.190> infrared<00:04:47.190> flares<00:04:47.880> yeah<00:04:48.600> so

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
you could use infrared flares yeah so

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.840 
you could use infrared flares yeah so
same<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.280> pilots<00:04:50.820> yes<00:04:51.470> as<00:04:52.850> second

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
same like the pilots yes as second

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.020 
same like the pilots yes as second
upgrade<00:04:54.000> you<00:04:54.600> could<00:04:54.810> use<00:04:55.050> zoom<00:04:55.860> optics<00:04:56.280> so

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
upgrade you could use zoom optics so

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.210 
upgrade you could use zoom optics so
zoom<00:04:57.420> optics<00:04:57.780> is<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.410> same<00:04:58.650> like<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.070> other

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
zoom optics is the same like on other

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.240 
zoom optics is the same like on other
vehicles<00:05:00.350> you<00:05:01.350> get<00:05:01.560> three<00:05:02.220> times

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
vehicles you get three times

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.490 
vehicles you get three times
magnification<00:05:03.350> for<00:05:04.760> four<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.940> view<00:05:06.210> but<00:05:07.200> on

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
magnification for four you view but on

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.450 
magnification for four you view but on
long<00:05:08.100> distances<00:05:08.730> your<00:05:09.030> machine<00:05:09.480> gun<00:05:09.510> is<00:05:09.990> quite

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
long distances your machine gun is quite

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.340 
long distances your machine gun is quite
inaccurate<00:05:11.460> as<00:05:12.030> well<00:05:12.240> and<00:05:12.510> it's<00:05:12.810> bear<00:05:13.050> its

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
inaccurate as well and it's bear its

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.460 
inaccurate as well and it's bear its
race<00:05:13.710> very<00:05:14.370> much<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.420> I<00:05:15.870> don't<00:05:16.260> really

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
race very much so I don't really

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.180 
race very much so I don't really
recommend<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:19.320> next<00:05:19.560> book<00:05:19.740> you<00:05:19.770> could<00:05:20.040> use

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
recommend it the next book you could use

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.940 
recommend it the next book you could use
a<00:05:20.400> thermal<00:05:20.820> optics<00:05:21.030> many<00:05:21.930> Gunners<00:05:22.350> are<00:05:22.620> fans

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
a thermal optics many Gunners are fans

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.050 
a thermal optics many Gunners are fans
of<00:05:23.190> thermal<00:05:23.700> optics<00:05:23.820> because<00:05:24.510> they<00:05:24.780> can<00:05:24.990> see

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
of thermal optics because they can see

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.570 
of thermal optics because they can see
enemy<00:05:27.060> infantry<00:05:27.420> much<00:05:28.290> better<00:05:28.740> than<00:05:29.160> without

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
enemy infantry much better than without

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.430 
enemy infantry much better than without
it<00:05:30.320> but<00:05:31.670> the<00:05:32.670> gadget<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.240> would<00:05:33.510> recommend<00:05:34.110> here

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
it but the gadget I would recommend here

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.480 
it but the gadget I would recommend here
is<00:05:34.650> IR<00:05:35.370> flares<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:36.390> reason<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:36.900> you<00:05:37.290> have<00:05:37.490> you

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
is IR flares the reason is you have you

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.970 
is IR flares the reason is you have you
have<00:05:38.640> a<00:05:38.670> second<00:05:39.360> defensive<00:05:40.290> measure<00:05:40.970> yeah<00:05:41.970> so

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
have a second defensive measure yeah so

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.680 
have a second defensive measure yeah so
when<00:05:43.980> you<00:05:44.070> get<00:05:44.250> locked<00:05:44.460> by<00:05:44.700> stingers<00:05:45.330> for

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
when you get locked by stingers for

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.900 
when you get locked by stingers for
example<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.200> pilot<00:05:46.530> can<00:05:46.710> use<00:05:46.890> this<00:05:47.310> tremor<00:05:47.640> if

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
example the pilot can use this tremor if

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.280 
example the pilot can use this tremor if
you<00:05:48.060> got<00:05:48.270> lock<00:05:49.020> the<00:05:49.320> second<00:05:49.770> time<00:05:49.950> by<00:05:50.280> stingers

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290 
you got lock the second time by stingers

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.190 
you got lock the second time by stingers
the<00:05:52.290> gunner<00:05:52.500> can<00:05:52.800> use<00:05:52.950> his<00:05:53.190> flares<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:54.300> this<00:05:55.050> is

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
the gunner can use his flares so this is

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.780 
the gunner can use his flares so this is
very<00:05:55.410> important<00:05:55.950> the<00:05:56.520> gunner<00:05:56.700> has<00:05:57.000> flares<00:05:58.790> so

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
very important the gunner has flares so

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.540 
very important the gunner has flares so
it's<00:06:00.150> gonna<00:06:00.300> weapon<00:06:01.110> we<00:06:01.470> have<00:06:01.650> two<00:06:02.010> choices<00:06:02.250> we

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
it's gonna weapon we have two choices we

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.570 
it's gonna weapon we have two choices we
have<00:06:02.940> the<00:06:03.180> guided<00:06:03.870> missile<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.440> we<00:06:05.130> have<00:06:05.340> the

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
have the guided missile and we have the

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.620 
have the guided missile and we have the
TV<00:06:05.880> massage<00:06:06.360> the<00:06:07.320> guided<00:06:07.680> missile<00:06:07.830> is<00:06:08.400> like<00:06:09.330> a

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
TV massage the guided missile is like a

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.950 
TV massage the guided missile is like a
lock-on<00:06:09.960> Messiah<00:06:10.760> yes<00:06:11.760> so<00:06:12.030> you<00:06:12.090> can<00:06:12.360> lock<00:06:12.780> on

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
lock-on Messiah yes so you can lock on

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.740 
lock-on Messiah yes so you can lock on
enemy<00:06:13.560> tanks<00:06:13.860> for<00:06:14.070> example<00:06:14.550> and<00:06:14.750> after

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
enemy tanks for example and after

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.860 
enemy tanks for example and after
locking<00:06:16.380> on<00:06:16.500> you<00:06:16.680> can<00:06:16.920> fire<00:06:17.370> one<00:06:17.760> rocket<00:06:18.180> on<00:06:18.540> it

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
locking on you can fire one rocket on it

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.110 
locking on you can fire one rocket on it
yeah<00:06:19.530> one<00:06:19.920> thing<00:06:19.950> you<00:06:20.250> have<00:06:20.400> to<00:06:20.520> keep<00:06:20.670> in<00:06:20.850> mind

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
yeah one thing you have to keep in mind

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.390 
yeah one thing you have to keep in mind
is<00:06:21.420> I<00:06:21.720> don't<00:06:22.200> know<00:06:22.470> why<00:06:22.650> it<00:06:22.710> is<00:06:22.920> like<00:06:22.950> this<00:06:23.160> but

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
is I don't know why it is like this but

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.390 
is I don't know why it is like this but
as<00:06:24.060> soon<00:06:24.300> as<00:06:24.420> you<00:06:24.570> choose<00:06:24.840> this<00:06:25.230> perk<00:06:25.530> your

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
as soon as you choose this perk your

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.530 
as soon as you choose this perk your
machine<00:06:27.150> gun<00:06:27.420> s<00:06:27.630> scanner<00:06:28.050> seems<00:06:29.010> to<00:06:29.370> I<00:06:29.850> don't

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
machine gun s scanner seems to I don't

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.250 
machine gun s scanner seems to I don't
know<00:06:30.720> to<00:06:30.780> shake<00:06:31.580> so<00:06:32.580> and<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:33.720> damage<00:06:34.020> of<00:06:34.230> the

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
know to shake so and the damage of the

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.370 
know to shake so and the damage of the
guided<00:06:34.950> missile<00:06:35.100> is<00:06:35.460> not<00:06:35.820> so<00:06:36.060> great<00:06:36.360> if<00:06:37.320> you

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
guided missile is not so great if you

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.830 
guided missile is not so great if you
just<00:06:37.560> use<00:06:38.010> your<00:06:38.040> machine<00:06:38.880> gun<00:06:39.090> and

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
just use your machine gun and

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.290 
just use your machine gun and
quite<00:06:40.230> accurate<00:06:40.740> you<00:06:41.190> will<00:06:41.340> probably<00:06:41.580> do<00:06:42.030> more

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
quite accurate you will probably do more

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.690 
quite accurate you will probably do more
damage<00:06:42.690> on<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:43.020> target<00:06:43.470> then<00:06:43.680> using<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.340> guided

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
damage on the target then using a guided

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:50.409 
damage on the target then using a guided
missile<00:06:44.880> with<00:06:45.270> Locker<00:06:46.940> so<00:06:47.960> we<00:06:48.960> also<00:06:49.139> have<00:06:49.530> the

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
missile with Locker so we also have the

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:55.370 
missile with Locker so we also have the
TV<00:06:51.419> missile<00:06:51.930> and<00:06:52.820> the<00:06:53.820> TV<00:06:54.240> missile<00:06:54.570> is<00:06:54.900> really

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
TV missile and the TV missile is really

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.310 
TV missile and the TV missile is really
great<00:06:55.620> so<00:06:56.389> the<00:06:57.389> TV<00:06:57.600> missile<00:06:58.260> is<00:06:59.150> is<00:07:00.320> steered

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:01.320 
great so the TV missile is is steered

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.610 
great so the TV missile is is steered
from<00:07:01.680> the<00:07:02.190> first<00:07:02.460> perspective<00:07:02.880> so<00:07:03.600> from<00:07:04.470> the

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
from the first perspective so from the

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.659 
from the first perspective so from the
ego<00:07:04.830> perspective<00:07:05.430> and<00:07:06.770> it<00:07:07.770> does<00:07:08.100> a<00:07:08.130> lot<00:07:08.370> of

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:08.669 
ego perspective and it does a lot of

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.230 
ego perspective and it does a lot of
damage<00:07:08.910> and<00:07:09.240> it<00:07:10.050> has<00:07:10.200> a<00:07:10.230> great<00:07:10.650> range<00:07:10.889> and<00:07:11.240> you

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
damage and it has a great range and you

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.560 
damage and it has a great range and you
can<00:07:12.320> engage<00:07:13.320> any<00:07:13.830> target<00:07:14.520> with<00:07:14.669> it<00:07:14.850> you<00:07:15.360> can

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
can engage any target with it you can

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.440 
can engage any target with it you can
fire<00:07:15.840> it<00:07:16.080> on<00:07:16.320> infantry<00:07:17.040> you<00:07:17.400> can<00:07:17.580> fire<00:07:17.910> it<00:07:17.940> on

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
fire it on infantry you can fire it on

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.409 
fire it on infantry you can fire it on
tanks<00:07:18.990> on<00:07:19.169> enemy<00:07:19.770> helicopters<00:07:20.460> on<00:07:20.700> enemy<00:07:21.150> Jets

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 
tanks on enemy helicopters on enemy Jets

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.250 
tanks on enemy helicopters on enemy Jets
so<00:07:22.169> the<00:07:22.560> TV<00:07:22.740> missile<00:07:23.250> is<00:07:23.460> basically<00:07:24.150> the<00:07:24.990> best

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
so the TV missile is basically the best

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.490 
so the TV missile is basically the best
upgrade<00:07:26.040> for<00:07:26.550> the<00:07:26.910> helicopter<00:07:27.660> and<00:07:27.870> upgrade

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 
upgrade for the helicopter and upgrade

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.250 
upgrade for the helicopter and upgrade
with<00:07:28.740> the<00:07:28.770> most<00:07:29.130> damage<00:07:29.490> so<00:07:30.210> there's<00:07:31.139> no

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.260 
with the most damage so there's no

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.500 
with the most damage so there's no
question<00:07:31.710> about<00:07:31.800> it<00:07:32.160> at<00:07:32.370> last<00:07:32.669> perk<00:07:33.030> you<00:07:33.270> want

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
question about it at last perk you want

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:38.690 
question about it at last perk you want
