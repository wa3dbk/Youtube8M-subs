00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hey love and welcome to the hairstyles 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.730
 friday i am a bit today 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.770
 otherwise played because they easily it 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.019
 those who know me can recognize 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.120
 I usually know something 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.610
 I'm a decent make-up but I asked 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.650
 in addition, kristen stewart luck has it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.090
 just very well fitted and I think 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 that still adjusts the hairstyle 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.570
 little bit and this world wiesthal this one 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.519
 lg style they always only 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.550
 embodied with the smokey eyes with the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.990
 red lips roll with the means the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 hairstyle I think that's simply 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.070
 fit together and would be happy 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.520
 if you stay tuned then in connection 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.379
 the tutorial comes to this hairstyle as 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.379
 I start by saying that I mean mine 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.260
 first remove upper middle part 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.050
 and as strong papers as I can 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.700
 to get this buffer effect and 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.370
 I use mine for that 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.949
 paper cards with the tip in the end and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.960
 try it evenly and also very much 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.460
 so it's not accurate 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.320
 messy as I always do 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.170
 I really like that one 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.880
 can see a clear line and where he is 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.150
 You can do it yourself 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.650
 choose depending on how thick or how 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.030
 narrow this upper area 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.159
 want to have copper area 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.740
 i think i just go here at the end 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.840
 the eyebrow rainer long and tough that 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.159
 here to the back by round because the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:33.750
 partie you've taken to earn 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:35.400
 out then I'm just talking it all 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.320
 in short so that I on the other side 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.409
 can also do that and fixes that with 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.689
 a hair clip and you can see it now 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.180
 Here this clear head has arisen 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.409
 if I have my animals and that's exactly what 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.750
 I will do the same again on the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.710
 other 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.740
 since my remaining hair I will 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.290
 Now with the help of a band just in 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.290
 to do a normal job 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.510
 for I try with my combat the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.300
 pages that I have separated myself here 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.900
 as smooth as possible just back to 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.820
 do 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.160
 you can do that a little more 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.560
 Use hair spray or dry shampoo 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 so it's really straight down 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.450
 goes back than it must not be relaxed 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.300
 its so i just use someone came 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.300
 and know that here back 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.450
 if I do that with a soft rubber 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.450
 have fixed then I take care of me 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.230
 the upper part and now it starts 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.880
 team 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.220
 we really want this profectis 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.290
 you need to be perfect 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.330
 a lot of volume and I just start 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.250
 That I now have my hair first 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.549
 is going forward and start with the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:52.810
 the last strand so even if I do 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.739
 you have already done completely 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.120
 clearly that I also resent when 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.560
 that you always buffer extremely 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.570
 you have done that now 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.910
 just so you on the sides and 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.290
 the uppermost tries to the top 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.060
 Too smooth, so to speak 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.100
 brush to comb was ye the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.190
 fourth of course not see or no 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.750
 others should try that and you 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.090
 smooth it out a bit now 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.260
 But not with the facts too much 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.100
 in the deep if you want that 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.140
 did not copy 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.190
 came out you just wanted one 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.410
 nice surface so if you can 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.970
 that could have done reasonably well 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.800
 you fix this with hairspray 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.830
 you just accept it now 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.840
 say you have come up with this one here 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.970
 tail and here you just take yours 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:51.460
 spiked and hold this up 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:53.170
 together so you turn your toupierte 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.450
 just play a bit 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.560
 one the direction in which he on the zoff 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.200
 to turn on 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.370
 and then he fixes that roughly in soft 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.370
 Romania with hair spa 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.000
 the next thing you will do it 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.070
 just put your braid back in one 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.989
 a bit to relax and then into the 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.900
 same direction as with the upper one 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.850
 just pull a banana, so to speak 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.400
 that's what the herald calls it 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.699
 just inwardly into tries thereby 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.080
 the upper thing you have copied so 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:35.520
 to cover a bit 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.380
 so that you no longer the strand 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.250
 but see everything down rheins again 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.250
 comes out 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.060
 So it was something in the at the 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.650
