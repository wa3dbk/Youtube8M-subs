00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
saw as a person first it kind of seemed

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.440 
saw as a person first it kind of seemed
cool<00:00:27.410> but<00:00:28.070> then<00:00:28.370> as<00:00:28.580> I<00:00:28.700> was<00:00:28.790> watching<00:00:29.270> through

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
cool but then as I was watching through

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.779 
cool but then as I was watching through
the<00:00:29.539> thing<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:29.990> looks<00:00:30.260> almost<00:00:30.800> like<00:00:31.340> on<00:00:31.610> the

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
the thing it looks almost like on the

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.310 
the thing it looks almost like on the
trailer<00:00:32.119> they<00:00:32.270> show<00:00:32.450> a<00:00:32.480> lot<00:00:32.719> on<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.930> iPad

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
trailer they show a lot on the iPad

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.200 
trailer they show a lot on the iPad
right<00:00:33.590> because<00:00:33.860> obviously<00:00:33.980> it's<00:00:34.370> bigger<00:00:34.550> and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
right because obviously it's bigger and

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.669 
right because obviously it's bigger and
it<00:00:35.600> looks<00:00:35.780> like<00:00:35.870> this<00:00:36.140> would<00:00:36.289> pretty<00:00:36.440> much

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:36.679 
it looks like this would pretty much

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.860 
it looks like this would pretty much
only<00:00:36.920> be<00:00:37.309> good<00:00:37.489> on<00:00:37.640> a<00:00:37.670> tablet<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:38.510> coming<00:00:38.780> to

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
only be good on a tablet it's coming to

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.529 
only be good on a tablet it's coming to
all<00:00:38.989> iOS<00:00:39.260> devices<00:00:39.499> but<00:00:40.460> really<00:00:41.030> who<00:00:41.480> would

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:41.539 
all iOS devices but really who would

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:43.479 
all iOS devices but really who would
want<00:00:41.749> to<00:00:41.780> be<00:00:41.899> playing<00:00:42.170> call<00:00:42.679> of<00:00:42.710> duty<00:00:42.859> on<00:00:43.339> their

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.939 
want to be playing call of duty on their
iPod<00:00:43.940> now<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.569> call<00:00:44.899> of<00:00:44.960> duty<00:00:45.140> zombies<00:00:45.620> was

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
iPod now the call of duty zombies was

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.369 
iPod now the call of duty zombies was
okay<00:00:46.309> just<00:00:46.999> because<00:00:47.329> there's<00:00:47.809> just<00:00:48.140> basically

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
okay just because there's just basically

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.259 
okay just because there's just basically
the<00:00:48.530> two<00:00:48.710> analog<00:00:49.039> sticks<00:00:49.100> but<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:49.969> one<00:00:50.149> look

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
the two analog sticks but this one look

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.389 
the two analog sticks but this one look
like<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.510> had<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.659> lot<00:00:51.019> more<00:00:51.199> complex<00:00:51.739> controls

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
like it had a lot more complex controls

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.099 
like it had a lot more complex controls
because<00:00:53.089> basically<00:00:53.300> they're<00:00:53.600> taking<00:00:53.749> like

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
because basically they're taking like

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.439 
because basically they're taking like
the<00:00:54.229> black<00:00:54.440> ops<00:00:54.649> 2<00:00:54.829> multiplayer<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.639> making

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
the black ops 2 multiplayer and making

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.029 
the black ops 2 multiplayer and making
an<00:00:56.569> iOS<00:00:56.929> version<00:00:57.319> of<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.559> because<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:57.859> saw

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
an iOS version of that because I saw

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.610 
an iOS version of that because I saw
weapons<00:00:58.489> like<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:58.909> an-94<00:00:59.690> and<00:00:59.839> the<00:00:59.899> type<00:01:00.109> 25

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
weapons like the an-94 and the type 25

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.750 
weapons like the an-94 and the type 25
in<00:01:00.829> there<00:01:00.949> like<00:01:01.100> they're<00:01:01.219> using<00:01:01.429> the<00:01:01.519> same

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
in there like they're using the same

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.119 
in there like they're using the same
weapons<00:01:02.210> the<00:01:02.690> maps<00:01:03.019> will<00:01:03.350> all<00:01:03.469> look<00:01:03.649> different

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
weapons the maps will all look different

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.240 
weapons the maps will all look different
but<00:01:04.610> still<00:01:05.089> it<00:01:05.540> just<00:01:06.049> looks<00:01:06.710> like<00:01:06.890> they're

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
but still it just looks like they're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.730 
but still it just looks like they're
making<00:01:07.370> a<00:01:07.640> black<00:01:07.850> ops<00:01:08.060> 2<00:01:08.300> for<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:09.020> iOS<00:01:09.410> pretty

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
making a black ops 2 for the iOS pretty

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.650 
making a black ops 2 for the iOS pretty
much<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.130> changing<00:01:10.610> up<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.850> campaign<00:01:11.300> and

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
much is changing up the campaign and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.750 
much is changing up the campaign and
some<00:01:12.350> multiplayer<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.040> that<00:01:13.160> kind<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.400> stuff

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
some multiplayer and that kind of stuff

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.210 
some multiplayer and that kind of stuff
but<00:01:14.200> when<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.230> was<00:01:15.440> looking<00:01:15.650> at<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.010> really

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
but when I was looking at it it really

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.250 
but when I was looking at it it really
only<00:01:16.520> looked<00:01:16.850> good<00:01:17.090> for<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> iPad<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.110> if<00:01:18.170> you

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
only looked good for the iPad so if you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.780 
only looked good for the iPad so if you
have<00:01:18.350> an<00:01:18.440> iPad<00:01:18.710> that's<00:01:18.920> fine<00:01:19.100> it's<00:01:19.340> seven

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
have an iPad that's fine it's seven

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.640 
have an iPad that's fine it's seven
dollars<00:01:19.910> I<00:01:20.270> believe<00:01:20.330> this<00:01:20.720> app<00:01:20.870> cost<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:21.500> a

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
dollars I believe this app cost so a

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.050 
dollars I believe this app cost so a
little<00:01:22.070> bit<00:01:22.190> on<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.310> pricey<00:01:22.490> side<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:22.910> apps

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
little bit on the pricey side for apps

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.520 
little bit on the pricey side for apps
but<00:01:23.270> yet<00:01:23.420> again<00:01:23.540> it's<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:23.900> lot<00:01:24.020> cheaper<00:01:24.260> than<00:01:24.410> a

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
but yet again it's a lot cheaper than a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.830 
but yet again it's a lot cheaper than a
Call<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.800> Duty<00:01:25.100> game<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.000> if<00:01:26.270> that<00:01:26.480> works<00:01:26.690> out

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
Call of Duty game so if that works out

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.710 
Call of Duty game so if that works out
for<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.170> but<00:01:27.530> in<00:01:27.740> my<00:01:27.800> case<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.550> have<00:01:28.820> a<00:01:28.850> ps3<00:01:29.210> like

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
for you but in my case I have a ps3 like

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.320 
for you but in my case I have a ps3 like
10<00:01:30.320> feet<00:01:30.500> away<00:01:30.560> from<00:01:30.800> me<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.760> have<00:01:31.850> a<00:01:31.940> mic

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
don't know what they're doing but it'd

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.330 
don't know what they're doing but it'd
just<00:01:50.390> be<00:01:50.570> way<00:01:50.810> too<00:01:50.870> small<00:01:51.260> to<00:01:51.320> play<00:01:51.650> it<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:51.920> the

what you think but it seems okay it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.310 
what you think but it seems okay it
seems<00:02:00.890> like<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:01.070> cool<00:02:01.310> concept<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:02.330> it's<00:02:02.840> maybe

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
seems like a cool concept but it's maybe
