don't have enough traction to go ahead
and<00:01:22.049> pull<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.490> loads<00:01:23.970> up

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and pull it through it just loads up

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.120 
and pull it through it just loads up
with<00:01:24.330> mud<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> that's<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.100> doing

acre field over there this field here

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.270 
acre field over there this field here
you<00:02:31.330> know<00:02:31.420> they<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:32.950> lot<00:02:33.130> of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
you know they just it's just a lot of

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.660 
you know they just it's just a lot of
land

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
land

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.770 
land
um<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:35.340> bunch<00:02:36.340> of<00:02:36.490> solar<00:02:36.700> panels<00:02:37.120> over<00:02:37.300> there<00:02:37.570> oh

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
um a bunch of solar panels over there oh

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.380 
um a bunch of solar panels over there oh
maybe<00:02:38.290> you<00:02:38.440> could<00:02:38.560> see<00:02:38.740> which<00:02:39.610> I<00:02:39.790> find<00:02:40.060> them<00:02:40.240> to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
maybe you could see which I find them to

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.449 
maybe you could see which I find them to
be<00:02:40.420> rather<00:02:40.720> ridiculous<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:45.010> because<00:02:45.340> they

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
be rather ridiculous just because they

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.270 
be rather ridiculous just because they
took<00:02:45.610> good<00:02:45.820> farmland<00:02:46.209> really<00:02:46.900> good<00:02:47.280> solar

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
took good farmland really good solar

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.870 
took good farmland really good solar
panels<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:49.440> when<00:02:50.440> there's<00:02:50.650> like<00:02:50.890> 50<00:02:51.220> thousand

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
panels on when there's like 50 thousand

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.550 
panels on when there's like 50 thousand
rooms<00:02:52.150> over<00:02:52.570> there<00:02:52.630> on<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:52.959> other<00:02:53.020> side<00:02:53.200> of

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
rooms over there on the other side of

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.810 
rooms over there on the other side of
this<00:02:53.650> thing<00:02:53.860> they<00:02:54.040> could<00:02:54.160> put<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> solar<00:02:54.580> panel

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
this thing they could put a solar panel

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.180 
this thing they could put a solar panel
in<00:02:55.060> each<00:02:55.180> one<00:02:55.360> of<00:02:55.450> those<00:02:55.540> roofs<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.200> probably

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
in each one of those roofs and probably

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.490 
in each one of those roofs and probably
come<00:02:57.340> up<00:02:57.459> with<00:02:57.580> more<00:02:57.790> surface<00:02:58.209> to<00:02:59.140> generate

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
come up with more surface to generate

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.800 
come up with more surface to generate
electric<00:02:59.920> than<00:03:00.790> they<00:03:00.970> did<00:03:01.030> at<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.330> forty<00:03:01.780> five

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
electric than they did at a forty five

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.470 
electric than they did at a forty five
acre<00:03:02.170> solar<00:03:02.500> field<00:03:02.860> but<00:03:03.580> hey<00:03:04.000> what<00:03:04.330> do<00:03:04.390> you

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
acre solar field but hey what do you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.640 
acre solar field but hey what do you
know<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.690> know<00:03:04.989> they<00:03:05.140> got<00:03:05.260> paid<00:03:05.500> and

all righty that was simple let's dig it

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.340 
all righty that was simple let's dig it
out<00:04:20.660> now<00:04:21.020> it's<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.290> nice<00:04:21.500> even<00:04:21.950> straight<00:04:22.850> run

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
you just go right on through kind of a

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.450 
you just go right on through kind of a
nice<00:04:30.170> little<00:04:30.380> deal<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.710> shouldn't<00:04:31.220> have<00:04:31.280> did

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
nice little deal I shouldn't have did

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.550 
nice little deal I shouldn't have did
what<00:04:31.640> I<00:04:31.670> did<00:04:31.940> there<00:04:32.240> but<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:33.020> know<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.170> figured

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
what I did there but you know I figured

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.100 
what I did there but you know I figured
I'd<00:04:33.650> throw<00:04:33.950> some<00:04:34.700> stone<00:04:35.000> down<00:04:35.270> in<00:04:35.510> there<00:04:35.750> I<00:04:35.960> do

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
I'd throw some stone down in there I do

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.950 
I'd throw some stone down in there I do
have<00:04:36.530> to<00:04:36.710> go<00:04:36.830> get<00:04:37.040> some<00:04:37.220> shale<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:37.910> finish<00:04:38.750> up

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
have to go get some shale and finish up

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.800 
have to go get some shale and finish up
over<00:04:39.260> there<00:04:39.500> but<00:04:39.980> for<00:04:40.970> the<00:04:41.060> most<00:04:41.120> part<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.720> think

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
over there but for the most part I think

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.440 
over there but for the most part I think
we<00:04:42.320> did<00:04:43.070> it<00:04:43.100> alright<00:04:43.520> job<00:04:43.730> now<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.030> can<00:04:44.270> walk

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
we did it alright job now I can walk

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.840
