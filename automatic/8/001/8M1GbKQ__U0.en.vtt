00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
now one of the things that I think is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.220 
now one of the things that I think is
really<00:03:01.310> interesting<00:03:01.400> look<00:03:02.060> at<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.269> sky<00:03:02.510> do

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
really interesting look at the sky do

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.570 
really interesting look at the sky do

foggy<00:03:04.900> yeah<00:03:05.900> now<00:03:06.470> you<00:03:06.530> would<00:03:06.709> think<00:03:06.950> he<00:03:07.580> didn't

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
foggy yeah now you would think he didn't

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.910 
foggy yeah now you would think he didn't
put<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:07.940> lot<00:03:08.090> of<00:03:08.209> paint<00:03:08.420> up<00:03:08.630> there

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
put a lot of paint up there

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
put a lot of paint up there
but<00:03:09.099> he<00:03:09.550> wanted<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.150> look<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.360> way<00:03:10.540> now

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140
