wondered what would happen if they

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.779 
wondered what would happen if they
actually<00:00:51.270> pull<00:00:51.539> them<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.190> sure<00:00:53.190> they<00:00:53.340> acted

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
actually pull them like sure they acted

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.880 
actually pull them like sure they acted
out<00:00:53.940> but<00:00:54.329> none<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.020> us<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.649> what's

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
out but none of us really know what's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.380 
out but none of us really know what's
gonna<00:00:56.039> happen<00:00:56.250> when<00:00:56.610> we<00:00:56.640> pull<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
gonna happen when we pull them and so I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.680 
gonna happen when we pull them and so I
thought<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.559> better<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.820> safety<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
thought to better the safety of the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.149 
thought to better the safety of the
public<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:02.930> satiate<00:01:03.930> my<00:01:03.960> own<00:01:04.260> curiosity<00:01:04.470> I

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159

light if you didn't know this but it's
water<00:02:34.950> activated<00:02:35.730> like<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.150> can't<00:02:36.360> just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
water activated like you can't just

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.090 
water activated like you can't just
flick<00:02:36.870> on<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> switch<00:02:37.440> and<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.680> light<00:02:37.830> starts

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
flick on a switch and the light starts

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.160 
flick on a switch and the light starts
blinking<00:02:38.160> but<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.180> got<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.360> submerged<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
blinking but it's got a submerged in the

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.810 
blinking but it's got a submerged in the
water<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.680> somehow<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.100> guess<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.490> current

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
water and somehow I guess the current

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.780 
water and somehow I guess the current
connects<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.840> get<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> light<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
connects and so you get the light and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.340 
connects and so you get the light and
you'll<00:02:44.790> see<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.360> video<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.900> then

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350
