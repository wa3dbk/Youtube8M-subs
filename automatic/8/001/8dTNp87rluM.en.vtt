00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
out for the school team and I guess

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
out for the school team and I guess

because<00:00:45.329> training<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.960> very<00:00:46.170> intense<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
because training is very intense the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
because training is very intense the
challenges<00:00:47.579> would<00:00:47.730> probably<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.719> injuries

per<00:00:50.129> se<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.670> think<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.840> all<00:00:52.379> part

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
per se but I think that it's all part
