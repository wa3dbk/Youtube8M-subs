00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929 
little before takes them after it's
gonna<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.960> better<00:01:31.110> for<00:01:31.229> your<00:01:31.530> body<00:01:31.710> right<00:01:32.009> so

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
gonna be better for your body right so

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.310 
gonna be better for your body right so
that's<00:01:33.090> kind<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.299> what<00:01:33.450> I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:34.020> far<00:01:34.229> as

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that's kind of what I think as far as

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.870 
that's kind of what I think as far as
when<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.770> should<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.310> out<00:01:35.490> suggest

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
when you should take it out suggest

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
when you should take it out suggest
taking<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.270> after<00:01:36.659> even<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.470> take<00:01:37.680> a

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
taking it after even if you don't take a

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
taking it after even if you don't take a
pre-workout<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.640> find<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.240> better<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.630> take<00:01:39.780> it

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
pre-workout I find it better to take it

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.350 
pre-workout I find it better to take it
as<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> post-workout<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.759> seems<00:01:42.000> better<00:01:42.210> in

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
as a post-workout this seems better in

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.480 
as a post-workout this seems better in
the<00:01:42.420> recovery<00:01:42.869> process<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.829> as<00:01:43.950> far<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.189> what

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the recovery process now as far as what

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.980 
the recovery process now as far as what
you<00:01:44.579> should<00:01:44.790> mix<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> with<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> big

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
you should mix it with this is a big

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.840 
you should mix it with this is a big
debate<00:01:46.170> should<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> take<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.430> protein

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
debate should you take it with protein

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.690 
debate should you take it with protein
should<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> not<00:01:48.860> experts<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.520> in

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
should you not experts that are for in

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.490 
should you not experts that are for in
say<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:51.119> taking<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.630> protein<00:01:52.079> actually

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
say that taking it with protein actually

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.230 
say that taking it with protein actually
helps<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.009> absorption<00:01:53.100> protein<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
helps with the absorption protein and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.209 
helps with the absorption protein and
creatine<00:01:54.329> kind<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> work<00:01:54.960> together<00:01:55.140> absorb<00:01:56.070> in

and<00:02:13.069> it<00:02:13.640> between<00:02:13.940> those<00:02:14.180> two<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:14.720> was

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
and it between those two if that was

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.240 
and it between those two if that was
your<00:02:14.930> options<00:02:15.349> I<00:02:15.500> would<00:02:15.560> take<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.069> my

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
your options I would take it with my

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.360 
your options I would take it with my
protein<00:02:16.700> just<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:17.599> easier<00:02:18.140> and<00:02:19.010> for<00:02:19.250> me

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
protein just it's easier and for me

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.710 
protein just it's easier and for me
there's<00:02:19.670> really<00:02:19.730> it's<00:02:20.150> more<00:02:20.269> personal

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
there's really it's more personal

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.660 
there's really it's more personal
preference<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.349> I<00:02:21.890> really<00:02:22.280> haven't<00:02:22.430> seen<00:02:22.580> a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
preference and I really haven't seen a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.400 
preference and I really haven't seen a
difference<00:02:23.150> so<00:02:23.660> for<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.959> would<00:02:24.140> just<00:02:24.290> say

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
difference so for that I would just say

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.720 
difference so for that I would just say
take<00:02:24.590> it<00:02:24.739> with<00:02:24.860> your<00:02:24.950> protein<00:02:25.340> it's<00:02:25.459> probably

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
take it with your protein it's probably

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.190 
take it with your protein it's probably
not<00:02:25.790> going<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.030> matter<00:02:26.150> what<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.840> would

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
not going to matter what I would

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.509 
not going to matter what I would

basically<00:03:10.700> insulin<00:03:11.660> guys<00:03:11.810> think<00:03:12.140> of<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.380> as

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
basically insulin guys think of it as

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.250 
basically insulin guys think of it as
like<00:03:12.680> little<00:03:12.860> boats<00:03:13.340> in<00:03:13.730> your<00:03:14.000> body<00:03:14.239> and<00:03:14.569> the

creatine is what your body needs so the
bows<00:03:17.450> need<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.810> take<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.109> create<00:03:18.319> team

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
bows need to take to create team

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.840 
bows need to take to create team
throughout<00:03:18.829> your<00:03:19.010> body<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.370> get<00:03:19.519> it<00:03:19.639> there<00:03:19.760> as

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
fast as it can get as much of it you

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.670 
fast as it can get as much of it you
know<00:03:22.609> you<00:03:22.760> take<00:03:23.000> say<00:03:23.209> five<00:03:23.450> grams<00:03:23.780> get<00:03:24.350> as<00:03:24.470> much

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
know you take say five grams get as much

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.949 
know you take say five grams get as much
of<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.889> 5<00:03:25.190> grams<00:03:25.549> into<00:03:25.760> your<00:03:25.940> body<00:03:26.150> digested

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
of that 5 grams into your body digested

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.590 
of that 5 grams into your body digested
absorbed<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:28.730> help<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:28.970> recover<00:03:29.269> get

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
absorbed to help you recover get

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.580 
absorbed to help you recover get
stronger<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.049> get<00:03:30.230> bigger

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
stronger to get bigger

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.069 
stronger to get bigger
now<00:03:31.340> spiking<00:03:31.880> up<00:03:32.000> your<00:03:32.150> insulin<00:03:32.540> levels<00:03:32.840> is

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
now spiking up your insulin levels is

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.509 
now spiking up your insulin levels is
basically<00:03:33.500> going<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.680> create<00:03:33.889> a<00:03:34.069> whole<00:03:34.489> bunch

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
basically going to create a whole bunch

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.059 
basically going to create a whole bunch
of<00:03:34.880> boats<00:03:35.150> inside<00:03:35.750> your<00:03:35.930> body<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:36.560> I'm<00:03:36.829> using

of boats inside your body and I'm using

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.370 
of boats inside your body and I'm using
boats<00:03:37.819> as<00:03:38.000> an<00:03:38.120> example<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.780> think<00:03:39.019> of<00:03:39.200> like

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
boats as an example and think of like

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.670 
boats as an example and think of like
creatine<00:03:39.859> as<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:41.299> know<00:03:41.389> like<00:03:41.569> paramedics<00:03:42.290> the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
creatine as you know like paramedics the

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.949 
creatine as you know like paramedics the
paramedics<00:03:43.280> need<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.579> recover<00:03:44.329> your<00:03:44.600> muscles

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
paramedics need to recover your muscles

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.270 
paramedics need to recover your muscles
they<00:03:45.049> need<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.290> go<00:03:45.410> get<00:03:45.620> into<00:03:45.769> your<00:03:45.859> body<00:03:46.100> you

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
they need to go get into your body you

they need to go get into your body you
know<00:03:46.430> they<00:03:46.549> need<00:03:46.700> to<00:03:46.730> do<00:03:46.910> their<00:03:47.090> thing<00:03:47.139> well

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
know they need to do their thing well

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.960 
know they need to do their thing well
having<00:03:48.410> more<00:03:48.560> boats<00:03:48.829> obviously<00:03:49.760> it's<00:03:49.880> gonna

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
having more boats obviously it's gonna

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.210 
having more boats obviously it's gonna
get<00:03:50.180> there<00:03:50.329> faster<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.139> having<00:03:51.769> more<00:03:51.980> boats

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
get there faster and having more boats

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.280 
get there faster and having more boats
there's<00:03:52.519> going<00:03:52.609> to<00:03:52.670> be<00:03:52.760> more<00:03:53.090> you<00:03:53.239> know<00:03:53.359> so

there's going to be more you know so
taking<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.889> spiking<00:03:55.340> up<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:55.730> insulin<00:03:56.569> with

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
taking the spiking up the insulin with

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.390 
taking the spiking up the insulin with
grape<00:03:56.870> juice<00:03:57.049> is<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.260> great<00:03:57.530> thing<00:03:57.739> to<00:03:57.829> do<00:03:57.980> this

make sure if your are going to take it

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.000 
make sure if your are going to take it
with<00:04:09.139> the<00:04:09.230> juice<00:04:09.440> which<00:04:09.650> is<00:04:09.680> what<00:04:09.919> I'd

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
with the juice which is what I'd

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:11.949 
with the juice which is what I'd
recommend<00:04:10.190> take<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.150> with<00:04:11.269> grape<00:04:11.480> juice<00:04:11.780> if

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
recommend take it with grape juice if

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.839 
recommend take it with grape juice if
you<00:04:12.319> can't<00:04:12.560> get<00:04:12.739> grape<00:04:12.950> juice<00:04:13.190> get<00:04:13.459> apple

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
you can't get grape juice get apple

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.150 
you can't get grape juice get apple
juice<00:04:14.030> stay<00:04:14.870> away<00:04:15.169> from<00:04:15.650> orange<00:04:15.980> juice

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
juice stay away from orange juice

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.099 
juice stay away from orange juice
because<00:04:16.370> orange<00:04:16.789> juice<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.209> way<00:04:17.450> too<00:04:17.510> acidic

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
because orange juice is way too acidic

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.690 
because orange juice is way too acidic
it's<00:04:18.709> actually<00:04:19.039> going<00:04:19.130> to<00:04:19.220> turn<00:04:19.459> your

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
it's actually going to turn your

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.370 
it's actually going to turn your
creatine<00:04:20.239> into<00:04:20.479> a<00:04:20.570> different<00:04:20.959> form<00:04:21.260> of

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
creatine into a different form of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.110 
creatine into a different form of
creatine<00:04:21.680> which<00:04:21.979> your<00:04:22.130> body<00:04:22.250> can't<00:04:22.610> use<00:04:22.880> it's

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
creatine which your body can't use it's

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.340 
creatine which your body can't use it's
really<00:04:23.479> not<00:04:23.630> degradable

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
really not degradable

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.370 
really not degradable
I<00:04:24.380> cannot<00:04:24.740> digest<00:04:24.950> it's<00:04:25.640> not<00:04:25.820> gonna<00:04:25.970> absorb

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
I cannot digest it's not gonna absorb
