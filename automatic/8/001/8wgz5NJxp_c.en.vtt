00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.550 
and it's not like anything else is out
there<00:01:31.580> I<00:01:31.940> still<00:01:32.660> really<00:01:32.929> don't<00:01:33.170> know<00:01:33.319> if<00:01:33.470> I

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
there I still really don't know if I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.440 
there I still really don't know if I
like<00:01:33.770> this<00:01:34.009> game<00:01:34.250> but<00:01:34.520> I<00:01:34.550> keep<00:01:34.789> coming<00:01:35.030> back<00:01:35.240> to

like this game but I keep coming back to
it<00:01:35.780> because<00:01:36.410> it's<00:01:36.560> weird<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.459> I<00:01:37.729> thought<00:01:38.090> I'd

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
it because it's weird so I thought I'd

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:39.669 
it because it's weird so I thought I'd
tell<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.569> a<00:01:38.600> little<00:01:38.750> bit<00:01:38.840> about<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:39.259> game<00:01:39.410> I'm

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
covered here but we'll talk about the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.710 
covered here but we'll talk about the
rules<00:02:04.459> in<00:02:04.640> English<00:02:04.940> because<00:02:05.090> that's<00:02:05.450> what<00:02:05.630> I'm

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
rules in English because that's what I'm

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.779 
rules in English because that's what I'm
used<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:06.500> in<00:02:06.709> this<00:02:06.860> game<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.429> are<00:02:07.580> going

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
used to now in this game you are going

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.270 
used to now in this game you are going
to<00:02:07.940> photograph<00:02:08.750> tornadoes<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.250> idea

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
to photograph tornadoes and so the idea

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.339 
to photograph tornadoes and so the idea
is<00:02:10.729> that<00:02:11.030> you're<00:02:11.300> going<00:02:11.480> into<00:02:11.720> various

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
is that you're going into various

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.140 
is that you're going into various
dangerous<00:02:12.860> locations<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:13.730> photograph

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
dangerous locations to photograph

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.850 
dangerous locations to photograph
tornadoes<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.080> more<00:02:15.260> dangerous<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
tornadoes the more dangerous the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.699 
tornadoes the more dangerous the
location<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.819> higher<00:02:17.270> points<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.380> tornado

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
location the higher points that tornado

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.610 
location the higher points that tornado
picture<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.400> worth<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:19.940> six<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.450> most<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.319> 6

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
picture is worth so six is the most so 6

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.790 
picture is worth so six is the most so 6
is<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:22.640> view<00:02:22.910> here<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.690> guy<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:24.319> top<00:02:24.620> of

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
is this view here of this guy on top of

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.530 
is this view here of this guy on top of
a<00:02:24.890> tower<00:02:25.099> oh<00:02:25.370> yeah<00:02:25.610> let's<00:02:25.819> photograph<00:02:26.330> from

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
a tower oh yeah let's photograph from

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.050 
a tower oh yeah let's photograph from
here<00:02:26.840> as<00:02:26.989> compared<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.860> other<00:02:28.220> ones<00:02:28.489> which<00:02:28.790> are

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
here as compared to other ones which are

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.760 
here as compared to other ones which are
a<00:02:29.120> little<00:02:29.239> bit<00:02:29.510> safer<00:02:29.720> taking<00:02:30.319> pictures<00:02:30.650> from

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
a little bit safer taking pictures from

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.240 
a little bit safer taking pictures from
a<00:02:30.890> car<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:33.110> that's<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.500> idea<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:34.070> you're

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
a car and so that's the idea so you're

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.310 
a car and so that's the idea so you're
going<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.430> have<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.640> card<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.210> that<00:02:35.840> card<00:02:36.110> rope

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
going to have a card and that card rope

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.110 
going to have a card and that card rope
can<00:02:36.470> represent<00:02:36.770> your<00:02:37.040> current<00:02:37.370> location<00:02:37.490> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
can represent your current location and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.350 
can represent your current location and
where<00:02:38.510> you're<00:02:38.660> taking<00:02:38.750> pictures

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
where you're taking pictures

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.630 
where you're taking pictures
now<00:02:40.020> you're<00:02:40.530> going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.710> collect<00:02:41.070> these<00:02:41.190> cards

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
now you're going to collect these cards

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.340 
now you're going to collect these cards
into<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.880> stack<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.480> whatever<00:02:42.780> is<00:02:42.900> on<00:02:43.050> top<00:02:43.080> of

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
into a stack and whatever is on top of

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.650 
into a stack and whatever is on top of
your<00:02:43.650> stack<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> time<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.730> where<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.510> are

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
your stack at the time is where you are

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.910 
your stack at the time is where you are
so<00:02:45.960> if<00:02:46.050> you're<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.320> this<00:02:46.470> one<00:02:46.740> you're

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
so if you're in this one you're

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.540 
so if you're in this one you're
obviously<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:50.540> I'm<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:52.230> really<00:02:52.440> sure<00:02:52.740> anyway

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
obviously in I'm not really sure anyway

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.940 
obviously in I'm not really sure anyway
so<00:02:54.420> whatever<00:02:54.930> is<00:02:55.200> on<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.320> top<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.650> your<00:02:55.710> stack

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
so whatever is on the top of your stack

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.230 
so whatever is on the top of your stack
is<00:02:56.100> location<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.760> you're<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.150> that's

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
is location that you're in and that's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.090 
is location that you're in and that's
important<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.260> you'll<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.680> some<00:02:58.890> cars

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
important because you'll have some cars

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.430 
important because you'll have some cars
that<00:02:59.280> come<00:02:59.400> up<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.580> show<00:02:59.880> tornado<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:01.380> the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
that come up that show tornado and the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.490 
that come up that show tornado and the
tornado<00:03:02.280> card<00:03:02.700> show<00:03:03.240> one<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
tornado card show one of the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500 
tornado card show one of the
corresponding<00:03:04.950> place<00:03:05.430> cars<00:03:05.760> see<00:03:06.240> how<00:03:06.360> it's

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
corresponding place cars see how it's

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.820 
corresponding place cars see how it's
kind<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:06.750> blurred<00:03:07.020> out<00:03:07.230> it's<00:03:07.440> kind<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.620> hard<00:03:07.800> to

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
kind of blurred out it's kind of hard to

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.500 
kind of blurred out it's kind of hard to
tell<00:03:08.070> that's<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.580> bit<00:03:08.700> of<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.820> frustration<00:03:09.240> with

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
tell that's a bit of a frustration with

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.120 
tell that's a bit of a frustration with
the<00:03:09.540> game<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:09.990> if<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.500> look<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.860> can<00:03:10.980> usually

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
the game but if you look you can usually

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.860 
the game but if you look you can usually
figure<00:03:11.430> out<00:03:11.640> which<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:12.750> you

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
figure out which one it is and if you

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
things happen to this card so what's

happens you're going to have a stack of

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.660 
happens you're going to have a stack of
cards<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:22.260> top<00:03:22.500> shows<00:03:22.770> wherever<00:03:23.160> you<00:03:23.310> are<00:03:23.459> if

what you're going to have to do like the
example<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.870> showed<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.230> earlier<00:03:28.260> you're

example I showed you earlier you're
gonna<00:03:28.709> have<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.890> take<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.130> high<00:03:29.489> point<00:03:29.790> card

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
gonna have to take that high point card

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.820 
gonna have to take that high point card
flip<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.600> upside<00:03:30.900> down<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.290> put<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.530> under

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
flip it upside down and put it under

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.860 
flip it upside down and put it under
your<00:03:31.860> stack<00:03:32.280> at<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.000> point<00:03:33.270> it's<00:03:33.480> not<00:03:33.660> worth

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
your stack at that point it's not worth

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.780 
your stack at that point it's not worth
anything<00:03:34.140> now<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:34.800> final<00:03:35.130> score<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.550> going

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
anything now your final score is going

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.150 
anything now your final score is going
to<00:03:35.880> be<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.120> average<00:03:36.300> of<00:03:36.750> your<00:03:37.380> cards<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:37.980> what

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
to be the average of your cards and what

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.410 
to be the average of your cards and what
that<00:03:38.370> means<00:03:38.580> is<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.790> you're<00:03:38.970> going<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.180> sum

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
that means is that you're going to sum

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.090 
that means is that you're going to sum
all<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.690> numbers<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:40.260> you're

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
all the numbers that you see you're

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.890 
all the numbers that you see you're
going<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.520> count<00:03:41.760> 0<00:03:42.120> 4<00:03:42.450> cards<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:42.810> are

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
going to count 0 4 cards that are

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.660 
going to count 0 4 cards that are
facedown<00:03:43.320> you're<00:03:43.769> then<00:03:43.920> going<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.220> divide<00:03:44.489> it

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
facedown you're then going to divide it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.920 
facedown you're then going to divide it
by<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.790> number<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.150> cards<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.570> have<00:03:45.720> and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
by the number of cards you have and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.210 
by the number of cards you have and
that's<00:03:46.080> your<00:03:46.260> score<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.650> your<00:03:46.799> scores<00:03:47.070> me

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
that's your score so your scores me

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.110 
that's your score so your scores me
something<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:47.750> 2.34<00:03:48.750> or<00:03:49.019> 1.7<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.820> fewer

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
something like 2.34 or 1.7 to the fewer

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.000 
something like 2.34 or 1.7 to the fewer
cards<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.600> take<00:03:51.840> then<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.620> more<00:03:52.799> delicate

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
cards you take then the more delicate

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.830 
cards you take then the more delicate
that<00:03:53.400> averages<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:54.030> being<00:03:54.209> adjusted<00:03:54.660> if<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
that averages to being adjusted if you

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.449 
that averages to being adjusted if you
take<00:03:55.019> lots<00:03:55.320> of<00:03:55.500> cards<00:03:55.830> and<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.280> get<00:03:56.430> a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
take lots of cards and then you get a

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:58.910 
take lots of cards and then you get a
couple<00:03:56.850> facedown<00:03:57.510> ones<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:57.900> not<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.260> bad<00:03:58.410> how

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
couple facedown ones it's not so bad how

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.500 
couple facedown ones it's not so bad how
do<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.100> calculate<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.610> average<00:03:59.730> well<00:04:00.299> the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
do you calculate the average well the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.600 
do you calculate the average well the
game<00:04:00.720> presents<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.320> with<00:04:01.610> mathematical

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
game presents you with mathematical

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.310 
game presents you with mathematical
tables<00:04:03.030> that's<00:04:03.330> right<00:04:03.690> you<00:04:03.840> can<00:04:04.019> just<00:04:04.170> use

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
tables that's right you can just use

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.110 
tables that's right you can just use
this<00:04:04.440> handy<00:04:04.739> dandy<00:04:04.769> math<00:04:05.130> table<00:04:05.489> look<00:04:05.880> up<00:04:06.030> the

total and figure out what your score is
that's<00:04:09.870> right<00:04:10.170> it's<00:04:10.380> math<00:04:10.680> tables<00:04:10.950> again

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
that's right it's math tables again

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.729 
that's right it's math tables again
weird<00:04:12.330> game<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:12.959> your<00:04:13.110> scores<00:04:13.410> are<00:04:13.590> these

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
weird game so your scores are these

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.370 
weird game so your scores are these
weird<00:04:14.010> decimal<00:04:14.430> points<00:04:14.730> course<00:04:15.380> there's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
weird decimal points course there's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.370 
weird decimal points course there's
other<00:04:16.620> bizarre<00:04:16.919> stuff<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.609> goes<00:04:17.760> on<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.380> but

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
other bizarre stuff that goes on and but

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.599 
other bizarre stuff that goes on and but
i<00:04:19.410> guess<00:04:19.680> i<00:04:19.769> should<00:04:19.950> actually<00:04:20.070> explain<00:04:20.430> how

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
i guess i should actually explain how

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.370 
i guess i should actually explain how

up and stack and middle the table you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.030 
up and stack and middle the table you
always<00:04:33.030> draw<00:04:33.300> after<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:33.660> play<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> card<00:04:34.140> at<00:04:34.380> any

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
always draw after you play a card at any

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.460 
always draw after you play a card at any
point<00:04:35.400> if<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:36.210> want<00:04:36.450> that<00:04:36.660> stack<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.229> cards

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
point if you want that stack of cards

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.440 
point if you want that stack of cards
you<00:04:37.800> slap<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.370> then<00:04:38.970> you<00:04:39.090> get<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.330> take

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
you slap it and then you get to take

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.570 
you slap it and then you get to take
cards<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.290> number<00:04:40.710> of<00:04:40.800> cards<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.190> take<00:04:41.430> is

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
cards the number of cards you take is

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.670 
cards the number of cards you take is
dictated<00:04:42.090> by<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.270> number<00:04:42.720> on<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.900> top<00:04:43.260> card

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
dictated by the number on the top card

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.219 
dictated by the number on the top card
so<00:04:44.310> if<00:04:44.370> I<00:04:44.490> slap<00:04:44.820> this<00:04:45.150> card<00:04:45.540> I<00:04:45.810> would<00:04:45.960> have<00:04:46.110> to

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
so if I slap this card I would have to

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.930 
so if I slap this card I would have to
take<00:04:46.410> six<00:04:46.770> cards<00:04:47.250> starting<00:04:47.640> with<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:47.880> one

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
take six cards starting with this one

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.320 
take six cards starting with this one
going<00:04:48.330> down<00:04:48.419> so<00:04:49.110> now<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.349> game<00:04:49.680> has<00:04:50.330> averages

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
going down so now the game has averages

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.150 
going down so now the game has averages
or<00:04:51.479> calculating<00:04:52.050> and<00:04:52.169> it's<00:04:52.260> also<00:04:52.410> memory<00:04:52.950> you

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
or calculating and it's also memory you

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.340 
or calculating and it's also memory you
have<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.520> remember<00:04:53.880> what's<00:04:54.240> come<00:04:54.540> up<00:04:54.720> so<00:04:55.230> if

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
have to remember what's come up so if

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.080 
have to remember what's come up so if
you<00:04:55.470> see<00:04:55.620> some<00:04:55.800> card<00:04:56.070> that's<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.400> 0<00:04:56.700> or<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:57.000> 1

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
you see some card that's a 0 or a 1

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.640 
you see some card that's a 0 or a 1
those<00:04:57.510> are<00:04:57.630> bad<00:04:57.780> cards<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.230> don't<00:04:58.380> want<00:04:58.530> those

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
those are bad cards you don't want those

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.990 
those are bad cards you don't want those
low<00:04:58.800> card<00:04:59.070> so<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.310> have<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.550> count<00:04:59.760> in<00:04:59.970> your

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
low card so you have to count in your

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000 
low card so you have to count in your
head<00:05:00.120> how<00:05:00.690> many<00:05:00.870> cards<00:05:01.200> am<00:05:01.380> I<00:05:01.470> away<00:05:01.680> if<00:05:01.830> i<00:05:01.920> were

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
head how many cards am I away if i were

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.250 
head how many cards am I away if i were

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
anyway you get the idea weird weird

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.590 
anyway you get the idea weird weird
stuff<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:53.250> there's<00:05:54.090> a<00:05:54.180> couple<00:05:54.390> other

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
stuff and so there's a couple other

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.450 
stuff and so there's a couple other
bizarre<00:05:54.900> cards<00:05:55.530> there's<00:05:55.710> one<00:05:55.980> that<00:05:56.130> if<00:05:56.280> you

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
bizarre cards there's one that if you

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.940 
bizarre cards there's one that if you
cut<00:05:57.150> to<00:05:57.540> that<00:05:57.720> card<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:58.260> get<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.470> add<00:05:58.590> one<00:05:58.800> to

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
cut to that card you get to add one to

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.680 
cut to that card you get to add one to
your<00:05:59.010> average<00:05:59.340> but<00:05:59.700> if<00:05:59.820> it<00:05:59.940> includes<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.450> card

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
your average but if it includes the card

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.330 
your average but if it includes the card
in<00:06:00.810> your<00:06:00.900> stack<00:06:01.200> you<00:06:01.380> subtract<00:06:01.830> one<00:06:02.040> from<00:06:02.070> the

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
in your stack you subtract one from the

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.910 
in your stack you subtract one from the
average<00:06:02.700> so<00:06:03.240> it<00:06:03.510> is<00:06:03.660> a<00:06:03.870> bizarre<00:06:04.170> little<00:06:04.650> game

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:21.510 
you have to count the other two you have

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.270 
you have to count the other two you have
to<00:06:21.660> take<00:06:21.840> the<00:06:21.960> score<00:06:22.230> from<00:06:22.350> round<00:06:22.560> three<00:06:22.860> so

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
to take the score from round three so

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.370 
to take the score from round three so
after<00:06:23.490> Round<00:06:23.820> one<00:06:23.940> you<00:06:24.720> can<00:06:24.870> choose<00:06:25.110> to<00:06:25.260> keep

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
after Round one you can choose to keep

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.440 
after Round one you can choose to keep
that<00:06:25.560> score<00:06:25.860> dump<00:06:26.100> it<00:06:26.250> after<00:06:26.820> round<00:06:27.000> two<00:06:27.090> you

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450 
that score dump it after round two you

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.850 
that score dump it after round two you
can<00:06:27.570> keep<00:06:27.750> that<00:06:27.900> score<00:06:28.200> or<00:06:28.320> dump<00:06:28.500> it<00:06:28.620> if<00:06:28.740> you

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
can keep that score or dump it if you

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.260 
can keep that score or dump it if you
didn't<00:06:29.130> dump<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.400> one<00:06:29.550> from<00:06:29.669> round<00:06:29.880> round

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
didn't dump the one from round round

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.810 
didn't dump the one from round round
round<00:06:30.570> one<00:06:30.930> and<00:06:31.110> then<00:06:31.560> the<00:06:31.680> end<00:06:31.860> game<00:06:32.190> score<00:06:32.610> is

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
round one and then the end game score is

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.750 
round one and then the end game score is
your<00:06:33.060> lowest<00:06:33.530> score<00:06:34.530> from<00:06:35.070> all<00:06:35.280> three<00:06:35.580> rounds

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
your lowest score from all three rounds

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.120 
your lowest score from all three rounds
so<00:06:36.510> you<00:06:36.600> play<00:06:36.810> three<00:06:37.050> rounds<00:06:37.080> you<00:06:37.770> can<00:06:37.919> throw

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
so you play three rounds you can throw

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.740 
so you play three rounds you can throw
out<00:06:38.160> the<00:06:38.400> one<00:06:38.520> from<00:06:38.640> round<00:06:38.850> one<00:06:39.030> or<00:06:39.210> round<00:06:39.510> two

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
out the one from round one or round two

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.630 
out the one from round one or round two
and<00:06:39.960> then<00:06:40.470> you<00:06:40.590> take<00:06:40.770> the<00:06:40.919> lowest<00:06:41.310> score<00:06:41.580> of

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
and then you take the lowest score of

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.870 
and then you take the lowest score of
those<00:06:41.820> three<00:06:42.000> for<00:06:42.270> your<00:06:42.360> final<00:06:42.780> score<00:06:45.950> so<00:06:46.950> it's

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
those three for your final score so it's

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.500 
those three for your final score so it's
bizarre<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:49.200> gameplay<00:06:49.590> is<00:06:50.100> a<00:06:50.400> bit<00:06:50.940> of<00:06:51.120> speed

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510 
bizarre the gameplay is a bit of speed

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.240 
bizarre the gameplay is a bit of speed
because<00:06:51.990> you're<00:06:52.169> deciding<00:06:52.410> when<00:06:52.680> to<00:06:52.710> slap<00:06:53.070> it

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
because you're deciding when to slap it

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.640 
because you're deciding when to slap it
it's<00:06:53.430> memory<00:06:54.390> you're<00:06:54.930> doing<00:06:55.260> some<00:06:55.530> quick

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
it's memory you're doing some quick

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.440 
it's memory you're doing some quick
mathematics<00:06:56.370> you're<00:06:56.820> watching<00:06:57.210> for<00:06:57.330> those

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
mathematics you're watching for those

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:59.210 
mathematics you're watching for those
bad<00:06:57.660> cards<00:06:58.169> you're<00:06:58.320> trying<00:06:58.590> to<00:06:58.740> keep<00:06:58.950> track<00:06:59.160> of

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
bad cards you're trying to keep track of

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.390 
bad cards you're trying to keep track of
where<00:06:59.490> they<00:06:59.640> are<00:06:59.960> and<00:07:00.960> then<00:07:01.800> there's<00:07:02.340> a

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 
where they are and then there's a

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.760 
where they are and then there's a
variant<00:07:02.850> and<00:07:03.450> in<00:07:03.570> the<00:07:03.720> variant<00:07:04.169> you<00:07:04.260> take<00:07:04.530> away

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
variant and in the variant you take away

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.550 
variant and in the variant you take away
turns<00:07:05.070> complete

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
turns complete

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.340 
turns complete
at<00:07:06.070> any<00:07:06.220> point<00:07:06.520> anyone<00:07:07.480> can<00:07:07.660> play<00:07:07.720> a<00:07:07.900> card<00:07:08.200> on

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
at any point anyone can play a card on

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.200 
at any point anyone can play a card on
to<00:07:08.560> the<00:07:08.680> stack<00:07:08.889> and<00:07:09.160> that<00:07:09.400> continues<00:07:09.880> the<00:07:09.910> game

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
to the stack and that continues the game

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.060 
to the stack and that continues the game
so<00:07:10.660> now<00:07:10.810> you're<00:07:10.960> playing<00:07:11.110> cards<00:07:11.530> out<00:07:11.650> of<00:07:11.830> order

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
so now you're playing cards out of order

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.879 
so now you're playing cards out of order
and<00:07:12.220> it's<00:07:12.370> just<00:07:12.720> wacky<00:07:13.720> tornado<00:07:14.350> finish

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
and it's just wacky tornado finish

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.140 
and it's just wacky tornado finish
bizarre<00:07:15.520> t<00:07:15.700> fun<00:07:16.240> I<00:07:16.630> think<00:07:17.260> so<00:07:18.010> that's<00:07:18.610> tornado

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
bizarre t fun I think so that's tornado

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.270 
bizarre t fun I think so that's tornado
alert<00:07:19.480> it's<00:07:20.230> one<00:07:20.500> of<00:07:20.590> the<00:07:20.680> weirdest<00:07:21.040> games

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
alert it's one of the weirdest games

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.730 
alert it's one of the weirdest games
that's<00:07:21.520> I've<00:07:21.669> come<00:07:21.850> across<00:07:21.970> in<00:07:22.360> some<00:07:22.389> time<00:07:22.840> but

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 
that's I've come across in some time but

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.470 
that's I've come across in some time but
I<00:07:23.800> keep<00:07:24.190> wanting<00:07:24.490> to<00:07:24.639> come<00:07:24.910> back<00:07:25.090> to<00:07:25.270> it<00:07:25.389> and
