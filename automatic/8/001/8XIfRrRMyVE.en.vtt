time think outside the box
normally<00:00:13.810> we<00:00:13.930> working<00:00:14.320> with<00:00:14.350> sheet<00:00:14.650> metal<00:00:14.830> and

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
normally we working with sheet metal and

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.690 
normally we working with sheet metal and
in<00:00:16.840> the<00:00:17.560> English<00:00:17.770> wheel<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.160> bead<00:00:18.310> roller<00:00:18.490> and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
in the English wheel the bead roller and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.740 
in the English wheel the bead roller and
the<00:00:18.820> shrink<00:00:19.030> in<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:19.180> stretcher<00:00:19.630> but<00:00:21.570> once<00:00:22.570> in

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
the shrink in the stretcher but once in

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.960 
the shrink in the stretcher but once in
a<00:00:22.840> while<00:00:22.990> you<00:00:23.260> run<00:00:23.289> into<00:00:24.010> something<00:00:24.250> different

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
a while you run into something different

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.630 
a while you run into something different
and<00:00:25.420> you're<00:00:25.510> thinking<00:00:25.660> why<00:00:26.230> not<00:00:26.260> let's<00:00:27.190> try

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
and you're thinking why not let's try

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.180 
and you're thinking why not let's try
let's<00:00:28.060> do<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.779> test<00:00:29.050> and<00:00:29.230> see<00:00:29.410> what<00:00:29.650> result

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
let's do a test and see what result

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.000 
let's do a test and see what result
we're<00:00:30.369> going<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.640> get<00:00:31.079> so<00:00:32.079> on<00:00:32.500> this<00:00:32.710> little

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
we're going to get so on this little

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.209 
we're going to get so on this little
short<00:00:33.609> video<00:00:34.030> I'm<00:00:34.179> going<00:00:34.359> to<00:00:34.620> inspire<00:00:35.620> you<00:00:35.920> to

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
short video I'm going to inspire you to

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.139 
short video I'm going to inspire you to
actually<00:00:36.609> use<00:00:37.050> other<00:00:38.050> metal<00:00:38.499> or<00:00:38.850> see<00:00:39.850> what

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
actually use other metal or see what

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.869 
actually use other metal or see what
else<00:00:40.600> you<00:00:40.989> can<00:00:41.260> do<00:00:41.769> with<00:00:43.800> metal<00:00:44.800> but<00:00:45.039> not<00:00:45.069> sheet

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
else you can do with metal but not sheet

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.229 
else you can do with metal but not sheet
metal<00:00:46.149> so<00:00:47.399> here<00:00:48.399> what<00:00:48.609> you<00:00:48.639> can<00:00:48.760> do<00:00:49.030> with<00:00:49.210> a

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
metal so here what you can do with a

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.180 
metal so here what you can do with a
dashboard<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.960> make<00:00:50.229> it<00:00:50.379> look<00:00:50.859> a<00:00:51.069> little

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
dashboard to make it look a little

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:58.110 
dashboard to make it look a little
different<00:00:55.139> so<00:00:56.139> you<00:00:56.199> can<00:00:56.709> buy<00:00:56.859> a<00:00:57.190> sheet<00:00:57.579> you<00:00:57.850> can

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
different so you can buy a sheet you can

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.639 
different so you can buy a sheet you can
make<00:00:58.299> with<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.600> whole<00:00:58.749> dashboard<00:00:59.350> but<00:00:59.530> you

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
make with the whole dashboard but you

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.239 
make with the whole dashboard but you
can<00:00:59.889> do<00:01:00.129> this<00:01:00.879> piece<00:01:01.869> around<00:01:02.289> the<00:01:02.469> gauges<00:01:02.949> you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:03.249 
can do this piece around the gauges you

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.420 
can do this piece around the gauges you
can<00:01:03.429> do<00:01:03.609> that<00:01:03.850> in<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.180> bead<00:01:04.360> roller<00:01:04.950> but<00:01:05.950> it's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
can do that in the bead roller but it's

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.220 
can do that in the bead roller but it's
I<00:01:06.760> don't<00:01:07.180> know<00:01:07.360> what<00:01:07.570> you<00:01:07.690> call<00:01:07.870> it<00:01:07.990> maybe

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
I don't know what you call it maybe

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.010 
I don't know what you call it maybe
Knepp<00:01:08.560> tour<00:01:09.300> extrusion<00:01:10.300> or<00:01:10.450> something<00:01:10.900> like

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
Knepp tour extrusion or something like

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.970 
Knepp tour extrusion or something like
that<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.900> I'm<00:01:14.020> going<00:01:14.230> to<00:01:14.260> run<00:01:14.530> a<00:01:14.740> few

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
that but so I'm going to run a few

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.500 
that but so I'm going to run a few
things<00:01:15.280> with<00:01:15.520> the<00:01:15.550> bead<00:01:15.760> roller<00:01:15.970> so<00:01:16.240> you<00:01:16.330> can

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
things with the bead roller so you can

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.810 
things with the bead roller so you can
see<00:01:16.720> what<00:01:17.020> it<00:01:17.140> looks<00:01:17.380> like<00:01:17.590> but<00:01:17.860> it's<00:01:18.430> actually

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
see what it looks like but it's actually

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.440 
see what it looks like but it's actually
pretty<00:01:19.000> cool<00:01:19.360> looking<00:01:20.170> stuff<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:22.060> you<00:01:22.240> can

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
pretty cool looking stuff that you can

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.390 
pretty cool looking stuff that you can
add<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.930> something<00:01:23.320> that<00:01:23.620> you<00:01:23.740> already<00:01:23.920> have

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
add to something that you already have

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.010 
add to something that you already have
made<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:26.110> here<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.620> have<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.920> flat<00:01:27.910> piece<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.570> this

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
made so here I have a flat piece of this

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.130 
made so here I have a flat piece of this
metal<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:31.360> I'm<00:01:31.480> going<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.720> run<00:01:31.900> in<00:01:32.050> the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
metal and that I'm going to run in the

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.930 
metal and that I'm going to run in the
bead<00:01:32.290> roller<00:01:32.320> so<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:32.950> can<00:01:33.130> see<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.670> works

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
bead roller so you can see that it works

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.980 
bead roller so you can see that it works
in<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.210> bead<00:01:34.360> roller<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.810> well<00:01:34.990> I<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.630> put<00:01:37.840> in

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
in the bead roller as well I just put in

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.610 
in the bead roller as well I just put in
a<00:01:38.140> regular<00:01:38.890> dies<00:01:39.310> here<00:01:39.760> so<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.660> can<00:01:41.020> we<00:01:41.590> can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
a regular dies here so you can we can

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:54.370 
a regular dies here so you can we can
see<00:01:41.950> what<00:01:42.160> it<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.310> going<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.640> look<00:01:42.820> like

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.570 

as<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.830> see<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.450> here<00:01:58.250> it's<00:01:59.250> it's

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
as you see as you can see here it's it's

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.640 
as you see as you can see here it's it's
pretty<00:01:59.820> amazing<00:02:00.150> what<00:02:00.600> what<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.140> happen<00:02:01.350> with

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
pretty amazing what what can happen with

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.770 
pretty amazing what what can happen with
it<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.729> who<00:02:02.940> knows<00:02:03.150> what<00:02:03.510> you're<00:02:03.750> going

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
it and and who knows what you're going

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.800 
it and and who knows what you're going
to<00:02:04.020> use<00:02:04.260> it<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.479> interesting

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
to use it for but it's it's interesting

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
to use it for but it's it's interesting
to<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.710> be<00:02:08.069> done<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:09.060> I<00:02:09.149> think

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
to see that it can be done and I think

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.970 
to see that it can be done and I think
you<00:02:09.600> have<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.440> steel<00:02:11.430> copper<00:02:12.360> brass<00:02:13.170> all

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
you have this in steel copper brass all

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.090 
you have this in steel copper brass all
kinds<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.670> different<00:02:15.060> material<00:02:15.959> aluminum<00:02:16.470> and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
kinds of different material aluminum and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:36.860 
kinds of different material aluminum and
that<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.180> actually<00:02:18.510> can<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:20.010> work<00:02:20.970> with

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.390 

so<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.960> can<00:02:38.080> really<00:02:38.440> make<00:02:38.590> some<00:02:38.860> cool<00:02:39.100> stuff

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
so you can really make some cool stuff

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.210 
so you can really make some cool stuff
with<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:39.820> let<00:02:40.540> me<00:02:40.720> change<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.170> dye<00:02:41.380> over<00:02:41.950> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
with this let me change the dye over to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.350 
with this let me change the dye over to
the<00:02:42.580> polyurethane<00:02:42.910> wheel<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:45.520> solid<00:02:46.240> wheel

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the polyurethane wheel and a solid wheel

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.870 
the polyurethane wheel and a solid wheel
on<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.660> other<00:02:46.810> side<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.380> run<00:02:48.340> that<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.760> you

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
on the other side and run that and you

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.600 
on the other side and run that and you
can<00:02:49.120> see<00:02:49.270> what<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.570> looks<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.920> here<00:02:51.580> I

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
can see what that looks like so here I

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.150 
can see what that looks like so here I
put<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.930> polyurethane<00:02:53.260> wheel<00:02:53.770> on<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.040> bottom

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
put the polyurethane wheel on the bottom

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.030 
put the polyurethane wheel on the bottom
and<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:55.630> sharp<00:02:56.020> one<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.320> the<00:02:56.440> top<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:56.890> it's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
and a sharp one on the top but it's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.560 
and a sharp one on the top but it's
still<00:02:57.190> little<00:02:57.430> radius<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.210> so<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.510> think

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
still little radius to it so I think

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.180 
still little radius to it so I think
it's<00:02:58.780> 1.5<00:02:59.500> yes<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:00.730> three<00:03:01.450> millimeter<00:03:01.870> wide

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
it's 1.5 yes it's three millimeter wide

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.550 
it's 1.5 yes it's three millimeter wide
and<00:03:03.540> depends<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.630> what<00:03:04.780> proof<00:03:05.020> what<00:03:05.230> I<00:03:05.260> want

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
and depends on what proof what I want

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.920 
and depends on what proof what I want
but<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:05.860> can<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.310> can<00:03:06.910> push<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.090> down<00:03:07.420> pretty<00:03:07.660> hard

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
but I can I can push it down pretty hard

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.900 
but I can I can push it down pretty hard
in<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.800> polyurethane<00:03:09.130> wheel<00:03:09.640> there

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
in the in the polyurethane wheel there

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.160 
in the in the polyurethane wheel there
and<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.680> works<00:03:11.920> out<00:03:12.160> pretty<00:03:12.430> good<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.170> let's

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
and it it works out pretty good so let's

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.250 
and it it works out pretty good so let's
do<00:03:14.650> this<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.700> see<00:03:15.760> what<00:03:16.390> result<00:03:16.900> we're<00:03:17.140> going

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
do this and see what result we're going

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:29.770 
do this and see what result we're going
to<00:03:17.410> get<00:03:17.620> there

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.080 

so<00:03:30.780> here<00:03:31.050> you<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.560> don't<00:03:32.280> know<00:03:32.400> if<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.700> can<00:03:32.910> see

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
so here you I don't know if you can see

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.050 
so here you I don't know if you can see
that<00:03:33.300> in<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.810> camera<00:03:34.200> there<00:03:34.440> but<00:03:34.710> you<00:03:35.670> see<00:03:35.880> what

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
that in a camera there but you see what

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.600 
that in a camera there but you see what
it<00:03:36.180> looks<00:03:36.390> like<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.140> it's<00:03:37.860> still<00:03:38.160> making

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
it looks like it it's it's still making

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.350 
it looks like it it's it's still making
the<00:03:38.790> flames<00:03:39.090> or<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:40.230> be<00:03:40.410> there<00:03:40.740> but<00:03:40.980> it's<00:03:41.490> it's

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
the flames or the be there but it's it's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.380 
the flames or the be there but it's it's
different<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:47.040> let's<00:03:47.280> push<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.090> down<00:03:48.330> a

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
different so let's push this down a

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.040 
different so let's push this down a
little<00:03:48.630> harder<00:03:48.900> and<00:03:50.240> see<00:03:51.240> what<00:03:51.480> that's<00:03:51.720> going

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
little harder and see what that's going

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:03.350 
little harder and see what that's going
to<00:03:52.140> look<00:03:52.350> like<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:02.250> there<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> little<00:04:02.880> deeper

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
to look like so there is a little deeper

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.590 
to look like so there is a little deeper
so<00:04:04.350> it's<00:04:04.500> not<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:04.950> this<00:04:05.190> round<00:04:05.520> profile<00:04:06.120> but

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
so it's not like this round profile but

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:14.810 
so it's not like this round profile but
it's<00:04:07.050> soft<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.800> both<00:04:08.010> sides<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.370> that's<00:04:14.580> what

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
it's soft on both sides so that's what

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.660 
it's soft on both sides so that's what
you<00:04:15.000> can<00:04:15.240> do<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.990> that's<00:04:16.350> what<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:17.070> video

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
you can do and that's what this video

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.720 
you can do and that's what this video
was<00:04:17.910> about<00:04:18.239> to<00:04:19.110> work<00:04:19.799> with<00:04:20.100> different

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
was about to work with different

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.350 
was about to work with different
material<00:04:21.270> that<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.630> not<00:04:21.770> solid<00:04:23.180> has<00:04:24.180> some

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
material that is not solid has some

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.600 
material that is not solid has some
holes<00:04:24.570> in<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.590> who<00:04:25.770> knows<00:04:25.950> if<00:04:26.250> somebody

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
holes in it so who knows if somebody

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.360 
holes in it so who knows if somebody
going<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.880> use<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.270> for<00:04:27.450> art<00:04:27.630> or<00:04:28.370> something

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
going to use it for art or something

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.400 
going to use it for art or something
else<00:04:29.540> let<00:04:30.540> me<00:04:30.690> show<00:04:30.870> you<00:04:30.960> one<00:04:31.140> more<00:04:31.320> thing<00:04:31.380> I

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
else let me show you one more thing I

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.830 
else let me show you one more thing I
had<00:04:34.410> one<00:04:34.650> student<00:04:34.800> here<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.700> he<00:04:36.630> actually

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
had one student here and he actually

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.670 
had one student here and he actually
made<00:04:37.460> those<00:04:38.460> pieces<00:04:38.970> in<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.260> bead<00:04:40.440> roller

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
made those pieces in the bead roller

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.550 
made those pieces in the bead roller
with<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.040> skateboard<00:04:41.610> wheel<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:42.180> he<00:04:42.900> going<00:04:43.440> to

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
with a skateboard wheel and he going to

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.910 
with a skateboard wheel and he going to
do<00:04:43.740> some<00:04:43.980> odd<00:04:44.220> stuff<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:44.910> he<00:04:45.090> made<00:04:45.360> this<00:04:46.020> design

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
do some odd stuff so he made this design

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.980 
do some odd stuff so he made this design
and<00:04:47.190> then<00:04:47.400> he<00:04:47.610> trimmed<00:04:47.970> it<00:04:48.180> after<00:04:48.570> and<00:04:48.690> he<00:04:48.780> cut

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
and then he trimmed it after and he cut

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.570 
and then he trimmed it after and he cut
those<00:04:49.200> pieces<00:04:49.560> out<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:52.380> that's<00:04:52.590> pretty

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
those pieces out so that's pretty

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.550 
those pieces out so that's pretty
interesting<00:04:53.940> tear<00:04:54.480> I<00:04:54.600> like<00:04:55.020> those<00:04:55.290> those<00:04:55.530> are

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
interesting tear I like those those are

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.430 
interesting tear I like those those are
look<00:04:56.310> nice<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:58.940> think<00:04:59.940> outside<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.360> box<00:05:00.600> you

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
look nice so think outside the box you

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.440 
look nice so think outside the box you
can't<00:05:01.740> fail<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.340> can<00:05:02.430> only<00:05:02.730> produce<00:05:03.000> results

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
can't fail you can only produce results

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.770 
can't fail you can only produce results
and<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:05.280> result<00:05:05.640> maybe<00:05:05.880> is<00:05:06.030> not<00:05:06.090> going<00:05:06.510> to<00:05:06.660> be

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
and the result maybe is not going to be

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.720 
and the result maybe is not going to be
what<00:05:07.020> you<00:05:07.170> want<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:07.710> you're<00:05:08.250> still<00:05:08.490> producing

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
what you want but you're still producing

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.240 
what you want but you're still producing
a<00:05:09.090> result<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.690> can't<00:05:09.930> fail<00:05:10.230> keep<00:05:10.920> that<00:05:11.100> in

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
a result so you can't fail keep that in

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.310 
a result so you can't fail keep that in
mind<00:05:11.490> if<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.240> want<00:05:12.450> more<00:05:12.630> information<00:05:13.230> about
