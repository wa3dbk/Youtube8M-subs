00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:04.570
 good friends you after having installed yourself in it 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 on the full desktop in the index 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.469
 it occurred to me 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.969
 after seeing 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.090
 the graphic power that this computer can have 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.030
 it occurs to me this long the google wants for linux 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.089
 so that I downloaded to a point file well 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.970
 I installed it 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.489
 I want to teach euros 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.489
 how does google work them 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.449
 when they are installed, create a 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.170
 access icon 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.040
 ee 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.080
 in the menu in the internet applications section 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.420
 and we have here 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.420
 the google icon loses 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290
 at the moment they tell me 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.510
 that the resolution of my desktop is not 1024 by 768 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.150
 the google ios program requires at least this resolution 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.199
 says that the application will work but nevertheless on the other 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.020
 it may not be optimal 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.770
 we go ahead and we see that it starts google feet 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.730
 this application was very interested in 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.590
 in trying it 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.870
 because it's good to me I've always liked this 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.760
 this 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.960
 this dvd theme 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.460
 If that 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.730
 At first 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.730
 the application will take a while to start 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.120
 we're going to wait 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.090
 While we have another message 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.810
 in which tells me how well a source 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.710
 which is called of said amount was saenz 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 it is not installed 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.770
 apparently this program needs this source tell me where you could 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 download that font I had not yet been 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 I think that there he went ahead 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.470
 we'll go 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.340
 that the application start 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.530
 is making some kind of connection to the database 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.959
 and now what one expects to see here is to be able to do what we already know about 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.179
 established 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:19.489
 world ball 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.909
 well here we have a window of tips 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.909
 critical front 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.089
 the time to do it 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:31.879
 to keep going you can certainly see the milestone of the application 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.059
 we'll see 

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:38.209
 chesser valleys 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.279
 the world's ball has not yet appeared 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.279
 this is costing work starts with the application 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.209
 at the moment although it can not be appreciated perhaps in the video if it is appreciated 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.159
 here that the stars have appeared 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.969
 e of this universe 

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.679
 particular that since google 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.149
 and of course I imagine that it will be 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.599
 composing the world ball 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:09.599
 let's wait a little 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.699
 mood is loading the day and for the time being we carry the ball appeared 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:17.549
 of the world 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.239
 has also appeared 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.059
 up the right 

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.359
 Wolves 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.459
 the panel of delay and 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.459
 but we keep that there is not much movement here 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:32.629
 you can tell he's having a hard time 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.549
 I do not know if it will be because of that 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.449
 that belongs that marked the beginning on what did not have the resolution 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:41.859
 adequate 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.979
 but you can see 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:48.259
 I have already tried to move the ball but this hits a lot of jerk I was hoping it goes very 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:50.179
 slow 

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:52.959
 in chile for example now put here 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.209
 who will search for a city 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.739
 for example 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.369
 albacete 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:05.269
 At the moment, nothing was written. It is obvious that CristÃ³bal has cost him everything. 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.429
 work is consuming a lot of resources and 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.919
 and this application does not seem to go 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.579
 that goes well and appears here I write albacete and now I am going to say 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.189
 the search 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.200
 they are observed 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.710
 in a text well 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.490
 will have to prove it by determining if the problem is in sandro euros 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:31.650
 or is there precisely the resolution 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.539
 that were messy 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.580
 I have given the order and it seems that accepted 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.279
 the ball is rotating 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.339
 is beginning to abuse 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.300
 our 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.740
 our country spain sears is getting closer to that we could be 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.110
 here all afternoon 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.430
 waiting for it to appear albacete the screen 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.099
 so 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.240
 for now 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.550
 He left this testimony as evidence b 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:04.259
 that the application does not work well 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.210
 lets see if 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.909
 new ones appear 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:09.479
 bad news 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.479
 on how to improve it 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.080
 the speed of stay 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.069
 returns friends greetings and see you next time
