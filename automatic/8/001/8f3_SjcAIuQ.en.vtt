in<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.639> bucket<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.299> tried<00:00:15.990> doing<00:00:16.139> that<00:00:16.379> last

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
in this bucket I tried doing that last

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.730 
in this bucket I tried doing that last
year<00:00:17.130> but<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.640> soil<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.240> used<00:00:18.570> wasn't<00:00:19.260> right

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
year but the soil I used wasn't right

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.790 
year but the soil I used wasn't right
and<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.180> never<00:00:21.330> even<00:00:21.570> grew<00:00:22.080> whatsoever

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and just they never even grew whatsoever

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.099 
and just they never even grew whatsoever
so<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.939> kind<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.269> potato<00:00:24.600> we're<00:00:24.779> actually

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
so the kind of potato we're actually

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.009 
so the kind of potato we're actually
wanting<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> grow<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.010> year<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.580> these<00:00:27.019> new

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
wanting to grow this year are these new

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.560 
wanting to grow this year are these new
red<00:00:28.349> potatoes<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.640> I've<00:00:29.939> had<00:00:30.210> these<00:00:30.449> seedlings

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
red potatoes so I've had these seedlings

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.940 
red potatoes so I've had these seedlings
getting<00:00:33.570> ready<00:00:33.840> over<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.290> last<00:00:34.469> couple<00:00:34.739> weeks

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
getting ready over the last couple weeks

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.799 
getting ready over the last couple weeks
and<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.309> see<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.390> in

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
and and you can see that in

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
and and you can see that in
some<00:00:40.079> cases<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.620> had<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> potato<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.610> only<00:00:41.760> grew

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
some cases I had a potato that only grew

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.270 
some cases I had a potato that only grew
one<00:00:42.300> sprout<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.320> if<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:43.950> than<00:00:44.010> one

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
one sprout but if I have more than one

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.420 
one sprout but if I have more than one
sprout<00:00:44.640> coming<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.480> sliced<00:00:46.379> down<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.100> then

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
sprout coming out I sliced down and then

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
sprout coming out I sliced down and then
have<00:00:47.700> let<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.149> scab<00:00:48.600> over<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.170> last<00:00:49.350> couple

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
have let this scab over the last couple

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
have let this scab over the last couple
days<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.399> nice<00:00:50.969> hard<00:00:51.329> surface<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
days so that's a nice hard surface and

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.990 
days so that's a nice hard surface and
you<00:00:52.110> want<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.379> do<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:53.430> make<00:00:53.579> sure<00:00:53.820> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you want to do that to make sure that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
you want to do that to make sure that
the<00:00:54.149> potato<00:00:54.480> itself<00:00:54.899> doesn't<00:00:55.320> rot<00:00:55.559> out<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.129> if

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the potato itself doesn't rot out so if

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220 
the potato itself doesn't rot out so if
you're<00:00:56.430> doing<00:00:56.699> potatoes<00:00:57.180> don't<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.079> get

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
you're doing potatoes don't just get

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
you're doing potatoes don't just get
seed<00:00:58.500> potatoes<00:00:58.980> cut<00:00:59.430> them<00:00:59.460> right<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
seed potatoes cut them right up and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
seed potatoes cut them right up and
stick<00:01:00.329> them<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> ground<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.680> might

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
stick them right in the ground you might

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.250 
stick them right in the ground you might
be<00:01:02.100> encouraging<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.820> potato<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.420> rot<00:01:03.870> rather

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
be encouraging that potato to rot rather

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.820 
be encouraging that potato to rot rather
than<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:05.159> grow<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:06.030> new<00:01:06.630> plant<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.409> keep

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
than actually grow a new plant so keep

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.100 
than actually grow a new plant so keep
that<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.070> mind<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:09.330> soil<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.869> we're<00:01:10.020> going

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that in mind the soil that we're going

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320 
that in mind the soil that we're going
to<00:01:10.170> use<00:01:10.320> this<00:01:10.619> year<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.430> mixture<00:01:11.970> between

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
to use this year is a mixture between

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
to use this year is a mixture between
our<00:01:12.869> own<00:01:13.400> homemade<00:01:14.400> compost<00:01:15.049> some<00:01:16.049> good<00:01:16.560> well

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
our own homemade compost some good well

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.410 
our own homemade compost some good well
rotted<00:01:17.250> goat<00:01:17.700> manure<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.560> some<00:01:19.790> coarse<00:01:20.790> River

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
rotted goat manure and some coarse River

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.280 
rotted goat manure and some coarse River
sand<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.340> lot<00:01:23.640> more<00:01:24.290> aeration

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
sand and it's got a lot more aeration

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.530 
sand and it's got a lot more aeration
and<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.770> gonna<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.369> better<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:27.390> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and it's gonna be a lot better for the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
and it's gonna be a lot better for the
potatoes<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.259> grow<00:01:28.470> than<00:01:28.890> what<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.159> use<00:01:29.369> last

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
potatoes to grow than what we use last

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.080 
potatoes to grow than what we use last
year<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.470> we're<00:01:31.470> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.799> put<00:01:32.189> some<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.520> here

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
year so we're going to put some in here

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.760 
year so we're going to put some in here
and<00:01:33.270> I'm<00:01:33.360> also<00:01:33.540> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> try<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> potato

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
and I'm also going to try the potato

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.390 
and I'm also going to try the potato
cages<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.790> give<00:01:36.720> those<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> try<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.740> then

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
cages and give those a try and then

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.520 
cages and give those a try and then
hopefully<00:01:38.880> as<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.180> develop<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> rest<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
hopefully as we develop the rest of the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
hopefully as we develop the rest of the
property<00:01:41.040> there<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:42.030> places<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.810> come

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
property there are some places that come

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.690 
property there are some places that come
to<00:01:43.170> mind<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.740> good<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.159> potatoes

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
to mind that would be good for potatoes

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.630 
to mind that would be good for potatoes
to<00:01:44.939> stay<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> perennial<00:01:46.259> crop<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.490> now

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
to stay as a perennial crop but for now

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.359 
to stay as a perennial crop but for now
we're<00:01:47.880> sticking<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> containers<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.250> if

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
we're sticking to the containers so if

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.920 
we're sticking to the containers so if
you've<00:01:50.520> ever<00:01:50.700> wondered<00:01:50.909> why<00:01:51.240> people<00:01:51.630> tell<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you've ever wondered why people tell you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.530 
you've ever wondered why people tell you
to<00:01:51.960> Hill<00:01:52.259> potatoes<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.490> could<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.180> plant

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
to Hill potatoes you could just plant

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.620 
to Hill potatoes you could just plant
this<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> ground<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.119> barely<00:01:57.119> cover<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
this in the ground and barely cover it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.959 
this in the ground and barely cover it
up<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.350> potatoes<00:01:58.920> but<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.670> thing<00:01:59.939> about

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
up and get potatoes but the thing about

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.870 
up and get potatoes but the thing about
potatoes<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.590> taller<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.549> stem

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
potatoes is that the taller the stem

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.020 
potatoes is that the taller the stem
grows<00:02:03.409> these<00:02:04.409> nodes<00:02:05.100> are<00:02:05.430> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.700> put<00:02:05.880> out

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
grows these nodes are going to put out

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.719 
grows these nodes are going to put out
roots<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.049> get<00:02:07.290> more<00:02:07.560> tubers<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.459> hill

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
roots so you get more tubers if you hill

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.609 
roots so you get more tubers if you hill
dirt<00:02:09.060> over<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.390> Hill<00:02:09.690> dirt<00:02:09.929> over<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.470> Hill

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
dirt over it Hill dirt over and Hill

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.830 
dirt over it Hill dirt over and Hill
dirt<00:02:10.860> over<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.000> more<00:02:12.120> tubers<00:02:12.599> can

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
dirt over it so that more tubers can

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.240 
dirt over it so that more tubers can
form

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
form

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.400 
form
so<00:02:13.760> what<00:02:14.240> we're<00:02:14.420> going<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.600> do<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:15.080> this

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
so what we're going to do is this

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.350 
so what we're going to do is this
containers<00:02:15.950> got<00:02:16.100> about<00:02:16.280> two<00:02:16.640> inches<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.150> soil

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
containers got about two inches of soil

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.930 
containers got about two inches of soil
down<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.470> we're<00:02:19.130> going<00:02:19.370> to<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:19.730> pick

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
down in it and we're going to just pick

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.690 
down in it and we're going to just pick
a<00:02:20.000> few<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.450> these<00:02:20.570> ones<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.170> have<00:02:21.320> some<00:02:21.700> good

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
a few of these ones that have some good

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.130 
a few of these ones that have some good
long<00:02:23.290> starters<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.560> them<00:02:25.630> best<00:02:26.630> as<00:02:26.780> we<00:02:26.900> can

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
long starters on them best as we can

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.170 
long starters on them best as we can
hear<00:02:27.500> they're<00:02:27.650> not<00:02:27.800> all<00:02:28.010> growing<00:02:28.670> at<00:02:28.910> the<00:02:29.000> same

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
hear they're not all growing at the same

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.990 
hear they're not all growing at the same
rate<00:02:29.240> yet<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.920> we<00:02:31.280> don't<00:02:31.310> want<00:02:31.520> to<00:02:31.580> overfill

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
rate yet and we don't want to overfill

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.760 
rate yet and we don't want to overfill
this<00:02:32.180> too<00:02:32.450> much<00:02:32.720> we<00:02:32.960> want<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.230> make<00:02:33.380> sure<00:02:33.410> that

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
this too much we want to make sure that

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.770 
this too much we want to make sure that
the<00:02:33.980> potatoes<00:02:34.550> have<00:02:34.730> room<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.180> grow<00:02:35.420> but<00:02:35.720> at

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the potatoes have room to grow but at

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.160 
the potatoes have room to grow but at
the<00:02:35.930> same<00:02:36.080> time<00:02:36.350> we<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:36.770> make<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:37.070> much

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
the same time we want to make as much

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.030 
the same time we want to make as much
use<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.470> space<00:02:39.770> as<00:02:39.980> we<00:02:40.130> possibly<00:02:40.580> can<00:02:40.880> so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
use of the space as we possibly can so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
use of the space as we possibly can so
okay<00:02:43.040> that's<00:02:43.220> all<00:02:43.370> we're<00:02:43.490> going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.820> for

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
okay that's all we're going to do for

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.690 
okay that's all we're going to do for
now<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.570> one<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.230> let's<00:02:45.980> move<00:02:46.220> on<00:02:46.459> to

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
now for this one and let's move on to

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.610 
now for this one and let's move on to
making<00:02:46.880> some<00:02:47.770> cages<00:02:48.770> for<00:02:49.160> potatoes<00:02:50.380> this<00:02:51.380> is

the cage that we're going to use for

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.670 
the cage that we're going to use for
trying<00:02:53.330> to<00:02:53.360> grow<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.690> potatoes<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.410> this<00:02:54.500> is

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
trying to grow the potatoes and this is

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
non-native grasses so that when we start

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.320 
non-native grasses so that when we start
putting<00:03:12.650> soil<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.550> bottom<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:14.000> this<00:03:14.150> we

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
putting soil in the bottom of this we

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.000 
putting soil in the bottom of this we
don't<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:14.690> grasses<00:03:15.290> popping<00:03:15.740> up<00:03:15.830> through

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
don't have grasses popping up through

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.490 
don't have grasses popping up through
the<00:03:16.040> soil<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.610> competing<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.750> our<00:03:17.930> potatoes

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
the soil and competing with our potatoes

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.280

so<00:03:18.860> piece<00:03:19.580> of<00:03:19.760> cardboard<00:03:20.180> down<00:03:20.360> cage<00:03:20.720> on<00:03:21.019> top

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
so piece of cardboard down cage on top

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.970 
so piece of cardboard down cage on top
now<00:03:21.769> let's<00:03:22.010> fill<00:03:22.220> it<00:03:22.340> up<00:03:23.050> straw<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.290> used<00:03:24.650> to

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
now let's fill it up straw is used to

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.350 
now let's fill it up straw is used to
help<00:03:25.250> do<00:03:25.700> two<00:03:25.940> different<00:03:26.120> things

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
help do two different things

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.690 
help do two different things
structurally<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.470> keeps<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.980> soil<00:03:28.250> from

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
structurally it keeps the soil from

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.030 
structurally it keeps the soil from
coming<00:03:29.000> through<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.180> sides<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.959> cage<00:03:30.200> but

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
coming through the sides of the cage but

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.310 
coming through the sides of the cage but
it<00:03:31.160> also<00:03:31.340> helps<00:03:31.910> retain<00:03:32.120> moisture<00:03:32.600> by

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
it also helps retain moisture by

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.470 
it also helps retain moisture by
blocking<00:03:33.890> the<00:03:34.040> Sun<00:03:34.340> from<00:03:34.370> being<00:03:34.790> directly<00:03:35.300> on

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
blocking the Sun from being directly on

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.050 
blocking the Sun from being directly on
to<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> soil<00:03:36.200> it<00:03:36.890> becomes<00:03:37.220> more<00:03:37.430> obvious<00:03:37.489> as

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
to the soil it becomes more obvious as

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.930 
to the soil it becomes more obvious as
you<00:03:38.090> build<00:03:38.450> soil<00:03:38.750> up<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.410> cage<00:03:39.709> for<00:03:40.550> now<00:03:40.730> we'll

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
you build soil up the cage for now we'll

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.699 
you build soil up the cage for now we'll
put<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.120> little<00:03:41.360> bit<00:03:41.510> on<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.840> bottom<00:03:42.019> to<00:03:42.410> act<00:03:42.560> as

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
put a little bit on the bottom to act as

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.979 
put a little bit on the bottom to act as
another<00:03:43.040> buffer<00:03:43.340> against<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.180> cardboard<00:03:44.750> and

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
another buffer against the cardboard and

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.050 
another buffer against the cardboard and
a<00:03:45.470> little<00:03:45.769> around<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.190> edges<00:03:46.640> there's<00:03:46.910> not

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
a little around the edges there's not

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.580 
a little around the edges there's not
going<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.269> be<00:03:47.360> too<00:03:47.630> much<00:03:47.810> soil<00:03:48.230> in<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.560> bottom

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
going to be too much soil in the bottom

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.710 
going to be too much soil in the bottom
of<00:03:48.920> this<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.220> start<00:03:49.459> with<00:03:49.670> just<00:03:50.239> maybe<00:03:50.420> two

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
of this to start with just maybe two

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.900 
of this to start with just maybe two
inches<00:03:50.930> to<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.769> potatoes<00:03:52.250> started<00:03:52.730> and

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
inches to get the potatoes started and

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.759 
inches to get the potatoes started and
then<00:03:53.269> we'll<00:03:53.420> start<00:03:53.690> adding<00:03:54.140> up<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> soil<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
then we'll start adding up the soil the

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.920 
then we'll start adding up the soil the
rest<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.220> way<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:55.600> that's<00:03:56.600> all<00:03:56.810> there

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
rest of the way so that's all there

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.660 
rest of the way so that's all there
really<00:03:57.080> is<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.680> we'll<00:03:58.040> wait<00:03:58.280> for<00:03:58.519> these

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
really is to it we'll wait for these

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.840 
really is to it we'll wait for these
potatoes<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.510> grow<00:04:00.049> about<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.890> foot<00:04:01.250> tall<00:04:01.549> and

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
potatoes to grow about a foot tall and

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.449 
potatoes to grow about a foot tall and
we'll<00:04:02.209> heal<00:04:02.570> over<00:04:02.900> about<00:04:03.110> 2/3<00:04:03.799> of<00:04:04.100> them<00:04:04.310> and

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
we'll heal over about 2/3 of them and

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.070 
we'll heal over about 2/3 of them and
wait<00:04:04.640> for<00:04:04.790> them<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:04.970> grow<00:04:05.150> another<00:04:05.450> foot<00:04:05.840> tall

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
wait for them to grow another foot tall

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.340 
wait for them to grow another foot tall
hill<00:04:07.040> over<00:04:07.400> about<00:04:07.610> 2/3<00:04:08.180> of<00:04:08.420> them<00:04:08.600> and<00:04:08.780> just

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
hill over about 2/3 of them and just

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.100 
hill over about 2/3 of them and just
keep<00:04:09.590> going<00:04:09.860> until<00:04:10.220> we<00:04:10.640> until<00:04:11.360> as<00:04:11.450> far<00:04:11.720> up<00:04:11.900> this

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
keep going until we until as far up this

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.430 
keep going until we until as far up this
cage<00:04:12.590> as<00:04:12.860> we<00:04:13.040> can<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.820> stay<00:04:14.750> tuned<00:04:15.049> it'll<00:04:15.350> be

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
cage as we can so stay tuned it'll be

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.860 
cage as we can so stay tuned it'll be
really<00:04:15.650> fun<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.340> try<00:04:16.489> to<00:04:16.609> do<00:04:16.820> a<00:04:16.850> reveal<00:04:17.359> on<00:04:17.600> this

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
really fun to try to do a reveal on this

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.320 
really fun to try to do a reveal on this
at<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.530> end<00:04:18.650> of<00:04:18.830> the<00:04:18.890> season<00:04:19.340> if<00:04:19.489> all<00:04:20.000> grows

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
at the end of the season if all grows

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.930 
at the end of the season if all grows
well<00:04:20.690> one<00:04:21.560> other<00:04:21.770> thing<00:04:22.070> that<00:04:22.099> I<00:04:22.250> mention

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
well one other thing that I mention

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.409 
well one other thing that I mention
about<00:04:23.030> the<00:04:23.960> construction<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.070> cage<00:04:25.419> what

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
about the construction of the cage what

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.129 
about the construction of the cage what
we<00:04:26.570> did<00:04:26.750> is

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
we did is

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.020 
we did is
overlap<00:04:27.620> these<00:04:28.009> they're<00:04:28.340> don't<00:04:28.520> butt<00:04:28.849> up

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
overlap these they're don't butt up

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.089 
overlap these they're don't butt up
against<00:04:29.449> each<00:04:29.599> other<00:04:29.840> they<00:04:30.050> overlap<00:04:30.860> each

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
against each other they overlap each

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.279 
against each other they overlap each
other<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.849> then<00:04:32.030> we<00:04:32.150> just<00:04:32.419> tied<00:04:32.749> using

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
other and then we just tied using

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.769 
other and then we just tied using
Mason's<00:04:33.800> string<00:04:34.249> those<00:04:34.969> two<00:04:35.240> things<00:04:35.449> together

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:35.779 
Mason's string those two things together

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:37.719 
Mason's string those two things together
so<00:04:36.199> when<00:04:36.349> it<00:04:36.439> comes<00:04:36.650> time<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.919> harvest<00:04:37.550> these

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
so when it comes time to harvest these

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.360 
so when it comes time to harvest these
rather<00:04:38.629> than<00:04:38.930> trying<00:04:39.139> to<00:04:39.229> lift<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.740> cage<00:04:39.979> up

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
rather than trying to lift the cage up

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.659 
rather than trying to lift the cage up
we<00:04:40.759> can<00:04:40.999> just<00:04:41.270> pull<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:42.020> twine<00:04:42.439> off<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:43.129> then

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
we can just pull this twine off and then

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.999 
we can just pull this twine off and then
open<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.360> cage<00:04:44.659> and<00:04:44.990> let<00:04:45.319> it<00:04:45.469> all<00:04:45.560> just<00:04:45.620> fall

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
open the cage and let it all just fall

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.339 
open the cage and let it all just fall
to<00:04:46.039> pieces<00:04:46.310> because<00:04:46.759> we<00:04:46.939> will<00:04:47.180> harvest<00:04:47.900> all<00:04:48.319> of

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
to pieces because we will harvest all of

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.950 
to pieces because we will harvest all of
