00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.170
 young moroccan and not necessarily ready 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.659

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.200
 there is a defensive mission that today 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.820
 which he does not face in 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.840
 championship on the weekend so that was the 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.490
 first goal the second goal 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.909

 see our young good players show themselves 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.170

 football is an important part of it 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.140
 in the lives of these young people who are in 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.060
 perpetual learning we it's 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.220
 especially in term it is especially in term 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.570
 of physical impact this is especially where 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.690
 above that we witnessed in relation to 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.709
 defensive missions of a football team 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.510
 where that's what I told you all to 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.560
 the time we are not used to that 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.239
 did us a lot of good 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.280
 first to get in 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.590
 individually on situations of 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.910
 one to one and that made us a lot 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.530
 of good also to fall on teams 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.209
 organized that put us in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.140
 difficulty collectively on 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.420
 defensive missions 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.370
 we are not on a tournament formula where 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.290
 the result counts in the end when one is 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.579
 on a tour formula or that's it 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.840
 to make you see young players 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.820
 Moroccan 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.900
 what is European football and the 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.260

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.620
 young footballers in the making of 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.170

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.769
