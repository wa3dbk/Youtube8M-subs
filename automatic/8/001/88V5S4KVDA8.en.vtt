dry<00:01:57.270> they're<00:01:57.509> even<00:01:57.780> more<00:01:57.810> slippery<00:01:58.649> when

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
dry they're even more slippery when

dry they're even more slippery when
they're<00:01:59.159> wet<00:01:59.399> so<00:02:00.090> having<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.659> hard<00:02:01.020> line<00:02:01.290> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
they're wet so having this hard line to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920 
they're wet so having this hard line to
grab<00:02:01.799> on<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.549> valuable<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.450> important

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930

want<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.870> make<00:03:24.930> before<00:03:25.230> we<00:03:25.530> go<00:03:25.680> too<00:03:25.740> far<00:03:26.280> is

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
want to make before we go too far is

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.800 
want to make before we go too far is
that<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:28.200> here<00:03:28.860> there<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:30.030> wall<00:03:30.300> a<00:03:30.570> wall

that in here there is a wall a wall
inside<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.410> boat<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:31.950> called<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.430> bulkhead<00:03:32.820> and

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
inside a boat is called a bulkhead and

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.480 
inside a boat is called a bulkhead and
this<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:33.990> what<00:03:34.380> makes<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.890> into<00:03:35.459> a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
this is a what makes this into a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.940 
this is a what makes this into a
watertight<00:03:36.300> compartment<00:03:37.050> from<00:03:37.260> here<00:03:37.709> all<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
watertight compartment from here all the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.490 
watertight compartment from here all the
way<00:03:38.100> back<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.790> there's<00:03:39.510> another<00:03:39.840> bulkhead<00:03:40.320> or

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
way back and there's another bulkhead or

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.800 
way back and there's another bulkhead or
wall<00:03:40.800> here<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.910> makes<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.300> watertight

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
wall here that makes it a watertight

wall here that makes it a watertight
compartment<00:03:43.530> from<00:03:43.620> their<00:03:43.890> forward<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:45.030> is

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
compartment from their forward this is

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.420 
compartment from their forward this is
very<00:03:45.390> important<00:03:45.950> obviously<00:03:46.950> it's<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.220> place

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
very important obviously it's a place

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.979 
very important obviously it's a place
where<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.640> can<00:03:47.880> carry<00:03:48.180> your<00:03:48.390> gear<00:03:48.750> and

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
where you can carry your gear and

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.160 
where you can carry your gear and
supplies<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.770> keep<00:03:49.980> them<00:03:50.220> pretty<00:03:50.940> dry<00:03:51.239> not

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
supplies and keep them pretty dry not

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.110 
supplies and keep them pretty dry not
perfectly<00:03:52.620> dry<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.100> the<00:03:53.220> bigger<00:03:53.430> thing<00:03:53.520> is<00:03:53.940> is

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
perfectly dry but the bigger thing is is

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.840 
perfectly dry but the bigger thing is is
that<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.360> provides<00:03:54.510> inherent<00:03:55.350> floatation<00:03:56.130> so

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
that it provides inherent floatation so

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.940 
that it provides inherent floatation so
if<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.120> boats<00:03:57.330> capsized<00:03:57.989> or<00:03:58.320> even<00:03:58.590> full<00:03:58.830> of

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
if the boats capsized or even full of

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.920 
if the boats capsized or even full of
water<00:03:59.190> it's<00:03:59.820> still<00:04:00.150> going<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.390> float<00:04:00.660> because

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
water it's still going to float because

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.350 
water it's still going to float because
it<00:04:01.230> has<00:04:01.380> many<00:04:01.650> cubic<00:04:02.160> feet<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.459> air<00:04:02.730> leave<00:04:03.180> and

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
it has many cubic feet of air leave and

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.210 
it has many cubic feet of air leave and

it's<00:04:46.780> got<00:04:46.960> design<00:04:47.349> features<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:48.039> so<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.280> can

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
it's got design features and so you can

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.249 
it's got design features and so you can
perhaps<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.240> can<00:04:49.360> see<00:04:49.569> that<00:04:49.599> there's<00:04:49.930> a<00:04:49.990> line

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
perhaps you can see that there's a line

that runs all the way down the kayak
back<00:04:53.259> to<00:04:53.530> here<00:04:53.860> and<00:04:54.069> that's<00:04:54.220> generally

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
back to here and that's generally

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.689 
back to here and that's generally
referred<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.150> as<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.360> keel<00:04:55.840> line<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:57.340> helps

these<00:04:57.910> types<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.419> kayaks<00:04:58.840> go<00:04:59.620> straight<00:05:00.069> which

these types of kayaks go straight which

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.610 
these types of kayaks go straight which
are<00:05:00.520> called<00:05:00.759> tracking<00:05:01.539> the<00:05:01.750> track<00:05:02.080> means<00:05:02.440> to

are called tracking the track means to

are called tracking the track means to
go<00:05:02.800> straight<00:05:03.190> this<00:05:04.060> thing<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:04.479> looks<00:05:04.659> like<00:05:04.840> a

go straight this thing it looks like a
thin<00:05:05.229> back<00:05:05.470> here<00:05:05.770> also<00:05:06.009> aids<00:05:06.639> in<00:05:06.909> that

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
thin back here also aids in that

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.300 
thin back here also aids in that
tracking<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:09.810> here<00:05:10.810> we've<00:05:10.960> got<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:12.300> front<00:05:13.300> bow

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310
