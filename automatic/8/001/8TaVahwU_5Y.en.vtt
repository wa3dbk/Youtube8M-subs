cut of this this is obviously in a
smaller<00:00:46.010> size<00:00:46.750> but<00:00:47.750> it<00:00:47.870> gives<00:00:48.020> you<00:00:48.110> an<00:00:48.230> idea<00:00:48.379> of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
smaller size but it gives you an idea of

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.560 
smaller size but it gives you an idea of
the<00:00:51.170> there's<00:00:51.710> how<00:00:52.370> it's<00:00:52.550> designed<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:53.390> got<00:00:53.540> a

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
original equipment the bearings on this

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.510 
original equipment the bearings on this
one<00:01:16.580> is<00:01:17.090> three<00:01:17.299> part<00:01:17.570> kit<00:01:18.110> six<00:01:18.530> part<00:01:18.740> kit<00:01:18.950> three

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
one is three part kit six part kit three

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.080 
one is three part kit six part kit three
on<00:01:19.610> each<00:01:19.790> side

on each side

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.410 
on each side
so<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:20.869> would<00:01:21.170> take<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.670> actual<00:01:22.970> bearing<00:01:23.210> you

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
so you would take the actual bearing you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.850 
so you would take the actual bearing you
drop<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:23.869> in<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.110> race<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.470> already<00:01:24.740> in<00:01:24.799> the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
drop it in the race is already in the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.910 
drop it in the race is already in the
wheel<00:01:26.410> insert<00:01:27.410> the<00:01:27.560> end<00:01:27.710> cap<00:01:28.090> just<00:01:29.090> tap<00:01:29.330> it<00:01:29.510> in

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
wheel insert the end cap just tap it in

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.650 
wheel insert the end cap just tap it in
lightly<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.190> then<00:01:31.760> when<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.180> tapped<00:01:32.450> in

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
lightly and then when this is tapped in

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.000 
lightly and then when this is tapped in
flush<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.560> insert<00:01:34.630> your<00:01:35.630> spacer<00:01:36.170> inside<00:01:36.620> the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
flush you insert your spacer inside the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.520 
flush you insert your spacer inside the
rubber<00:01:37.490> grommet<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:38.900> will<00:01:39.020> be<00:01:39.110> all<00:01:39.230> flush

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
rubber grommet so this will be all flush

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.050 
rubber grommet so this will be all flush
when<00:01:39.770> it's<00:01:39.890> inserted<00:01:40.280> properly<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.910> way<00:01:46.940> you

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
when it's inserted properly the way you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.980 
when it's inserted properly the way you
measure<00:01:47.390> these<00:01:47.780> tires<00:01:50.560> are<00:01:51.560> by<00:01:52.430> the<00:01:52.970> hub<00:01:53.510> width

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
measure these tires are by the hub width

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.240 
measure these tires are by the hub width
the<00:01:54.470> length<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.130> hub<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.750> case

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
the length of the hub and in this case

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.380 
the length of the hub and in this case
and<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.340> other<00:02:01.460> measurement<00:02:01.940> generally<00:02:02.240> is

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
and the other measurement generally is

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.649 
and the other measurement generally is
the<00:02:02.420> ID<00:02:03.140> of<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.530> bearing<00:02:07.300> which<00:02:08.300> is<00:02:08.330> this

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659 
the ID of the bearing which is this

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:11.710 
the ID of the bearing which is this
they're<00:02:09.500> all<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.769> same<00:02:09.800> though<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.330> tire

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
they're all the same though in the tire

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.309 
they're all the same though in the tire
so<00:02:11.959> this<00:02:12.080> tire<00:02:12.260> size<00:02:12.730> 13500<00:02:13.730> by<00:02:14.090> six<00:02:14.450> which<00:02:15.290> is

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
so this tire size 13500 by six which is

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.399 
so this tire size 13500 by six which is
the<00:02:15.440> most<00:02:15.680> popular<00:02:15.860> size<00:02:16.310> on<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.670> smaller

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
the most popular size on the smaller

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.550 
the most popular size on the smaller
zero-turn<00:02:18.409> riders<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.920> bigger<00:02:19.159> sizes<00:02:19.489> take<00:02:20.000> a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
zero-turn riders the bigger sizes take a

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.080 
zero-turn riders the bigger sizes take a
13-6<00:02:21.560> fifty<00:02:21.860> by<00:02:22.010> six<00:02:22.310> there's<00:02:22.519> just<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.790> wider

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
13-6 fifty by six there's just a wider

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.000 
13-6 fifty by six there's just a wider
tire<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.170> there's<00:02:24.319> not<00:02:24.409> a<00:02:24.470> whole<00:02:24.739> lot<00:02:24.980> of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
tire so there's not a whole lot of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.640 
tire so there's not a whole lot of
variations<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:25.849> these<00:02:26.030> sized<00:02:26.300> tires<00:02:26.599> as<00:02:27.409> far

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
variations on these sized tires as far

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.369 
variations on these sized tires as far
as<00:02:27.800> like<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.099> hub<00:02:28.340> width<00:02:28.629> but
