world's worst base email to clash on gun
at<00:01:00.620> gmail.com<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:01.879> I'll<00:01:02.659> go<00:01:02.809> ahead<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.109> just

at gmail.com and I'll go ahead and just
see<00:01:03.649> what<00:01:04.489> looks<00:01:04.850> I<00:01:05.150> guess<00:01:05.780> bad<00:01:06.170> instead<00:01:06.530> of

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
see what looks I guess bad instead of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.399 
see what looks I guess bad instead of
good<00:01:06.860> see<00:01:07.520> how<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.790> looks<00:01:07.940> bad<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.570> then<00:01:08.720> from

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
good see how it looks bad and then from

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.100 
good see how it looks bad and then from
there<00:01:09.680> we'll<00:01:10.400> throw<00:01:11.270> up<00:01:11.420> maybe<00:01:11.630> like<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.900> top

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
there we'll throw up maybe like the top

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.050 
there we'll throw up maybe like the top
three<00:01:12.380> and<00:01:13.210> see<00:01:14.210> how<00:01:14.450> they<00:01:14.659> do<00:01:14.720> on<00:01:15.340> defense<00:01:16.340> so

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
three and see how they do on defense so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.270 
three and see how they do on defense so
I<00:01:17.420> guess<00:01:17.810> I'm<00:01:17.990> going<00:01:18.080> to<00:01:18.140> show<00:01:18.530> how<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.070> one

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
I guess I'm going to show how this one

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.150 
I guess I'm going to show how this one
looks<00:01:19.460> on<00:01:19.580> defense<00:01:19.940> when<00:01:20.690> I'm<00:01:20.840> done<00:01:21.290> with<00:01:21.560> it

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
looks on defense when I'm done with it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.320 
looks on defense when I'm done with it
maybe<00:01:22.610> when<00:01:23.060> I<00:01:23.090> release<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.780> top<00:01:24.020> 3<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.330> from

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
maybe when I release the top 3 and from

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.660 
maybe when I release the top 3 and from
there<00:01:26.540> we'll<00:01:26.720> just<00:01:26.930> see<00:01:27.680> who<00:01:27.980> wins<00:01:28.250> world's

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
there we'll just see who wins world's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.100 
there we'll just see who wins world's
worst<00:01:28.850> basin<00:01:29.150> we<00:01:29.210> can<00:01:29.330> have<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.540> guys<00:01:29.630> vote<00:01:29.930> on

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
worst basin we can have you guys vote on

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.510 
worst basin we can have you guys vote on
it<00:01:30.260> and<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:30.860> think<00:01:30.980> it<00:01:31.070> would<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.250> really<00:01:31.400> good

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
it and I think it would be a really good

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.960 
it and I think it would be a really good
time

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
time

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
we'll see if we can feature that in a

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.950 
we'll see if we can feature that in a
future<00:01:40.010> video<00:01:40.370> but<00:01:41.210> after<00:01:41.540> I'm<00:01:41.660> done<00:01:41.780> with

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
future video but after I'm done with

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.300 
future video but after I'm done with
this<00:01:42.110> let's<00:01:42.500> see<00:01:42.680> if<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.860> can<00:01:42.980> do<00:01:43.100> another

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
this let's see if we can do another

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.470 
this let's see if we can do another
library<00:01:43.790> for<00:01:43.940> you<00:01:44.030> guys<00:01:44.150> after<00:01:44.420> this<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:44.990> have

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
library for you guys after this I have

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.730 
library for you guys after this I have
sort<00:01:47.480> of<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.600> similar<00:01:47.780> troop<00:01:48.110> composition<00:01:48.650> but

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
sort of a similar troop composition but

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.990 
sort of a similar troop composition but
I<00:01:48.800> have<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:48.980> couple<00:01:49.310> new<00:01:49.460> troops<00:01:49.760> that<00:01:49.880> I'm

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
I have a couple new troops that I'm

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.990 
I have a couple new troops that I'm
throwing<00:01:50.510> into<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.900> mix<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.410> I'll<00:01:52.220> tell<00:01:52.910> you

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
throwing into the mix and I'll tell you

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.580 
throwing into the mix and I'll tell you
there's<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.240> reason<00:01:53.600> why<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:53.750> have<00:01:54.050> those<00:01:54.260> troops

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
there's a reason why I have those troops

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.130 
there's a reason why I have those troops
in<00:01:55.210> you'll<00:01:56.210> see<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.480> in<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.690> future<00:01:56.900> video

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
in you'll see it in a future video

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140 
in you'll see it in a future video
actually<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.220> I<00:01:58.250> don't<00:01:58.460> give<00:01:58.640> too<00:01:58.790> much<00:01:58.940> away

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
actually so I don't give too much away

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.830 
actually so I don't give too much away
but<00:02:00.080> as<00:02:00.290> you<00:02:00.800> see<00:02:01.040> I'm<00:02:01.460> trying<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.880> basically

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
but as you see I'm trying to basically

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.300 
but as you see I'm trying to basically
just<00:02:03.290> put<00:02:03.440> my<00:02:03.560> walls<00:02:03.800> where<00:02:04.040> they<00:02:04.190> don't

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
just put my walls where they don't

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.900 
just put my walls where they don't
matter<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:06.010> see<00:02:07.010> if<00:02:07.070> I<00:02:07.130> can<00:02:07.250> do<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> little<00:02:07.820> bit

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
matter and see if I can do a little bit

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.850 
matter and see if I can do a little bit
of<00:02:07.970> symmetry<00:02:08.300> as<00:02:08.539> well<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.440> we'll<00:02:09.560> go<00:02:09.679> ahead

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
of symmetry as well so we'll go ahead

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.290 
of symmetry as well so we'll go ahead
and<00:02:10.009> speed<00:02:10.250> build<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.610> rest<00:02:10.819> of<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.060> walls

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
and speed build the rest of the walls

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.160 
and speed build the rest of the walls
and<00:02:11.629> then<00:02:11.750> jump<00:02:12.050> into<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.440> live<00:02:13.129> raid<00:02:14.170> alright

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and then jump into a live raid alright

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.259 
and then jump into a live raid alright
so<00:02:15.290> here<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:15.500> have<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.830> finished<00:02:16.190> product<00:02:16.459> air

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
so here we have the finished product air

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.270 
so here we have the finished product air
defences<00:02:17.870> next<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.349> Town<00:02:18.530> Hall<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.160> you

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
defences next to the Town Hall so if you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.830 
defences next to the Town Hall so if you
have<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.430> ground<00:02:19.879> raid<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.269> can<00:02:20.390> take<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.660> Town

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
have a ground raid you can take the Town

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.410 
have a ground raid you can take the Town
Hall<00:02:20.959> really<00:02:21.319> quickly<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.940> then<00:02:22.940> all<00:02:23.269> my

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
Hall really quickly and then all my

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.630 
Hall really quickly and then all my
traps<00:02:23.689> in<00:02:23.930> one<00:02:24.079> spot<00:02:24.379> probably<00:02:25.340> not<00:02:25.459> going<00:02:25.549> to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
traps in one spot probably not going to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.160 
traps in one spot probably not going to
do<00:02:25.730> too<00:02:25.879> much<00:02:25.999> damage<00:02:26.060> if<00:02:26.480> people<00:02:26.719> don't<00:02:26.840> go

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
do too much damage if people don't go

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
do too much damage if people don't go
for<00:02:27.439> it<00:02:27.469> all<00:02:27.890> my<00:02:28.310> storages<00:02:28.939> with

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
for it all my storages with

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.780 
for it all my storages with

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
in the middle easy to take and then all

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.430 
in the middle easy to take and then all
the<00:02:31.909> defenses<00:02:32.420> on<00:02:32.540> one<00:02:32.720> side<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.260> don't

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
the defenses on one side so you don't

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.050 
the defenses on one side so you don't
have<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.680> worry<00:02:33.890> about<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.459> then<00:02:34.790> clan

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
have to worry about it and then clan

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.600 
have to worry about it and then clan
castle<00:02:35.540> easily<00:02:35.930> can<00:02:36.110> get<00:02:36.260> lured<00:02:36.500> out<00:02:36.739> as<00:02:36.920> well

that's<00:03:04.670> actually<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.209> surprise<00:03:05.629> for<00:03:05.959> a<00:03:06.019> future

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
that's actually a surprise for a future

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.380 
that's actually a surprise for a future
video<00:03:06.620> so<00:03:06.769> if<00:03:07.099> you<00:03:07.190> can<00:03:07.340> guess<00:03:07.970> where<00:03:08.269> this

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
video so if you can guess where this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.210 
video so if you can guess where this
witch<00:03:08.629> is<00:03:08.660> going<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.049> be<00:03:09.260> or<00:03:09.560> what<00:03:09.980> I'm<00:03:10.099> going

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
witch is going to be or what I'm going

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.400 
witch is going to be or what I'm going
to<00:03:10.250> use<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.670> for<00:03:10.970> go<00:03:11.840> ahead<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.079> comment<00:03:12.260> down

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
to use it for go ahead and comment down

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.589 
to use it for go ahead and comment down
below<00:03:12.530> as<00:03:12.980> well<00:03:13.220> as<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.549> one<00:03:13.819> hog<00:03:14.090> rider<00:03:14.359> so

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
below as well as that one hog rider so

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.900 
below as well as that one hog rider so
one<00:03:14.780> which<00:03:15.019> one<00:03:15.620> hog<00:03:15.799> rider<00:03:16.099> it's<00:03:16.609> going<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.819> be

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
one which one hog rider it's going to be

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.610 
one which one hog rider it's going to be
in<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.030> future<00:03:17.299> video<00:03:17.450> try<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.079> guess<00:03:18.290> what<00:03:18.500> it

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
in a future video try to guess what it

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.339 
in a future video try to guess what it
is<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.180> it's<00:03:20.180> actually<00:03:20.420> probably<00:03:20.930> going<00:03:21.170> to

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
is and it's actually probably going to

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.589 
is and it's actually probably going to
be<00:03:21.440> released<00:03:21.799> later<00:03:21.950> on<00:03:22.340> today<00:03:22.849> so<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.510> not

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
be released later on today so it's not

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:25.270 
be released later on today so it's not
going<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.840> be<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:23.989> video<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.799> know<00:03:24.890> five<00:03:25.129> months

going to be a video you know five months
from<00:03:25.430> now<00:03:25.609> or<00:03:25.640> anything<00:03:25.879> like<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.120> so<00:03:26.480> let's

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
from now or anything like that so let's

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.199 
from now or anything like that so let's
go<00:03:26.930> ahead<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.200> do<00:03:27.410> a<00:03:27.440> raid<00:03:27.680> I'm<00:03:28.670> not<00:03:28.879> going<00:03:29.120> to

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
and then clean up some of the gold maybe

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.060 
and then clean up some of the gold maybe
if<00:05:54.900> we're<00:05:55.050> lucky<00:05:55.080> we'll<00:05:55.410> get<00:05:55.560> into<00:05:55.800> the<00:05:55.890> middle

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
if we're lucky we'll get into the middle

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.580 
if we're lucky we'll get into the middle
of<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.190> base<00:05:56.340> as<00:05:56.550> well<00:05:56.760> so<00:05:57.419> let's<00:05:57.690> see<00:05:57.930> what

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
of the base as well so let's see what

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.380 
of the base as well so let's see what
the<00:05:58.710> Queen<00:05:58.950> does<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.460> still<00:05:59.669> have<00:05:59.820> her<00:05:59.940> ability

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
the Queen does I still have her ability

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.150 
the Queen does I still have her ability
but<00:06:00.780> we<00:06:00.840> have<00:06:01.080> a<00:06:01.110> clear<00:06:01.440> shot<00:06:01.710> to<00:06:01.890> the<00:06:01.979> middle

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
but we have a clear shot to the middle

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.980 
but we have a clear shot to the middle
of<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.400> base<00:06:02.580> hopefully<00:06:03.390> we<00:06:03.450> can<00:06:03.600> get<00:06:03.750> the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
of the base hopefully we can get the

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.469 
of the base hopefully we can get the
storages<00:06:04.590> and<00:06:04.800> all<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.550> other<00:06:05.669> good<00:06:05.910> stuff<00:06:06.060> so

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
storages and all the other good stuff so

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.260 
storages and all the other good stuff so
use<00:06:06.990> her<00:06:07.140> ability<00:06:07.790> hopefully<00:06:08.790> take<00:06:08.940> out<00:06:09.090> the

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270

cannon<00:06:09.840> the<00:06:09.990> archer<00:06:10.260> tower<00:06:10.440> if<00:06:10.650> we<00:06:10.770> can<00:06:11.130> oh<00:06:12.080> no

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
gotta take down that cannon quickly if

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.860 
gotta take down that cannon quickly if
we<00:06:17.190> can<00:06:17.490> alright<00:06:18.030> but<00:06:18.300> then<00:06:18.419> she's<00:06:18.660> going<00:06:18.810> to

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
we can alright but then she's going to

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.680 
we can alright but then she's going to
start<00:06:19.110> getting<00:06:19.169> hit<00:06:19.470> by<00:06:19.590> that<00:06:19.680> Archer<00:06:20.010> tower

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
start getting hit by that Archer tower

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.530 
start getting hit by that Archer tower
and<00:06:21.690> we<00:06:21.960> have<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.320> couple<00:06:22.800> lone<00:06:23.370> archers<00:06:23.910> left<00:06:24.270> I

and we have a couple lone archers left I

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.750 
and we have a couple lone archers left I
do<00:06:25.140> not<00:06:25.680> think<00:06:26.039> that's<00:06:26.160> going<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.460> play<00:06:26.520> a

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
do not think that's going to play a

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.440 
do not think that's going to play a
factor<00:06:27.169> but<00:06:28.169> looks<00:06:28.680> like<00:06:28.820> mainly<00:06:29.820> it<00:06:30.090> wasn't

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
factor but looks like mainly it wasn't

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.670 
factor but looks like mainly it wasn't
