00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a brand new bottom on this boat I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.670 
a brand new bottom on this boat I
believe<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.880> or<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.020> previous

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
believe it or not in a previous

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.819 
believe it or not in a previous
restorative<00:00:38.309> attempt<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.690> bottom<00:00:40.050> was<00:00:40.170> epoxy

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
restorative attempt the bottom was epoxy

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.069 
restorative attempt the bottom was epoxy
and<00:00:41.040> Tim<00:00:41.969> was<00:00:42.090> telling<00:00:42.480> me<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.629> was<00:00:42.750> done<00:00:42.960> with

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
and Tim was telling me it was done with

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.069 
and Tim was telling me it was done with
iron<00:00:43.320> screws<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.700> which<00:00:45.329> started<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> rust

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
iron screws and which started to rust

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.279 
iron screws and which started to rust
and<00:00:46.320> bleed<00:00:46.620> colour<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.910> guess<00:00:48.149> allowed<00:00:49.020> for

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and bleed colour and I guess allowed for

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
and bleed colour and I guess allowed for
some<00:00:49.440> water<00:00:49.620> penetration<00:00:50.329> Tim<00:00:51.329> let's<00:00:51.510> put<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
some water penetration Tim let's put a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.979 
some water penetration Tim let's put a
new<00:00:51.870> stem<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.559> boat<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:53.820> a

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
new stem on this boat and I have a

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.040 
new stem on this boat and I have a
close-up<00:00:54.989> here<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> old<00:00:55.739> stem<00:00:57.050> laminated

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
close-up here of the old stem laminated

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
close-up here of the old stem laminated
obviously<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.219> how<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.550> was

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
obviously and you can see how it was

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
obviously and you can see how it was
coming<00:00:59.910> apart<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.449> irons<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.989> work

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
coming apart and this the irons we work

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.710 
coming apart and this the irons we work
I<00:01:04.700> guess<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.150> not<00:01:07.700> kosher<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:09.600> this

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
I guess just was not kosher for this

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.740 
I guess just was not kosher for this
particular<00:01:10.020> boat<00:01:14.150> so<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> be<00:01:15.720> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
particular boat so this is going to be a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.730 
particular boat so this is going to be a
major<00:01:16.020> undertaking

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
major undertaking

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
major undertaking

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
around the ancient compartment

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.480 
around the ancient compartment
apparently<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.409> repaired<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
apparently that will all be repaired and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.859 
apparently that will all be repaired and
replaced<00:01:31.310> yosemite<00:01:32.310> sam<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:33.090> was<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> boat

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
replaced yosemite sam here was a boat

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.679 
replaced yosemite sam here was a boat
built<00:01:34.170> by<00:01:34.380> tim<00:01:34.680> many<00:01:35.670> years<00:01:35.909> ago<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.570> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
built by tim many years ago it's a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.990 
built by tim many years ago it's a
Glenelg<00:01:37.049> design<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.369> hull<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.759> still

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
Glenelg design and the hull is still

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.840 
Glenelg design and the hull is still
sound<00:01:39.329> apparently<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.400> boat's<00:01:41.610> been

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
sound apparently but the boat's been

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.420 
sound apparently but the boat's been
quite<00:01:42.090> weather

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
quite weather

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.940 
quite weather
and<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.880> guess<00:01:44.360> as<00:01:44.720> time<00:01:44.990> allows<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.740> we'll

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and I guess as time allows and we'll

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.250 
and I guess as time allows and we'll
clean<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.370> up<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.880> sand<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.660> varnish<00:01:48.050> and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
clean it up the sand and the varnish and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.950 
clean it up the sand and the varnish and
make<00:01:49.160> a<00:01:49.190> ship<00:01:49.490> shape<00:01:49.730> again

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
make a ship shape again

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.859 
make a ship shape again
what<00:01:52.380> we<00:01:52.500> have<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> ski<00:01:53.490> boat<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
what we have here is a ski boat now in

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
what we have here is a ski boat now in
this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.830> an<00:01:56.010> example<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.580> where<00:01:56.820> Tim<00:01:57.119> would

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
this is an example of where Tim would

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.270 
this is an example of where Tim would
use<00:01:57.570> an<00:01:57.750> epoxy<00:01:58.080> it's<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.220> toxic<00:01:59.729> ride<00:01:59.970> haul<00:02:00.210> and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
use an epoxy it's a toxic ride haul and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.380 
use an epoxy it's a toxic ride haul and
above<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.400> waterline<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.880> parent

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
above the waterline a parent

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.779 
above the waterline a parent
the<00:02:03.900> virus<00:02:04.230> will<00:02:04.470> be<00:02:04.560> used<00:02:05.690> rather<00:02:06.690> than<00:02:06.870> epoxy

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the virus will be used rather than epoxy

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.430 
the virus will be used rather than epoxy
that's<00:02:09.149> quite<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> powerful<00:02:09.720> engine<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.319> this

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
that's quite a powerful engine in this

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.330 
that's quite a powerful engine in this
boat<00:02:10.739> probably<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.520> fly

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340

the last vote under restoration here is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.510 
the last vote under restoration here is
an<00:02:19.160> upturn<00:02:19.640> Billy<00:02:20.450> Johnson<00:02:21.520> obviously

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520
