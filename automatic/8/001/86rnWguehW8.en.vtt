00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.310
 a father called mat hails when he found out 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.500
 of the news that they were going to close the 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:15.309
 your 67-year-old school 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.240
 He decided to buy the whole school is 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:22.150
 spent $ 14 million to buy 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.390
 the school to prevent the school 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.490
 it was closed fills it with staff and 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.520
 today your daughter can continue 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.850
 enjoying going to school to which 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.340
 always wanted to make the decision 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.860
 that the father took was due to the daughter 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.989
 the daughter told her that she did not want to leave 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.100
 another party that did not want to go to another 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.510
 school so his father who was 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.210
 millionaire as you can see then no 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.090
 He hesitated to buy the whole school for 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.059
 that her daughter could continue teaching 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.980
 it's amazing to see the power they have 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.110
 some people to do what 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.780
 they want it seems that money can 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.690
 everything in extreme cases like that of 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.910
 this man then managed to buy the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.330
 entire school simply because your 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.370
 daughter did not want to change school 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.140
 and to think that there are millions of people 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.430
 that are starving that every minute 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.560
 there is a child who dies in africa 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.500
 these kinds of things are what make you 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.510
 to one reflect why the being 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.810
 human allows so many 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.450
 unevenness in society seems to us 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.229
 like it seems that people who have 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.680
 power that are rich because they like 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.840
 to follow is to remain rich and the 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.930
 poor, obviously, they always try 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.550
 change your social status to rich the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.430
 ask what we have to do all 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.030
 is if we really were rich we 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.330
 those who have little money then no 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.340
 we would do the same as this man 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.670
 surely the vast majority if they would 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.830
 if they could based on the idea that 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.220
 that money you have won and that you have not 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.250
 why do you have to give it in this case? 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.170
 this man decided to spend this 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.900
 impressive amount of money 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.590
 simply for a reason without 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.590
 importance
