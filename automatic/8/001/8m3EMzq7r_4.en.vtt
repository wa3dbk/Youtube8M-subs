today<00:00:02.020> I'm<00:00:02.080> going<00:00:02.199> to<00:00:02.260> cover<00:00:02.440> a<00:00:02.500> much<00:00:02.679> simpler

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.100 
today I'm going to cover a much simpler

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.640 
today I'm going to cover a much simpler
concept<00:00:03.280> of<00:00:03.820> shutter<00:00:04.090> speed<00:00:04.420> and<00:00:04.630> if<00:00:05.080> you<00:00:05.230> hung

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:05.650 
concept of shutter speed and if you hung

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.200 
concept of shutter speed and if you hung
with<00:00:05.830> me<00:00:06.009> through<00:00:06.279> aperture<00:00:06.879> you'll<00:00:07.060> have

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.210 
with me through aperture you'll have

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.180 
with me through aperture you'll have
absolutely<00:00:07.779> no<00:00:08.260> issues<00:00:08.620> understanding

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
absolutely no issues understanding

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.129 
absolutely no issues understanding
shutter<00:00:09.400> speed<00:00:09.730> shutter<00:00:10.300> speed<00:00:10.630> is<00:00:10.660> simply<00:00:11.110> a

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.139 
shutter speed shutter speed is simply a

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.410 
shutter speed shutter speed is simply a
measured<00:00:11.500> the<00:00:11.650> amount<00:00:11.740> of<00:00:12.040> time<00:00:12.280> that<00:00:12.610> light

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
measured the amount of time that light

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.070 
measured the amount of time that light
is<00:00:13.599> allowed<00:00:13.809> to<00:00:13.990> fall<00:00:14.200> on<00:00:14.349> the<00:00:14.500> sensor<00:00:14.920> and<00:00:16.080> it

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
is allowed to fall on the sensor and it

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.769 
is allowed to fall on the sensor and it
makes<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.560> difference<00:00:17.740> between<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:19.119> soft

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
makes the difference between a soft

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.500 
makes the difference between a soft
image<00:00:20.170> or<00:00:20.470> blurry<00:00:20.859> image<00:00:21.279> and<00:00:21.520> a<00:00:22.029> sharp<00:00:22.300> image

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
image or blurry image and a sharp image

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.330 
image or blurry image and a sharp image
you'll<00:00:23.140> see<00:00:23.230> this<00:00:23.439> time<00:00:23.680> expressed<00:00:24.160> in

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
you'll see this time expressed in

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.370 
you'll see this time expressed in
fractions<00:00:24.880> such<00:00:25.330> as<00:00:25.510> one<00:00:25.689> five-hundredth<00:00:26.260> of

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
fractions such as one five-hundredth of

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.339 
fractions such as one five-hundredth of

even hours for long exposures used or

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.860 
even hours for long exposures used or
nighttime<00:00:35.320> photography<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.480> that's<00:00:37.660> it

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
nighttime photography so that's it

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.319 
nighttime photography so that's it
that's<00:00:38.469> what<00:00:38.710> shutter<00:00:38.980> speed<00:00:39.280> is<00:00:39.309> the<00:00:40.149> amount

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
that's what shutter speed is the amount

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.299 
that's what shutter speed is the amount
of<00:00:40.450> time<00:00:40.629> the<00:00:40.780> shutters<00:00:41.079> open<00:00:41.230> allowing<00:00:41.980> light

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
of time the shutters open allowing light

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.459 
of time the shutters open allowing light
to<00:00:42.340> fall<00:00:42.670> on<00:00:42.820> the<00:00:42.940> sensor<00:00:43.329> there<00:00:44.110> are<00:00:44.290> two

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
to fall on the sensor there are two

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.930 
to fall on the sensor there are two
issues<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:45.100> you<00:00:45.219> need<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.430> understand<00:00:45.850> to

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
issues that you need to understand to

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.830 
issues that you need to understand to
get<00:00:46.090> sharp<00:00:46.750> images<00:00:47.590> one<00:00:48.100> is<00:00:48.520> camera<00:00:49.300> shake<00:00:49.570> and

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
get sharp images one is camera shake and

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.139 
get sharp images one is camera shake and
the<00:00:50.230> other<00:00:50.379> is<00:00:50.680> blurred<00:00:51.129> due<00:00:51.370> to<00:00:51.550> the<00:00:51.670> subjects

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
the other is blurred due to the subjects

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.330 
the other is blurred due to the subjects
motion<00:00:52.690> both<00:00:53.379> of<00:00:53.559> those<00:00:53.680> are<00:00:53.890> affected<00:00:54.309> by

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
motion both of those are affected by

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.040 
motion both of those are affected by
shutter<00:00:54.730> speed<00:00:55.059> so<00:00:55.539> you're<00:00:55.660> holding<00:00:55.930> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
shutter speed so you're holding the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.930 
shutter speed so you're holding the
camera<00:00:56.289> up<00:00:56.440> here<00:00:56.739> you're<00:00:57.219> trying<00:00:57.520> to<00:00:57.610> take<00:00:57.760> an

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
camera up here you're trying to take an

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.450 
camera up here you're trying to take an
image<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:58.390> everybody<00:00:58.719> knows<00:00:58.960> that<00:00:59.460> we're

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
image and everybody knows that we're

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.220 
image and everybody knows that we're
shaking<00:01:00.910> right<00:01:01.059> we're<00:01:01.239> not<00:01:01.359> perfectly<00:01:01.780> still

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
shaking right we're not perfectly still

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.880 
shaking right we're not perfectly still
so<00:01:03.010> the<00:01:03.190> following<00:01:03.370> rule<00:01:03.760> applies<00:01:04.089> for<00:01:04.899> images

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
so the following rule applies for images

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.810 
so the following rule applies for images
that<00:01:06.040> are<00:01:06.130> taken<00:01:06.600> without<00:01:07.600> tripods<00:01:08.409> or

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that are taken without tripods or

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.550 
that are taken without tripods or
actually<00:01:09.820> with<00:01:10.090> free<00:01:10.659> handing<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.080> image<00:01:11.320> of

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
actually with free handing the image of

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.480 
actually with free handing the image of
the<00:01:12.250> camera<00:01:12.640> and<00:01:12.820> then<00:01:13.350> also<00:01:14.350> this<00:01:15.130> applies<00:01:15.460> to

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
the camera and then also this applies to

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.789 
the camera and then also this applies to
lenses<00:01:16.119> where<00:01:16.330> image<00:01:16.630> stabilization<00:01:17.049> is<00:01:17.560> not

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
lenses where image stabilization is not

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.670 
lenses where image stabilization is not
used<00:01:18.159> okay<00:01:18.790> so<00:01:19.270> if<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:19.600> find<00:01:20.110> yourself<00:01:20.320> in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
used okay so if you find yourself in

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.609 
used okay so if you find yourself in
that<00:01:20.799> scenario<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.960> want<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.259> use<00:01:23.409> the

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
that scenario you want to use the

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.830 
that scenario you want to use the
inverse<00:01:23.890> of<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.250> focal<00:01:24.640> length<00:01:24.820> times<00:01:25.479> the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
inverse of the focal length times the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.100 
inverse of the focal length times the
crop<00:01:26.409> factor<00:01:26.619> of<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.130> sensor<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.960> will

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
crop factor of the sensor and that will

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.080 
crop factor of the sensor and that will
give<00:01:29.140> you<00:01:29.380> your<00:01:29.590> minimum<00:01:29.950> shutter<00:01:30.250> speed<00:01:30.579> okay

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
give you your minimum shutter speed okay

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.539 
give you your minimum shutter speed okay
if<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.960> don't<00:01:32.049> know<00:01:32.229> what<00:01:32.350> your<00:01:32.530> crop<00:01:33.280> factor

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
if you don't know what your crop factor

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.730 
if you don't know what your crop factor
of<00:01:33.850> your<00:01:34.000> sensor<00:01:34.390> is<00:01:34.630> typically<00:01:35.610> 1.3<00:01:36.610> 1.6<00:01:37.740> are

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
of your sensor is typically 1.3 1.6 are

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.850 
of your sensor is typically 1.3 1.6 are
typical<00:01:39.579> numbers<00:01:39.850> for<00:01:40.060> crop<00:01:40.240> sensors<00:01:40.750> or<00:01:41.740> you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
typical numbers for crop sensors or you

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.260 
typical numbers for crop sensors or you
may<00:01:41.979> be<00:01:42.040> using<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.490> full<00:01:42.700> frame<00:01:42.939> if<00:01:43.119> you're

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
may be using a full frame if you're

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.730 
may be using a full frame if you're
using<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.600> full<00:01:43.810> frame<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.049> don't<00:01:44.290> suspect<00:01:44.439> you

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
using a full frame I don't suspect you

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.770 
using a full frame I don't suspect you
would<00:01:44.860> need<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.189> watch<00:01:45.340> this<00:01:45.579> video<00:01:46.270> anyway

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
would need to watch this video anyway

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.660 
would need to watch this video anyway
unless<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.770> had<00:01:47.890> more<00:01:48.100> money<00:01:48.310> than<00:01:48.520> brains

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
unless you had more money than brains

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.719 
unless you had more money than brains
but<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:51.329> crop<00:01:52.329> sensor<00:01:52.600> idea<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:54.640> my

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
but a the crop sensor idea for in my

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.780 
but a the crop sensor idea for in my
case<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.180> 1.6<00:01:55.840> crop<00:01:56.290> factor<00:01:56.560> if<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.640> don't

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
case is a 1.6 crop factor if you don't

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.859 
case is a 1.6 crop factor if you don't
like<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.180> if<00:01:58.450> you're<00:01:58.600> perhaps

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
like that if you're perhaps

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.959 
like that if you're perhaps
mathematically<00:01:59.829> challenged<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.640> can<00:02:00.790> just

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
mathematically challenged you can just

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.480 
mathematically challenged you can just
use<00:02:01.030> two<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.780> you're<00:02:02.290> using<00:02:02.439> a<00:02:02.649> crop<00:02:02.890> sensor<00:02:03.100> so

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
use two if you're using a crop sensor so

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.580 
use two if you're using a crop sensor so
I<00:02:03.700> have<00:02:04.119> an<00:02:04.240> 85<00:02:04.630> millimeter<00:02:05.079> lens

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
I have an 85 millimeter lens

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.679 
I have an 85 millimeter lens
once<00:02:05.710> again<00:02:05.859> if<00:02:06.789> you're<00:02:07.090> mathematically

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
once again if you're mathematically

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.960 
once again if you're mathematically
challenged<00:02:08.649> we'll<00:02:08.890> just<00:02:09.129> round<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.729> to

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
challenged we'll just round that on to

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.750 
challenged we'll just round that on to
80<00:02:10.330> millimeters<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.950> everybody<00:02:12.280> can<00:02:12.459> stay

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
80 millimeters so everybody can stay

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.759 
80 millimeters so everybody can stay
with<00:02:12.970> us<00:02:13.030> so<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:13.959> have<00:02:14.080> an<00:02:14.170> 80<00:02:14.319> millimeter

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
with us so if you have an 80 millimeter

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.339 
with us so if you have an 80 millimeter
lens<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:16.150> inverse<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.660> that<00:02:16.720> would<00:02:17.019> be<00:02:17.140> one

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349

millimeter<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:06.660> second<00:03:07.660> issue<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:09.459> causes

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
millimeter a second issue that causes

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.860 
millimeter a second issue that causes
softness<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.230> an<00:03:11.380> image<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:13.030> actual<00:03:13.329> blur

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
softness and an image is the actual blur

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.640 
softness and an image is the actual blur
due<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.799> subjects<00:03:15.250> motion<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:17.500> have

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
due to the subjects motion so you have

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.319 
due to the subjects motion so you have
light<00:03:17.829> falling<00:03:18.100> on<00:03:18.310> your<00:03:18.430> sensor<00:03:18.850> while<00:03:19.150> your

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
light falling on your sensor while your

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.460 
light falling on your sensor while your
shutter<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.840> open<00:03:21.060> if<00:03:22.060> that<00:03:22.540> subject<00:03:23.170> moves

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
shutter is open if that subject moves

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.830 
shutter is open if that subject moves
then<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.190> light<00:03:24.400> being<00:03:24.670> reflected<00:03:24.970> through

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
then the light being reflected through

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080 
then the light being reflected through
the<00:03:25.959> lens<00:03:26.170> onto<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.620> sensor<00:03:26.829> changes<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.670> you

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
the lens onto the sensor changes and you

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.020 
the lens onto the sensor changes and you
get<00:03:28.299> effectively<00:03:28.720> two<00:03:29.139> images<00:03:29.470> on<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:30.790> same

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
get effectively two images on the same

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.370 
get effectively two images on the same
exposure<00:03:31.989> which<00:03:32.349> results<00:03:32.859> in<00:03:32.950> softness<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
exposure which results in softness the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.470 
exposure which results in softness the
way<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.590> eliminate<00:03:35.859> that<00:03:36.250> is<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:37.120> course<00:03:37.269> you

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
way to eliminate that is of course you

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.030 
way to eliminate that is of course you
use<00:03:37.599> a<00:03:37.630> shutter<00:03:37.930> speed<00:03:38.049> appropriately<00:03:38.829> high

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
use a shutter speed appropriately high

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.110 
use a shutter speed appropriately high
enough<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:40.329> stop<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.109> motion<00:03:41.319> as<00:03:41.799> we<00:03:42.010> call<00:03:42.190> and

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
enough to stop the motion as we call and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.059 
enough to stop the motion as we call and
this<00:03:43.150> just<00:03:43.900> takes<00:03:44.049> some<00:03:44.200> experience<00:03:44.769> or<00:03:44.919> some

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
this just takes some experience or some

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.210 
this just takes some experience or some
quick<00:03:45.780> experimentation<00:03:46.780> with<00:03:47.650> whatever<00:03:47.889> your

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
quick experimentation with whatever your

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.930 
quick experimentation with whatever your
subject<00:03:48.639> is<00:03:48.790> whether<00:03:49.120> it's<00:03:49.329> sports<00:03:50.940> or

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
subject is whether it's sports or

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.300 
subject is whether it's sports or
wildlife<00:03:52.630> or<00:03:52.870> nature<00:03:53.139> or<00:03:53.380> whatever<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.040> and

wildlife or nature or whatever it is and

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.420 
wildlife or nature or whatever it is and
then<00:03:54.459> of<00:03:54.609> course<00:03:54.639> sometimes<00:03:55.569> you<00:03:55.720> want<00:03:55.900> to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
then of course sometimes you want to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.729 
then of course sometimes you want to
intentionally<00:03:57.430> cause<00:03:57.690> motion<00:03:58.690> blur<00:03:59.079> such<00:03:59.590> as

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
intentionally cause motion blur such as

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
blurry dreamy look but that's all

shutter<00:04:12.040> speed<00:04:12.370> is<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:13.329> have<00:04:13.510> your<00:04:13.719> shutter

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
shutter speed is you have your shutter

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.839 
shutter speed is you have your shutter
priority<00:04:14.260> mode<00:04:14.560> up<00:04:14.950> here<00:04:15.129> which<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.430> use<00:04:15.670> the

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
priority mode up here which I use the

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.430 
priority mode up here which I use the
least<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.390> three

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
just like aperture-priority movie you

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.050 
just like aperture-priority movie you

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
set your shutters your shutter speed and

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.790 
set your shutters your shutter speed and
sheriff<00:04:22.480> already<00:04:22.660> mode<00:04:22.990> and<00:04:23.230> then<00:04:23.620> your

sheriff already mode and then your

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.760 
sheriff already mode and then your
camera<00:04:24.190> adjust<00:04:24.310> aperture<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:25.450> your<00:04:25.990> ISO<00:04:26.500> if

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
camera adjust aperture and your ISO if

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.100 
camera adjust aperture and your ISO if
your<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:27.280> as<00:04:27.490> an<00:04:27.640> auto<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:28.450> make<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.780> exposure

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
your is as an auto to make the exposure

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.140 
your is as an auto to make the exposure
correct<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.870> there<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.230> is<00:04:32.550> shutter<00:04:33.550> speed<00:04:33.760> and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
correct so there it is shutter speed and

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.290 
correct so there it is shutter speed and
a<00:04:34.690> simple<00:04:34.990> thumb<00:04:35.290> rule<00:04:35.520> for<00:04:36.520> knowing<00:04:37.180> your
