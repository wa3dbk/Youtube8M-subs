00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.730
 A group of high-fat, high-fat pork slices 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.830
 I ate food. 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:23.360
 On one side I filled 60% of my total calories with fat, 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.160
 10% in the diet, because the fat is fed low fat food, the immune system 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.560
 I compared the activities . 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:35.210
 A lot of fat intake and away from the activity of the immune layer of fat intake group delay 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.629
 Whether it has been confirmed that the ability to leukocyte decreased or 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:43.249
 Whether you're fairing or not, 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:49.039
 Fat intake is too high, the impact pecking 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:50.480
 For 00 days but now somehow meat intake is associated with the head in many developed countries 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.429

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.780
 Beef Pork Red Meat I have my chicken and duck meat my strength 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:02.629
 And 2 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:08.240
 Anyway, the more red meat you eat, the higher the risk of cancer. 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:14.180
 Now , if the onset of colorectal cancer b1 occurs within 10 degrees, the US National Cancer Institute 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:18.830
 And then go to the top 20% of the red meat intake group went to the bottom 10% 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.560
 The average rate of disease is 79% 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.119
 4 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.090
 So yes yesterday I was not good to eat too much 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.000
 I think slap is young. 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:37.170
 In the United States, when I talk about Rice 6, I usually talk about beef and mutton . 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.140
 Look at the beef. Now the white 6 will talk about chicken. 2 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:47.880
 Now, the pork is a moderate language, so now the pork 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:53.640
 6 jeoksaeng will say gonna be up in the range is a little unaware of me yet 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.580

 And the nutrition that kept the influence of the people of the Korean people 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.920
 It is not the report that we kept the influence of the Busan refugees during the Korean War . 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:16.349
 Pork soup rice seaweed is yearly It is now a rule in childhood 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:22.200
 And we were able to substantially increase the intake of pork and grown up in adolescence 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:28.049
 It is evident that the development and development of nearly a collection of relationships is now just around the corner of development 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:33.660
 According to recent research results, and also the value of what is generated to promote its energetic 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:38.040
 Alas, the result is good, so it is already possible to explain this side and we 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:42.750
 What mental health yangjaejin ever be good to very good

 If you like the way I felt my happiness For rainy and gloomy day Curacao 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.959
 Scientifically wrong words about the day that you feel better when you are soothed 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.470
 Because 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.940
 Two to three tons. The substance is tryptophan. 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:04.380

 In the day when the mood is depressed,

 That's it. 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.130
 It's not because of alcohol.
