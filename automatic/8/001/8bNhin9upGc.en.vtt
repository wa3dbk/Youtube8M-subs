00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
something and then my combat boots

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.760 
something and then my combat boots
yeah<00:01:56.939> these<00:01:57.149> were<00:01:57.210> about<00:01:57.420> six<00:01:57.780> dollars<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
yeah these were about six dollars and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.730 
yeah these were about six dollars and
for<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> organization<00:01:59.399> thing<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> set

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
for the organization thing it is a set

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
for the organization thing it is a set
of<00:02:01.860> three<00:02:02.130> cosmetic<00:02:02.759> organizers<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> I'll

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
of three cosmetic organizers and I'll

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.590 
of three cosmetic organizers and I'll
actually<00:02:04.079> open<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.490> show<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:05.969> guys<00:02:06.060> what

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
actually open it and show you guys what

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.350 
actually open it and show you guys what
it<00:02:06.659> comes<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.250> my<00:02:08.250> bathroom<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:08.970> pretty

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it comes with my bathroom is pretty

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.680 
it comes with my bathroom is pretty
clean<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.379> not<00:02:10.500> like<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.860> really<00:02:10.950> need

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
clean so it's not like I really need

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.230 
clean so it's not like I really need
but<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.470> think<00:02:13.280> you<00:02:13.340> would<00:02:13.430> make<00:02:13.460> it<00:02:13.670> look<00:02:13.790> nicer

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
but I think you would make it look nicer

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.540 
but I think you would make it look nicer
so<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.050> is<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.290> first<00:02:15.500> container<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.430> could

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
so this is the first container you could

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.340 
so this is the first container you could
put<00:02:16.730> lipsticks<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.480> here<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> think<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:18.140> might

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
put lipsticks in here so I think I might

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.490 
put lipsticks in here so I think I might
put<00:02:18.560> my<00:02:18.590> most<00:02:18.950> worn<00:02:19.340> lipsticks<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:21.050> like

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
put my most worn lipsticks and then like

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.530 
put my most worn lipsticks and then like
a<00:02:21.530> brush<00:02:21.920> or<00:02:22.100> two<00:02:22.310> here<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.030> don't<00:02:23.240> know<00:02:23.420> what

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
a brush or two here I don't know what

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.850 
a brush or two here I don't know what
I'll<00:02:23.630> put<00:02:23.750> in<00:02:23.840> here<00:02:23.960> maybe<00:02:24.110> some<00:02:24.380> cotton<00:02:24.710> balls

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
I'll put in here maybe some cotton balls

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:33.310 
I'll put in here maybe some cotton balls
I<00:02:25.310> don't<00:02:25.550> know<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.390> there's

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
I don't know this like that there's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.460 
I don't know this like that there's
actually<00:02:33.650> another<00:02:33.860> piece<00:02:34.220> which<00:02:35.090> is<00:02:35.150> this<00:02:35.930> and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
actually another piece which is this and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.010 
actually another piece which is this and
you<00:02:36.680> put<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:36.950> on<00:02:37.040> top<00:02:37.340> and<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.150> can<00:02:38.450> close<00:02:38.660> it

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
you put it on top and you can close it

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.290 
you put it on top and you can close it
open<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.530> don't<00:02:39.710> know<00:02:39.770> like<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:40.670> it's<00:02:41.060> kind

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300
