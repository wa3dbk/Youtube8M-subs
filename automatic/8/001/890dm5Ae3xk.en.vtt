00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.580 

okay<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.809> just<00:00:12.840> wanted<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.290> make<00:00:13.410> this

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
okay so I just wanted to make this

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.440 
okay so I just wanted to make this
really<00:00:13.860> quick<00:00:14.070> video<00:00:14.519> for<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.910> today<00:00:15.210> because

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
really quick video for you today because

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.180 
really quick video for you today because
I<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.990> simple<00:00:16.500> trick<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.039> can<00:00:17.160> use

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
I have a simple trick that you can use

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.670 
I have a simple trick that you can use
for<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.060> call<00:00:18.359> perpetual<00:00:19.080> recovery

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
for what I call perpetual recovery

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.130 
for what I call perpetual recovery
ability<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.400> perpetual<00:00:20.850> recovery<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.960> just

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
ability and perpetual recovery it's just

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019 
ability and perpetual recovery it's just
basically<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> ability<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.130> continually

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
basically the ability to continually

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.410 
basically the ability to continually
recover<00:00:24.869> very<00:00:25.350> very<00:00:25.680> quickly<00:00:26.010> from<00:00:26.760> any<00:00:27.029> type

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
recover very very quickly from any type

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.240 
recover very very quickly from any type
of<00:00:27.689> training<00:00:28.050> or<00:00:28.380> game<00:00:28.619> play<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:29.070> anything

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
of training or game play or anything

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.269 
of training or game play or anything
like<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.519> because<00:00:29.789> as<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> season

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
like that because as the season

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.350 
like that because as the season
approaches<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.550> know<00:00:32.759> our<00:00:32.940> trainings

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
approaches and you know our trainings

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.479 
approaches and you know our trainings
getting<00:00:33.600> harder<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> or<00:00:34.559> workloads<00:00:35.130> harder

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
getting harder and or workloads harder

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.920 
getting harder and or workloads harder
and<00:00:35.610> I've<00:00:35.670> had<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> lot<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.090> players<00:00:36.360> say<00:00:36.750> hey

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and I've had a lot of players say hey

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.540 
and I've had a lot of players say hey
like<00:00:37.200> I'm<00:00:37.380> getting<00:00:37.649> overtrained<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:38.370> did<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
like I'm getting overtrained what did I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
like I'm getting overtrained what did I
do<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> simple<00:00:40.230> thing<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> can

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
do this is a simple thing that you can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.000 
do this is a simple thing that you can
do<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.219> immediately<00:00:42.149> will<00:00:42.690> help<00:00:43.010> your

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
do that immediately will help your

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.950 
do that immediately will help your
recovery<00:00:44.399> ability<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.030> before<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.930> actually

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
recovery ability and before we actually

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
recovery ability and before we actually
get<00:00:46.410> into<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.770> trick<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.129> there's

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
get into the trick I think there's

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.799 
get into the trick I think there's
something<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.910> really<00:00:48.360> really<00:00:48.510> need<00:00:48.780> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
something that you really really need to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.630 
something that you really really need to
understand<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.680> all<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.010> without

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
understand first of all so without

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
understand first of all so without
getting<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.090> science<00:00:51.570> either<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:52.410> know

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
getting to science either we all know

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.840 
getting to science either we all know
the<00:00:52.680> importance<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.280> central<00:00:53.820> nervous

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the importance of your central nervous

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.580 
the importance of your central nervous
system<00:00:54.270> obviously<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.110> central<00:00:55.379> nervous

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
system obviously the central nervous

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.729 
system obviously the central nervous
system<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.550> basically<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.750> power<00:00:58.050> plant<00:00:58.440> and

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
system is basically your power plant and

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.459 
system is basically your power plant and
it<00:00:58.940> it<00:00:59.940> essentially<00:01:00.270> supplies<00:01:00.809> your<00:01:01.079> entire

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it it essentially supplies your entire

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.820 
it it essentially supplies your entire
body<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:03.229> everything<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.320> needs<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.710> become

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
body with everything it needs to become

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
body with everything it needs to become
more<00:01:05.159> powerful<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.970> really<00:01:06.390> train<00:01:06.659> hard<00:01:06.960> when

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
more powerful and really train hard when

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.310 
more powerful and really train hard when
your<00:01:07.490> power<00:01:08.490> plant<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.390> so-called<00:01:10.110> power

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
your power plant so so-called power

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.190 
your power plant so so-called power
power<00:01:10.650> plant<00:01:10.950> gets<00:01:11.159> depleted<00:01:12.049> you're<00:01:13.049> not

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
power plant gets depleted you're not

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.810 
power plant gets depleted you're not
gonna<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.590> much<00:01:13.619> power<00:01:14.010> output<00:01:14.580> you're

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
gonna have as much power output you're

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.700 
gonna have as much power output you're
not<00:01:14.939> gonna<00:01:15.119> feel<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.049> good<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> you're<00:01:16.590> gonna

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
not gonna feel as good and you're gonna

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.050 
not gonna feel as good and you're gonna
have<00:01:16.830> all<00:01:16.920> kinds<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.549> really<00:01:17.729> negative

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
have all kinds of really negative

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.820 
have all kinds of really negative
consequences<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> you're<00:01:19.290> gonna<00:01:19.380> get<00:01:19.560> over

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
consequences and you're gonna get over

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
consequences and you're gonna get over
trained<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.430> when<00:01:21.060> your<00:01:21.210> central<00:01:21.659> nervous

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
trained but when your central nervous

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
trained but when your central nervous
system<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.409> really<00:01:22.560> operating<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> high

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
system is really operating on a high

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.440 
system is really operating on a high
high<00:01:23.820> level<00:01:24.090> you're<00:01:24.840> gonna<00:01:24.930> feel<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:26.270> at<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
high level you're gonna feel just at the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.880 
high level you're gonna feel just at the
top<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:27.869> game<00:01:28.080> all<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.409> time<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.799> our

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
top of your game all the time and our

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.260 
top of your game all the time and our
goal<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.490> keep<00:01:29.640> our<00:01:29.850> central<00:01:30.240> nervous

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
goal is to keep our central nervous

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
goal is to keep our central nervous
system<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:31.200> charged<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.829> okay<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.189> any

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
system really charged up okay and any

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.819 
system really charged up okay and any
type<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> training<00:01:33.290> taxes<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.470> central

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
type of training taxes your central

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.120 
type of training taxes your central
nervous<00:01:35.009> system<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.140> speed<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.829> we<00:01:37.890> can

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
nervous system so the speed that we can

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.149 
nervous system so the speed that we can
recover<00:01:38.610> our<00:01:39.000> central<00:01:39.630> nervous<00:01:39.840> system<00:01:40.409> from

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
recover our central nervous system from

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.850 
recover our central nervous system from
training<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.970> gonna<00:01:42.150> determine<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.829> can

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
training is gonna determine how we can

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.130 
training is gonna determine how we can
you<00:01:44.250> know<00:01:44.369> perpetually<00:01:45.090> recover<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.840> there

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you know perpetually recover so there

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.780 
you know perpetually recover so there
was<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.890> good<00:01:47.040> strength<00:01:47.340> coaching

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
was a really good strength coaching

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.370 
was a really good strength coaching
buddy<00:01:48.119> Morris<00:01:48.540> who<00:01:48.689> I've<00:01:48.780> learned<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.110> lot<00:01:49.320> from

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
buddy Morris who I've learned a lot from

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.249 
buddy Morris who I've learned a lot from
and<00:01:49.799> he<00:01:49.979> he<00:01:50.640> talks<00:01:50.909> about<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.780> autonomic

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and he he talks about the autonomic

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.800 
and he he talks about the autonomic
nervous<00:01:52.829> system<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.610> how<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.759> recover<00:01:54.210> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
nervous system and how to recover that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.330 
nervous system and how to recover that
branch<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> central<00:01:55.829> nervous<00:01:56.130> system

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.940 
branch of the central nervous system
really<00:01:56.759> quickly<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.710> essentially<00:01:58.710> your

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
really quickly so essentially your

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.830 
really quickly so essentially your
central<00:01:59.399> nervous<00:01:59.430> system<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.210> made<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
central nervous system is made up of a

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120 
central nervous system is made up of a
lot<00:02:00.990> of<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.380> branches<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
lot of different branches and one of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
lot of different branches and one of
those<00:02:02.189> branches<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> autonomic<00:02:03.119> nervous

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
those branches of the autonomic nervous

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.560 
those branches of the autonomic nervous
system<00:02:04.290> which<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.439> further<00:02:05.299> subdivided<00:02:06.299> into

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
system which is further subdivided into

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.089 
system which is further subdivided into
your<00:02:07.079> sympathetic<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.009> your

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
your sympathetic and your

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.919 
your sympathetic and your
parasympathetic<00:02:08.580> nervous<00:02:09.270> system<00:02:09.690> as<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
parasympathetic nervous system as you

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.830 
parasympathetic nervous system as you
can<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.470> picture<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.840> your

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
can see in this picture and your

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.750 
can see in this picture and your
sympathetic<00:02:13.620> nervous<00:02:13.860> system<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.370> basically

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
sympathetic nervous system is basically

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.690 
sympathetic nervous system is basically
all<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> your<00:02:15.690> fight<00:02:16.560> hormones<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.520> your

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
all of your fight hormones and your

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.760 
all of your fight hormones and your
parasympathetic<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.200> flight<00:02:19.530> so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
parasympathetic is is like the flight so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.160 
parasympathetic is is like the flight so
it's<00:02:19.890> fight<00:02:20.129> or<00:02:20.280> flight<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.790> obviously<00:02:21.690> when

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
it's fight or flight and obviously when

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.040 
it's fight or flight and obviously when
we're<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.440> sympathetic<00:02:22.980> mode<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.940> kind<00:02:24.270> of<00:02:24.480> you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
we're in sympathetic mode we kind of you

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.600 
we're in sympathetic mode we kind of you
know<00:02:25.170> our<00:02:25.349> adrenaline<00:02:25.890> gets<00:02:26.040> pumping<00:02:26.190> it

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
know our adrenaline gets pumping it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.490 
know our adrenaline gets pumping it
releases<00:02:26.940> all<00:02:27.150> these<00:02:27.330> catabolic<00:02:27.900> hormones

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
releases all these catabolic hormones

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.670 
releases all these catabolic hormones
like<00:02:28.590> adrenaline<00:02:28.790> cortisol<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.560> know

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
like adrenaline cortisol and you know

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.610 
like adrenaline cortisol and you know
these<00:02:32.160> are<00:02:32.690> essential<00:02:33.690> hormones<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.379> get<00:02:34.530> you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
these are essential hormones to get you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.160 
these are essential hormones to get you
fired<00:02:34.890> up<00:02:35.069> for<00:02:35.250> training<00:02:35.819> but<00:02:36.599> at<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.989> same

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
fired up for training but at the same

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.050 
fired up for training but at the same
time<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.920> more<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.459> release<00:02:38.819> those

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
time the more that you release those

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.300 
time the more that you release those
hormones<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.810> harder<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.440> recover<00:02:40.709> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
hormones the harder it is to recover and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.430 
hormones the harder it is to recover and
the<00:02:42.120> more<00:02:42.269> drain<00:02:42.599> that<00:02:42.840> you're<00:02:42.989> gonna<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.319> in

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
the more drain that you're gonna be in

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.380 
the more drain that you're gonna be in
your<00:02:43.560> central<00:02:43.890> nervous<00:02:44.040> system<00:02:44.400> but<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:45.239> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
your central nervous system but I on the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.729 
your central nervous system but I on the
flip<00:02:45.599> side<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.989> parasympathetic<00:02:46.410> nervous

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
flip side the parasympathetic nervous

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.970 
flip side the parasympathetic nervous
system<00:02:47.720> basically<00:02:48.720> releases<00:02:49.319> your<00:02:49.500> anabolic

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
system basically releases your anabolic

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.670 
system basically releases your anabolic
sex<00:02:50.940> hormones<00:02:51.450> okay<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.959> testosterone

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
sex hormones okay like testosterone

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.800 
sex hormones okay like testosterone
growth<00:02:52.860> hormone<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.670> it's<00:02:54.120> really<00:02:54.390> your

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
growth hormone it's it's really your

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.040 
growth hormone it's it's really your
body's<00:02:55.230> own<00:02:55.260> natural<00:02:55.760> source<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:57.050> recovery

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
body's own natural source of recovery

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.160 
body's own natural source of recovery
hormones<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:58.890> more<00:02:59.840> you<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.959> in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
hormones and the more you know in

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.290 
hormones and the more you know in
training<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:01.830> obviously<00:03:02.040> have<00:03:02.670> to<00:03:02.909> be<00:03:03.090> in

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
training we obviously have to be in

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.920 
training we obviously have to be in
sympathetic<00:03:04.019> mode<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.540> outside<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.720> training

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
sympathetic mode but outside of training

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.170 
sympathetic mode but outside of training
we<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.409> to<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.769> parasympathetic<00:03:08.310> mode<00:03:08.909> as

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
we have to be in parasympathetic mode as

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.199 
we have to be in parasympathetic mode as
much<00:03:09.870> as<00:03:10.140> possible<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.550> we<00:03:11.790> can<00:03:11.970> really

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
much as possible so that we can really

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.449 
much as possible so that we can really
you<00:03:12.599> know<00:03:12.629> focus<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.379> recovering<00:03:13.860> all<00:03:14.129> the

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you know focus on recovering all the

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.190 
you know focus on recovering all the
time<00:03:14.700> when<00:03:14.940> we're<00:03:15.060> outside<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.659> gym<00:03:16.019> and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
time when we're outside of the gym and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.070 
time when we're outside of the gym and
there's<00:03:16.830> a<00:03:16.890> really<00:03:17.280> easy<00:03:17.580> way<00:03:17.909> to<00:03:17.940> shift<00:03:18.480> into

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
there's a really easy way to shift into

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.970 
there's a really easy way to shift into
parasympathetic<00:03:19.980> mode<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.989> know<00:03:22.110> as<00:03:22.349> fast<00:03:22.650> as

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
parasympathetic mode you know as fast as

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.619 
parasympathetic mode you know as fast as
possible<00:03:23.489> and<00:03:23.610> stay<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.180> parasympathetic

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
possible and stay in parasympathetic

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.420 
possible and stay in parasympathetic
mode<00:03:25.140> all<00:03:25.379> the<00:03:25.440> time<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.159> that<00:03:26.190> we're

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
mode all the time so that we're

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.089 
mode all the time so that we're
perpetually<00:03:27.260> recovering<00:03:28.260> from<00:03:28.560> our<00:03:28.709> training

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
perpetually recovering from our training

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.740 
perpetually recovering from our training
and<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.280> just<00:03:29.459> staying<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:30.000> sympathetic<00:03:30.420> mode

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
and not just staying in sympathetic mode

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.350 
and not just staying in sympathetic mode
and<00:03:31.019> training<00:03:31.799> our<00:03:31.950> recovery<00:03:32.400> resources<00:03:33.180> and

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
and training our recovery resources and

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.660 
and training our recovery resources and
trust<00:03:33.599> me<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.379> really<00:03:34.799> helps<00:03:35.159> once

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
trust me this really really helps once

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.500 
trust me this really really helps once
you<00:03:35.790> get<00:03:35.970> into<00:03:36.239> your<00:03:36.330> season<00:03:36.780> this<00:03:36.900> year<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.379> a

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
you get into your season this year so a

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.759 
you get into your season this year so a
really<00:03:39.510> quick<00:03:39.900> way<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.170> shift<00:03:40.470> into

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
really quick way to shift into

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.830 
really quick way to shift into
parasympathetic<00:03:41.159> mode<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:41.970> also<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.540> I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
parasympathetic mode and also the I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.570 
parasympathetic mode and also the I
wanted<00:03:43.260> to<00:03:43.319> mention<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.709> speed<00:03:44.159> that<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.549> can

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
wanted to mention the speed that you can

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.369 
wanted to mention the speed that you can
shift<00:03:45.060> into<00:03:45.330> parasympathetic<00:03:46.019> mode<00:03:46.200> after

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
shift into parasympathetic mode after

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.350 
shift into parasympathetic mode after
training<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.519> speed<00:03:47.819> that<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.060> can<00:03:48.090> get

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
training so the speed that you can get

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.720 
training so the speed that you can get
from<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.230> sympathetic<00:03:49.980> dominance<00:03:50.459> into

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
from you know sympathetic dominance into

any personal training certification you
could<00:04:38.100> ever<00:04:38.340> get<00:04:38.699> I<00:04:38.850> think<00:04:39.030> bricks<00:04:39.210> that<00:04:39.330> you

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
could ever get I think bricks that you

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.990 
could ever get I think bricks that you
can<00:04:39.570> use<00:04:39.780> to<00:04:39.960> stay<00:04:40.260> in<00:04:40.790> parasympathetic<00:04:41.790> mode

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
can use to stay in parasympathetic mode

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.700 
can use to stay in parasympathetic mode
and<00:04:42.270> Elliot's<00:04:42.870> really<00:04:43.139> good<00:04:43.290> at<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:43.530> he's<00:04:43.680> a

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
talking about and we talk about this a

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.400 
talking about and we talk about this a
lot<00:04:46.889> very<00:04:47.850> very<00:04:48.150> valuable<00:04:48.419> for<00:04:48.840> athletes<00:04:49.260> but

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
lot very very valuable for athletes but

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.920 
lot very very valuable for athletes but
not<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.740> get<00:04:49.860> out<00:04:50.040> off<00:04:50.250> on<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.580> tangent<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.240> have<00:04:51.900> a

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
not to get out off on a tangent I have a

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.200 
not to get out off on a tangent I have a
really<00:04:52.470> simple<00:04:52.800> breathing<00:04:53.310> pattern<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.090> you

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
really simple breathing pattern that you

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.450 
really simple breathing pattern that you
can<00:04:54.360> use<00:04:54.479> to<00:04:54.660> stay<00:04:55.050> in<00:04:55.380> parasympathetic<00:04:55.889> mode

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
can use to stay in parasympathetic mode

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.270 
can use to stay in parasympathetic mode
all<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.820> time<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:58.050> really<00:04:58.139> balance<00:04:58.800> both

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
all the time and really balance both

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.250 
all the time and really balance both
sides<00:04:59.610> of<00:04:59.760> your<00:04:59.820> nervous<00:05:00.180> system<00:05:00.330> for<00:05:00.660> optimal

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
sides of your nervous system for optimal

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.500 
sides of your nervous system for optimal
recovery<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:02.100> this<00:05:02.880> is<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.240> breathing

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
recovery so this is the breathing

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.969 
recovery so this is the breathing
sequence<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.200> you're<00:05:04.290> gonna<00:05:04.380> perform<00:05:04.620> it

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
sequence and you're gonna perform it

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.670 
sequence and you're gonna perform it
before<00:05:05.520> each<00:05:05.760> meal<00:05:06.150> that<00:05:06.570> you<00:05:06.690> eat<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:07.139> right

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
before each meal that you eat and right

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.190 
before each meal that you eat and right

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
regular breathing patterns because you

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.340 
regular breathing patterns because you

don't want to hyperventilate and then

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.440 
don't want to hyperventilate and then
you're<00:05:37.470> gonna<00:05:37.560> go<00:05:37.830> again<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.700> full<00:05:39.120> sequence

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
you're gonna go again that full sequence

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.740 
you're gonna go again that full sequence
again<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:41.310> then<00:05:41.669> you<00:05:41.910> know<00:05:42.030> breathe<00:05:42.300> normally

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
again and then you know breathe normally

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.150 
again and then you know breathe normally
for<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:42.960> few<00:05:43.139> seconds<00:05:43.560> do<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.770> full<00:05:43.950> sequence

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
for a few seconds do the full sequence

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.000 
for a few seconds do the full sequence
again<00:05:44.700> you're<00:05:45.330> gonna<00:05:45.450> repeat<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.080> for<00:05:46.680> five

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
again you're gonna repeat it for five

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.150 
again you're gonna repeat it for five
full<00:05:47.669> rounds<00:05:48.599> okay<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.320> it<00:05:49.410> really<00:05:49.770> doesn't

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
full rounds okay and it really doesn't

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.980 
full rounds okay and it really doesn't
take<00:05:50.190> long<00:05:50.520> at<00:05:50.550> all<00:05:50.760> this<00:05:50.970> takes<00:05:51.240> about<00:05:51.570> five

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
take long at all this takes about five

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.770 
take long at all this takes about five
minutes<00:05:52.580> you<00:05:53.580> can<00:05:53.729> work<00:05:54.000> yourself<00:05:54.150> up<00:05:54.599> to

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
minutes you can work yourself up to

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.830 
minutes you can work yourself up to
being<00:05:54.990> able<00:05:55.139> to<00:05:55.260> do<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:55.950> know<00:05:56.570> every<00:05:57.570> single

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
being able to do you know every single

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.140 
being able to do you know every single
breathing<00:05:58.740> sequence<00:05:59.160> in<00:05:59.340> a<00:05:59.460> row<00:05:59.669> so<00:05:59.910> you<00:06:00.000> just

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
breathing sequence in a row so you just

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.180 
breathing sequence in a row so you just
go<00:06:00.270> five<00:06:00.510> seconds<00:06:00.930> 15<00:06:01.229> seconds<00:06:01.590> ten<00:06:01.800> seconds

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190

doctor first you know we don't want to

doctor first you know we don't want to
be<00:06:23.789> held<00:06:24.000> liable<00:06:24.240> for<00:06:24.479> anybody<00:06:25.020> who

hyperventilates or anything like that

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.969 
hyperventilates or anything like that
but<00:06:26.880> I<00:06:27.150> think<00:06:27.690> for<00:06:27.870> healthy<00:06:28.260> athletes<00:06:28.770> like

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 
but I think for healthy athletes like

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:30.680 
but I think for healthy athletes like
basketball<00:06:29.520> players<00:06:29.550> there's<00:06:30.000> absolutely<00:06:30.419> no

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
basketball players there's absolutely no

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.210 
basketball players there's absolutely no
danger<00:06:30.930> of<00:06:31.200> that<00:06:31.320> I've<00:06:31.500> been<00:06:31.620> doing<00:06:31.860> this<00:06:31.979> for

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
danger of that I've been doing this for

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.680 
danger of that I've been doing this for
years<00:06:32.370> and<00:06:32.490> years<00:06:32.639> I've<00:06:32.909> never<00:06:33.090> seen<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.419> player

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
years and years I've never seen a player

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.810 
years and years I've never seen a player
actually<00:06:34.349> have<00:06:34.710> a<00:06:34.800> problem<00:06:35.219> like<00:06:35.400> that<00:06:35.430> unless

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
actually have a problem like that unless

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.940 
actually have a problem like that unless
you're<00:06:36.030> truly

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:36.950 
you're truly

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.880 
you're truly
you<00:06:37.550> know<00:06:37.670> 300<00:06:38.540> pounds<00:06:38.870> morbidly<00:06:39.260> obese<00:06:39.380> or

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
you know 300 pounds morbidly obese or

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.140 
you know 300 pounds morbidly obese or
you<00:06:40.070> have<00:06:40.160> asthma<00:06:40.580> or<00:06:40.700> something<00:06:40.820> like<00:06:41.090> that

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
you have asthma or something like that

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.870 
you have asthma or something like that
you<00:06:41.390> should<00:06:41.540> be<00:06:41.630> careful<00:06:41.870> but<00:06:42.370> otherwise<00:06:43.370> this

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
you should be careful but otherwise this

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.090 
you should be careful but otherwise this
is<00:06:44.000> a<00:06:44.030> very<00:06:44.420> very<00:06:44.630> effective<00:06:44.840> sequence<00:06:45.770> for

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.100 
is a very very effective sequence for

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.060 
is a very very effective sequence for
actually<00:06:46.520> shifting<00:06:47.060> into<00:06:47.360> parasympathetic

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
actually shifting into parasympathetic

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.370 
actually shifting into parasympathetic
dominant<00:06:49.070> nervous<00:06:49.520> system<00:06:49.820> and<00:06:50.080> the<00:06:51.080> reason

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
dominant nervous system and the reason

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.720 
dominant nervous system and the reason
we<00:06:51.470> perform<00:06:51.860> it<00:06:51.950> before<00:06:52.190> each<00:06:52.310> meal<00:06:52.580> is

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730 
we perform it before each meal is

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.010 
we perform it before each meal is
because<00:06:53.000> it<00:06:53.090> actually<00:06:53.450> really<00:06:53.660> helps<00:06:53.750> your

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
because it actually really helps your

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.730 
because it actually really helps your
digestion<00:06:54.590> so<00:06:55.270> just<00:06:56.270> a<00:06:56.450> really<00:06:56.780> quick<00:06:57.260> trick

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
digestion so just a really quick trick

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.890 
digestion so just a really quick trick
that<00:06:57.950> you<00:06:58.040> can<00:06:58.190> use<00:06:58.370> before<00:06:58.670> you<00:06:59.090> eat<00:06:59.270> after

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
that you can use before you eat after

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.660 
that you can use before you eat after
your<00:07:00.470> training<00:07:00.920> if<00:07:01.040> you<00:07:01.130> do<00:07:01.280> this<00:07:01.430> all<00:07:01.640> the

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
your training if you do this all the

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.340 
your training if you do this all the
time<00:07:01.790> during<00:07:02.510> the<00:07:02.750> day<00:07:02.960> you're<00:07:03.200> going<00:07:03.290> to

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:03.350 
time during the day you're going to

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.470 
time during the day you're going to
perpetually<00:07:04.160> stay<00:07:04.580> in<00:07:04.940> parasympathetic

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
perpetually stay in parasympathetic

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.520 
perpetually stay in parasympathetic
dominance<00:07:06.020> and<00:07:06.560> you're<00:07:07.010> really<00:07:07.490> going<00:07:07.730> to

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
dominance and you're really going to

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.990 
dominance and you're really going to
increase<00:07:09.530> your<00:07:09.710> ability<00:07:09.830> to<00:07:10.190> recover<00:07:10.820> because

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
increase your ability to recover because

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.010 
increase your ability to recover because
you're<00:07:11.180> always<00:07:11.360> going<00:07:11.660> to<00:07:11.690> be<00:07:11.750> in<00:07:11.900> that

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
you're always going to be in that

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.180 
you're always going to be in that
relaxed<00:07:12.770> anabolic<00:07:14.290> recovery<00:07:15.290> state<00:07:15.830> and<00:07:16.070> it's

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
relaxed anabolic recovery state and it's

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.410 
relaxed anabolic recovery state and it's
really<00:07:16.610> really<00:07:16.820> going<00:07:16.940> to<00:07:17.030> help<00:07:17.180> you<00:07:17.270> out<00:07:17.330> a
