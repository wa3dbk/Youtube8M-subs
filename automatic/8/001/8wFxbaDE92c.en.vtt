to<00:00:33.149> seven<00:00:33.540> as<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:34.140> we're<00:00:34.320> going<00:00:34.500> over<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
to seven as now we're going over the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.670 
to seven as now we're going over the
middle<00:00:35.190> after<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.640> flag<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.360> believe<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.350> was

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
middle after the flag I believe that was

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.889 
middle after the flag I believe that was
an<00:00:37.770> offside<00:00:38.250> call<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.030> move<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> up<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:39.780> as

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
an offside call so we move it up here as

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.430 
an offside call so we move it up here as
its<00:00:40.110> second<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.680> five<00:00:41.010> now<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.050> we<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.200> Kurt

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
gonna go to Kurt but I was not expecting

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.110 
gonna go to Kurt but I was not expecting
that<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.200> he<00:00:49.739> throws<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.219> before<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.850> curl

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that as he throws it before the curl

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.209 
that as he throws it before the curl
road<00:00:51.300> even<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:52.050> supposed<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> happen<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
road even it's supposed to happen and

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.010 
road even it's supposed to happen and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
team and he couldn't get much of that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.399 
team and he couldn't get much of that
one<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.979> play<00:01:20.340> worked<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.479> well<00:01:21.630> either

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
one this play worked very well either

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
one this play worked very well either
way<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.100> quarterback<00:01:23.549> took<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.450> if<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
way the quarterback took it but if you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.140 
way the quarterback took it but if you
were<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> decide<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.530> use<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> option<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.909> think

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
were to decide to use the option I think

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.030 
were to decide to use the option I think
Kurt<00:01:27.390> McCullough<00:01:27.720> could<00:01:27.960> have<00:01:28.080> got<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.380> good

into<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.119> end<00:01:45.299> zone<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.290> he's<00:01:46.710> doing<00:01:46.920> fairly

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
into the end zone so he's doing fairly

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.359 
into the end zone so he's doing fairly
well<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.790> far<00:01:47.820> with<00:01:48.420> one<00:01:48.659> touchdown<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.530> just

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
well so far with one touchdown and just

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
well so far with one touchdown and just
trying<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.820> someone<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.299> it's<00:01:51.570> tough

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
trying to get someone going it's tough

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.569 
trying to get someone going it's tough
because<00:01:52.110> his<00:01:52.590> blocks<00:01:52.979> aren't<00:01:53.189> coming

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because his blocks aren't coming

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.580 
because his blocks aren't coming
especially<00:01:53.790> when<00:01:54.270> heís<00:01:54.600> minutes<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.350> kind

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
especially when heís minutes it's kind

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.450 
especially when heís minutes it's kind
of<00:01:55.680> tough<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> guess<00:01:57.119> what<00:01:57.360> he<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.810> and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
of tough but I guess what he can do and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.100 
of tough but I guess what he can do and

because<00:04:27.960> he<00:04:28.169> needs<00:04:28.380> a<00:04:28.530> first<00:04:28.770> down<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.280> he

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
because he needs a first down and he

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.120 
because he needs a first down and he
does<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.270> bit<00:04:30.480> of<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.690> deeper<00:04:30.900> curl<00:04:31.380> but<00:04:31.919> once

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
does a bit of a deeper curl but once

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.790 
does a bit of a deeper curl but once
again<00:04:32.310> not<00:04:32.970> thrown<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.570> him<00:04:33.600> he<00:04:34.169> was<00:04:34.320> covered<00:04:34.710> a

again not thrown to him he was covered a
bit<00:04:34.949> there<00:04:35.160> so<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.490> understand<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.300> one

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
bit there so I understand that one

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.870 
bit there so I understand that one
especially<00:04:36.810> like<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.470> one<00:04:37.740> he<00:04:38.250> was<00:04:38.430> covered

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
especially like this one he was covered

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.969 
especially like this one he was covered
they<00:04:39.720> throwed<00:04:40.080> him<00:04:40.320> as<00:04:40.380> soon<00:04:40.530> as<00:04:40.680> he<00:04:40.800> gets

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
they throwed him as soon as he gets

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.820 
they throwed him as soon as he gets
behind<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.550> defender<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:42.600> once<00:04:42.780> again<00:04:43.110> that

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
behind the defender but once again that

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.730 
behind the defender but once again that
that<00:04:44.310> passing<00:04:45.030> it's<00:04:45.330> so<00:04:45.570> hard<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.930> catch<00:04:46.290> user

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
that passing it's so hard to catch user

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.620 
that passing it's so hard to catch user
catch<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.400> don't<00:04:47.850> know<00:04:47.970> why<00:04:49.130> it<00:04:50.130> needs<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:51.000> be<00:04:51.210> it

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
catch I don't know why it needs to be it

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.960 
catch I don't know why it needs to be it
needs<00:04:52.050> to<00:04:52.260> be<00:04:52.380> changed<00:04:52.680> basically<00:04:53.460> but<00:04:53.760> I'll

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
needs to be changed basically but I'll

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.690 
needs to be changed basically but I'll
deal<00:04:54.389> with<00:04:54.419> it<00:04:54.660> for<00:04:55.050> now<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.199> guess<00:04:55.410> as<00:04:55.830> look<00:04:56.580> at

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
deal with it for now I guess as look at

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.280 
deal with it for now I guess as look at
this<00:04:56.790> just<00:04:57.120> tons<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.510> time<00:04:57.660> in<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.900> pocket
