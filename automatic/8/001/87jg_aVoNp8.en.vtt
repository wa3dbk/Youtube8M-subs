notice the fun kind of trace rough
roughly<00:00:26.519> done<00:00:26.730> sketchy<00:00:27.330> graphics<00:00:28.050> here<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
roughly done sketchy graphics here so

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.189 
roughly done sketchy graphics here so
for<00:00:29.250> example<00:00:29.310> let's<00:00:29.670> go<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> our<00:00:30.750> first

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
for example let's go to our first

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.170 
for example let's go to our first
destination<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.579> pick<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.090> these

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
destination and you pick one of these

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.709 
destination and you pick one of these
boards<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:35.059> if<00:00:36.059> you're<00:00:36.180> not<00:00:36.270> familiar<00:00:36.450> with

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
boards and if you're not familiar with

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.119 
boards and if you're not familiar with
line<00:00:36.899> rider<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.350> basically<00:00:37.770> I'm<00:00:37.860> trying<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
line rider so basically I'm trying to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.790 
line rider so basically I'm trying to
get<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.280> guy<00:00:38.700> into<00:00:39.260> this<00:00:40.260> little<00:00:40.500> circle

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
get this guy into this little circle

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.680 
get this guy into this little circle
down<00:00:41.190> here<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> through<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
down here and you do that through a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.920 
down here and you do that through a
series<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> lines<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.219> draw<00:00:44.750> just<00:00:45.750> like

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
series of lines that you draw just like

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.790 
series of lines that you draw just like
that<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.800> get<00:00:46.950> them<00:00:47.039> from<00:00:47.190> place<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> place<00:00:47.640> and

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
that to get them from place to place and

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.779 
that to get them from place to place and
you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:49.950> also<00:00:50.100> jump<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> could<00:00:53.010> maybe<00:00:53.340> jump

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
you can also jump so I could maybe jump

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.689 
you can also jump so I could maybe jump
up<00:00:54.149> can't<00:00:54.780> quite<00:00:54.960> make<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.170> leap<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
up can't quite make that leap and so I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.630 
up can't quite make that leap and so I
would<00:00:56.850> add<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> line<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.750> that

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.720 

and<00:01:01.380> make<00:01:02.380> it<00:01:02.530> down<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:02.920> destination<00:01:03.130> now

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
and make it down to the destination now

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.660 
and make it down to the destination now
you're<00:01:03.880> going<00:01:04.000> to<00:01:04.059> watch<00:01:04.180> out<00:01:04.420> those<00:01:04.629> yellow

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you're going to watch out those yellow

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.740 
you're going to watch out those yellow
orbs<00:01:06.670> there<00:01:06.909> what<00:01:07.150> we're<00:01:07.270> trying<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.570> avoid

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
orbs there what we're trying to avoid

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.800 
orbs there what we're trying to avoid
and<00:01:08.680> make<00:01:08.830> it<00:01:08.950> past<00:01:09.190> that<00:01:09.400> one<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:10.420> just<00:01:10.690> like

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
and make it past that one and just like

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.760 
and make it past that one and just like
that<00:01:10.869> admitted<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.440> my<00:01:11.530> destination

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
that admitted to my destination

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.310 
that admitted to my destination
frustrating<00:01:12.729> about<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.180> you<00:01:13.330> ask<00:01:13.540> well<00:01:13.780> that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
frustrating about that you ask well that

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.590 
frustrating about that you ask well that
is<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.830> easiest<00:01:15.250> level<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.240> further<00:01:16.450> you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
is the easiest level and the further you

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.719 
is the easiest level and the further you
go<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.869> more<00:01:20.100> what's<00:01:21.100> so<00:01:21.250> difficult<00:01:21.430> about

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
go the more what's so difficult about

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.430 
go the more what's so difficult about
that<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:22.240> ask<00:01:22.420> well<00:01:22.690> that's<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.080> easiest

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
that you ask well that's the easiest

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.200 
that you ask well that's the easiest

challenging than the space level to get

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.700 
challenging than the space level to get
from<00:01:30.040> point<00:01:30.400> A<00:01:30.700> as<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.300> worked<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.960> point<00:01:32.200> B<00:01:32.380> by

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
from point A as it worked to point B by

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.800 
from point A as it worked to point B by
drawing<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.160> line<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.580> also<00:01:33.940> avoiding<00:01:34.420> the

obstacles<00:01:35.470> along<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.979> way<00:01:36.280> so<00:01:36.970> even<00:01:37.210> though

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
obstacles along the way so even though

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.820 
obstacles along the way so even though
it's<00:01:37.450> not<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.780> kind<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.020> game<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.350> usually
