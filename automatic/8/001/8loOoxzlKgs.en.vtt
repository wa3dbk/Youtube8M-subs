00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.300 

the<00:00:04.050> reason<00:00:04.380> that<00:00:04.410> I've<00:00:04.590> broken<00:00:04.830> up<00:00:05.069> this

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
the reason that I've broken up this

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.480 
the reason that I've broken up this
process<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.270> show<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:07.130> it's<00:00:08.130> a<00:00:08.250> Deans

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
process is to show you that it's a Deans

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.209 
process is to show you that it's a Deans
and<00:00:09.410> so<00:00:11.570> you<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.780> go<00:00:12.990> back<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.559> work<00:00:13.709> over<00:00:14.129> it

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
and so you can go back and work over it

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.540 
and so you can go back and work over it
and<00:00:14.459> come<00:00:14.580> backwards<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.120> forwards<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:16.550> keep

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and come backwards and forwards and keep

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:28.390 
and come backwards and forwards and keep
establishing<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.510> building<00:00:18.780> it<00:00:18.869> up

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.310 

it's<00:00:28.940> flat<00:00:29.300> relative<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.870> my<00:00:29.990> life<00:00:30.230> because

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
it's flat relative to my life because

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.890 
it's flat relative to my life because
yes<00:00:30.680> good<00:00:30.980> yeah<00:00:31.310> so<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:32.450> means<00:00:32.660> I'll<00:00:32.870> be

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
yes good yeah so that means I'll be

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.490 
yes good yeah so that means I'll be
looking<00:00:33.290> at<00:00:33.380> the<00:00:33.410> sky<00:00:33.860> then<00:00:35.320> reflected<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.380> the

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
looking at the sky then reflected on the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.250 
looking at the sky then reflected on the
surface<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.070> water<00:00:37.310> okay<00:00:38.300> but<00:00:38.989> if<00:00:39.110> I'm

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
surface of the water okay but if I'm

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.630 
surface of the water okay but if I'm
looking<00:00:39.380> at<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.830> sky<00:00:40.100> even<00:00:40.809> here<00:00:41.809> for<00:00:41.960> example

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
looking at the sky even here for example

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.369 
looking at the sky even here for example
bounces<00:00:43.640> up<00:00:43.790> there<00:00:44.090> that<00:00:44.809> means<00:00:45.080> at<00:00:45.260> this

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
bounces up there that means at this

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.040 
bounces up there that means at this
point<00:00:45.680> here<00:00:46.010> I'll<00:00:46.220> be<00:00:46.370> looking<00:00:46.670> at<00:00:46.760> this<00:00:47.720> part

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
point here I'll be looking at this part

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.770 
point here I'll be looking at this part
of<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.230> sky<00:00:48.440> reflected<00:00:49.040> on<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.220> water<00:00:49.780> that

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
of the sky reflected on the water that

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.780 
of the sky reflected on the water that
makes<00:00:50.930> it<00:00:52.300> face<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.330> wave<00:00:53.720> like<00:00:54.020> that<00:00:54.790> and

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
makes it face the wave like that and

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.880 
makes it face the wave like that and
pull<00:00:56.570> some<00:00:56.809> backwards<00:00:57.170> or<00:00:57.260> forwards<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:57.710> up

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
pull some backwards or forwards and up

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:16.880 
pull some backwards or forwards and up
and<00:00:58.100> down<00:00:58.160> yep

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.069

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
solar body abruption as you're moving

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.380 
solar body abruption as you're moving
pain<00:01:22.390> around<00:01:23.369> when<00:01:24.369> you<00:01:24.520> start<00:01:24.820> including<00:01:25.149> the
