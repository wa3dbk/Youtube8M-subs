then go ahead and hit enter to execute

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
then go ahead and hit enter to execute
the<00:01:27.060> command<00:01:28.640> secondly<00:01:29.810> sometimes<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.350> need

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the command secondly sometimes you need

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.490 
the command secondly sometimes you need
to<00:01:31.560> actually<00:01:31.820> relaunch<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:33.150> finder<00:01:33.810> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
to actually relaunch your finder it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.170 
to actually relaunch your finder it's
kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.770> like<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:34.950> restarting<00:01:35.700> everything

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
kind of like just restarting everything

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.390 
kind of like just restarting everything
so<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:36.750> those<00:01:36.960> hidden<00:01:37.799> files<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so that way those hidden files and

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.710 
so that way those hidden files and
folders<00:01:38.490> will<00:01:39.479> appear<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.259> your<00:01:40.350> system

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
folders will appear on your system

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.389 
folders will appear on your system
there's<00:01:42.720> two<00:01:42.990> ways<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.369> use

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
there's two ways to do that you can use

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.789 
there's two ways to do that you can use
a<00:01:44.820> kill<00:01:45.540> all<00:01:46.790> space<00:01:47.790> capital<00:01:48.329> F<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.960> finder

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
a kill all space capital F for finder

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.910 
a kill all space capital F for finder
command<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> enter<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.170> will<00:01:52.380> relaunch

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
command and enter and this will relaunch

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.569 
command and enter and this will relaunch
my<00:01:53.490> finder<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.750> when<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> prove

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
my finder and when I do so just to prove

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.730 
my finder and when I do so just to prove
to<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> guys<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.360> will<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.479> two<00:01:57.869> files<00:01:58.290> over

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
to you guys there will be two files over
