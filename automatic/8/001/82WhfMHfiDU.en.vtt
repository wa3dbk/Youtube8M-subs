 Hello my friends, I'm going in today 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.550
 short tutorial like this skyrim 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:17.130
 Install inventory mods on the pc 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.470
 Can this be the murder of the use of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.130
 Inventory user-friendly makes us 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.279
 closing is the last thing max thing and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.010
 that's because it 's normal for that 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.320
 normal mini is for consoles 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.850
 thought that's why I use this one 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.300
 and then you go on the side 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:46.219
 downloads or stop here and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.940
 download the supreme then that comes 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.079
 get that fast I have already done 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.820
 then you have this winter here 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.239
 or zip file depends on it 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.760
 what you use then goes to computer 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.260
 local disk and if you skyrim 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.130
 bought by steam then searched 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.130
 here in the folder his 86 print the team 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:20.220
 come and then on data so the data 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.320
 even if you do not steam it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.680
 Just install it once on pc 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.860

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.650
 on it pulls the folder here and turn 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.720
 also unpack here 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.100
 existed on tel 32 are already 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 then installed on all now 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 would have to be where before only the file was 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.399
 still the two beginning to come 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.750
 his 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.720
 then you can actually do that out 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.070
 clap and yes you have 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.649
 actually always that 's it 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.909
 decide on 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:02.090
 could do what you want with me 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.140
 then I could still do it for you 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.319
 but now I have no desire to show 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.560
 on it when it seeks not working 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.569
 he 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.480
 sometimes in comments then not 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.840
 I can help him and he works 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.110
