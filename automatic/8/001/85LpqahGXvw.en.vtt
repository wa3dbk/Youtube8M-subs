00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
and as we run this track down this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.950 
and as we run this track down this
shoreline<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.790> weave<00:00:39.000> in<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.629> weave

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
right back down the same line the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.389 
right back down the same line the
quietest<00:00:48.989> turning<00:00:49.470> motor<00:00:49.680> I've<00:00:49.890> ever<00:00:50.100> heard

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.069 
quietest turning motor I've ever heard
you<00:00:50.610> know<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.820> prop<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.269> extremely<00:00:51.870> quiet

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
also probably the quietest so when you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.530 
also probably the quietest so when you
compare<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.979> motor<00:00:56.309> turning<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.089> and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
compare this motor turning and that and
