00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.320 
another episode of Proctor car tips
today<00:00:08.429> we're<00:00:08.610> going<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.790> be<00:00:08.880> talking<00:00:09.150> about

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.980 
today we're going to be talking about
the<00:00:09.840> CVT<00:00:10.380> or<00:00:11.509> continuously<00:00:12.509> variable

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
the CVT or continuously variable

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.060 
the CVT or continuously variable
transmission<00:00:14.299> what<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> CVT<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.740> CVT

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
transmission what is a CVT the CVT

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.620 
transmission what is a CVT the CVT
stands<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.670> continuously<00:00:18.210> variable

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
stands for continuously variable

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.330 
stands for continuously variable
transmission<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.590> means<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
transmission which means the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.099 
transmission which means the
transmission<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.029> constantly<00:00:21.570> varying

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
transmission is constantly varying

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.160 
transmission is constantly varying
inside<00:00:22.500> based<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> engines<00:00:23.760> RPMs<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
inside based on the engines RPMs the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.109 
inside based on the engines RPMs the
main<00:00:25.410> difference<00:00:25.830> between<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.160> CVT<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
main difference between a CVT and a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.300 
main difference between a CVT and a
traditional<00:00:27.810> transmission<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.189> there

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
traditional transmission is that there

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.700 
traditional transmission is that there
are<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:29.580> gears<00:00:29.910> inside<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.630> CVT<00:00:30.990> it's

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
are no gears inside the CVT it's

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.799 
are no gears inside the CVT it's
completely<00:00:32.160> sealed<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.730> therefore<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:33.780> are

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
completely sealed so therefore there are

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
completely sealed so therefore there are
no<00:00:33.989> gears<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.710> constantly<00:00:35.280> moving<00:00:35.460> it's

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
no gears that are constantly moving it's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600 
no gears that are constantly moving it's

you're<00:00:50.460> probably<00:00:50.670> asking<00:00:50.910> yourself<00:00:51.390> what's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
you're probably asking yourself what's

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.200 
you're probably asking yourself what's
the<00:00:51.870> benefit<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.530> CVT<00:00:52.890> well<00:00:53.610> first<00:00:53.969> off

you're no longer going to have to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
you're no longer going to have to
experience<00:00:55.890> gear<00:00:56.250> hunting<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.809> does

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
experience gear hunting because it does

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
transmission is just going to be a lot

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.770 
transmission is just going to be a lot
smoother<00:01:07.850> another<00:01:08.850> major<00:01:09.150> advantage<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
smoother another major advantage that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.620 
smoother another major advantage that
the<00:01:09.869> CVT<00:01:10.229> has<00:01:10.740> over<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.310> traditional

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
the CVT has over the traditional

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
the CVT has over the traditional
transmission<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> fuel<00:01:13.710> economy<00:01:13.979> who

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
transmission is fuel economy who

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
transmission is fuel economy who
wouldn't<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.270> gas<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.780> well<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
wouldn't want more gas right well the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.340 
wouldn't want more gas right well the
CVT<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.150> always<00:01:18.390> changing<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
CVT because it's always changing and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
CVT because it's always changing and
adjusting<00:01:19.439> based<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> engines<00:01:20.759> rpm<00:01:21.180> it's

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
adjusting based on the engines rpm it's

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
adjusting based on the engines rpm it's
kind<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.770> always<00:01:23.189> being<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.549> that

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
kind of like always being at that

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.940 
kind of like always being at that
perfect<00:01:24.210> gear<00:01:24.509> being<00:01:24.930> at<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.200> perfect<00:01:25.740> shift

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
perfect gear being at that perfect shift

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.100 
perfect gear being at that perfect shift
point<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.640> you'll<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> major<00:01:27.450> increase<00:01:27.900> in

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
point so you'll see a major increase in

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.740 
point so you'll see a major increase in
fuel<00:01:28.320> economy<00:01:28.579> sometimes<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> 2<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.509> 3

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
fuel economy sometimes up to 2 or 3

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.260 
fuel economy sometimes up to 2 or 3
miles<00:01:30.930> per<00:01:31.140> gallon<00:01:31.439> better<00:01:31.729> now<00:01:32.729> sometimes

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
miles per gallon better now sometimes

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.819 
miles per gallon better now sometimes
there<00:01:33.600> are<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.930> disadvantages<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
there are some disadvantages with the

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.249 
there are some disadvantages with the
CVT<00:01:35.299> because<00:01:36.299> some<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> steel

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
CVT because some of them have a steel

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.810 
CVT because some of them have a steel
plated<00:01:37.590> chain<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> them<00:01:38.490> may<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.790> a

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
plated chain some of them may have a

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.149 
plated chain some of them may have a
belt<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.689> may<00:01:40.020> experience<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.740> little<00:01:40.979> bit

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
belt you may experience a little bit

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.889 
belt you may experience a little bit
more<00:01:41.520> noise<00:01:41.850> coming<00:01:42.210> from<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> transmission

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
more noise coming from the transmission

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.649 
more noise coming from the transmission
than<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> traditional<00:01:43.860> transmission<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
than a traditional transmission so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.330 
than a traditional transmission so
you're<00:01:45.780> probably<00:01:45.960> asking<00:01:46.140> yourself<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you're probably asking yourself if it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.850 
you're probably asking yourself if it
doesn't<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.729> any<00:01:47.759> gears<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.960> how

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
doesn't have any gears in there then how

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.950 
doesn't have any gears in there then how
can<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.070> swap<00:01:50.579> through<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> gears<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> need

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
can I swap through the gears when I need
