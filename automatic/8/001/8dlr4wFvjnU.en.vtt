it<00:03:43.409> awesome<00:03:43.949> we're<00:03:44.699> like<00:03:44.849> you're<00:03:45.030> like<00:03:45.150> wow<00:03:45.510> I

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
it awesome we're like you're like wow I

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.569 
it awesome we're like you're like wow I
know<00:03:46.439> that's<00:03:46.650> impossible<00:03:46.889> but<00:03:47.189> I<00:03:47.250> want<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.459> do

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
know that's impossible but I want to do

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:55.459 
know that's impossible but I want to do
that<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:54.540> I'm<00:03:54.599> reckoning<00:03:54.840> what<00:03:55.019> we've<00:03:55.169> done<00:03:55.290> is

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:55.469 
that so I'm reckoning what we've done is

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.319 
that so I'm reckoning what we've done is
we've<00:03:55.620> built<00:03:55.799> a<00:03:55.859> combo<00:03:56.219> system<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.969> lets<00:03:57.180> the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
we've built a combo system that lets the

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.089 
we've built a combo system that lets the
player<00:03:57.449> sort<00:03:57.870> of<00:03:57.959> build<00:03:58.199> out<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.469> combos<00:03:58.829> in<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
player sort of build out the combos in a

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.949 
player sort of build out the combos in a
way<00:03:59.219> they<00:03:59.400> see<00:03:59.459> fit<00:03:59.579> but<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.269> built<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.840> be

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
way they see fit but it's built to be

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.259 
way they see fit but it's built to be
balanced<00:04:01.349> also<00:04:01.620> as<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:02.129> sense<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.549> risk<00:04:03.090> and

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
balanced also as a sense of risk and

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.330 
balanced also as a sense of risk and
reward<00:04:03.599> so<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> very<00:04:04.290> bottom<00:04:04.680> level<00:04:05.069> you

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
reward so it's a very bottom level you

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.770 
reward so it's a very bottom level you
have<00:04:05.489> your<00:04:05.760> basic<00:04:05.909> attacks<00:04:06.389> and<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.659> are

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
have your basic attacks and these are

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.509 
have your basic attacks and these are
the<00:04:06.930> first<00:04:07.139> hits<00:04:07.439> of<00:04:07.560> your<00:04:07.709> combo<00:04:08.040> chain<00:04:08.250> so<00:04:08.430> if

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
the first hits of your combo chain so if

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.679 
the first hits of your combo chain so if
you<00:04:08.609> think<00:04:08.790> about<00:04:08.849> it<00:04:09.000> with<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.269> daggers

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
you think about it with you daggers

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.929 
you think about it with you daggers
daggers<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.769> a<00:04:10.799> six-hit<00:04:11.220> change<00:04:11.430> so<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.790> first

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 
daggers is a six-hit change so the first

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:13.580 
daggers is a six-hit change so the first
five<00:04:12.209> hits<00:04:12.449> are<00:04:12.599> your<00:04:12.720> basic<00:04:12.870> attacks<00:04:13.319> you<00:04:13.470> can

committed to that move so once you're

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
using magic you've paid a mana cost but

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:49.969 
using magic you've paid a mana cost but
you're<00:04:48.810> committed<00:04:49.199> to<00:04:49.229> that<00:04:49.320> move<00:04:49.680> if<00:04:49.860> you're

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
you're committed to that move if you're

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.260 
you're committed to that move if you're
going<00:04:50.099> to<00:04:50.159> get<00:04:50.250> hit<00:04:50.460> out<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.729> word<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:51.090> might

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
going to get hit out the word you might

going to get hit out the word you might
get<00:04:51.449> hit<00:04:51.659> and<00:04:52.199> it's<00:04:52.380> going<00:04:52.469> to<00:04:52.560> take<00:04:52.710> a<00:04:52.740> while

get hit and it's going to take a while

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.310 
get hit and it's going to take a while
before<00:04:53.130> you<00:04:53.340> can<00:04:53.550> block<00:04:53.849> cancel<00:04:54.659> or<00:04:54.960> dodge

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
before you can block cancel or dodge

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.279 
before you can block cancel or dodge
cancel<00:04:55.860> or<00:04:56.099> even<00:04:56.370> attack<00:04:56.639> again<00:04:57.090> out<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.389> it<00:04:57.509> so

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
cancel or even attack again out of it so

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.510 
cancel or even attack again out of it so
what<00:04:58.440> we've<00:04:58.560> done<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.740> built<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.190> system

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
what we've done is built that system

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.770 
what we've done is built that system
where<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.729> start<00:04:59.969> with<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.240> low<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.630> can

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
where you start with the low and you can

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.200 
where you start with the low and you can
go<00:05:00.900> to<00:05:00.960> always<00:05:01.320> move<00:05:01.469> up<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.770> chain<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.280> now

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
go to always move up the chain and now

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.399 
go to always move up the chain and now
you<00:05:03.270> start<00:05:03.659> working<00:05:03.930> in<00:05:04.050> things<00:05:04.320> like

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:04.409 
you start working in things like

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:05.360 
you start working in things like
launching<00:05:04.949> attack

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
launching attack

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.950 
launching attack
then<00:05:05.820> you<00:05:05.910> can<00:05:06.030> start<00:05:06.150> building<00:05:06.330> combos<00:05:06.840> out

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
then you can start building combos out

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.750 
then you can start building combos out
of<00:05:07.110> it<00:05:07.229> you<00:05:07.710> might<00:05:07.860> get<00:05:07.979> to<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.220> end<00:05:08.430> of<00:05:08.639> your

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
of it you might get to the end of your

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.310 
of it you might get to the end of your
very<00:05:09.030> last<00:05:09.210> hit<00:05:09.510> you've<00:05:09.540> hit<00:05:09.870> him<00:05:10.020> with<00:05:10.290> a

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
very last hit you've hit him with a

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.650 
very last hit you've hit him with a
strong<00:05:11.190> finisher<00:05:11.699> but<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:12.270> always<00:05:12.479> know<00:05:12.600> you

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660

I<00:06:46.289> never<00:06:46.500> thought<00:06:46.590> would<00:06:46.830> be<00:06:46.979> possible<00:06:47.120> but

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
I never thought would be possible but

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.180 
I never thought would be possible but
they<00:06:48.270> work<00:06:48.539> and<00:06:48.810> it's<00:06:48.990> just<00:06:49.169> sort<00:06:49.320> of<00:06:49.380> how<00:06:49.979> each

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
they work and it's just sort of how each

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.740 
they work and it's just sort of how each
person<00:06:50.550> just<00:06:50.669> represents<00:06:51.210> themselves<00:06:51.630> so

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
person just represents themselves so

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.270 
person just represents themselves so
really<00:06:52.020> what<00:06:52.229> I<00:06:52.260> want<00:06:52.470> to<00:06:52.560> see<00:06:52.680> is<00:06:52.919> just<00:06:53.130> that

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 
really what I want to see is just that

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.189 
really what I want to see is just that
self-expression<00:06:54.090> I'm<00:06:54.720> really<00:06:54.930> looking

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 
self-expression I'm really looking

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:58.040 
self-expression I'm really looking
forward<00:06:55.229> to<00:06:55.530> seeing<00:06:56.070> videos<00:06:56.910> of<00:06:57.120> like<00:06:57.300> combos

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
forward to seeing videos of like combos

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.320 
forward to seeing videos of like combos
or<00:06:58.080> ways<00:06:58.470> like<00:06:58.800> people<00:06:59.190> have<00:06:59.310> found<00:06:59.460> a<00:06:59.699> defeat
