00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the game as soon as you have enough

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.750 
the game as soon as you have enough
stone<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.989> wood<00:00:43.020> go<00:00:43.829> ahead<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.040> craft<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
stone and wood go ahead and craft a

stone and wood go ahead and craft a
stone<00:00:45.090> hatchet<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.770> will<00:00:46.980> allow<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.430> get

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
stone hatchet this will allow you to get

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.430 
stone hatchet this will allow you to get
wood<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.120> stone<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.420> metal<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> whole<00:00:49.260> lot

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
wood and stone and metal or a whole lot

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
wood and stone and metal or a whole lot
faster<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:50.039> well<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.460> kill<00:00:50.730> animals<00:00:51.210> such<00:00:51.329> as

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
faster as well as kill animals such as

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
faster as well as kill animals such as
the<00:00:51.539> boar<00:00:51.809> much<00:00:52.469> quicker<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.980> you'll<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.280> able

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
the boar much quicker so you'll be able

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.029 
the boar much quicker so you'll be able
to<00:00:53.460> have<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> higher<00:00:53.940> sustain<00:00:54.559> with<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> exes

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to have a higher sustain with the exes

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.310 
to have a higher sustain with the exes
whether<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.879> from<00:00:57.149> making<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> hatchet

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
whether you have from making the hatchet

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
whether you have from making the hatchet
go<00:00:58.530> ahead<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.739> make<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> campfire<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> go

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
go ahead and make a campfire so you go

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.760 
go ahead and make a campfire so you go
ahead<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.480> cook<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.870> raw<00:01:01.020> chicken<00:01:01.410> breast<00:01:01.649> so

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
ahead and cook the raw chicken breast so

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
ahead and cook the raw chicken breast so
you<00:01:01.859> won't<00:01:02.070> starve<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.520> death<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
you won't starve to death this is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
you won't starve to death this is
important<00:01:03.899> starvation<00:01:04.439> usually<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
important starvation usually one of the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
important starvation usually one of the
main<00:01:06.090> things<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.510> kills<00:01:06.840> people<00:01:06.900> because

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.399 
or they just don't have access to food
now<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:12.270> ahead<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.479> also<00:01:12.750> build<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.049> furnace

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
now go ahead and also build a furnace

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.070 
now go ahead and also build a furnace
and<00:01:13.590> put<00:01:14.490> all<00:01:14.670> your<00:01:14.909> materials<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
and put all your materials in there and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.810 
and put all your materials in there and
start<00:01:16.350> making<00:01:16.470> metal<00:01:16.950> fragments<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.670> is

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
start making metal fragments this is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.399 
start making metal fragments this is
important<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.299> your<00:01:18.479> need<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> metal<00:01:19.140> door

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
important because your need a metal door

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440 
important because your need a metal door
when<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> start<00:01:19.920> building<00:01:20.070> your<00:01:20.340> base<00:01:20.549> now

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
when you start building your base now

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.700 
when you start building your base now
once<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.780> have<00:01:21.869> all<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> stuff<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.500> middle

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
once you have all the stuff your middle

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.289 
once you have all the stuff your middle
Bay<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:22.860> you'll<00:01:23.100> need<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.580> foundation

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
Bay so you'll need you know a foundation

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.530 
Bay so you'll need you know a foundation
for<00:01:24.330> pillars<00:01:25.049> walls<00:01:25.860> ceilings<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
for pillars walls ceilings all that

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
for pillars walls ceilings all that
stuff<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:28.560> ahead<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.920> find<00:01:29.070> kind<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> little

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
stuff go ahead and find kind of a little

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.530 
stuff go ahead and find kind of a little
remote<00:01:30.000> location<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:32.030> suggest<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.420> in

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
remote location I I suggest like up in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
materials to build a bigger base go

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
materials to build a bigger base go
ahead<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> main<00:01:52.619> thing

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
ahead and do so that's the main thing

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.969 
ahead and do so that's the main thing
and<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.579> sure<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> secure<00:01:54.360> base<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.780> well

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
and make sure it's a secure base as well

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.649

so once you have constructed all the
wooden<00:01:57.990> parts<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.380> your<00:01:58.469> base<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
wooden parts of your base like the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.139 
wooden parts of your base like the
ceiling<00:01:59.310> everything<00:01:59.520> go<00:01:59.670> ahead<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.969> put<00:02:00.119> your

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
ceiling everything go ahead and put your

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.260 
ceiling everything go ahead and put your
metal<00:02:00.659> door<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.549> will<00:02:02.700> allow<00:02:02.909> people

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
