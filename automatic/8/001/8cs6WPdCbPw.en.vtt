and<00:01:09.990> actually<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.400> pretty

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and actually it's I think it's pretty

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.940 
and actually it's I think it's pretty
good<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.060> uh<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:13.020> about<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.560> inch<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
good it's uh it's about an inch and a

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.330 
good it's uh it's about an inch and a
half<00:01:15.409> inch<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.560> three<00:01:16.770> quarters<00:01:17.420> deep<00:01:19.130> on<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
half inch and three quarters deep on the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.450 
half inch and three quarters deep on the
whole<00:01:20.490> bottom<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> think<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.859 
whole bottom so I think I'm going to
leave<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.390> need<00:01:24.570> more<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
leave it like that and if I need more I

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.520 
leave it like that and if I need more I
can<00:01:25.200> always<00:01:25.350> add<00:01:25.619> more<00:01:26.149> over<00:01:27.149> time<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.020> want

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
can always add more over time if I want
