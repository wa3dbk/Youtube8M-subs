00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.490
 I'm going to need the shelf for 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.720
 that matters, I'm going to redecorate when 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.430
 you get to my father 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.750
 Spend a little decoration products 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.480
 so I came and they had 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.470
 accompanied I have come with my mother and with 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.470
 my brother wanted 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.440
 really enjoying the subject of what it is 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.970
 the interior decoration I love and 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.500
 I do not know what he told me so 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.510
 I like it because I have it so 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.510
 with them so to take 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.140
 one 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.140
 do not 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.100
 good 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.240
 really what is the gap that I have left 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.980
 available to decorate what is the 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.020
 walls and the wall of the bookshelf 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.790
 still but yes I bought things 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.710
 there will be the back that are your 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.820
 opening this is very very very very 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.470
 similar to the sanctity that we are going to 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.470
 buy but without strings the other time 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.880
 It is true 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.310
 enough weeks delaying the moment 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.310
 to come 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.730
 well nothing now I'm waiting because 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.920
 my mother has met a friend 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.560
 and there they are speaking talking talking and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.660
 I have a little press but good 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.430
 because we come from own to help me 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.560
 buy the nonsense that you have to 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.970
 wait for the term to end in 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.840
 shelf reality are a gift that I 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.850
 will my brother do for my birthday 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.110
 that is, the other day he was at home 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.550
 he was seeing that practically the 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.960
 old strategy that I had is already 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.890
 completely online but I'm happy 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.540
 because usually always usually 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.640
 give me things that I love and the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.990
 truth is the bookshelf I need it and I 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.130
 like it a lot and we have also been 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.900
 thinking about changing a little too 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.760
 because it is the approach to record the 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.890
 videos the not different and things like that 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.000
 so then I'm really enjoying it and 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.920
 the truth is that I appreciate a lot 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.020
 I very much appreciate the manager that half 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.130
 have the previous trust and it is that it is 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.810
 entering a little bit of hunger is 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.569
 Going forward to having a coffee because 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.430
 this morning we went to breakfast 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.469
 I 'm going to tell you to go to breakfast 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.569
 tomorrow away from home and I have taken the 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.310
 worst croissant that could have existed and 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.980
 the most human coffee in history and I 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.530
 has stayed with him 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.180
 that I want to give that taste to my mouth 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.830
 so they do not know if they started a 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.569
 service couple I bought that 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.060
 framework with composition I want that 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.879
 to 67 pictures because I wear to 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.860
 the plates that gave me vÃ©lez full 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:40.860
 please because they are very cool boy 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.420
 and then to break good here we are going to 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.650
 start assembling the shelf but for 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.930
 start to assemble it we have to remove 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.849
 he's here because he's going to go here so 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.870
 It will not help me to remove all 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.980
 released 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.980
 I do not know what 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.800

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.310
 making my shelves today I know 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.680
 the sincere thing has given me enough pain in 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.720
 remove from my brown wardrobe room 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.100

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.540
 years for a shelf registration 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.860

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.660

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.810

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.070
