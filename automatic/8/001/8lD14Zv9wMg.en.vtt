00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
a bunch of pieces and one of the reasons

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.310 
a bunch of pieces and one of the reasons
for<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.970> because<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.780> wanted<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.050> keep<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
for that is because we wanted to keep a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.169 
for that is because we wanted to keep a
really<00:00:10.530> dynamic<00:00:10.769> pose<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.610> him<00:00:11.730> because<00:00:11.849> you

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
really dynamic pose for him because you

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.910 
really dynamic pose for him because you
only<00:00:12.509> have<00:00:12.719> three<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.049> them<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.170> he's<00:00:13.320> pretty

head so we're going to clip these off
and<00:00:32.719> whenever<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:33.989> clipping<00:00:34.200> off<00:00:34.440> parts<00:00:34.770> like

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
and whenever I'm clipping off parts like

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.069 
and whenever I'm clipping off parts like
this<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> big<00:00:35.489> model<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.880> lot<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.120> times<00:00:36.329> I'll

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
this for a big model a lot of times I'll

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.660 
this for a big model a lot of times I'll
try<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> put<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.010> know<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> two<00:00:38.370> arms

close to you he'll start doing sanity
damage<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:11.070> pretty<00:01:11.280> harsh<00:01:14.509> now

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
damage just pretty harsh now

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.260 
damage just pretty harsh now
occasionally<00:01:15.780> you'll<00:01:16.140> find<00:01:16.520> where<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.030> sprue

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
occasionally you'll find where the sprue

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.940 
occasionally you'll find where the sprue
connects<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> figure<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.380> close

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
connects to the figure is really close

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
connects to the figure is really close
in<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.820> using<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> flat<00:01:21.479> edge<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
in and so using the flat edge of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.390 
in and so using the flat edge of the
pliers<00:01:22.200> against<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> model<00:01:23.130> doesn't<00:01:23.280> work

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
pliers against the model doesn't work

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.609 
pliers against the model doesn't work
very<00:01:23.520> well<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.330> can<00:01:24.450> flip<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.380> use

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
very well you can flip it around and use

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.300 
very well you can flip it around and use
the<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.939> other<00:01:27.090> end<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.540> then<00:01:28.229> afterward<00:01:29.130> go

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
the the other end and then afterward go

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
the the other end and then afterward go
back<00:01:29.490> with<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> flat<00:01:29.970> end<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.329> trim<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
back with the flat end and trim it up so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.640 
back with the flat end and trim it up so
that<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.710> nice<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> squared<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> here's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that it's nice and squared off so here's

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.640 
that it's nice and squared off so here's
his<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:35.130> loops<00:01:35.939> his<00:01:36.180> two<00:01:36.390> legs

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.840 

again<00:01:43.650> just<00:01:43.830> square<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.400> off

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.420 

and<00:01:47.850> last<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.450> least<00:01:48.690> we<00:01:48.870> have<00:01:49.130> his<00:01:50.130> head

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and last but not least we have his head

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:02.560 
and last but not least we have his head
in<00:01:50.700> his<00:01:50.820> hands

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.730 

all<00:02:03.140> right<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:03.500> there's<00:02:03.650> all<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.920> pieces<00:02:05.740> now

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
all right so there's all the pieces now

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.469 
all right so there's all the pieces now
one<00:02:06.890> thing<00:02:07.010> you'll<00:02:07.220> notice<00:02:07.850> about<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.360> night

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
one thing you'll notice about the night

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.779 
one thing you'll notice about the night
terror<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.679> much<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.490> some<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.670> the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
terror is that much like some of the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.300 
terror is that much like some of the
other<00:02:10.910> big<00:02:11.120> models<00:02:11.480> he<00:02:11.720> has<00:02:11.930> anchors<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:13.010> some

other big models he has anchors on some

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.699 
other big models he has anchors on some
of<00:02:13.430> his<00:02:13.580> arms<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.450> legs<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.440> basically

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
of his arms and legs and that basically

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.890 
of his arms and legs and that basically
is<00:02:15.920> where<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.550> plastic<00:02:16.940> on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.240> pan<00:02:17.450> flares

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
is where the plastic on the pan flares

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.780 
is where the plastic on the pan flares
out<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.110> little<00:02:18.290> bit<00:02:18.470> at<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.650> end<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.640> want

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
out a little bit at the end so you want

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.430 
out a little bit at the end so you want
to<00:02:19.850> put<00:02:20.000> those<00:02:20.120> pieces<00:02:20.330> into<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.900> body<00:02:21.140> before

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
to put those pieces into the body before

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.230 
to put those pieces into the body before
you<00:02:21.680> put<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.459> two<00:02:22.610> halves<00:02:22.820> of<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.030> body

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
you put the two halves of the body

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.290 
you put the two halves of the body
together<00:02:24.250> now<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.490> dry<00:02:25.670> fitting<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.120> body

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
together now in dry fitting the body

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.400 
together now in dry fitting the body
here<00:02:26.600> just<00:02:26.780> putting<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.020> two<00:02:27.140> pieces

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
here just putting the two pieces

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.390 
here just putting the two pieces
together<00:02:27.530> but<00:02:27.770> haven't<00:02:27.950> mean<00:02:28.040> glue<00:02:28.190> yet

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
together but haven't mean glue yet

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.980 
together but haven't mean glue yet
you'll<00:02:28.910> notice<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.270> there's<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.720> little<00:02:29.900> bit

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
you'll notice that there's a little bit

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.230 
you'll notice that there's a little bit
of<00:02:30.080> sprue<00:02:30.560> that's<00:02:31.100> on<00:02:31.310> one<00:02:31.550> side<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.060> body

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
of sprue that's on one side of the body

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.770 
of sprue that's on one side of the body
and<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.920> specifically<00:02:34.459> on<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:34.910> little<00:02:35.120> lip

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
and it's specifically on this little lip

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.160 
and it's specifically on this little lip
on<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.320> hip<00:02:36.790> so<00:02:37.790> if<00:02:38.090> you<00:02:38.270> go<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.050> can

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
on the hip so if you go in and you can

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.229 
on the hip so if you go in and you can
just<00:02:39.200> very<00:02:39.500> carefully<00:02:39.800> remove<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.970> little

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
just very carefully remove that little

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.510 
just very carefully remove that little
extra<00:02:41.600> bit<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.900> sprue<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:43.250> will<00:02:43.340> give<00:02:43.459> it

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
extra bit of sprue and that will give it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.790 
extra bit of sprue and that will give it
a<00:02:43.610> nice<00:02:43.760> tighter<00:02:44.330> cleaner<00:02:44.810> connection<00:02:45.350> and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
a nice tighter cleaner connection and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.900 
a nice tighter cleaner connection and
you're<00:02:45.950> gonna<00:02:46.040> do<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.220> with<00:02:46.459> your<00:02:46.580> clippers

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
you're gonna do that with your clippers

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.380 
you're gonna do that with your clippers
or<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.300> do<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.570> with<00:02:47.720> file<00:02:48.320> or<00:02:48.739> hoggish

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
or you can do that with file or hoggish

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.270 
or you can do that with file or hoggish
and<00:02:50.390> then<00:02:50.540> it's<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.750> much<00:02:50.900> cleaner<00:02:51.739> connection

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
and then it's a much cleaner connection

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.390 
and then it's a much cleaner connection
when<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:52.670> goes<00:02:52.790> together<00:02:53.019> like<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.400> all

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
when it goes together like that all

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.750 
when it goes together like that all
right

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
right

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.449 
right
so<00:02:56.450> let's<00:02:56.630> take<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.840> look<00:02:57.050> at<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.890> arms<00:02:58.280> and

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
so let's take a look at the arms and

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.100 
so let's take a look at the arms and
legs<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.940> we'll<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.180> dry<00:02:59.330> fit<00:02:59.570> them<00:02:59.660> on<00:02:59.780> here

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
legs and we'll just dry fit them on here

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.030 
legs and we'll just dry fit them on here
and<00:03:00.590> see<00:03:00.980> looks<00:03:01.880> like<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.150> one<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:03.410> aimed

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
and see looks like this one is aimed

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.830 
and see looks like this one is aimed
down<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.820> can<00:03:04.940> see<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.209> fits<00:03:05.660> pretty

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
down so you can see it fits pretty

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.690 
down so you can see it fits pretty
nicely<00:03:05.959> in<00:03:06.470> there<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.160> slot<00:03:07.370> if<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.549> put

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
nicely in there in the slot if you put

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.360 
nicely in there in the slot if you put
the<00:03:07.760> anchor<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:10.760> other<00:03:10.970> arm<00:03:12.370> actually

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the anchor in and the other arm actually

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.949 
the anchor in and the other arm actually
I<00:03:13.519> think<00:03:13.640> will<00:03:14.000> fit<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.239> little<00:03:14.540> better<00:03:14.750> if<00:03:14.840> we

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
I think will fit a little better if we

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.720 
I think will fit a little better if we
put<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.230> in<00:03:15.320> the<00:03:15.470> front<00:03:15.830> half<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.370> body<00:03:18.730> so

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
put it in the front half of the body so

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.670 
put it in the front half of the body so
we<00:03:19.850> dry<00:03:20.060> fit<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.420> in<00:03:20.540> there<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:21.290> looks<00:03:21.470> pretty

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
we dry fit it in there that looks pretty

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.009 
we dry fit it in there that looks pretty
good<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:23.530> so<00:03:25.180> my<00:03:26.180> dry<00:03:26.360> fitting<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.750> in<00:03:26.840> you<00:03:26.930> can

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
good and so my dry fitting it in you can

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.330 
good and so my dry fitting it in you can
see<00:03:27.290> how<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.530> pieces<00:03:27.739> are<00:03:27.950> gonna<00:03:28.040> fit

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
see how the pieces are gonna fit

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.190 
see how the pieces are gonna fit
together<00:03:28.640> so<00:03:29.360> when<00:03:29.600> the<00:03:29.720> two<00:03:29.840> halves<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
together so when the two halves of the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.400 
together so when the two halves of the
body<00:03:30.410> go<00:03:30.590> together<00:03:30.739> you<00:03:31.160> can<00:03:31.430> see<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:33.079> arms

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
body go together you can see the arms

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.800 
body go together you can see the arms
work<00:03:33.769> really<00:03:33.920> nicely<00:03:34.269> but<00:03:35.269> we<00:03:35.390> got<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.600> get<00:03:35.660> the

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
work really nicely but we got to get the

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.150 
work really nicely but we got to get the
the<00:03:36.260> legs<00:03:36.500> in<00:03:36.739> there<00:03:36.890> first<00:03:38.769> so<00:03:39.769> let's<00:03:39.980> go

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
the legs in there first so let's go

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.860 
the legs in there first so let's go
ahead<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.670> try<00:03:41.060> that

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
ahead and try that

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.170 
ahead and try that
now<00:03:42.860> with<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.160> legs<00:03:43.400> I'm<00:03:43.580> gonna<00:03:43.700> go<00:03:43.819> ahead<00:03:43.910> and

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
now with the legs I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.949 
now with the legs I'm gonna go ahead and
glue<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.930> feet<00:03:45.349> on<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.709> legs<00:03:46.660> before<00:03:47.660> I<00:03:47.690> glue

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
glue the feet on the legs before I glue

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.390 
glue the feet on the legs before I glue
the<00:03:48.050> legs<00:03:48.230> into<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.560> body<00:03:48.739> because<00:03:49.069> they<00:03:49.220> just

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
the legs into the body because they just

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.740 
the legs into the body because they just
have<00:03:49.550> individual<00:03:50.510> little<00:03:50.750> pins<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:52.750> little

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
have individual little pins so a little

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.580 
have individual little pins so a little
dab<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.230> glue<00:03:54.290> on<00:03:54.560> there<00:03:54.800> and<00:03:55.430> then<00:03:56.470> put<00:03:57.470> the

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
dab of glue on there and then put the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.710 
dab of glue on there and then put the
foot<00:03:57.860> on<00:03:57.890> you're<00:03:58.280> gonna<00:03:58.370> line<00:03:58.580> up<00:03:58.610> the<00:03:59.360> pegs

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
foot on you're gonna line up the pegs

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.289 
foot on you're gonna line up the pegs
with<00:04:00.049> one<00:04:00.230> another<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.799> you<00:04:00.830> can<00:04:00.950> get<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.069> nice

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
with one another so you can get a nice

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:07.869 
with one another so you can get a nice
solid<00:04:02.299> connection<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:07.340> wrong<00:04:07.459> foot<00:04:07.640> let<00:04:07.819> me

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
solid connection the wrong foot let me

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.940 
solid connection the wrong foot let me
take<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.030> little<00:04:08.620> open<00:04:09.620> yep<00:04:09.769> there<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:09.980> go<00:04:11.950> oops

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
I got needed just a little more glue in

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:24.730 
I got needed just a little more glue in
there<00:04:21.520> nice<00:04:22.520> connection<00:04:23.380> I'll<00:04:24.380> do<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.590> same

you<00:04:29.510> can<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:29.750> wipe<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.139> little<00:04:30.560> bit<00:04:30.650> off<00:04:30.800> on<00:04:30.950> a

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
you can just wipe a little bit off on a

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:38.150 
you can just wipe a little bit off on a
napkin<00:04:31.220> a<00:04:31.400> piece<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.669> paper

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.370 

alright<00:04:40.590> okay<00:04:41.590> so<00:04:41.830> now<00:04:42.190> let's<00:04:42.370> go<00:04:42.490> ahead<00:04:42.610> and

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
alright okay so now let's go ahead and

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.960 
alright okay so now let's go ahead and
dry<00:04:44.380> fit<00:04:44.680> those<00:04:45.690> two<00:04:46.690> legs<00:04:47.050> into<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> body<00:04:47.970> it

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
dry fit those two legs into the body it

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.400 
dry fit those two legs into the body it
looks<00:04:49.180> like<00:04:49.270> it's<00:04:49.420> gonna<00:04:49.510> fit<00:04:49.780> pretty<00:04:50.290> nicely

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
looks like it's gonna fit pretty nicely

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:56.010 
looks like it's gonna fit pretty nicely
in<00:04:50.860> there<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:54.450> this<00:04:55.450> one<00:04:55.600> looks<00:04:55.780> like<00:04:55.840> it's

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
in there and this one looks like it's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.870 
in there and this one looks like it's
not<00:04:56.200> an<00:04:56.440> anchor<00:04:56.860> so<00:04:57.160> we<00:04:57.370> don't<00:04:57.490> have<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.730> worry

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
not an anchor so we don't have to worry

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.220 
not an anchor so we don't have to worry
about<00:04:57.940> putting<00:04:58.300> that<00:04:58.390> on<00:04:58.570> just<00:04:58.840> yet<00:04:59.020> we<00:04:59.110> can

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
about putting that on just yet we can

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.350 
about putting that on just yet we can
put<00:04:59.320> that<00:04:59.410> on<00:04:59.470> afterward<00:05:00.030> so<00:05:01.030> we'll<00:05:01.240> go<00:05:01.330> ahead

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
put that on afterward so we'll go ahead

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.120 
put that on afterward so we'll go ahead
and<00:05:01.540> put<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.720> little<00:05:01.960> bit<00:05:02.110> of<00:05:02.230> glue<00:05:02.440> for<00:05:02.680> each<00:05:03.010> of

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
and put a little bit of glue for each of

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.930 
and put a little bit of glue for each of
those<00:05:03.420> anchors<00:05:04.420> is<00:05:04.570> gonna<00:05:04.750> go<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:06.160> also

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
those anchors is gonna go and also

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.490 
those anchors is gonna go and also
around<00:05:07.060> just<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:09.100> edge<00:05:10.140> trim<00:05:11.140> of<00:05:11.470> the

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
around just the the edge trim of the

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.040 
around just the the edge trim of the
body<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.190> two<00:05:12.340> halves<00:05:13.240> can<00:05:13.600> fit<00:05:13.900> together

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
body so the two halves can fit together

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.920 
body so the two halves can fit together
nicely<00:05:15.120> we'll<00:05:16.120> use<00:05:16.270> our<00:05:16.360> little<00:05:16.600> board<00:05:16.810> here

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
nicely we'll use our little board here

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.540 
nicely we'll use our little board here
and<00:05:17.880> drop<00:05:18.880> that<00:05:19.090> in

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
and drop that in

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.490 
and drop that in
and<00:05:20.639> we'll<00:05:20.940> just<00:05:21.030> put<00:05:21.300> the<00:05:21.509> top<00:05:21.960> half<00:05:22.169> right<00:05:22.379> on

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
and we'll just put the top half right on

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.879 
and we'll just put the top half right on
the<00:05:22.560> bottom<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:24.169> pinch<00:05:25.169> it<00:05:25.289> together<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:25.860> that

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
the bottom and pinch it together so that

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.990 
the bottom and pinch it together so that
it's<00:05:26.129> a<00:05:26.400> nice<00:05:27.150> solid<00:05:28.050> connection<00:05:28.430> and<00:05:29.430> we'll

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
it's a nice solid connection and we'll

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
it's a nice solid connection and we'll
just<00:05:30.150> hold<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:30.389> for<00:05:30.509> a<00:05:30.539> minute<00:05:30.659> while<00:05:30.900> it's

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
just hold it for a minute while it's

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.960 
just hold it for a minute while it's
gluing<00:05:31.349> now<00:05:31.979> again<00:05:32.250> you<00:05:32.370> can<00:05:32.400> use<00:05:32.699> either

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
gluing now again you can use either

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.510 
gluing now again you can use either
super<00:05:33.750> glue<00:05:33.900> or<00:05:34.139> a<00:05:35.069> plastic<00:05:35.849> cement<00:05:36.240> for<00:05:36.569> this

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
super glue or a plastic cement for this

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.689 
super glue or a plastic cement for this
both<00:05:38.520> work<00:05:38.759> pretty<00:05:38.970> well<00:05:40.280> well<00:05:41.280> go<00:05:41.370> ahead<00:05:41.490> put

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
both work pretty well well go ahead put

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.369 
both work pretty well well go ahead put
any<00:05:41.879> other<00:05:41.970> leg<00:05:42.240> now<00:05:42.479> super<00:05:42.990> glue<00:05:43.110> dries<00:05:43.349> a

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379 
any other leg now super glue dries a

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.529 
any other leg now super glue dries a
little<00:05:43.710> bit<00:05:43.800> faster<00:05:44.220> so<00:05:44.460> that's<00:05:45.120> kind<00:05:45.419> of

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
little bit faster so that's kind of

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.760 
little bit faster so that's kind of
helpful<00:05:46.879> plastic<00:05:47.879> cement<00:05:48.060> actually<00:05:48.960> bonds

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
helpful plastic cement actually bonds

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.439 
helpful plastic cement actually bonds
the<00:05:49.889> two<00:05:50.039> pieces<00:05:50.400> together<00:05:50.580> two<00:05:51.180> pieces<00:05:51.300> of

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
the two pieces together two pieces of

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.300 
the two pieces together two pieces of
plastic<00:05:51.599> together<00:05:51.930> so<00:05:52.650> it's<00:05:52.860> got<00:05:52.979> a<00:05:53.009> stronger

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
plastic together so it's got a stronger

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.999 
plastic together so it's got a stronger
connection<00:05:53.580> over<00:05:53.819> time<00:05:54.590> so<00:05:55.590> we'll<00:05:55.710> just<00:05:55.830> hold

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
connection over time so we'll just hold

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.620 
connection over time so we'll just hold
that<00:05:56.190> leg<00:05:56.430> in<00:05:56.610> there<00:05:56.759> for<00:05:57.000> a<00:05:57.030> second<00:05:57.360> for<00:05:57.539> it<00:05:57.569> to

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
that leg in there for a second for it to

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.860 
that leg in there for a second for it to
glue<00:05:59.060> and<00:06:00.060> you<00:06:00.120> can<00:06:00.240> see<00:06:00.389> there's<00:06:00.659> a<00:06:00.720> little

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
glue and you can see there's a little

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.540 
glue and you can see there's a little
bit<00:06:00.960> of<00:06:01.050> flash<00:06:01.319> left<00:06:01.680> on<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:01.949> pin<00:06:02.190> for<00:06:02.430> the

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
bit of flash left on the pin for the

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.649 
bit of flash left on the pin for the
head<00:06:02.759> so<00:06:03.389> I'm<00:06:03.479> just<00:06:03.599> gonna<00:06:03.720> take<00:06:03.960> my<00:06:04.220> hobby

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
head so I'm just gonna take my hobby

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.149 
head so I'm just gonna take my hobby
Clippers<00:06:06.659> and<00:06:07.080> just<00:06:07.319> clip<00:06:07.560> off<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.770> little<00:06:08.009> bit

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
Clippers and just clip off a little bit

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.760 
Clippers and just clip off a little bit
of<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.370> and<00:06:09.270> dry<00:06:09.930> fitting<00:06:10.199> the<00:06:10.409> head<00:06:10.590> on

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
of that and dry fitting the head on

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.860 
of that and dry fitting the head on
looks<00:06:11.039> like<00:06:11.220> that<00:06:11.759> it's<00:06:12.030> got<00:06:12.180> a<00:06:12.240> nice<00:06:12.360> clean

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
looks like that it's got a nice clean

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.959 
looks like that it's got a nice clean
easy<00:06:13.139> fit<00:06:13.409> so<00:06:14.340> we're<00:06:14.460> going<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.669> put<00:06:14.789> a<00:06:14.819> little

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:14.969 
easy fit so we're going to put a little

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:22.840 
easy fit so we're going to put a little
blue<00:06:15.240> on<00:06:15.270> that

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.390 

all<00:06:23.330> right<00:06:23.510> and<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.200> last<00:06:24.380> bit<00:06:24.650> is<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:25.370> little

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400
