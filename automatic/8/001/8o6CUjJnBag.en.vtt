mean I breath I was eating the whole

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.430 
mean I breath I was eating the whole
argument<00:00:53.730> about<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.660> there<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.899> go<00:00:54.930> because

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
argument about so there you go because

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529

of<00:00:55.469> 911<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.489> won't<00:00:56.670> let<00:00:56.850> me<00:00:56.910> plug<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.360> my

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
of 911 they won't let me plug in my

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.010 
of 911 they won't let me plug in my
electric<00:00:58.109> car<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.770> DWP<00:00:59.370> Haynes<00:00:59.640> plant<00:01:00.090> so

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
electric car in a DWP Haynes plant so

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.260 
electric car in a DWP Haynes plant so
whatever<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.010> means<00:01:02.190> meanwhile<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:03.059> these

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
whatever that means meanwhile all these

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.820 
whatever that means meanwhile all these
dangerous<00:01:03.870> gasoline<00:01:04.500> cars<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.280> right<00:01:05.580> by

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
dangerous gasoline cars going right by

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.789 
dangerous gasoline cars going right by
so<00:01:07.830> i<00:01:08.580> guess<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.510> electric<00:01:09.840> car<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.500> too

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so i guess the electric car is just too

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.750 
so i guess the electric car is just too
darn<00:01:11.100> dangerous<00:01:12.920> but<00:01:13.920> really<00:01:14.280> each<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.640> those

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
darn dangerous but really each of those

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.270 
darn dangerous but really each of those
gasoline<00:01:15.420> cars<00:01:15.780> has<00:01:16.229> let's<00:01:16.590> say<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> has<00:01:16.890> ten

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
gasoline cars has let's say it has ten

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940 
gasoline cars has let's say it has ten
gallons<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.820> gas<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.330> its<00:01:18.479> gas<00:01:18.720> tank<00:01:19.049> there's

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
gallons of gas in its gas tank there's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
gallons of gas in its gas tank there's
thirty<00:01:20.369> five<00:01:20.610> kilowatt<00:01:21.119> hours<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> electrical

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
thirty five kilowatt hours of electrical

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.810 
thirty five kilowatt hours of electrical
energy<00:01:22.140> equivalent<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> each<00:01:23.189> gallon<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.640> gas

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
energy equivalent in each gallon of gas

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.429 
energy equivalent in each gallon of gas
so<00:01:24.659> 10<00:01:24.960> gallons<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.530> gas<00:01:25.740> has<00:01:26.299> 350<00:01:27.439> kilowatt

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
so 10 gallons of gas has 350 kilowatt

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.219 
so 10 gallons of gas has 350 kilowatt
hours<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> electrical<00:01:29.430> power<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
hours of electrical power in it and the

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.679 
hours of electrical power in it and the
electric<00:01:31.860> car<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.579> i'm<00:01:32.700> driving<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
electric car here that i'm driving the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.530 
electric car here that i'm driving the
most<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.170> holes<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.799> 26<00:01:35.640> kilowatt-hours<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
most in holes is 26 kilowatt-hours the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.660 
most in holes is 26 kilowatt-hours the
energy<00:01:36.900> equivalent<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.500> two<00:01:38.100> thirds<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.579> a

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
energy equivalent of two thirds of a

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
energy equivalent of two thirds of a
gallon<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.060> gas<00:01:39.299> over<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.470> we<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
gallon of gas over here we see the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.750 
gallon of gas over here we see the
lowest<00:01:41.490> originals<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.090> there's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.299> camry

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
lowest originals and there's a camry

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.390 
lowest originals and there's a camry
yeah<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:44.390> don't<00:01:44.540> think<00:01:44.690> there's<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.020> CR<00:01:45.530> but

I don't think either one of those can

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.770 
I don't think either one of those can
plug<00:01:47.900> in<00:01:48.110> either<00:01:48.790> and<00:01:49.790> out<00:01:49.970> of<00:01:50.000> all<00:01:50.210> these<00:01:50.420> cars

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
gas at all and we plug it in to charge

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.880 
gas at all and we plug it in to charge
you<00:03:32.900> get<00:03:33.799> per<00:03:33.920> charge<00:03:34.190> 120<00:03:35.090> miles<00:03:35.530> 120<00:03:36.530> miles

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
per charge yeah and then then we can

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.220 
per charge yeah and then then we can
plug<00:03:40.940> it<00:03:41.060> in<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.660> if<00:03:41.780> we<00:03:41.900> won't<00:03:42.080> go

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
plug it in you know if we won't go

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.160 
plug it in you know if we won't go
further<00:03:42.470> away<00:03:43.090> but<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:46.459> is<00:03:46.640> 4-cylinder<00:03:47.510> 2.4

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
further away but this is 4-cylinder 2.4

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
cause you know if it had a plug I can

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.699 
cause you know if it had a plug I can
may<00:03:54.700> be<00:03:54.760> compromised<00:03:55.420> if<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.750> had<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.900> plush<00:03:56.230> at

will be all electric been you know what
well<00:04:15.610> there's<00:04:15.790> plug-in<00:04:16.239> hybrids<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:17.049> mean<00:04:17.829> if<00:04:17.950> I

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
well there's plug-in hybrids I mean if I

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.860 
well there's plug-in hybrids I mean if I
put<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> gas<00:04:18.519> engine<00:04:18.820> on<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.299> route<00:04:19.540> that

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
put a gas engine on that route that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.420 
put a gas engine on that route that
would<00:04:19.989> be<00:04:20.169> ugly<00:04:20.620> enough<00:04:20.829> now<00:04:21.040> I'm<00:04:21.100> sure<00:04:21.310> you

would be ugly enough now I'm sure you
can<00:04:21.639> customize<00:04:22.419> something<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.840> that<00:04:22.990> electro

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
can customize something to that electro

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.860 
can customize something to that electro
you<00:04:23.770> can<00:04:23.919> customize<00:04:24.700> some<00:04:25.300> kind<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.540> plug<00:04:25.720> in

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
you can customize some kind of plug in

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.680 
you can customize some kind of plug in
on<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.970> again<00:04:28.450> this<00:04:28.600> is<00:04:28.660> what<00:04:28.870> we<00:04:28.990> have<00:04:29.020> a
