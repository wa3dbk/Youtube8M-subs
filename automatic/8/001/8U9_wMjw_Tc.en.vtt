00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
hi - this is my review of the lego power

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.799 
hi - this is my review of the lego power
functions<00:00:06.890> set<00:00:08.090> eight<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.510> nine<00:00:09.809> three<00:00:11.809> and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
functions set eight to nine three and

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.939 
functions set eight to nine three and
it's<00:00:13.349> requested<00:00:14.009> by<00:00:14.219> totally<00:00:14.880> Peyton<00:00:15.800> so<00:00:16.800> yeah

it's not really going to be a review but
just<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.770> instructions<00:00:20.430> video<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.480> like

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
just like instructions video and like

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.340 
just like instructions video and like
what<00:00:21.900> comes<00:00:22.109> with<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.650> stuff<00:00:23.210> so<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:25.109> comes

what comes with it and stuff so it comes
with<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.619> few<00:00:25.859> gears<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.640> axles<00:00:27.410> like<00:00:29.150> three

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
with a few gears and axles like three

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.139 
with a few gears and axles like three
gears<00:00:30.539> two<00:00:31.579> connectors<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.079> an<00:00:34.079> axle<00:00:34.550> I<00:00:35.550> got<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
gears two connectors and an axle I got a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.650 
gears two connectors and an axle I got a
lot<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.480> extra<00:00:36.960> pieces<00:00:37.170> done<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:38.370> me<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.850> got<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
lot of extra pieces done for me I got a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.000 
lot of extra pieces done for me I got a
lot<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> extra<00:00:40.379> pieces<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> gear<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.640> yeah

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
lot of extra pieces of the gear so yeah

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.350 
lot of extra pieces of the gear so yeah
so<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.129> comes<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.079> motor<00:00:46.910> lights<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
so it comes with the and motor lights a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.220 
so it comes with the and motor lights a
switch<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:50.160> battery<00:00:50.430> box<00:00:50.719> no<00:00:51.719> batteries

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
switch and the battery box no batteries

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:09.830 
switch and the battery box no batteries
included<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.480> box<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> just<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.199> that

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770 

that's<00:01:10.840> what<00:01:11.050> comes<00:01:11.260> with<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:12.390> okay<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.450> you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
that's what comes with it okay so you

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.750 
that's what comes with it okay so you
would<00:01:13.870> need<00:01:16.620> six<00:01:17.620> to<00:01:19.710> six<00:01:20.710> double-a<00:01:21.220> batteries

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
would need six to six double-a batteries

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.060 
would need six to six double-a batteries
both<00:01:22.450> sides<00:01:24.360> so<00:01:25.360> that's<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:29.020> that's<00:01:29.440> too

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
both sides so that's I think that's too

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.370 
both sides so that's I think that's too
like<00:01:30.880> too<00:01:31.720> much<00:01:31.930> but<00:01:32.440> it's<00:01:33.190> really<00:01:33.460> worth<00:01:33.640> it

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
like too much but it's really worth it

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.310 
like too much but it's really worth it
so<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.560> battery<00:01:35.890> box<00:01:36.100> is<00:01:36.280> just<00:01:36.310> like<00:01:36.640> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.150 

switch<00:01:41.320> on<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.970> LED<00:01:43.090> if<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.990> turn<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.259> on<00:01:44.350> that

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
switch on the LED if you turn it on that

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.140 
switch on the LED if you turn it on that
LED<00:01:45.670> light<00:01:46.270> will<00:01:46.450> turn<00:01:46.600> on<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.470> there's<00:01:48.150> so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
LED light will turn on so there's so

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.450 
LED light will turn on so there's so
there's<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:50.410> can<00:01:50.560> turn<00:01:50.710> it<00:01:50.830> at<00:01:50.890> this<00:01:51.009> side<00:01:51.250> or

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
there's you can turn it at this side or

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.930 
there's you can turn it at this side or
that<00:01:51.520> side<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:53.110> controls<00:01:53.650> whether<00:01:54.490> your

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
that side and it controls whether your

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.889 
that side and it controls whether your
motor<00:01:55.210> goes<00:01:55.509> left<00:01:55.869> over<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.470> right<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:58.149> turn

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
motor goes left over the right so turn

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.900 
motor goes left over the right so turn
it<00:01:58.930> this<00:01:59.140> way<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.470> light<00:01:59.619> turns<00:01:59.860> on<00:02:00.130> turn<00:02:00.790> it

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
it this way the light turns on turn it

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.430 
it this way the light turns on turn it
the<00:02:00.970> other<00:02:01.180> way<00:02:01.300> the<00:02:01.330> light<00:02:01.690> turns<00:02:01.930> on<00:02:02.110> and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
the other way the light turns on and

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.680 
the other way the light turns on and
then<00:02:03.009> turn<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.490> in<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.850> middle<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.479> turns

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
then turn it in the middle and it turns

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.729 
then turn it in the middle and it turns
off<00:02:04.920> here<00:02:05.920> is<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:08.250> place<00:02:09.250> where<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:09.580> plug<00:02:09.820> the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
off here is the place where you plug the

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.100 
off here is the place where you plug the
the<00:02:11.739> wires<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.489> your<00:02:12.690> extensions<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:13.959> the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the wires for your extensions like the

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.710 
the wires for your extensions like the
lights<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.530> motor<00:02:17.280> let's<00:02:18.280> start<00:02:19.180> off<00:02:19.299> with

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
lights and motor let's start off with

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:28.440 
lights and motor let's start off with
the<00:02:19.840> motor

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.170 

so<00:02:29.450> you<00:02:29.510> can<00:02:29.870> put<00:02:30.490> so<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.520> can<00:02:31.760> put<00:02:31.970> something

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
so you can put so I can put something

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:45.630 
so you can put so I can put something
here<00:02:32.510> like<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:41.500> putting<00:02:42.500> an<00:02:42.560> axle<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:44.020> then

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
here like that putting an axle and then

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:55.980 
here like that putting an axle and then
here<00:02:46.640> you<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:46.820> see<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.210> plug<00:02:53.590> see<00:02:54.590> that

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
here you can see the plug see that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:27.520 
here you can see the plug see that
so<00:02:56.990> to<00:02:57.050> basically<00:02:57.530> plug<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.010> in<00:03:26.410> enough<00:03:27.410> you

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
so to basically plug it in enough you

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:51.479 
so to basically plug it in enough you
can<00:03:27.709> see<00:03:27.860> that<00:03:28.070> place

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:04:00.729 

you<00:03:52.489> can<00:03:52.700> touch<00:03:53.150> all<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:57.129> booths<00:03:58.129> a<00:03:58.430> close<00:03:59.739> and

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
you can touch all the booths a close and

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.300 
you can touch all the booths a close and
you<00:04:00.950> can<00:04:01.069> also<00:04:01.690> overlap<00:04:02.829> like<00:04:03.829> you<00:04:03.980> can<00:04:04.129> put

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
you can also overlap like you can put

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.390 
you can also overlap like you can put
both<00:04:04.640> lights<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:06.200> motor<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.940> switch<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.629> on

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
both lights and motor and switch it on

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:44.100 
both lights and motor and switch it on
but<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.609> mass<00:04:10.849> is<00:04:11.209> too<00:04:11.390> more<00:04:12.290> than<00:04:12.819> two

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.270 

and<00:04:45.110> then<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.880> goes<00:04:47.090> on<00:04:47.330> into<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.690> middle<00:04:48.280> when

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
and then it goes on into the middle when

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.880 
and then it goes on into the middle when
there's<00:04:49.550> this<00:04:49.700> black<00:04:50.030> piece<00:04:50.590> it's<00:04:51.590> just<00:04:51.680> a

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
there's this black piece it's just a

00:04:51.890 --> 00:05:05.550 
there's this black piece it's just a
shoebox

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:35.730 

oh<00:05:31.650> yeah<00:05:32.740> for<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.520> lights<00:05:34.230> if<00:05:35.230> we<00:05:35.380> turn<00:05:35.560> both

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
oh yeah for the lights if we turn both

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
oh yeah for the lights if we turn both
sides<00:05:36.630> both<00:05:37.630> opens<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:39.220> it<00:05:39.310> doesn't<00:05:39.610> really

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
sides both opens so it doesn't really
