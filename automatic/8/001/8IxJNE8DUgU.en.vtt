00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
can need the turbo roid from the you can

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.590 
can need the turbo roid from the you can
place<00:01:03.399> then

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.210 

chips<00:01:08.290> fall<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:09.040> format<00:01:09.610> shape

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.500 

they<00:01:14.220> make<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.830> police<00:01:16.830> stop<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> police<00:01:18.000> car

they make the police stop a police car

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.830 
they make the police stop a police car
parts<00:01:21.590> would<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> fit<00:01:22.920> together<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
parts would you fit together like so and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
parts would you fit together like so and
I've<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> top<00:01:28.260> a<00:01:28.290> pin<00:01:28.620> out<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> then

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.620 

legend<00:01:34.079> see

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.600 

so<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.200> looks<00:01:37.350> like<00:01:37.409> fat

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
so it looks like fat

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:47.790 
so it looks like fat
then<00:01:40.210> at<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:43.140> -<00:01:44.140> like<00:01:44.470> dinosaur<00:01:45.310> arms<00:01:46.060> or<00:01:46.800> claw

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
then at the - like dinosaur arms or claw

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.770 
then at the - like dinosaur arms or claw
parts<00:01:48.630> drop<00:01:49.630> garage<00:01:50.110> form<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.470> claw<00:01:51.780> which

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
parts drop garage form of claw which

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.969 
parts drop garage form of claw which
you've<00:01:53.460> fit<00:01:54.460> onto<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.910> turbo<00:01:55.690> roid<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.260> looks

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
you've fit onto the turbo roid so looks

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.350 
you've fit onto the turbo roid so looks
like<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:58.650> which<00:01:59.650> you<00:01:59.860> then<00:02:00.070> can<00:02:00.910> fit<00:02:01.180> onto

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
like that which you then can fit onto

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:11.890 
like that which you then can fit onto
here

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.680 

surely<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.769> fold<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.129> arm<00:02:13.610> parts<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.480> on

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
surely you can fold the arm parts out on

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.809 
surely you can fold the arm parts out on
here<00:02:14.989> so<00:02:15.409> it's<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:16.069> top<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.519> torso

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
here so it's the top of the torso

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.500 
here so it's the top of the torso
clapping<00:02:17.420> facts<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.840> thoughts

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.009 

then<00:02:23.610> put<00:02:24.610> one<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.090> these<00:02:25.349> onto<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:27.060> back<00:02:28.060> of

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
then put one of these onto the back of

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.880 
then put one of these onto the back of
the

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.300 

the<00:02:32.630> turbo<00:02:33.630> roids<00:02:33.840> who<00:02:34.050> resembles<00:02:34.920> Wow<00:02:37.310> then

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the turbo roids who resembles Wow then

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.630 
the turbo roids who resembles Wow then
for<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> right<00:02:39.240> arm<00:02:39.450> you'll<00:02:39.660> need<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:41.250> turbo

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
for the right arm you'll need the turbo

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.199 
for the right arm you'll need the turbo
roid<00:02:41.819> from<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:43.800> build<00:02:44.069> up<00:02:44.280> or<00:02:44.520> what<00:02:45.090> the

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
roid from you can build up or what the

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.820 
roid from you can build up or what the
over<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.870> Paco<00:02:46.200> haven't<00:02:46.560> used<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:47.450> you

with a lot trial and error you should
then<00:04:38.240> go<00:04:38.420> ship<00:04:38.840> the

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:48.079 
putz onto the arm so it looks like that

full Heiser and you should end up with
something<00:05:58.549> that<00:05:59.549> resembles<00:05:59.999> a<00:06:00.329> big<00:06:01.259> Godzilla
