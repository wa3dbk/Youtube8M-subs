to go to that channel I'll be making
playthroughs<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> reason<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.180> got<00:00:42.210> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.299 
playthroughs and the reason I got this
anyways<00:00:42.960> is<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> has<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.920> s-video

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
anyways is because it has the s-video

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.360 
anyways is because it has the s-video
plug<00:00:44.700> which<00:00:45.329> will<00:00:45.590> plug<00:00:46.590> into<00:00:46.770> my<00:00:46.950> daesil

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370
