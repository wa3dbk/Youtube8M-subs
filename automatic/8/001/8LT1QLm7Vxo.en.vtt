I<00:00:00.060> guess<00:00:00.329> it's<00:00:00.690> time<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:01.020> know<00:00:01.140> quickly<00:00:01.290> Oh

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
I guess it's time to know quickly Oh

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.249 
I guess it's time to know quickly Oh

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.340 
speedtest in between galaxy a5 the Alpha
and<00:00:04.529> these<00:00:05.339> four<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.450> s5<00:00:06.779> mini<00:00:06.810> so

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
and these four and the s5 mini so

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.500 
and these four and the s5 mini so
stopping<00:00:07.859> for<00:00:08.130> 10<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.400> these<00:00:08.849> two<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.389> a5

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
stopping for 10 in these two and the a5

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.070 
stopping for 10 in these two and the a5
and<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.139> ACE<00:00:10.260> 4<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.830> then<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.960> quarrel<00:00:12.960> but

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
and the ACE 4 and then a quarrel but

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.560 
and the ACE 4 and then a quarrel but
forget<00:00:13.500> Hertz<00:00:13.679> 87<00:00:14.429> instead<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> s5<00:00:15.540> mini

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
forget Hertz 87 instead of the s5 mini

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.130 
forget Hertz 87 instead of the s5 mini
and<00:00:15.929> then<00:00:16.139> an<00:00:16.379> octa-core<00:00:17.130> exynos<00:00:17.880> 5<00:00:18.150> process

and then an octa-core exynos 5 process

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.859 
and then an octa-core exynos 5 process

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
of course 8:15 and course a 7 inside of

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.429 
of course 8:15 and course a 7 inside of
the<00:00:22.730> galaxy<00:00:23.730> alpha<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.210> let's<00:00:25.019> do<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.230> video

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the galaxy alpha so let's do this video

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.089 
the galaxy alpha so let's do this video
hopefully<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.340> won't<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.730> too<00:00:26.970> hard<00:00:28.099> but

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
hopefully this won't be too hard but

00:00:29.099 --> 00:01:04.130 
hopefully this won't be too hard but
they<00:00:29.250> all<00:00:29.460> are<00:00:29.820> different<00:00:30.269> sizes<00:00:30.720> so<00:01:03.140> so

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they all are different sizes so so

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.630 
they all are different sizes so so
usually<00:01:04.439> something<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.129> usually<00:01:05.460> pretty

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
usually something is usually pretty

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.030 
usually something is usually pretty
quick<00:01:05.939> at<00:01:06.180> optimizing<00:01:06.720> software<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.650> can

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
quick at optimizing software so you can

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.500 
quick at optimizing software so you can
that<00:01:11.340> that's<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.000> probably<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> reason

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that that's what the probably the reason

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.710 
that that's what the probably the reason
why<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:13.110> see<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> latest<00:01:13.710> galaxy<00:01:14.549> a5<00:01:14.790> be

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
why you can see the latest galaxy a5 be

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.140 
why you can see the latest galaxy a5 be
a<00:01:15.750> little<00:01:15.930> bit<00:01:16.049> faster<00:01:16.229> than<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> ace<00:01:16.740> 4

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
a little bit faster than the ace 4

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.010 
a little bit faster than the ace 4
because<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.540> its<00:01:19.020> new<00:01:19.259> software<00:01:20.720> Wow

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because this is its new software Wow

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.899 
because this is its new software Wow
this<00:01:22.200> one<00:01:22.409> still<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.040> little<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.369> laggy<00:01:23.580> here

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
this one still a little bit laggy here

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.410 
this one still a little bit laggy here
yes<00:01:24.450> fine<00:01:24.689> mini<00:01:25.340> but<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.610> also<00:01:26.909> custom

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
yes fine mini but this is also custom

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
yes fine mini but this is also custom
thing<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.990> Rafael<00:01:28.290> Pinto<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.770> have

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
thing and Rafael Pinto that I have

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.410 
thing and Rafael Pinto that I have
installed<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:30.299> top<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.820> that's<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
installed on top of it that's all the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.289 
installed on top of it that's all the
reason<00:01:33.840> why<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.920> year<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.369> device<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.210> if

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
reason why this year about device and if

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.200 
reason why this year about device and if
it<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.630> me<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> cut<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:39.030> one

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it was for me to get the cut this one

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.719 
it was for me to get the cut this one
was<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> winner<00:01:39.600> right<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.700> but<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
was the winner right I think so but I

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.359 
was the winner right I think so but I
think<00:01:41.850> these<00:01:42.689> two<00:01:42.960> very<00:01:43.470> very<00:01:43.590> close<00:01:43.979> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
think these two very very close so

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300 
think these two very very close so
that's<00:01:45.149> also<00:01:45.689> pretty<00:01:46.020> interesting<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.130> yeah

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that's also pretty interesting so yeah

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.010 
that's also pretty interesting so yeah
quickly<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.790> speed<00:01:48.090> test<00:01:48.360> there<00:01:48.540> did<00:01:48.840> some

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
quickly of speed test there did some

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.600 
quickly of speed test there did some
other<00:01:49.200> videos<00:01:49.619> checking<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.280> some<00:01:50.460> other

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
other videos checking out some other

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.030 
other videos checking out some other
things<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:52.110> check<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.350> out<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.890> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
things you can check that out if you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.429 
things you can check that out if you
want<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.610> youtube<00:01:53.970> channel<00:01:54.140> that<00:01:55.140> could<00:01:55.320> be

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
want on my youtube channel that could be

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410 
want on my youtube channel that could be
some<00:01:55.649> fun<00:01:56.130> things<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:57.060> one's<00:01:57.270> still

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
some fun things to do this one's still

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.080 
some fun things to do this one's still
laggy<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.229> pretty<00:01:58.439> interesting<00:01:58.700> but<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.969> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
laggy it's pretty interesting but it's a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.080 
laggy it's pretty interesting but it's a
quad-core<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.409> seven<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.460> four<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.909> mean

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
quad-core or a seven one four I mean

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.730 
quad-core or a seven one four I mean
it's<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.049> impressive<00:02:04.799> at<00:02:05.100> all

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
it's not that impressive at all

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.800 
it's not that impressive at all
these<00:02:07.740> are<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> latest<00:02:08.280> boys<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.539> yeah

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
these are the latest boys so yeah

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.559 
these are the latest boys so yeah
quickly<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.349> video<00:02:10.679> moving<00:02:11.280> up<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
quickly a video moving up here you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.670 
quickly a video moving up here you
should<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.930> those<00:02:13.110> requests

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
should get those requests

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
should get those requests
to<00:02:13.950> do<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.099> video<00:02:14.579> like<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.569> have<00:02:15.780> an

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
to do a video like that I have an

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.399 
to do a video like that I have an
anti-suit<00:02:16.349> benchmark<00:02:16.859> test<00:02:17.159> which<00:02:18.409> provides

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
anti-suit benchmark test which provides

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.660 
anti-suit benchmark test which provides
some<00:02:19.530> pretty<00:02:19.709> interesting<00:02:19.950> score<00:02:20.459> an

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
some pretty interesting score an

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.199 
some pretty interesting score an
internet<00:02:21.030> test<00:02:21.299> and<00:02:21.569> also<00:02:21.989> on<00:02:22.260> overall<00:02:22.730> video

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
internet test and also on overall video

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.440 
internet test and also on overall video
checking<00:02:25.109> out<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.980> quality<00:02:26.879> of<00:02:27.090> these

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
checking out the quality of these

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.830 
checking out the quality of these
devices<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.680> specs<00:02:29.250> look<00:02:29.640> as<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.719> can

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
devices and the specs look as you can

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.449 
devices and the specs look as you can
see<00:02:31.049> one<00:02:31.349> thing<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.709> pretty<00:02:31.950> unique<00:02:32.159> about

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
see one thing is pretty unique about

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.640 
see one thing is pretty unique about
these<00:02:32.670> devices<00:02:32.939> is<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.299> they<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.870> feature

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
these devices is that they all feature
