Rain Man basically star breaks collect
stars<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.970> click<00:01:06.210> space<00:01:06.510> we<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.170> right

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
stars so we click space we get it right

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
stars so we click space we get it right
into<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.680> game<00:01:07.860> we<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.520> left<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.210> right<00:01:10.340> it's

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
from area to area there are some

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.260 
from area to area there are some
problems<00:02:34.260> where<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.770> he<00:02:34.980> slides<00:02:38.240> but<00:02:39.240> I

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
problems where you know he slides but I

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.820 
problems where you know he slides but I
can<00:02:39.600> easily<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:40.170> fixed<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:42.380> put<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.500> together

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
can easily be fixed I put this together

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.020 
can easily be fixed I put this together
really<00:02:44.220> quick<00:02:44.550> he<00:02:45.330> can<00:02:45.480> jump<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.860> then<00:02:47.760> he's

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
really quick he can jump and then he's

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.140 
really quick he can jump and then he's
got<00:02:48.240> an<00:02:48.330> idle<00:02:48.660> animation<00:02:49.730> basically<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.820> say
