November let me turn the light on and as
my<00:02:59.819> is<00:03:00.360> really<00:03:00.870> really<00:03:01.110> my<00:03:01.409> concern<00:03:01.549> that<00:03:03.709> this

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
my is really really my concern that this

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.699 
my is really really my concern that this
call<00:03:06.769> might<00:03:07.769> not<00:03:08.010> make<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:09.140> because<00:03:10.140> of<00:03:10.290> algae

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
call might not make it because of algae

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.580 
call might not make it because of algae
growing<00:03:11.040> all<00:03:11.459> over<00:03:11.519> the<00:03:11.909> place<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:16.609> am

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
growing all over the place here and I am

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.160 
growing all over the place here and I am
really<00:03:19.940> torn<00:03:20.940> right<00:03:21.329> now<00:03:22.370> what<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.519> do<00:03:24.170> because

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
really torn right now what to do because

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.069 
really torn right now what to do because
I<00:03:25.470> do<00:03:25.530> want<00:03:25.859> to<00:03:26.400> see<00:03:26.639> this<00:03:26.790> experiment<00:03:27.510> going

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
I do want to see this experiment going

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:38.240 
I do want to see this experiment going
for<00:03:28.620> these<00:03:28.859> two<00:03:29.040> years<00:03:29.370> or<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:33.019> so

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.540 

I<00:03:38.340> will<00:03:39.210> certainly<00:03:40.200> add<00:03:40.560> three<00:03:41.070> more<00:03:41.100> snail<00:03:43.550> to

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
I will certainly add three more snail to

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.290 
I will certainly add three more snail to
each<00:03:44.730> tang<00:03:45.210> here<00:03:46.580> for<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.700> sake<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.740> this

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
each tang here for the sake of this

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.610 
each tang here for the sake of this
wallet<00:03:51.300> vision<00:03:51.810> matane

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.430 

so<00:03:55.310> we<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.640> keep<00:03:55.909> the<00:03:56.269> coral<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.870> lie<00:03:59.409> what<00:04:00.409> I

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
so we can keep the coral to lie what I

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.410 
so we can keep the coral to lie what I
can<00:04:00.769> do

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.960 

and<00:04:04.540> that's<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.980> from<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.459> hobbyist

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
and that's is from the hobbyist

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.070 
and that's is from the hobbyist
standpoint<00:04:07.599> I<00:04:07.900> have<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.260> do<00:04:08.440> something<00:04:10.080> but

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
standpoint I have to do something but

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.930 
standpoint I have to do something but
from<00:04:11.319> a<00:04:11.349> business<00:04:11.470> standpoint<00:04:12.130> I<00:04:12.610> shouldn't

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
from a business standpoint I shouldn't

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.470 
from a business standpoint I shouldn't
let<00:04:13.030> it<00:04:13.180> go<00:04:14.430> as<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.730> friend<00:04:15.790> suggested

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.840 

it's<00:04:21.200> really<00:04:21.620> really<00:04:21.920> difficult<00:04:22.070> for<00:04:22.460> me<00:04:22.610> to

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
it's really really difficult for me to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.450 
it's really really difficult for me to
do<00:04:23.000> that<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:25.720> but<00:04:26.720> there's<00:04:26.930> only<00:04:27.140> so<00:04:27.290> much<00:04:28.250> I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
do that so but there's only so much I

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.890 
do that so but there's only so much I
can<00:04:28.490> do<00:04:28.880> here
