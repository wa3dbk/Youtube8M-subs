00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:10.509
 how are you if I know that a long time ago 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.749
 that he did not record the videos because I do not know 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:16.299
 because I'm a little busy and also 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:20.810
 it's because 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:26.060
 I do not know what to say but good 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.910
 Now I'm here and I have a question 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.480
 little weird but good I'm curious about 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.480
 know it 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:40.530
 the question is 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:44.300
 if you look like pedagogy, it's very bad 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.710
 for the for health because for example 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:53.239
 I have some friends or some friends from 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.690
 They are Spanish speakers and sometimes 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.320
 we're 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.190
 we are talking about 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.190
 that question 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.560
 about cold water especially for 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.540
 the girls because here they were less 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.150
 of water I think in general 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:20.080
 the Asians think like this 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.370
 cold water is bad word 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:31.000
 for health because your body 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:37.650
 Normally it has a normal temperature 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 and if you suddenly drink cold water between 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:47.110
 until your body that is very bad 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:51.450
 you also know that for girls who 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:58.710
 we have the rule then he will 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.710
 it will prohibit to drink water fira in company 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:06.760
 but that period 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.270
 well I do not know if you guys too 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.370
 you think like that because sometimes I see I see my 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:20.170
 friends after komodo 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:27.190
 do sport sports or run things like that 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:30.000
 you should enroll a lot of water like that and 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.000
 I ask 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.650
 I did not know before that they do not think 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.500
 what 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.280
 Lake Cia is very bad for health but 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.540
 after asking and they like me 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.270
 they look like surprised and told me how 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.090
 that where 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.720
 but why do you think so things 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.020
 well but here we always always think 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 that quality health 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:10.380
 you tell me 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.470
 You are going to tell me what you think 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.700
 I feel because my Spanish I think that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:21.500
 He has not spoken for a long time 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:26.340
 but good if you understand me you can leave 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.840
 the comments on my facebook 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.840
 good chao
