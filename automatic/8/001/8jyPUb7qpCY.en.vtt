00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
regional resource we want to see our

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.610

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
approaches replicated in other places

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.710

because<00:04:54.250> we<00:04:54.430> know<00:04:54.610> we'll<00:04:54.820> never<00:04:54.850> be<00:04:55.419> able<00:04:55.450> to

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
because we know we'll never be able to

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.270 
because we know we'll never be able to
reach<00:04:56.020> all<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:56.470> the<00:04:56.560> kids<00:04:56.740> who<00:04:56.919> have<00:04:57.039> learning
