a good practice tool you've seen me in

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.400 
a good practice tool you've seen me in
certain<00:00:08.250> situations<00:00:08.849> even<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.150> games<00:00:09.389> when<00:00:10.380> I

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
certain situations even in games when I

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.810 
certain situations even in games when I
step<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.010> free-throw<00:00:11.190> line

fundamentals<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.699> I've<00:00:20.850> been<00:00:21.000> taught<00:00:21.270> I've

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
fundamentals that I've been taught I've

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.720 
fundamentals that I've been taught I've
been<00:00:21.630> practicing<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.130> best<00:00:23.310> way<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> do

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
been practicing so the best way to do

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370 
been practicing so the best way to do
that<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.539> your<00:00:24.630> eyes<00:00:24.689> closed

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that is to do it with your eyes closed

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.560 
that is to do it with your eyes closed
nothing<00:00:25.800> changes<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.180> step<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
nothing changes when you step to the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.990 
nothing changes when you step to the
free-throw<00:00:27.840> line<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.640> through<00:00:29.849> your

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
free-throw line and you go through your

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.020 
free-throw line and you go through your
ritual<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.500> set<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.890> target<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.489> now

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
ritual and you set your target and now

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.580 
ritual and you set your target and now
that<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.329> close<00:00:33.540> your<00:00:33.719> eyes<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
that you close your eyes you think the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.400 
that you close your eyes you think the
dimensions<00:00:35.010> change<00:00:35.280> no<00:00:35.820> you're<00:00:36.750> still<00:00:36.989> 15

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
dimensions change no you're still 15

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.740 
dimensions change no you're still 15
feet<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> basket<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:39.000> rim<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.329> still<00:00:39.540> 10

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
feet from the basket the rim is still 10

feet from the basket the rim is still 10
feet<00:00:39.989> high<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.500> everything<00:00:41.309> should<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> kept

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
feet high so everything should be kept

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.180 
feet high so everything should be kept
on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> same<00:00:42.120> plane<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.770> total

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
on the same plane if you have total

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.250 
on the same plane if you have total
comfort<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.329> free<00:00:45.539> throws<00:00:45.750> stroke

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
comfort and your free throws stroke

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.650 
comfort and your free throws stroke
or<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.649> fundamentals<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.430> should<00:00:48.360> be<00:00:48.480> able

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
or your fundamentals you should be able

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
or your fundamentals you should be able
to<00:00:48.750> make<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.079> shot<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:50.250> just<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
to make that shot not just going to

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
to make that shot not just going to
shoot<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.059> same<00:00:51.239> percentage<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:52.500> when

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
shoot with the same percentage but when

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
shoot with the same percentage but when
you<00:00:52.800> release<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.820> know<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> same

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
you release it you know it's in the same

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.930 
you release it you know it's in the same
target<00:00:55.079> at<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.620> same<00:00:55.829> target<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> same

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
target at the same target with the same

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.650 
target at the same target with the same
type<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.210> shot<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:58.730> good<00:00:59.730> practice<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> let<00:01:00.539> see

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
type of shot so good practice to let see

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.090 
type of shot so good practice to let see
starts<00:01:01.020> go<00:01:01.230> through<00:01:01.410> ritual<00:01:03.650> see<00:01:04.650> everything

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
starts go through ritual see everything

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.670 
starts go through ritual see everything
make<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> first<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.990> your<00:01:07.140> eyes<00:01:07.260> open

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
make the first one with your eyes open

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.700 
make the first one with your eyes open
so<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.030> isn't<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.170> everything<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so now it isn't you have everything in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.840 
so now it isn't you have everything in
rhythm<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:12.150> goes<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> same<00:01:12.810> ritual<00:01:13.850> look

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
rhythm then goes to the same ritual look

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
rhythm then goes to the same ritual look
at<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> target<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.479> right<00:01:15.689> before<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.049> shoot

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
at the target and right before you shoot

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.289 
at the target and right before you shoot
it<00:01:16.470> close<00:01:16.680> your<00:01:16.830> eyes<00:01:18.439> it<00:01:19.439> shouldn't<00:01:19.770> change

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
it close your eyes it shouldn't change

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.399 
it close your eyes it shouldn't change
but<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.570> good<00:01:21.689> practice<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.110> learn<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
but that's a good practice to learn a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.560 
but that's a good practice to learn a
lot<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> guys<00:01:22.950> who<00:01:23.189> don't<00:01:23.400> have<00:01:24.000> comfort<00:01:24.479> in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
lot of guys who don't have comfort in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.450 
lot of guys who don't have comfort in
their<00:01:24.689> free<00:01:24.869> throw<00:01:25.049> shot<00:01:25.320> when<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.220> close

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
their free throw shot when they close

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270 
their free throw shot when they close
their<00:01:26.670> eyes<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> shoot<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.020> short<00:01:28.280> -

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
their eyes need to shoot it short -

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.300 
their eyes need to shoot it short -
right<00:01:29.579> shoot<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.329> left<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.950> that's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.100> good

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
right shoot it left and that's a good

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.149 
right shoot it left and that's a good
way<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.579> test<00:01:33.119> your<00:01:33.420> fundamentals<00:01:34.290> under

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
way to test your fundamentals under

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.770 
way to test your fundamentals under
pressure<00:01:35.430> because<00:01:36.000> if<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> shoot<00:01:36.659> it

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
pressure because if you can shoot it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
pressure because if you can shoot it
with<00:01:36.900> your<00:01:37.049> eyes<00:01:37.110> closed<00:01:37.560> quite<00:01:38.520> naturally

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
with your eyes closed quite naturally

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
with your eyes closed quite naturally
you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.210> shoot<00:01:39.420> them<00:01:39.570> when<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.229> six<00:01:40.409> or

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you can shoot them when there's six or

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.200 
you can shoot them when there's six or
4,000<00:01:41.070> people<00:01:41.189> paying<00:01:41.490> attention<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.060> your

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
4,000 people paying attention to your

shot another tool for getting the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
shot another tool for getting the
correct<00:01:44.729> back<00:01:45.030> spin<00:01:45.390> as<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.170> talked<00:01:46.439> earlier

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
correct back spin as I talked earlier

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.319 
correct back spin as I talked earlier
about<00:01:46.890> once<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> ball<00:01:47.579> hits<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.880> rim<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
about once the ball hits the rim and

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760 
about once the ball hits the rim and
starts<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.689> bounce<00:01:48.840> around<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.619> may

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
starts to bounce around a little bit may
