a<00:03:15.000> blading<00:03:16.280> yeah<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.579> good

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
a blading yeah you have a good

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.430 
a blading yeah you have a good
separation<00:03:18.000> there<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:19.140> have<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> good

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
separation there we have a good

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.589 
separation there we have a good
separation<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.220> appendage<00:03:20.730> we<00:03:21.420> have

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
separation of the appendage we have

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.449 
separation of the appendage we have
identification<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.799> veins<00:03:23.040> clearly

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
identification of the veins clearly

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.619 
identification of the veins clearly
let's<00:03:26.459> take<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.670> look<00:03:26.879> at<00:03:26.970> your<00:03:27.120> appendage<00:03:27.540> do

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
let's take a look at your appendage do

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.369 
let's take a look at your appendage do
you<00:03:27.690> like<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.989> your<00:03:28.109> appendage<00:03:28.500> knob<00:03:29.180> yeah<00:03:30.379> so

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
you like to your appendage knob yeah so

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.410 
you like to your appendage knob yeah so
I<00:03:31.440> think<00:03:31.680> we<00:03:31.920> have<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.099> good<00:03:32.340> view<00:03:32.579> over<00:03:33.269> there

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
I think we have a good view over there

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.020 
I think we have a good view over there
that<00:03:33.629> we<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.900> use<00:03:34.049> for<00:03:34.200> overlay<00:03:34.849> the<00:03:35.849> main

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
that we can use for overlay the main

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.990 
that we can use for overlay the main
hurdle<00:03:36.390> was<00:03:36.510> just<00:03:36.720> getting<00:03:36.989> over<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:38.000> initial

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040

appropriate setting it took

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.569 
appropriate setting it took
approximately<00:03:47.400> ten<00:03:48.209> cases<00:03:48.450> for<00:03:48.870> me<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.049> become
