00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
got to understand 12 million dollars is

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.889

a<00:01:20.499> lot<00:01:20.679> of<00:01:21.399> money<00:01:21.639> no<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:21.939> do<00:01:21.999> understand<00:01:22.749> that

more<00:01:24.789> money<00:01:24.850> than<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.270> for<00:01:25.569> some<00:01:25.749> reason

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:27.029 
more money than that for some reason

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.370 
more money than that for some reason
because<00:01:28.029> he<00:01:28.060> doesn't<00:01:28.479> own<00:01:28.659> it<00:01:28.689> you<00:01:29.139> know<00:01:29.259> like
