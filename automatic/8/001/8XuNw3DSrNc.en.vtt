00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.610
 Hi, I'm Alejandra Cobra and you're in my 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.950
 house that is your house and today we are going to do 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.010
 with this wire we are going to turn it into 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.320
 a beautiful crown of first communion 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.850
 do not miss how we are going to do this 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.830
 is the material with which we are going to 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.619
 work first we have wire 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.720
 galvanized lola tape and with that wire 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.429
 let's do this little circle that is 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.529
 where we are going to assemble all the color 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:33.410
 then we are going to use a little ribbon 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.750
 to generate these ribbon flowers 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.760
 fabric flowers that are purchased the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.680
 twigs of lips or phil since the 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.410
 we did with a little pearl 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.989
 ribbons in two shades and in different 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.149
 sizes these are this satin these 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.710
 they are organza and we have it instead 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.539
 that combines with the ellipse cilia in 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.430
 white to match the flowers and 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.949
 Well, let's get to work, here we have 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.559
 our galvanized wire and we're going to 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.129
 generate a circle of approximately 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.160
 about 12 15 centimeters the ideal is that 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.260
 Le Mirage the baby's head to which 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.640
 you're going to do the crown then 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.070
 very easy nothing more 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.070
 you are a little bit so it does not move 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.289
 and then to start working 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:23.619
 we need to cover it with flower to tale 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:26.380
 white reminds that this flower att ribbon 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.689
 for the florist you find in have 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.700
 haberdasheries or specialized stores 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.380
 for flowers and then the only thing you're going 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.369
 to do is to turn it around you have to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.280
 stretch it so that it sticks itself to 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.740
 stretch here and we have it ready and it's 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.380
 where are we going to start assembling our 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.810
 flowers these flowers as I said are 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.970
 I'll teach you how to make these 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.250
 flowers that are ribbon flowers 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.530
 anyway , I'll leave you anyway 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.630
 a link so that if you do not understand him very 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.149
 well this time you do not want to see another 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.539
 type of flowers you may need 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.579
 needle and thread and a little ribbon in this 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.709
 case is organza what you are going to do is 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.289
 you are going to cut the the you are going to cut the 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:10.569
 ribbon at the peak end and that peak 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.579
 you're going to fold it and then we're going to start the 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.620
 flower that this will be the center of the 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.210
 flower 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.450
 and it has been soft 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:23.760
 right now you're going to put a little 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.760
 in the needle and the thread to stop 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.100
 and what you're doing is that you're going 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.100
 thinking and you are sewing 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.790
 They are some headdresses that like you are 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.560
 making the flowers are very simple if 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.239
 you buy the light flower that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.049
 you find nothing else spending a little 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.459
 more expensive, it is already a very size 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.040
 harmonious and that yes now nothing else what 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.630
 we are going to finish and the tops closing 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.230
 here and covering 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.320
 saws you turn around and now what 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.470
 let's ride on a stick on a wire 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.290
 same with a little flora tape to 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.900
 what tape is the thread and all things 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.600
 Here and flower GIPS or philia 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.310
 with these we are going to make the bouquets 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.350
 in small here we put them some 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.080
 pearls that look very pretty and with 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.000
 this we will complete the other part of 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.010
 the flowers are the ones you find 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.350
 usually in the haberdashery the same 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.600
 you work by mounting them on a wire with 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.850
 floral here we are going to start you 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.560
 we are going to start then we are very 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.540
 excited we are going to put the first 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.070
 flower as we already have the flower well 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.900
 wire fence and flora tape no no no 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.990
 there is no problem how we tie it 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:43.970
 Now let's put a little bit of lips or 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.490
 filia equal and we have it well worked 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.700
 and then of course because we are not going to ride 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.770
 the tea flower the paper flower just like 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.120
 we have it very ready is probably 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.870
 is very long inhabit sides 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.670
 and here what we are going to do is 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.580
 interlacing some slats so that 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.930
 see even more beautiful and this yes the 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.720
 let's ride with the foil on the 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.610
 I hook them here with the hook this 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.610
 of the paper flower and here you go 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.500
 doing the finished and on the other side you 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:20.199
 put you back again another little 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.750
 we are about to finish 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:26.000
 then we are going to assemble what we need 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.430
 there you see very well the gap of how 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.590
 You see very beautiful everything there crown and 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.810
 we have practically all the coronary 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.240
 we're going to finish it with a beige ribbon 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.340
 and with a white ribbon then it's going to be 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.650
 very simple I think that a ribbon of 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.500
 normal lacing can work very well 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.510
 because the crown is already very loaded 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.710
 nothing else we are going to make a ribbon of 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.710
 simple loop 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.230
 we always provide it with the 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.020
 laths of the room passes a little this 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.270
 what to do as well as if yes 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.490
 it works and you already proportion it and now 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.620
 let's put a second bow on 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.900
 white so that it continues to combine everything 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.720
 It is white and beige, just like we do 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.670
 of smaller loop and you know we have 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.890
 always this silicon that I love 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.720
 what is the good cold this is already super 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.810
 thick but it works very well still 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.050
 let's hit the white on top of the bei and 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.570
 I really liked this pin that 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.090
 it looks very father that is pearl we are going 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.490
 to put it like this we're going to cut it just 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.650
 you put it a little bit but if we go to 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:34.710
 paste with silicone and this time 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.710
 tender how pretty this crown was for 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.400
 How did you like the video to me? 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.620

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.169
 communion will love you are the 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.150
