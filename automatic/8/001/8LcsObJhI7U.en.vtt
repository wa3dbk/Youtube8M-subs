00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.400
 haim is the water I enjoy today 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.070
 a little break in my job from 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.770
 time of an hour if they could 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.510
 read to make you a video of a 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.310
 boat that I managed to do these three 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.590
 last weeks with hours a 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.390
 little bit taken here and there on my 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.850
 free time that I did not have much 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.150
 in short always is it that this time 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.310
 it is a reproduction almost the most 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.970
 identical that I could do hms 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.800
 victory 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.040
 you also noticed that I 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.770
 changed skins good ben I see there 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.270
 I wanted since that is what 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.890
 boat there I do them in three weeks 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.290
 by taking an hour here and there as 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.700
 I just told you so it's 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.610
 this is a long time to do so it's 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.680
 really a most faithful reproduction 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.260
 that I was able to do with this boat I 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.030
 really took my time I really 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.130
 look at the plans look at the photos 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.860
 actually hms I took several 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.680
 plans each time several references 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.170
 to measure every thing for example at 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.820
 the length of the verbs in relation to the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.500
 size of the boat because I do not have 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.170
 could make the boat to real size and that 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.239
 would be it would have been too small the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.010
 cubes minecraftians are too big and we 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.520
 can not do enough details 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.890
 on a real size boat what 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.870
 unfortunately so 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.670
 so he's pretty successful enough in 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.440
 the set I find the ropes 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.340
 pretty much respects the reality except those 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.190
 between the last word and the mode of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.660
 middle because I have a nose add a 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.080
 or two it was a little bit empty 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.810
 but otherwise it's really the most 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.310
 looking like I would put or 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.250
 when I put in the editing 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.150
 the world you had to see 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.250
 pictures of true hms victory 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.390
 why there is more inscription here 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.790
 it's because I'm not on the bench 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.319
 hms a good brief so suddenly this is the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.359
 same thing and 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.489
 that one is a copy in fact that 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.959
 I put to be able the film is so 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.340
 that's why the inscriptions on 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.810
 the panel behind were removed but 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.689
 it's not very serious there I'm mostly 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.489
 show the inside of the boat because 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.859
 I also did the inside of the boat 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.390
 for once so so I did not 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:00.680
 sprained I made a mistake 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.270
 that's usual it's our way 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.860
 I did not really go for 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.970
 inside the boat I have not finished 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.600
 by the way completely as well as a 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.819
 I had forgotten that I had done this 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.190
 part there so the way these offenses I have 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.140
 really old forget it I had 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.989
 do that I 'm here so this is where 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.490
 what is the captain's thing I would say 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.770
 that so we can go here so 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:28.460
 inside boats as you know 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.050
 maybe it's really not my thing 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.790
 I really do them to say that I 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.210
 do what with the cannons toulouse 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:39.020
 have read thing with the words that go beyond 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.630
 and who are up to the bottom of the hold 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.100
 finally but I did not really 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.510
 much more than that I put guns 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.210
 I put cabins in the back and then 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.740
 that pretty much all that does not respect the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.640
 reality a high level of the interior of the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.020
 boat you have to know but it's 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.740
 really level of the outside that I have 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.440
 wanted to give a bath that I wanted 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.940
 do something and that's where I 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.620
 succeeded anyway so there it is to be at 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.729
 bread to go from one bridge to another 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.380
 see that the sands always the same 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.380
 except the bilge where there are plenty of 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.729
 trunk like on the real ones actually I'm 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.020
 am a little inspired by the real boats 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.570
 I was inspired by others 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.270
 boats that had made other 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.400
 people too so here I am not going 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.680
 to bother you longer I'm going 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.020
 stop taking this path a little 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.810
 not stupid too that would not be worse 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.270
 so here I leave you on those on sadr 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.330
 and at the productions of the hms victory I 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.770
 will be other boat production to 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.110
 the future I will be also inventions 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.070
 because it's missing a little bit 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.980
 last time on my chain of 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:47.360
 boat inventions actually 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.010
 if you also find a home at meys 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.800
 victory if you know this boat and 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.860
 that you find a better done boat 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.940
 than mine better ie by 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.990
 compared to reality better reproduced 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.760
 perfectly sign because it's true 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.490
 than me for the moment from what I saw 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.870
 what I have pretty badly searched when 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.290
 even from what I saw on the internet 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:13.000
 it is the friend to the productions of this boat 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:17.540
 there I watched the reproductions of 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.660
 two other big shipbuilders world 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.340
 who are mr b ch'ti and silhouette and I 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.340
 still find that mine is more 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:31.370
 more more more how more true what 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.020
 more true effect for example that of 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.870
 silhouettes more trimmed but there are some 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.510
 inconsistent stuff not seemed like my 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.639
 iron ropes in green and all that good 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.249
 here 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.050
 and it's on ben's one esteem this 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:47.259
 part there for example does not exist good 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.669
 that's what I could find on 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.430
 internet that's really what's the 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.529
 more like reality so 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.520
 there may be some and surely 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:59.490
 others later 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.870
 on this I leave you if you have any 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.090
 two too clumsy as it showed me the 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.699
 month I'll be happy to look 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:10.419
 on this movement sailors and the 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.949
 next for genesis project or for a 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.479
 other stuff too because I planned 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.819
 two three things during this summer that 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:18.879
 you will see by studying the bad beat bit 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:21.490
 bedbug i will get there 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:22.870
 meanwhile I always in times of 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.129
 partial ones of which there will not be many 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.870
 video this week will not even have 

00:07:24.129 --> 00:07:27.270
 at all except this one is the week 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:31.960
 next it will be the same 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:33.839
 so we end up in two three 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.189
 weeks in two weeks normally 

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:38.259
 for the rest to pose genesis and the 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:41.219
 following the usual videos and hi all 

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:41.219
 the world and good winds sailors
