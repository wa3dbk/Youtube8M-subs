00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
configuration to this one you see the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.670 
configuration to this one you see the
Gator<00:01:16.000> pattern<00:01:16.690> stuff<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:19.479> rushed<00:01:20.140> out<00:01:20.440> in

the water with real alligator skin and
that's<00:01:24.550> how<00:01:24.729> we<00:01:24.790> get<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.229> bad<00:01:26.229> ambia<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:27.720> this

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
that's how we get the bad ambia and this

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.460 
that's how we get the bad ambia and this
one<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.080> nickel<00:01:29.500> plated<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.729> one<00:01:30.970> is<00:01:31.150> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
one is nickel plated this one is a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.840 
one is nickel plated this one is a
metric<00:01:32.470> silver<00:01:33.100> with<00:01:34.740> with<00:01:35.740> widow<00:01:36.550> Gator

right<00:01:37.300> engraving<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:39.340> one<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.790> you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:39.910 
right engraving this one is that you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.530 
right engraving this one is that you
basically<00:01:40.150> so<00:01:41.080> it's<00:01:41.229> kind<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.440> destructive

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
basically so it's kind of destructive

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.740 
basically so it's kind of destructive

this one is a little lighter than the

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.709 
this one is a little lighter than the
regular<00:01:58.579> 1i<00:01:59.740> use<00:02:00.740> like<00:02:01.039> perforated<00:02:01.819> steel<00:02:01.969> and

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
regular 1i use like perforated steel and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.749 
regular 1i use like perforated steel and
we<00:02:02.869> call<00:02:03.079> them<00:02:03.319> ollie<00:02:03.649> front<00:02:04.429> or<00:02:04.670> back<00:02:06.759> same

we call them ollie front or back same

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.680 
we call them ollie front or back same
for<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.030> base<00:02:09.310> this<00:02:10.310> one<00:02:10.549> is<00:02:10.910> called<00:02:11.030> steel

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
for the base this one is called steel

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.140 
for the base this one is called steel
phonic<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.890> use<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.099> candy<00:02:13.610> box<00:02:13.849> is<00:02:14.120> a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
phonic and I use a candy box is a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.050 
phonic and I use a candy box is a
resonator<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.980> sounds<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.370> bit<00:02:16.519> different

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
resonator so it sounds a bit different

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.259 
resonator so it sounds a bit different
that's<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.959> rest<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.349> guitars<00:02:18.799> so<00:02:19.519> what

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
that's the rest of the guitars so what

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.619 
that's the rest of the guitars so what
does<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.200> steel<00:02:21.650> bodies<00:02:22.010> kind<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.489> do<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.540> the

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
does the steel bodies kind of do to the

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.890 
does the steel bodies kind of do to the
sound<00:02:23.900> like<00:02:24.260> what<00:02:24.440> would<00:02:24.650> he<00:02:24.890> yeah<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.579> a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
sound like what would he yeah it's a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.830 
sound like what would he yeah it's a
classic<00:02:26.900> town<00:02:27.140> but<00:02:27.500> different<00:02:28.599> response<00:02:29.599> the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
classic town but different response the

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.009 
classic town but different response the
response<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.380> faster<00:02:31.069> because<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.329> metal

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
response is faster because the metal

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.930 
response is faster because the metal
body<00:02:33.349> yeah<00:02:34.780> what<00:02:35.780> was<00:02:36.440> less<00:02:36.680> than<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.890> 1<00:02:37.069> hi<00:02:37.700> my
