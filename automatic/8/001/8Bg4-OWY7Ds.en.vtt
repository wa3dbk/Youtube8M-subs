say they didn't like this color I
haven't<00:02:02.189> tried<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.179> this<00:02:03.359> so<00:02:04.200> we

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
haven't tried it I just got this so we

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:24.410 
haven't tried it I just got this so we
almost

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.540 

and<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.350> color<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.650> not<00:02:25.830> as<00:02:26.040> bad<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:26.430> I

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
and this color is not as bad as I

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.750 
and this color is not as bad as I
thought<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:29.480> mean<00:02:30.480> it's<00:02:30.630> not<00:02:30.980> intense<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.250> using

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
thought I mean it's not intense as using

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.510 
thought I mean it's not intense as using
your<00:02:32.790> paints<00:02:33.480> wet<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.709> just<00:02:34.890> not<00:02:35.130> as<00:02:35.280> bad

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
your paints wet but it's just not as bad

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.010 
your paints wet but it's just not as bad
as<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.790> thought<00:02:36.000> if<00:02:36.959> you're<00:02:37.110> wanting<00:02:37.440> purple

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
as I thought if you're wanting purple

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
now this brings me to a good point is

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.029 
now this brings me to a good point is
that<00:06:03.370> when<00:06:03.729> I<00:06:03.759> want<00:06:04.090> both<00:06:04.750> sets<00:06:05.199> of<00:06:05.440> paints<00:06:05.860> I

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
that when I want both sets of paints I

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.830 
that when I want both sets of paints I
bought<00:06:06.669> the<00:06:07.120> star<00:06:07.479> blends<00:06:07.750> to<00:06:08.199> be<00:06:08.289> used<00:06:09.840> dry

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
bought the star blends to be used dry

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.290 
bought the star blends to be used dry
and<00:06:11.199> the<00:06:12.190> been<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.180> to<00:06:13.240> be<00:06:13.569> used<00:06:13.810> wet<00:06:14.080> and<00:06:15.300> you

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
and the been I to be used wet and you

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.990 
and the been I to be used wet and you
can<00:06:16.419> see<00:06:16.660> why<00:06:16.900> I<00:06:17.199> think<00:06:17.530> star<00:06:18.039> blends<00:06:18.340> is<00:06:18.580> made

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
can see why I think star blends is made

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.029 
can see why I think star blends is made
to<00:06:19.330> be<00:06:19.360> used<00:06:19.449> dry<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.289> that's<00:06:20.349> why<00:06:20.560> the<00:06:20.620> colors

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 
to be used dry and that's why the colors

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:23.360 
to be used dry and that's why the colors
are<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:21.190> lot<00:06:21.370> more<00:06:21.400> vibrant<00:06:21.789> when<00:06:22.270> use<00:06:22.449> dry<00:06:22.930> and

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
are a lot more vibrant when use dry and

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.050 
are a lot more vibrant when use dry and
the<00:06:24.780> Ben<00:06:25.780> Nye<00:06:25.810> is<00:06:26.470> meant<00:06:26.800> to<00:06:26.979> be<00:06:27.099> used<00:06:27.370> wet<00:06:27.729> and

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
the Ben Nye is meant to be used wet and

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.740 
the Ben Nye is meant to be used wet and
so<00:06:28.750> that's<00:06:29.110> why<00:06:29.820> it's<00:06:30.820> not<00:06:31.090> working<00:06:31.150> very<00:06:31.630> well

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
so that's why it's not working very well

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.320

there's<00:06:57.340> a<00:06:57.400> lot<00:06:57.580> of<00:06:57.700> pattern<00:06:58.030> on<00:06:58.120> top<00:06:58.180> but

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:08.889 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:11.309 

and<00:07:09.639> for<00:07:09.819> those<00:07:09.939> of<00:07:10.000> you<00:07:10.330> who<00:07:10.629> find<00:07:10.960> that<00:07:11.110> these

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 
and for those of you who find that these

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.709 
and for those of you who find that these
are<00:07:11.349> very<00:07:11.710> very<00:07:11.919> muscle<00:07:12.490> messy<00:07:13.270> one<00:07:13.539> of<00:07:13.629> the

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:13.719 
are very very muscle messy one of the

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:15.830 
are very very muscle messy one of the
things<00:07:13.870> I<00:07:13.990> did<00:07:14.139> find<00:07:14.349> out<00:07:14.469> is<00:07:14.650> if<00:07:14.800> you<00:07:14.949> rub<00:07:15.219> your

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
things I did find out is if you rub your

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.059 
things I did find out is if you rub your
sponge<00:07:16.840> or<00:07:17.080> blender<00:07:17.379> or<00:07:17.469> whatever<00:07:17.710> you<00:07:17.800> decide

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:18.069 
sponge or blender or whatever you decide

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:21.029 
sponge or blender or whatever you decide
you<00:07:18.159> want<00:07:18.310> to<00:07:18.340> use<00:07:18.400> on<00:07:18.729> top<00:07:19.330> and<00:07:19.629> then<00:07:20.020> dab<00:07:20.379> it

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 
you want to use on top and then dab it

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.330 
you want to use on top and then dab it
picks<00:07:21.340> up<00:07:21.520> some<00:07:21.699> of<00:07:21.849> that<00:07:21.969> extra<00:07:22.569> powder<00:07:23.379> so

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340 
picks up some of that extra powder so

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.600 
picks up some of that extra powder so
it's<00:07:24.699> not<00:07:25.090> as<00:07:25.330> messy<00:07:25.840> I<00:07:26.340> still<00:07:27.340> think<00:07:27.490> it's

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.610 
it's not as messy I still think it's

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.999 
it's not as messy I still think it's
really<00:07:27.819> messy<00:07:28.120> but<00:07:28.330> it's<00:07:29.319> not<00:07:29.379> as<00:07:29.740> messy<00:07:32.009> okay

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:33.009 
really messy but it's not as messy okay

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:37.140 
really messy but it's not as messy okay
so<00:07:33.129> now<00:07:33.340> this<00:07:33.520> is<00:07:33.580> star<00:07:33.969> blends<00:07:35.909> there's<00:07:36.909> no

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
so now this is star blends there's no

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:53.219 
so now this is star blends there's no
effort<00:07:37.389> and<00:07:37.750> getting<00:07:38.080> this<00:07:38.169> one<00:07:38.409> to<00:07:38.590> power<00:07:38.770> up

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:53.229 

00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:56.469 

I'm<00:07:54.229> not<00:07:54.349> sure<00:07:54.469> it's<00:07:54.619> not<00:07:54.769> black<00:07:55.159> black<00:07:55.479> like

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 
I'm not sure it's not black black like

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.749 
I'm not sure it's not black black like
what<00:07:56.689> you<00:07:56.869> if<00:07:57.439> you're<00:07:57.829> looking<00:07:58.189> for<00:07:58.429> when

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:03.579 

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:09.609
