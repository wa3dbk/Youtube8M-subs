let's start with our heel in a dig

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.959 
let's start with our heel in a dig
because<00:00:40.290> once<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.219> quick<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.760> is

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
because once you get going quick this is

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.060 
because once you get going quick this is
how<00:00:42.120> you'll<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.420> starting<00:00:42.840> them<00:00:42.989> from<00:00:43.739> here
