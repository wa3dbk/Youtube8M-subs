floating<00:00:45.840> towards<00:00:46.320> me<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.160> not<00:00:47.309> extra

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
floating towards me this is not extra

floating towards me this is not extra
this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.539> guaranteed<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.710> hundred<00:00:50.550> percent

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
this is not guaranteed a hundred percent

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.479

but<00:00:51.590> for<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> most<00:00:52.770> part<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.190> works<00:00:53.370> really

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
but for the most part it works really

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.750 
but for the most part it works really

well so for starters let me demonstrate

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.080 
well so for starters let me demonstrate
on<00:00:57.449> blocks<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.859> right<00:00:59.100> here<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.579> have<00:00:59.699> three

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
on blocks so right here we have three

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.729 
on blocks so right here we have three
well<00:01:00.510> four<00:01:00.780> different<00:01:00.809> blocks<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.530> count

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

smart<00:01:15.270> guy<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.869> are<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.500> decided<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> mine

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
smart guy that we are we decided to mine

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.310 
smart guy that we are we decided to mine
this<00:01:17.700> diamond<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.330> being<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> lazy<00:01:18.900> people

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
this diamond but being the lazy people

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.810 
this diamond but being the lazy people
that<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.799> we're<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.250> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> put<00:01:20.610> any

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
that we are we're not going to put any

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.270 
that we are we're not going to put any
blocks<00:01:21.060> between<00:01:21.270> us<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.740> that's<00:01:23.009> too

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
blocks between us because we that's too

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
blocks between us because we that's too
mainstream<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.270> too<00:01:24.420> cool<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.869> that

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
mainstream and we're too cool for that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
mainstream and we're too cool for that
so<00:01:25.200> basically<00:01:25.500> what<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:27.000> take<00:01:27.299> go

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so basically what we do is we take go

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.480 
so basically what we do is we take go
diamond<00:01:27.780> pickaxe<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.530> remind<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.100> diamond

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
diamond pickaxe and remind the diamond

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.550 
diamond pickaxe and remind the diamond
and<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.810> automatically<00:01:31.520> automatically<00:01:32.520> comes

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
and it automatically automatically comes

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.310 
and it automatically automatically comes
automatically<00:01:35.090> anyway<00:01:36.090> same<00:01:36.840> thing<00:01:37.079> works

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
automatically anyway same thing works

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.920 
automatically anyway same thing works
for<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.729> melon<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.090> let's<00:01:39.299> use<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> bow<00:01:39.869> to

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
on how it works with mods obviously

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.590 
on how it works with mods obviously
you're<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> ocean<00:02:47.519> you<00:02:47.670> find<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.030> pig<00:02:48.299> like

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
you're in the ocean you find a pig like

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.720 
you're in the ocean you find a pig like
about<00:02:49.080> five<00:02:49.410> miles<00:02:49.709> away<00:02:49.950> swimming<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
about five miles away swimming in the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.120 
about five miles away swimming in the
middle<00:02:50.940> of<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> ocean<00:02:51.239> for<00:02:51.690> no<00:02:51.870> reason<00:02:52.410> you

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
middle of the ocean for no reason you

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.920 
middle of the ocean for no reason you
know<00:02:53.190> well<00:02:53.670> this<00:02:53.790> is<00:02:53.819> this<00:02:54.299> isn't<00:02:54.600> really<00:02:54.810> an

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
know well this is this isn't really an

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.900 
know well this is this isn't really an
ocean<00:02:55.470> this<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.950> an<00:02:56.069> island<00:02:56.489> that<00:02:56.519> I<00:02:56.670> made

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
ocean this is just an island that I made

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.420 
ocean this is just an island that I made
but<00:02:57.180> no<00:02:57.660> se<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.959> see<00:02:58.230> a<00:02:58.260> chicken<00:02:58.739> randomly

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
but no se you see a chicken randomly

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.420 
but no se you see a chicken randomly
there<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.570> saw<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:01.290> beef<00:03:01.769> float<00:03:02.160> towards

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
there and I saw the beef float towards

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.449 
there and I saw the beef float towards
me<00:03:02.820> that's<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.870> guess<00:03:04.049> some<00:03:04.500> cows<00:03:05.040> drowned

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
me that's I guess some cows drowned

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.640 
me that's I guess some cows drowned
earlier<00:03:05.850> but<00:03:06.780> today<00:03:07.049> we<00:03:07.260> have<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> chicken

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
earlier but today we have a chicken

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
earlier but today we have a chicken
right<00:03:07.950> here<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.400> know<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.730> don't<00:03:08.880> hunger<00:03:09.690> bar

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
right here you know we don't hunger bar

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.530 
right here you know we don't hunger bar
is<00:03:09.959> gone<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.620> well<00:03:11.400> we<00:03:11.609> basically<00:03:11.880> kill<00:03:12.329> it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
is gone and well we basically kill it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.220 
is gone and well we basically kill it
and<00:03:12.799> it<00:03:13.799> doesn't<00:03:14.250> fall<00:03:14.579> down<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:15.230> normal

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and it doesn't fall down like normal

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.620 
and it doesn't fall down like normal
like<00:03:16.829> Minecraft<00:03:17.790> normally<00:03:18.150> does<00:03:18.359> which<00:03:18.600> is

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
like Minecraft normally does which is

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.250 
like Minecraft normally does which is
extremely<00:03:19.019> annoying<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.730> say<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.570> some

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
extremely annoying so say for some

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.520 
extremely annoying so say for some
reason<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:23.010> are<00:03:23.430> skeptical<00:03:24.120> of<00:03:24.530> chickens

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
reason you are skeptical of chickens

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.199 
reason you are skeptical of chickens
working<00:03:25.950> because<00:03:26.160> they<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.519> fly<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.000> maybe

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
working because they can fly and maybe

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.900 
working because they can fly and maybe
the<00:03:27.630> feathers<00:03:28.019> will<00:03:28.350> fly<00:03:28.680> out<00:03:28.709> know<00:03:29.220> whatever

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
the feathers will fly out know whatever

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.420 
the feathers will fly out know whatever
your<00:03:30.840> reasoning<00:03:31.200> behind<00:03:31.350> this<00:03:31.650> is<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.280> we

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
your reasoning behind this is but we

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.789 
your reasoning behind this is but we
have<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.579> mushroom<00:03:32.970> here<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.450> Fisher<00:03:34.380> mushrooms

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
have a mushroom here so Fisher mushrooms

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.520 
have a mushroom here so Fisher mushrooms
can't<00:03:35.010> fly<00:03:35.220> so<00:03:35.549> you<00:03:35.910> know<00:03:36.079> let's<00:03:37.079> kill<00:03:37.500> that

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
can't fly so you know let's kill that

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.280 
can't fly so you know let's kill that
and<00:03:38.070> as<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.030> see<00:03:39.060> here<00:03:39.450> yes<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:39.989> just<00:03:40.019> came

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
and as you can see here yes it just came

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.500 
and as you can see here yes it just came
to<00:03:40.470> me<00:03:40.590> again<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:40.950> this<00:03:41.100> does<00:03:41.370> work<00:03:41.510> underwater

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
to me again so this does work underwater

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.880 
to me again so this does work underwater
too<00:03:42.959> um<00:03:44.060> some<00:03:45.060> tips<00:03:45.390> basically<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.079> that<00:03:46.410> you

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
too um some tips basically is that you

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.430 
too um some tips basically is that you
should<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:48.090> block<00:03:48.390> about<00:03:48.720> one<00:03:49.109> block

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
should have to block about one block

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.150 
should have to block about one block
above<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.130> this<00:03:50.340> is<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.819> best<00:03:51.420> um<00:03:52.109> this<00:03:52.980> is

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
above you this is the best um this is

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.729 
above you this is the best um this is
the<00:03:53.280> most<00:03:53.430> reliable<00:03:53.760> form<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.630> still<00:03:55.500> wouldn't

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
the most reliable form I still wouldn't

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.860 
the most reliable form I still wouldn't
recommend<00:03:56.220> doing<00:03:56.310> it<00:03:56.579> over<00:03:56.700> lava<00:03:57.030> like<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.630> did

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
recommend doing it over lava like I did

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.809
