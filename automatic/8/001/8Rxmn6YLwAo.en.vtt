Car and I'm making this video because I
have<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> problem<00:00:21.900> where<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> think<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.769> have<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
have a problem where I think I have the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.310 
have a problem where I think I have the
blended<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.640> issue<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.570> dashboard<00:00:25.230> is

blended or issue or the dashboard is
making<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> clicking<00:00:26.070> sound<00:00:26.449> but<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> figured

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
making the clicking sound but I figured

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
making the clicking sound but I figured
I'd<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.140> more<00:00:29.099> advice<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.849> at<00:00:30.119> least

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830

some<00:00:31.830> agreement<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:32.790> at<00:00:33.149> least<00:00:34.460> to<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.610> if<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
some agreement or at least to see if it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.060 
some agreement or at least to see if it
is<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.450> issue<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.809> hand<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.200> think<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.649> but

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
is the issue at hand I think it is but

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
is the issue at hand I think it is but
I'm<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.670> looking<00:00:38.940> forward<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.270> taking<00:00:39.390> the

dash<00:00:39.809> part<00:00:40.200> hopefully<00:00:40.710> I'm<00:00:40.770> wrong<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.309> maybe

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
dash part hopefully I'm wrong or maybe

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.000 
dash part hopefully I'm wrong or maybe
it's<00:00:41.670> something<00:00:41.879> else<00:00:42.350> because<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.739> went<00:00:43.890> away

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it's something else because it went away

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.930 
it's something else because it went away
and<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.670> came<00:00:44.879> back<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:46.800> only<00:00:47.370> came<00:00:47.700> back
