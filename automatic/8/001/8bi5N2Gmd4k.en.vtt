this<00:00:00.480> is<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:00.690> quick<00:00:01.050> video<00:00:01.230> of<00:00:01.500> our<00:00:01.589> Excel

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
this is a quick video of our Excel

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.190 
this is a quick video of our Excel
macros<00:00:02.460> in<00:00:02.669> this<00:00:03.030> video<00:00:03.389> I<00:00:03.419> want<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.899> show<00:00:04.140> you

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
macros in this video I want to show you

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.070 
macros in this video I want to show you
how<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.560> make<00:00:04.890> a<00:00:04.920> simple<00:00:05.310> very<00:00:05.850> simple<00:00:06.120> pump

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
how to make a simple very simple pump

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.360 
how to make a simple very simple pump
animation<00:00:07.680> where<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.890> can<00:00:08.010> actually<00:00:08.250> have<00:00:08.340> a

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
animation where you can actually have a

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.280 
animation where you can actually have a
button<00:00:08.580> that<00:00:08.790> turns<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> pump<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:10.019> button

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
button that turns on a pump and a button

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.740 
button that turns on a pump and a button
that<00:00:10.410> turns<00:00:10.590> off<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.010> pump<00:00:11.240> so<00:00:12.240> let's<00:00:12.540> get

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
that turns off the pump so let's get

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.680 
that turns off the pump so let's get
started<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.440> we're<00:00:14.309> going<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.490> just<00:00:14.639> say<00:00:14.969> we're

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
started so we're going to just say we're

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.660 
started so we're going to just say we're
going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> say<00:00:16.070> J<00:00:17.240> 11<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> our<00:00:19.020> pump<00:00:19.320> area<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.580> we

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
going to say J 11 is our pump area so we

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.939 
going to say J 11 is our pump area so we
want<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.910> merge<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.270> center<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.800> this

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
want to merge and center this so this

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.650 
want to merge and center this so this
this<00:00:23.400> cell<00:00:23.670> will<00:00:23.880> actually<00:00:23.910> represent<00:00:24.539> our

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
this cell will actually represent our

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.330 
this cell will actually represent our
pump<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:25.680> we<00:00:25.769> actually<00:00:25.859> make<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
pump so if we actually make that a

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.609 
pump so if we actually make that a
little<00:00:26.580> block<00:00:27.170> all<00:00:28.170> right<00:00:28.289> now<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.529> not

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
little block all right now it's not

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.859 
little block all right now it's not
really<00:00:28.859> dealing<00:00:29.010> with<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> macros<00:00:29.699> yet<00:00:29.880> but

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
really dealing with the macros yet but

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.459 
really dealing with the macros yet but
let's<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.470> add<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> few<00:00:31.920> other<00:00:32.250> things

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
let's just add in a few other things

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:42.530 
let's just add in a few other things
shape<00:00:34.910> an<00:00:35.910> arrow<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:39.210> we<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.570> an<00:00:39.690> arrow<00:00:41.540> so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
shape an arrow so we have an arrow so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.060 
shape an arrow so we have an arrow so
now<00:00:44.149> make<00:00:45.149> all<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.629> outside<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.379> make

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
now make all the outside of this make

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.770 
now make all the outside of this make
the<00:00:47.160> outside<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.670> white<00:00:48.950> whoops<00:00:50.660> make<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the outside just white whoops make it

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.200 
the outside just white whoops make it
just<00:00:51.809> white<00:00:54.110> so<00:00:55.110> now<00:00:55.520> let's<00:00:56.520> make<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> where<00:00:57.030> we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
just white so now let's make it where we

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.029 
just white so now let's make it where we
add<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> button<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.199> will<00:00:58.289> make<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> green

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
add in a button that will make it green

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
add in a button that will make it green
and<00:00:59.280> red<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.239> it'll<00:01:00.480> actually<00:01:00.660> look<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and red so it'll actually look like a

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.210 
and red so it'll actually look like a
little<00:01:01.680> pump<00:01:01.890> animation<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> we'll<00:01:03.690> go<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.220> go

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
little pump animation so we'll go to go

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820 
little pump animation so we'll go to go
to<00:01:05.299> Microsoft<00:01:06.299> Excel<00:01:06.420> options<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.290> we'll

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
to Microsoft Excel options and we'll

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.500 
to Microsoft Excel options and we'll
make<00:01:08.070> sure<00:01:08.100> we<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.640> show<00:01:08.850> Developer<00:01:09.330> tab

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
make sure we have show Developer tab

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.289 
make sure we have show Developer tab
ribbon<00:01:09.900> checked<00:01:10.170> click<00:01:10.920> OK<00:01:11.250> then<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
ribbon checked click OK then go to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.320 
ribbon checked click OK then go to
developer<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.010> go<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.220> visual<00:01:14.520> basics<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
developer and go to visual basics and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.870 
developer and go to visual basics and
now<00:01:16.229> we're<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.680> playground<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.700> is

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
now we're in the playground this is

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
now we're in the playground this is
where<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.180> write<00:01:18.390> our<00:01:18.570> code<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.159> want

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
where we write our code so what I want

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
where we write our code so what I want
you<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.460> do<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> go<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.840> little<00:01:22.080> window

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
you to do is go to this little window

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.190 
you to do is go to this little window
and<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:22.740> click<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.330> insert<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:26.280> module

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
and right click and go insert to module

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.780 
and right click and go insert to module
so<00:01:28.200> now<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.009> module<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.610> can

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
so now we have a little module we can

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.730 
so now we have a little module we can
actually<00:01:30.060> write<00:01:30.240> our<00:01:30.390> code<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.650> you

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
actually write our code and I want you

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.460 
actually write our code and I want you
to<00:01:31.770> write<00:01:32.009> sub<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.900> want<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> name<00:01:34.439> our

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
to write sub now we want to name our

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.420 
to write sub now we want to name our
subroutine<00:01:35.070> I'm<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.460> say<00:01:35.610> pump<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:37.430> pump

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
subroutine I'm just a say pump on pump

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.240 
subroutine I'm just a say pump on pump
on<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:38.970> add<00:01:39.150> brackets<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.189> now<00:01:41.189> we

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
on and then we add brackets and now we

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.789 
on and then we add brackets and now we
have<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> subroutine<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.840> whenever<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.560> call

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
have a subroutine so whenever we call

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.380 
have a subroutine so whenever we call
pump<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:45.290> pop<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:47.060> oops

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
pump on pop on oops

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.289 
pump on pop on oops
whenever<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.470> call<00:01:49.619> pump<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:51.030> code

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
whenever we call pump on the code

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.609 
whenever we call pump on the code
between<00:01:51.509> sub<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.619> n<00:01:53.250> sub<00:01:53.490> will<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.909> performed

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
between sub and n sub will be performed

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.530 
between sub and n sub will be performed
so<00:01:55.619> what<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> want<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> do<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.579> go<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.939> our<00:01:57.360> little

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
so what I want to do is go to our little

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.120 
so what I want to do is go to our little
cell<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.380> make<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.619> red<00:01:58.890> or

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
cell and I want to make it red or

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.639 
cell and I want to make it red or
actually<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> want<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.270> make<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.509> green<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.530> we

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
actually I want to make it green so we

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.850 
actually I want to make it green so we
want<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> make<00:02:02.070> cell<00:02:03.649> j11

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
want to make cell j11

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.130 
want to make cell j11
green<00:02:05.719> so<00:02:06.719> we<00:02:06.899> do<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.469> by<00:02:07.770> saying<00:02:07.799> range<00:02:09.140> or

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
green so we do that by saying range or

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.660 
green so we do that by saying range or
so<00:02:10.440> there's<00:02:10.709> there's<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.160> lot<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.430> ways<00:02:11.550> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so there's there's a lot of ways of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.100 
so there's there's a lot of ways of
actually<00:02:11.819> doing<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.840> we're<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.020> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
actually doing this but we're going to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.350 
actually doing this but we're going to
save<00:02:13.230> range

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
save range

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.140 
save range

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you all these different options we can

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.650 
you all these different options we can
play<00:02:22.830> around<00:02:22.950> with<00:02:23.190> we're<00:02:23.940> going<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.239> go<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.450> an

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
play around with we're going to go to an

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.540 
play around with we're going to go to an
interior<00:02:25.160> dot<00:02:26.160> color<00:02:27.110> index<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:29.010> we're<00:02:29.190> going

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
interior dot color index and we're going

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.520 
interior dot color index and we're going
to<00:02:29.580> say<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.150> equal<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.510> four<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.930> believe

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
to say it is equal to four I believe

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.729 
to say it is equal to four I believe
four<00:02:32.010> makes<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.430> green<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.380> right<00:02:34.380> now<00:02:34.530> it's

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
four makes it green so right now it's

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.949 
four makes it green so right now it's
white<00:02:35.300> and<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.930> click<00:02:37.170> play<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:39.420> should<00:02:39.780> be

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
white and if we click play it should be

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.520 
white and if we click play it should be
green<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> now<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:41.880> green<00:02:42.239> what<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.290> want<00:02:43.470> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
green so now it's green what we want to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.009 
green so now it's green what we want to
do<00:02:43.620> next<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.480> copy<00:02:45.480> and<00:02:45.629> paste<00:02:45.930> us<00:02:47.810> copy<00:02:48.810> and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
do next is copy and paste us copy and

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.720 
do next is copy and paste us copy and
paste<00:02:49.170> is<00:02:49.349> change<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.250> name<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
paste is change the name of the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.020 
paste is change the name of the
subroutine<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.510> off<00:02:52.519> we<00:02:53.519> want<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.730> make<00:02:53.819> this

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
subroutine to off we want to make this

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.600 
subroutine to off we want to make this
three<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.870> believe<00:02:55.349> when<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.620> three<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.250> red

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
three I believe when it's three it's red

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.610 
three I believe when it's three it's red
and<00:02:58.069> now<00:02:59.069> if<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.280> click<00:02:59.489> play<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.030> should<00:03:00.620> be

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
and now if we click play it should be

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.069 
and now if we click play it should be
red<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.940> now<00:03:03.180> how<00:03:03.360> do<00:03:03.420> we<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.840> like<00:03:04.049> a

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
red so now how do we make it like a

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.280 
red so now how do we make it like a
little<00:03:04.170> pump<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.040> we'll<00:03:05.220> go<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.340> insert<00:03:05.880> and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
little pump so we'll go to insert and

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.380 
little pump so we'll go to insert and
we're<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> insert<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:08.010> control<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.790> form

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
we're going to insert a control a form

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.699 
we're going to insert a control a form
control<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.900> just<00:03:10.079> a<00:03:10.170> little<00:03:10.319> button

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
control and it's just a little button

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.220 
control and it's just a little button
right<00:03:10.739> there<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:12.269> we'll<00:03:12.420> click<00:03:12.540> insert<00:03:12.959> oops

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
right there so we'll click insert oops

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.349 
right there so we'll click insert oops
right<00:03:16.230> there<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.739> now<00:03:17.400> we<00:03:17.459> can<00:03:17.700> assign<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.269> a

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
right there and now we can assign it a

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.629 
right there and now we can assign it a
macro<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.139> those<00:03:19.680> are<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.950> subroutines<00:03:20.519> we

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
macro and those are the subroutines we

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.460 
macro and those are the subroutines we
just<00:03:21.000> wrote<00:03:21.269> we're<00:03:21.810> going<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.019> have<00:03:22.139> this<00:03:22.260> one

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
just wrote we're going to have this one

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.660 
just wrote we're going to have this one
be<00:03:22.590> on<00:03:22.819> will<00:03:23.819> click<00:03:24.000> OK<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:25.260> we'll<00:03:25.410> click<00:03:25.670> or

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
be on will click OK and we'll click or

be on will click OK and we'll click or
right<00:03:26.730> click<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:28.040> name<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.220> oh<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.000> now

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
right click and name it oh and so now

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.690 
right click and name it oh and so now
when<00:03:30.389> we<00:03:30.420> click<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.109> makes<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.560> green<00:03:31.799> we'll

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
when we click it it makes it green we'll

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.370 
when we click it it makes it green we'll
do<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:32.970> same<00:03:33.299> thing<00:03:33.540> by<00:03:33.720> inserting<00:03:34.109> another

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
do this same thing by inserting another

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.699 
do this same thing by inserting another
button<00:03:37.010> insert<00:03:38.010> another<00:03:38.280> button<00:03:38.609> and<00:03:39.709> we'll

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
button insert another button and we'll

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:46.340 
button insert another button and we'll
go<00:03:40.859> off<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:42.630> we'll<00:03:42.720> say<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:42.930> one<00:03:43.230> is<00:03:43.350> off<00:03:45.350> so

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
go off and we'll say that one is off so

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.910 
go off and we'll say that one is off so
now<00:03:46.709> we<00:03:47.639> have<00:03:47.819> a<00:03:47.850> simple<00:03:48.389> little<00:03:49.200> animation

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
now we have a simple little animation

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.430 
now we have a simple little animation
for<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> pump<00:03:50.549> so<00:03:51.540> let's<00:03:51.750> actually<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.230> the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
for a pump so let's actually have the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.250 
for a pump so let's actually have the
pump<00:03:52.620> sight<00:03:52.769> on<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.250> off<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.329> off<00:03:54.420> so

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
pump sight on and off on and off so

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.890 
pump sight on and off on and off so
we'll<00:03:55.410> go<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.530> visual<00:03:55.950> basic<00:03:56.160> Segen<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.720> we'll

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
we'll go to visual basic Segen and we'll

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.020 
we'll go to visual basic Segen and we'll
copy<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:58.620> part<00:03:58.889> range<00:03:59.959> dot<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.849> we'll<00:04:02.849> say

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
copy this part range dot and we'll say

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.050 
copy this part range dot and we'll say
value<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.079> value<00:04:04.410> of<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.590> cell<00:04:04.829> is<00:04:05.060> equal

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
value so the value of the cell is equal

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.220 
value so the value of the cell is equal
to<00:04:06.299> on<00:04:07.549> for<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.090> now<00:04:09.299> I'll<00:04:09.480> say<00:04:09.660> on<00:04:09.930> when

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
to on for that so now I'll say on when

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.420 
to on for that so now I'll say on when
we<00:04:10.319> click<00:04:10.560> that<00:04:12.139> copy<00:04:13.139> whoops<00:04:13.849> copy<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.239> paste

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
we click that copy whoops copy and paste

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.599 
we click that copy whoops copy and paste
so<00:04:17.430> now<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:18.060> should<00:04:18.209> say<00:04:18.389> on<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.870> off<00:04:19.340> or<00:04:20.340> when

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
so now it should say on and off or when

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.640 
so now it should say on and off or when
I<00:04:20.639> did<00:04:20.880> edit<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.229> should<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:22.470> off

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
I did edit it so that should be off

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.760 
I did edit it so that should be off
so<00:04:25.190> on<00:04:25.699> and<00:04:26.060> off<00:04:26.180> and<00:04:26.780> let's<00:04:27.050> actually<00:04:27.229> change

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
so on and off and let's actually change

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.950 
so on and off and let's actually change
the<00:04:28.010> color<00:04:28.040> of<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:29.570> black<00:04:30.020> and<00:04:31.780> make<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.930> a

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
the color of that to black and make it a

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.780 
the color of that to black and make it a
little<00:04:33.080> bigger<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:34.540> bold<00:04:35.540> it

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
little bigger and bold it

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.990 
little bigger and bold it
so<00:04:38.800> let's<00:04:39.800> actually<00:04:39.889> change<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.580> background

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
so let's actually change the background

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:50.890 
so let's actually change the background
of<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.180> color<00:04:41.419> it's<00:04:42.080> not<00:04:42.260> really<00:04:49.720> so<00:04:50.720> yeah

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
of that color it's not really so yeah

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.600 
of that color it's not really so yeah
it's<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.229> that's<00:04:51.410> good<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:54.560> there<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.280> have<00:04:55.340> a

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
it's a that's good so there you have a

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.960 
it's a that's good so there you have a
very<00:04:55.970> simple<00:04:56.500> little<00:04:57.500> pump<00:04:57.770> animation<00:04:58.340> in<00:04:58.460> the

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
very simple little pump animation in the

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.240 
very simple little pump animation in the
next<00:04:59.360> video<00:04:59.660> I'll<00:04:59.840> actually<00:04:59.990> show<00:05:00.229> you<00:05:00.470> how<00:05:01.190> to

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
next video I'll actually show you how to

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.640 
next video I'll actually show you how to
have<00:05:01.490> this<00:05:01.669> actually<00:05:02.090> fill<00:05:02.389> up<00:05:02.570> a<00:05:02.690> tank<00:05:02.870> not

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
have this actually fill up a tank not

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.800 
have this actually fill up a tank not
the<00:05:03.800> tank<00:05:04.160> animation<00:05:04.610> itself<00:05:04.940> but<00:05:05.600> how<00:05:05.750> to

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
the tank animation itself but how to

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.230 
the tank animation itself but how to
actually<00:05:06.050> show<00:05:06.289> you<00:05:06.350> how<00:05:06.500> to<00:05:06.560> add<00:05:06.830> in<00:05:07.220> say<00:05:07.970> when

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
actually show you how to add in say when

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.850 
actually show you how to add in say when
this<00:05:08.360> pump<00:05:08.570> is<00:05:08.660> on<00:05:08.780> every<00:05:09.110> second<00:05:09.440> add<00:05:09.620> in

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
this pump is on every second add in

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.490 
this pump is on every second add in
three<00:05:10.250> liters<00:05:10.610> of<00:05:10.820> fluid<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.389> this<00:05:11.600> tank<00:05:11.900> I'll

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
three liters of fluid to this tank I'll

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.990 
three liters of fluid to this tank I'll
show<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:12.830> how<00:05:12.979> to<00:05:13.039> do<00:05:13.190> that<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.729> next

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
show you how to do that in the next
