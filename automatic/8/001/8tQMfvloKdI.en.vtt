00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.620
 good friends of hdblog we are with the city o 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.320
 then the technology director of 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.790
 vodafone I wanted to ask 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.189
 something more specific than his networks 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.800
 because today vodafone presented the 4g 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.420
 blues believed what the 4 c plus is 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.930
 wanted to reach then how it reaches her to 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.820
 this speed 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.160
 then maybe I'll tell you a moment 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.860
 you must always keep in mind that everything 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.059
 it is based on the frequencies we have 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.690
 available 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.670
 then yes 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.440
 with the memory we return to September of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 2011 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.860
 the year in which the tender was made for 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:50.130
 the allocation of lte or 4g frequencies 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.030
 vodafone won 10 mega hertz of 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.050
 800 megahertz frequency spectrum 5 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.270
 spectrum makers on the thousand frequency 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.180
 815 frequency spectrum maggert 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.890
 26 frequencies are more valuable when 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.170
 They are lower then the eight hundred more 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.860
 prized by a milan penetration a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.360
 much higher indoor penetrations 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.040
 how it happened that five megs 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.530
 respect on the 1800s 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.870
 let's say a little wasted if not 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.500
 think we also have 15 May ergs 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.730
 of spectrum we had on the csm on csm it is done 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.410
 voice and sms 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.590
 therefore now unused we say then 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.469
 we say used 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.399
 less and above all less exploited 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.200
 present that when passing from the gsm 3g 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.600
 efficiency doubles when passing 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.670
 from 3g to 4g and vicente doubles by 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.920
 new so i can bring a lot more 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.920
 information on 3g technologies 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.209
 compared to 3g 4g compared to 3g then 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.539
 we started working for 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:54.119
 be able to move 5 mag ars first 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.299
 specter of 1800 that was on gsm on 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.880
 so everyone can do 10 and 10 e 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.030
 then in the past few months we have worked 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.159
 further to move to 35 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.500
 still think a lot of voice 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.149
 goes on gsm so this work must 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.470
 be done with great caution because 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.540
 however, we always want to ensure 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.269
 the highest quality on the item 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.159
 here we have succeeded now in 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.819
 compress the gsm voice in 5 May 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.250
 hearts earning 15 out of 1800 then 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.880
 today we can use repeat 10 megs 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.130
 in the nineteenth century 15 out of a thousand 815 out of 27 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.950
 obviously having more band a 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.410
 speed increased the 4g 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.860
 plus it lets you do allows 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.440
 put together pairs of frequencies 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.450
 different so I can use 10 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.920
 mega hertz of the nineteenth century together with the 15 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.860
 of 1800 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.200
 or so club but we are sorry ships 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.560
 held in a video 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.260
 or 15 of 1800 together with 15 of 26 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.380
 or the 10 of 800 together with 15 of 26 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.630
 when they get together 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.910
 bangkok and frequency bands and with lo 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.250
 major spectrum villas 826 is reached 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.740
 the 225 megabits know I'm not 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.380
 absolutely bad that i am a 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.330
 great result that I am a 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.240
 great result as I said why 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.450
 in ten years we have gone from 384 kb to 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.940
 300 megabits at 225 megabits per second per 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.150
 a thousand and I believe that together with karama the 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.070
 lazio absolutely demand us want 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.780
 specific phones for this 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.190
 matching of identical bands only there 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.490
 they want phones that are called 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.750
 category 6 Oct six at this time 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.020
 those that we provide 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:44.570
 are the samsung samsung alpha the galaxy 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:47.810
 samsung note 4 and then you will have law law 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.380
 66 ain't no shit so can't 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.560
 use 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.560
 45 maybe there's a dick 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.020
 the prices remain the same 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.360
 or this plus will need a 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.990
 add on subscription but this one now 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.640
 it is not I can not comment which 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.110
 commercial aspects because they are not there 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.940
 I know enough I don't want to say 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.770
 of the blunders surely entails 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.530
 major technology investments 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.360
 which however discharge on the quality of the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.970
 service that because upstream of the 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.950
 repeater there will be fiber cables 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.650
 however exactly the bra girls 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.020
 many with pulled at very high speed 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.070
 which obviously require investments 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.080
 important 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.720
 last user question from user 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.360
 vodafone of the road I noticed in Milan 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.040
 and a deterioration over the months 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.780
 past 3g benefits and why it is 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.120
 excavated by implementing the 4gb state 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.520
 working a lot on the radio bridges on 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.340
 repeaters 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.530
 then I 'm sorry if he did it 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.259
 bad experiences and all the times that 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.240
 we find the important thing is to have 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.300
 where this happened to intervene 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.490
 because then I am a passionate feels 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.099
 i like you posted me on your own 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.349
 for this reason, therefore, since 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:08.509
 bad to know that I'll explain to him 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.250
 this 3g what happens what 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:12.650
 it can actually happen that maybe 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.590
 even going up the data load in 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.659
 some situations of the day le 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.150
 conditions can worsen unfortunately 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:22.610
 or even the type of phones you are looking for 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.349
 noticed this own decline 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.449
 previously then to the large space 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.039
 in 4 g s 4g in Milan and neighboring is 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.349
 really very very extended a lot 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.590
 widespread, however, is not linked the thing not 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.569
 it must be so if success 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.800
 send me send me the information 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:38.629
 precise that to intervene 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.590
 okay thanks on the application 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:45.800
 upload with this plus improve 4g 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.740
 plus does not improve upload by itself 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.150
 we remain on 35 megabits per second but 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.909
 we are setting up new ones 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.099
 technologies such as four-way diversity 

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.199
 which will allow us to increase the 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:58.950
 performance especially on the cell basis 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.660
 so even there having an error 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.790
 a more basic form cell performance 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.720
 also on the contribution thanks a lot kind 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.720
 thank you goodbye
