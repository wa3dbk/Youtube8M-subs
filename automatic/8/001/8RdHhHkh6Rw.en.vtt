00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
don't know and I don't think it's a

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.480 
don't know and I don't think it's a
Japanese<00:06:02.260> take<00:06:02.470> it<00:06:02.590> on<00:06:02.710> think<00:06:03.040> it's<00:06:03.160> very<00:06:03.370> much

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
Japanese take it on think it's very much

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.390 
Japanese take it on think it's very much
of<00:06:03.850> a<00:06:03.940> Western<00:06:04.510> cultural<00:06:05.020> thing<00:06:05.400> next

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
of a Western cultural thing next

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.280 
of a Western cultural thing next
question<00:06:06.790> so<00:06:07.390> um<00:06:07.510> I<00:06:07.600> don't<00:06:07.660> think<00:06:07.810> that's<00:06:08.140> the

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
question so um I don't think that's the

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.200 
question so um I don't think that's the
case<00:06:08.530> between<00:06:09.040> them<00:06:09.220> I<00:06:09.340> get<00:06:09.520> that<00:06:09.700> and<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.150> get

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
case between them I get that and I get

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:11.700 
case between them I get that and I get
that<00:06:10.330> question<00:06:10.630> a<00:06:10.900> lot<00:06:10.930> though<00:06:11.380> and<00:06:11.590> I<00:06:11.650> don't

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
that question a lot though and I don't

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.440 
that question a lot though and I don't
really<00:06:11.890> think<00:06:12.010> that's<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.430> case<00:06:12.640> and<00:06:12.910> and

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
really think that's the case and and

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.160 
really think that's the case and and
