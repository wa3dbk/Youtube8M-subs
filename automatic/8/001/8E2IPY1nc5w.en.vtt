if you buy a wired mouse

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.580 
if you buy a wired mouse
why<00:02:20.950> doesn't<00:02:21.370> go<00:02:21.459> as<00:02:21.640> far<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.329> used<00:02:23.319> to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
why doesn't go as far as it used to

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.690 
why doesn't go as far as it used to
cuz<00:02:24.930> sometimes<00:02:27.840> wires<00:02:28.840> like<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:30.400> one

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
cuz sometimes wires like that that one

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.990 
cuz sometimes wires like that that one
maybe<00:02:31.090> centimeters<00:02:31.750> or<00:02:31.900> something<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.640> having
