00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.960
 Gleason 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.800
 It is a new tire s 20 yeah 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.809
 It is referred to as the previous model Is it 016 pro 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.370
 Well I was No. 8 balance was good all-round, but this time as that of the successor model 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:54.010
 s 20 Well I think this s will be a sport-made front 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:56.500
 First of all I was running at La Pore え え 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.660
 It is low and there is a sound and January is already 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
 hy 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.320
 Are you talking about once or twice ? 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.170
 Daughter-in-law is a little to the state, such as frozen 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.530
 Getting dry 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:12.159
 If the road surface temperature is very low, I would like to run a little 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.250
 First I thought Naa can not enjoy today Well 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:19.990
 First week and two weeks of circuit driving 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.030
 I just do not to eat supermarket it is you were an ordinary tire I in Sonomanma 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.080
 I have a sense of grounding soon 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.520
 Properly the feeling that suddenly firmly caught the eye of, but I do not grip 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:35.329
 And I wish it a great place that Tteyuu veil 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:38.020
 The initial grip is very good even at low road surface temperature A place with a sense of stability and a sense of security 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:42.640
 It There was first a great good 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.370
 The other one is you do it's a wet patch so it's also effective 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.820
 Haha is flowing 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.369
 When passing over it 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.340
 It's normal if the wet patch is where you go after sleeping a motorcycle 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 Even without taking action 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.899
 It is also the funnel to slide buddy next to a little 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:06.670
 I think this is normal if you want to lie next to rear too 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:12.040
 Running at the same speed and trying on the same vehicle immediately 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:16.810
 You've slipped so far It 's better to go 2 pars without hesitation 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.530
 It becomes a little any good even if Mesmerize of there and say did not skate in the same Bankaku for a little while ago 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.920
 I mean 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.510
 The wet performance is good enough to fall into the illusion 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:30.799
 Surface area than very large 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:33.200
 The feeling that I'm catching the road surface as a whole has a sense of stability or is it a little? 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.390
 It's like I'm capturing life on the surface of 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.390
 After all if it runs on the wet road surface with this 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:45.350
 I think I'd say whether it is a surface that water will ride 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.100
 Is it rubbery , does it point to the wet road surface properly 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.670
 After all 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:56.250
 Properly is I bomb room is this compound 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.120
 By di or firmly It is bite after the Great Hanshin because even asphalt in the wet road surface 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.090
 It is said that 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.150
 If you look at the identification of s Nieman 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.280
 Two-wheeled tires and professional movement 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.010
 circuit 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.700
 It's about taking some space between the hull and so much More from 016 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.370
 Widely 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:20.180
 It's taking much larger than the more and more polo movement than the Street 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.270
 Since the grip force is getting better it is around say the norm is by Nemaa s 20 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.620
 It is a loss that I had a high grip on a dry road surface 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.120
 Rice was very good though 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.010
 I say that I thought good 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:37.030
 That there is a sense of security properly even when the road surface temperature is cold and when the tires are not warmed up 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:41.709
 Professional to Bara' that this bass is very done by say 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:47.560
 Wet about the other was one amazing is that we said it is the wet performance is there to 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:48.110
 Plus is life to have Come So in this is what today is and say I wonder what 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.290
 Naa 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:57.440
 I didn't go to Guam in the f- test 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:02.810
 Looking at the overall surface, it's about 3 hours a day today, but it's 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:05.390
 Vale type of tire that last 3 because it is not a feeling will melt to mush 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.140
 So I guess that's not too bad 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.770
 That means 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:15.640
 Good grip, low bass and good wet 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.470
 In the same tire of this really until now it is or was a life is good 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.310
 This is in the form of covering the whole area 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.790
 Well I thought it was amazing to try running a little 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:32.370
 It 's a good idea that all things get better It's not like this kind of tire 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:35.550
 Would I thought I But now considerably and be compounds that are buying it is this time evolution 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.460
 Improve the rubber quality until 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.669
 It was a tire that can be played on the dry road so pretty 016 pro 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:48.210
 Now this time is all situations, right? 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:48.210
 So say I wonder if say I also If you proceed with this to anyone 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:55.760
 Burning's Naa but I'm very kind No. 2 does not give strength to put Hirofumi in person to the superscalar 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.110
 Matsunaka 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.030
 3 is a ne 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:06.210
 Maybe corresponding sense of security to people who run to the slow feet and have at it a 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:10.170
 Even people who want to run away the winding and want to run 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.930
 Maybe there is a sense of security from the beginning of the fly 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:18.280
 And I was able to feel the go in communion 1 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.820
 Properly that to when I was a cinch and against It is Romeo Mishima another Guigui 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.969
 Is to say that the feeling of recommend even a little will come stretched 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.330
 very 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:27.840
 It is a tire that is easy to put on because feedback is good 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.470
 It Was there Kedomo there is a sense of security 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.370
 This is not- 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.260
 Hey That's right 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.930
 There are so many people 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.930
 I wonder if it is a tire that can be satisfied 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.620
 As Bridgestone's new mule tire s 20 came to mind 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:51.290
 a 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.419
 I was taking a test drive, but it was intense that it was done together 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.990
 Masu 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:58.980
 Thank you in advance 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.840
 It's also a real name. It's famous for a good rider. 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.060
 It looks like today 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.820
 0100000000 I think I was able to return in place of wear and professional 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.660
 It There was something new card try instead that wear 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.420
