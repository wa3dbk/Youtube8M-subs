first gameplay I first time I ever

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
first gameplay I first time I ever
played<00:00:29.580> modern<00:00:29.910> warfare<00:00:30.179> 3<00:00:30.420> but<00:00:30.900> in<00:00:31.560> this

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
played modern warfare 3 but in this

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.680 
played modern warfare 3 but in this
video<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.099> wanted<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> talk<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.790> how<00:00:33.660> to

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
video I wanted to talk about how to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.240 
video I wanted to talk about how to
level<00:00:34.020> off<00:00:34.110> fast<00:00:34.380> mother<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.800> three<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.070> four

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
level off fast mother of three and four

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.370 
level off fast mother of three and four
thinking<00:00:35.489> how<00:00:35.640> how<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.719> that<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:37.170> you

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
thinking how how can you do that if you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.979 
thinking how how can you do that if you
played<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.800> game<00:00:38.360> I've<00:00:39.360> been<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:39.870> know

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
played one game I've been you know

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.860 
played one game I've been you know
looking<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.850> everything<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.480> months<00:00:42.809> now

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
looking at everything for months now

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.690 
looking at everything for months now
figuring<00:00:43.469> out<00:00:43.649> what<00:00:43.860> would<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> fastest

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
figuring out what would be the fastest

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.920 
figuring out what would be the fastest
way<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.879> level<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.180> fast<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
way to level up fast so this is kind of

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.690 
way to level up fast so this is kind of
like<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> first<00:00:46.410> impressions<00:00:46.739> video<00:00:47.100> i'll<00:00:47.430> be

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to say is the best to level up fast

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
to say is the best to level up fast
because<00:01:19.560> you're<00:01:19.680> killstreaks<00:01:20.189> don't<00:01:20.520> reset

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
because you're killstreaks don't reset

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030

on death the killstreak i would use

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
on death the killstreak i would use
