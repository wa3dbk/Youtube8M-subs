take<00:02:34.190> too<00:02:34.250> many<00:02:34.520> casualties<00:02:34.790> because<00:02:35.240> of

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
take too many casualties because of

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.120 
take too many casualties because of
their<00:02:35.630> hormone<00:02:36.110> health<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.560> indeed<00:02:36.920> they

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
their hormone health and indeed they

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.590 
their hormone health and indeed they
don't<00:02:39.640> so<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.880> lead<00:02:41.000> Nordics<00:02:41.390> are

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
don't so the lead Nordics are

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.550 
don't so the lead Nordics are
significantly<00:02:42.200> outmatched<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:43.010> health<00:02:43.670> armor

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
significantly outmatched in health armor

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.140 
significantly outmatched in health armor
but<00:02:45.560> they<00:02:45.680> have<00:02:45.830> the<00:02:46.130> better<00:02:46.310> charge<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.030> they

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
but they have the better charge and they

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.730 
but they have the better charge and they
have<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.450> better<00:02:47.600> meta<00:02:47.930> attack<00:02:48.050> so<00:02:48.410> let's<00:02:48.590> see

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
have the better meta attack so let's see

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.790 
have the better meta attack so let's see
if<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.130> enough<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.520> win<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.760> day<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:53.800> I'm

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
if that is enough to win the day and I'm

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.680 
if that is enough to win the day and I'm
being<00:02:54.980> nice<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.640> these<00:02:55.760> pachoo<00:02:56.150> of<00:02:56.300> nobles

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
being nice to these pachoo of nobles

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:04.660 
being nice to these pachoo of nobles
here<00:02:56.930> because<00:03:00.880> yeah<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:03.190> could<00:03:04.190> have<00:03:04.280> put<00:03:04.489> them

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
here because yeah I could have put them

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.410 
here because yeah I could have put them
up<00:03:04.790> against<00:03:05.180> much<00:03:05.450> worse<00:03:05.870> units

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.170 

or<00:03:11.420> mean<00:03:12.050> better<00:03:12.350> units<00:03:12.800> really<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.910> the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
or mean better units really so the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.090 
or mean better units really so the
bejeweled<00:03:14.390> novels<00:03:14.840> absolutely<00:03:15.560> stomp<00:03:15.890> all

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
bejeweled novels absolutely stomp all

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.220 
bejeweled novels absolutely stomp all
over<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.790> Nordics<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:20.120> Nordics<00:03:20.540> are<00:03:20.720> not

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
over the Nordics the Nordics are not

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.900 
over the Nordics the Nordics are not
give<00:03:21.530> units<00:03:21.800> here<00:03:21.980> we<00:03:22.100> have<00:03:22.220> the<00:03:22.340> Nordics<00:03:22.700> in

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
give units here we have the Nordics in

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.820 
give units here we have the Nordics in
shield-wall

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
shield-wall

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.360 
shield-wall
elite<00:03:24.830> nordic<00:03:25.160> warriors<00:03:25.489> in<00:03:25.610> shield<00:03:25.880> wall<00:03:27.370> and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
elite nordic warriors in shield wall and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.010 
elite nordic warriors in shield wall and
this<00:03:28.580> just<00:03:28.819> goes<00:03:29.000> to<00:03:29.030> show<00:03:29.330> how<00:03:29.360> important

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
this just goes to show how important

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.740 
this just goes to show how important
shield<00:03:30.350> wall<00:03:30.500> is<00:03:30.709> for<00:03:30.950> unit<00:03:31.480> even<00:03:32.480> though<00:03:32.569> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
shield wall is for unit even though the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.800 
shield wall is for unit even though the
Nordics<00:03:33.080> have<00:03:33.230> both<00:03:33.470> precursors<00:03:34.130> armed<00:03:34.850> DS<00:03:35.569> in

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
Nordics have both precursors armed DS in

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.530 
Nordics have both precursors armed DS in
charge<00:03:36.110> when<00:03:37.100> they<00:03:37.280> are<00:03:37.430> involved<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.300> is

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
charge when they are involved this is

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.660 
charge when they are involved this is
how<00:03:38.750> much<00:03:39.050> better<00:03:39.110> they<00:03:39.830> do<00:03:39.890> against<00:03:40.550> the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
how much better they do against the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.699 
how much better they do against the
jeweled<00:03:40.970> Nobles

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
jeweled Nobles

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.180 
jeweled Nobles
so<00:03:42.709> they<00:03:43.130> lost<00:03:43.400> on<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.700> charge<00:03:43.970> they<00:03:44.780> lost

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
so they lost on the charge they lost

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.030 
so they lost on the charge they lost
badly<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.900> shield<00:03:48.200> wall<00:03:48.380> they're<00:03:48.860> able

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
badly but this shield wall they're able

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.580 
badly but this shield wall they're able
to<00:03:49.220> turn<00:03:49.459> around<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:50.030> straight-up<00:03:50.330> defeat<00:03:50.870> into

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
to turn around a straight-up defeat into

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.890 
to turn around a straight-up defeat into
a<00:03:52.100> situation<00:03:52.459> where<00:03:53.060> they<00:03:53.269> defeat<00:03:53.660> their

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
a situation where they defeat their

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.250 
a situation where they defeat their
enemy<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.709> they<00:03:55.459> have<00:03:55.730> let's<00:03:56.239> see<00:03:56.420> well<00:03:57.080> only

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
enemy and they have let's see well only

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.199 
enemy and they have let's see well only
about<00:03:57.530> 40<00:03:57.980> min<00:03:58.130> remaining<00:03:58.430> but<00:03:58.730> the

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
about 40 min remaining but the

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.059 
about 40 min remaining but the
difference<00:03:59.630> between<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:01.819> enemy<00:04:02.209> having<00:04:03.069> 88

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
difference between the enemy having 88

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.559 
difference between the enemy having 88
men<00:04:04.280> remaining<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.819> you<00:04:05.510> having<00:04:06.760> 40<00:04:07.760> and<00:04:07.970> 34

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
men remaining and you having 40 and 34

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.900 
men remaining and you having 40 and 34
min<00:04:08.720> remaining<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.200> quite<00:04:09.440> substantial<00:04:09.730> so<00:04:10.730> if

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
min remaining is quite substantial so if

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.699 
min remaining is quite substantial so if
these<00:04:11.090> units<00:04:11.510> got<00:04:11.720> shield<00:04:12.050> wall<00:04:12.290> they<00:04:12.500> might

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
these units got shield wall they might

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.580 
these units got shield wall they might
be<00:04:12.980> very<00:04:13.280> good<00:04:13.519> but<00:04:14.299> without<00:04:14.989> shield<00:04:15.290> walls

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
be very good but without shield walls

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.830 
be very good but without shield walls
they<00:04:15.890> underperform<00:04:16.609> significantly<00:04:17.359> against

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
they underperform significantly against

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.580 
they underperform significantly against
units<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.380> have<00:04:18.950> shield<00:04:19.700> wall<00:04:20.590> strengthen

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
units that have shield wall strengthen

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.739 
units that have shield wall strengthen
over
