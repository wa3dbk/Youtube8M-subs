00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
now two seconds ago I just tried to do I

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.309 
now two seconds ago I just tried to do I
tried<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.489> crawl<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.849> with<00:02:18.030> my<00:02:18.540> flat<00:02:18.750> iron<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
tried to crawl it with my flat iron and

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.940 
tried to crawl it with my flat iron and
it<00:02:20.159> didn't<00:02:20.459> work<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:21.060> I'm<00:02:22.049> not<00:02:22.319> sure<00:02:22.560> if

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
it didn't work and I I'm not sure if

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.009 
it didn't work and I I'm not sure if
that's<00:02:23.189> because<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.269> don't<00:02:24.689> know<00:02:24.870> how

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
that's because I just I don't know how

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.440 
that's because I just I don't know how
to<00:02:25.109> curl<00:02:25.379> with<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.560> flat<00:02:25.859> iron<00:02:26.069> or<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:27.420> just

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to curl with the flat iron or it just

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.679 
to curl with the flat iron or it just
doesn't<00:02:27.689> work<00:02:28.049> so<00:02:28.560> i<00:02:28.920> decided<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.670> plug<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.209> my

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.199 
doesn't work so i decided to plug in my
actual<00:02:31.170> curling<00:02:31.859> iron<00:02:32.040> curling<00:02:32.370> iron<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.909> see

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
if it would call with that and if it

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.009
