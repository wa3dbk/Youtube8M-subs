00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
um right off the bat I just didn't think

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.540 
um right off the bat I just didn't think
he<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.350> actually<00:00:40.469> end<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.100> going<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
he would actually end up going for the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.280

high<00:00:41.640> jump<00:00:41.670> kick<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.300> thought<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.809> he<00:00:43.110> may<00:00:43.260> be

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
high jump kick I thought that he may be

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.869 
high jump kick I thought that he may be
just<00:00:43.500> go<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.829> our<00:00:43.920> fake<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.280> which<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.579> why<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
just go for our fake out which is why I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.760 
just go for our fake out which is why I
went<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> u-turn<00:00:45.780> because<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.530> were

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
went for the u-turn because that were

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.190 
went for the u-turn because that were
the<00:00:46.920> u-turn<00:00:47.280> himself<00:00:47.910> which<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.840> why<00:00:48.960> would

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the u-turn himself which is why would

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.110 
the u-turn himself which is why would
force<00:00:49.680> Mario<00:00:49.980> nutrients<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.579> way<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> would

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
force Mario nutrients that way I would

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.880 
force Mario nutrients that way I would
end<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.360> getting<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.660> switch<00:00:51.960> advantage<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
end up getting the switch advantage but

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
end up getting the switch advantage but
that<00:00:53.309> doesn't<00:00:53.610> happen<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> end<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.360> going<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that doesn't happen so I end up going to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
that doesn't happen so I end up going to
my<00:00:54.809> gengar<00:00:55.260> now<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> i<00:00:56.309> am<00:00:56.610> not<00:00:56.640> going<00:00:57.000> to

hopefully it does a pretty good amount

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
hopefully it does a pretty good amount
of<00:01:21.990> damage<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.759> know<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.030> I'm

can<00:02:40.990> go<00:02:41.050> for<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> solar<00:02:41.500> beam<00:02:41.710> and<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.010> how<00:02:42.100> much

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
can go for a solar beam and see how much

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.460 
can go for a solar beam and see how much
it<00:02:42.400> does<00:02:42.580> um<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.660> know<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.810> really<00:02:44.140> could<00:02:44.440> have

one and like I said it's very hard to
for<00:03:47.980> me<00:03:48.070> for<00:03:48.250> whatever<00:03:48.400> reason<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.850> cannot<00:03:49.630> get

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
stuff over to probe you make very easily

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.580 
stuff over to probe you make very easily
at<00:03:51.520> all<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.730> don't<00:03:51.910> know<00:03:51.970> why<00:03:52.470> stuff<00:03:53.470> from

hopefully not too bad actually end up
going<00:04:26.719> for<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.930> knockoff<00:04:27.289> unfortunately<00:04:27.889> I

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
going for the knockoff unfortunately I

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:29.290 
going for the knockoff unfortunately I
kind<00:04:28.159> of<00:04:28.189> wish<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.490> went<00:04:28.669> for<00:04:28.759> the<00:04:28.879> earthquake

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
kind of wish I went for the earthquake

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.809 
kind of wish I went for the earthquake
there<00:04:29.479> but<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.500> just<00:04:30.740> didn't<00:04:31.219> really<00:04:31.430> know<00:04:31.610> want

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:31.819 
there but I just didn't really know want

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.159 
there but I just didn't really know want
to<00:04:31.879> risk<00:04:32.030> it<00:04:32.240> although<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.539> probably<00:04:32.810> should

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
to risk it although I probably should

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.140 
to risk it although I probably should
because<00:04:33.319> again<00:04:33.979> later<00:04:34.250> is<00:04:34.400> t<00:04:34.580> really<00:04:34.849> going<00:04:35.090> to

do anything to me at all and then I

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:37.839 
do anything to me at all and then I
could<00:04:36.800> have<00:04:36.919> knocked<00:04:37.069> him<00:04:37.250> out<00:04:37.280> there<00:04:37.610> I

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:37.849 
could have knocked him out there I

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.640 
could have knocked him out there I
wouldn't<00:04:38.180> well<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.689> wouldn't<00:04:39.439> necessarily

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
wouldn't well I wouldn't necessarily

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:52.939 
and you'll see that obviously here in a

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.029 
and you'll see that obviously here in a
second<00:04:53.210> when<00:04:53.270> he<00:04:53.360> tries<00:04:53.539> to<00:04:53.569> go<00:04:53.780> for<00:04:53.960> that<00:04:54.080> and

impossible now next time what I think

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.409 
impossible now next time what I think
it's<00:05:07.009> the<00:05:07.099> same<00:05:07.460> percentage<00:05:07.969> you<00:05:08.120> knowing

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
it's the same percentage you knowing

it's the same percentage you knowing
bike<00:05:08.810> and<00:05:09.050> white<00:05:09.139> 2<00:05:09.319> unless<00:05:09.529> I'm<00:05:09.710> mistaken<00:05:09.800> but

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:25.969 
going to go in at integral because it's

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:28.149 
going to go in at integral because it's
you<00:05:26.120> know<00:05:26.150> my<00:05:26.360> other<00:05:26.509> wall<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:27.379> he<00:05:27.919> ends<00:05:28.099> up

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
you know my other wall and he ends up

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
bringing his landris again and I go for

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.869 
bringing his landris again and I go for
sludge<00:05:30.409> ball<00:05:30.650> that<00:05:30.860> was<00:05:30.949> not<00:05:31.310> a<00:05:31.339> good<00:05:31.550> play<00:05:31.759> at

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:31.879 
sludge ball that was not a good play at

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.249 
sludge ball that was not a good play at
all<00:05:32.000> I<00:05:32.029> should<00:05:32.389> just<00:05:32.539> gone<00:05:32.690> straight<00:05:32.870> for<00:05:33.110> the

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
all I should just gone straight for the

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.469 
all I should just gone straight for the
skull<00:05:33.589> I<00:05:33.830> guess<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:34.639> just<00:05:34.669> wanted<00:05:35.029> that<00:05:35.180> extra

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
skull I guess I just wanted that extra

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.360 
skull I guess I just wanted that extra
damage<00:05:35.599> but<00:05:35.990> still<00:05:36.529> not<00:05:36.680> a<00:05:36.740> very<00:05:36.949> smart<00:05:37.069> play

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
damage but still not a very smart play

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.490 
damage but still not a very smart play
right<00:05:37.550> there<00:05:37.699> and<00:05:37.909> I<00:05:38.539> don't<00:05:39.169> think<00:05:39.289> I<00:05:39.379> would

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
right there and I don't think I would

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.390 
right there and I don't think I would
have<00:05:39.529> knocked<00:05:39.740> him<00:05:39.830> out<00:05:39.949> with<00:05:40.009> the<00:05:40.159> skull<00:05:40.339> but

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
have knocked him out with the skull but

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.519 
have knocked him out with the skull but
you<00:05:40.819> know<00:05:40.940> again<00:05:41.629> it<00:05:41.990> still<00:05:42.199> would<00:05:42.319> have<00:05:42.349> done

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529 
you know again it still would have done

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:44.860 
you know again it still would have done
a<00:05:42.560> lot<00:05:42.889> more<00:05:42.919> damage<00:05:43.430> i<00:05:43.729> just<00:05:43.940> didn't<00:05:44.719> let<00:05:44.839> that

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
a lot more damage i just didn't let that

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.170 
a lot more damage i just didn't let that
happen<00:05:45.199> so<00:05:45.620> now<00:05:46.610> he's<00:05:46.759> going<00:05:46.849> to<00:05:46.940> go<00:05:47.000> for<00:05:47.150> that

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
happen so now he's going to go for that

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.390 
happen so now he's going to go for that
earthquake<00:05:47.629> i'm<00:05:47.900> going<00:05:48.349> to<00:05:48.529> unfortunately

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.700 
earthquake i'm going to unfortunately
died<00:05:49.610> we're<00:05:50.180> going<00:05:50.330> to<00:05:50.389> do<00:05:50.449> now<00:05:50.629> is<00:05:50.960> I<00:05:51.469> could

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
died we're going to do now is I could

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.040 
died we're going to do now is I could
either<00:05:51.860> bring<00:05:52.339> in<00:05:52.550> my<00:05:52.759> gangor<00:05:53.150> or<00:05:53.509> my<00:05:53.750> sister

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
either bring in my gangor or my sister

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.659 
either bring in my gangor or my sister
but<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.259> problem<00:05:54.560> is<00:05:54.620> scizor<00:05:55.039> is<00:05:55.189> that<00:05:55.400> rocks

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
but the problem is scizor is that rocks

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.189 
but the problem is scizor is that rocks
are<00:05:55.909> up<00:05:56.060> I<00:05:56.240> never<00:05:56.419> got<00:05:56.599> those<00:05:56.810> spinned<00:05:57.080> away

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
are up I never got those spinned away

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.559 
are up I never got those spinned away
and<00:05:57.620> now<00:05:58.250> pretty<00:05:58.699> much<00:05:58.789> scissor<00:05:59.150> can't<00:05:59.449> do

00:05:59.559 --> 00:05:59.569 
and now pretty much scissor can't do

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:00.909 
and now pretty much scissor can't do
anything<00:05:59.750> at<00:05:59.930> all<00:06:00.020> which<00:06:00.259> is<00:06:00.409> proportionate

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
anything at all which is proportionate

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.559 
anything at all which is proportionate
and<00:06:00.979> as<00:06:01.159> heliolisk<00:06:01.729> is<00:06:01.939> going<00:06:02.389> to<00:06:02.449> be<00:06:02.539> a

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
and as heliolisk is going to be a

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.740 
and as heliolisk is going to be a
problem<00:06:02.930> so<00:06:03.349> my<00:06:03.949> only<00:06:04.219> chance<00:06:04.729> is<00:06:05.029> that<00:06:05.330> like<00:06:05.539> I

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
problem so my only chance is that like I

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.619 
problem so my only chance is that like I
had<00:06:06.020> somehow<00:06:06.439> as<00:06:06.740> heliolisk<00:06:07.279> is<00:06:07.520> not<00:06:07.909> scarf<00:06:08.389> I

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:08.629 
had somehow as heliolisk is not scarf I

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.929 
had somehow as heliolisk is not scarf I
go<00:06:09.500> into<00:06:09.650> scissor<00:06:09.949> just<00:06:10.339> so<00:06:10.520> that<00:06:10.699> way<00:06:10.879> you

00:06:10.929 --> 00:06:10.939 
go into scissor just so that way you

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:12.879 
go into scissor just so that way you
know<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.449> can<00:06:11.689> get<00:06:11.779> an<00:06:11.900> extra<00:06:11.990> turn<00:06:12.409> of<00:06:12.560> poison

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
know I can get an extra turn of poison

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.920 
know I can get an extra turn of poison
damage<00:06:13.009> and<00:06:13.370> then<00:06:13.909> you<00:06:14.240> know<00:06:14.360> I<00:06:14.389> guess<00:06:14.750> him

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
damage and then you know I guess him

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.409 
damage and then you know I guess him
with<00:06:15.110> a<00:06:15.139> shadow<00:06:15.469> ball<00:06:15.740> and<00:06:16.240> honestly<00:06:17.240> I'm

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419 
with a shadow ball and honestly I'm

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.909 
with a shadow ball and honestly I'm
locked<00:06:17.659> in<00:06:17.870> so<00:06:18.020> it<00:06:18.139> really<00:06:18.439> can't<00:06:18.770> do<00:06:18.889> anything

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
locked in so it really can't do anything

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.040 
locked in so it really can't do anything
about<00:06:19.219> that<00:06:19.370> at<00:06:19.639> all<00:06:19.729> um<00:06:20.000> kind<00:06:20.750> of<00:06:20.839> i<00:06:20.990> guess

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
about that at all um kind of i guess

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.140 
about that at all um kind of i guess
imploded<00:06:21.949> on<00:06:22.039> myself<00:06:22.250> at<00:06:22.580> the<00:06:22.669> end<00:06:22.939> there

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
imploded on myself at the end there

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.369 
imploded on myself at the end there
because<00:06:23.360> you<00:06:23.659> know<00:06:23.779> i<00:06:23.810> could<00:06:24.020> have<00:06:24.110> made<00:06:24.229> some

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:24.379 
because you know i could have made some

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:26.800 
because you know i could have made some
better<00:06:24.560> place<00:06:24.770> here<00:06:25.099> and<00:06:25.250> there<00:06:25.849> um<00:06:26.449> you<00:06:26.689> know

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
better place here and there um you know

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.089 
better place here and there um you know
maybe<00:06:27.080> just<00:06:27.319> going<00:06:27.500> for<00:06:27.589> the<00:06:27.650> Skull<00:06:27.889> there

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
maybe just going for the Skull there

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:29.769 
maybe just going for the Skull there
maybe<00:06:28.310> I<00:06:28.430> want<00:06:28.639> to<00:06:28.699> have<00:06:28.819> to<00:06:29.000> necessarily<00:06:29.389> go

00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:29.779 
maybe I want to have to necessarily go

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:32.889 
maybe I want to have to necessarily go
for<00:06:30.710> a<00:06:31.240> shadow<00:06:32.240> ball<00:06:32.419> there<00:06:32.599> could<00:06:32.779> be<00:06:32.810> gone

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:32.899 
for a shadow ball there could be gone

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:33.820 
for a shadow ball there could be gone
for<00:06:33.080> such<00:06:33.229> pump<00:06:33.500> stuff<00:06:33.649> like<00:06:33.800> that

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830
