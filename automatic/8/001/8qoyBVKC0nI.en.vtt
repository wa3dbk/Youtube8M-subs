00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
apiece and I got those just so it would

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.370 
apiece and I got those just so it would
be<00:00:26.130> easy<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.789> level<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.300> construction<00:00:28.080> spot

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
be easy to level the construction spot

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.769 
be easy to level the construction spot
this<00:00:29.009> is<00:00:29.220> what<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.609> first<00:00:29.820> layer<00:00:30.150> looks<00:00:30.509> like

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
this is what the first layer looks like

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.410 
this is what the first layer looks like
I'm<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.949> use<00:00:32.099> four<00:00:32.519> and<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.790> half<00:00:32.820> bricks

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
I'm going to use four and a half bricks

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.770 
I'm going to use four and a half bricks
now<00:00:34.140> I<00:00:34.170> bought<00:00:34.410> 16<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> broke<00:00:36.150> one<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.540> half

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
now I bought 16 so I broke one in half

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.259 
now I bought 16 so I broke one in half
and<00:00:37.080> it's<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> go<00:00:37.799> on<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.949> corner<00:00:38.339> but

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
and it's going to go on a corner but

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.770 
and it's going to go on a corner but
there's<00:00:39.449> your<00:00:39.659> first<00:00:39.870> layer<00:00:41.330> for<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.390> second

there's your first layer for the second
layer<00:00:42.930> now<00:00:43.170> we're<00:00:44.070> going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.750> arrange<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
layer now we're going to arrange the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.509 
layer now we're going to arrange the
bricks<00:00:46.229> just<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.589> little<00:00:46.769> differently<00:00:47.129> we're

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
bricks just a little differently we're

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.369 
bricks just a little differently we're
going<00:00:47.699> to<00:00:47.790> put<00:00:48.000> each<00:00:48.239> brick<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
going to put each brick so that it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:07.710 
going to put each brick so that it
overlaps<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:50.220> joint

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.999

now if you like Legos you're going to

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.600 
now if you like Legos you're going to
love<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.280> project<00:01:10.850> what<00:01:11.600> we're<00:01:11.689> going<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:11.840> do

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
love this project what we're going to do

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.520 
love this project what we're going to do
is<00:01:13.610> try<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.909> overlap<00:01:14.450> as<00:01:14.899> much<00:01:15.110> as<00:01:15.290> possible

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
is try to overlap as much as possible

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.260 
is try to overlap as much as possible
hit<00:01:16.399> brick<00:01:16.759> with<00:01:17.390> every<00:01:18.640> joint<00:01:21.850> in<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.000> front

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
hit brick with every joint in the front

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.749 
hit brick with every joint in the front
here<00:01:23.450> now<00:01:23.630> right<00:01:24.140> here<00:01:24.409> we're<00:01:25.340> going<00:01:25.429> to<00:01:25.549> put

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
here now right here we're going to put

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.889 
here now right here we're going to put
this<00:01:25.939> brick<00:01:26.840> sideways<00:01:28.450> what<00:01:29.450> this<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:29.750> going

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
this brick sideways what this is going

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.499 
this brick sideways what this is going
to<00:01:29.990> do<00:01:30.140> then<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:30.439> create<00:01:30.619> our<00:01:31.329> area<00:01:32.329> for

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
to do then is create our area for

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.510 
to do then is create our area for
feeding<00:01:32.869> in<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:32.990> fuel<00:01:34.659> for<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.780> final<00:01:36.140> layer

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
feeding in the fuel for the final layer

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
feeding in the fuel for the final layer
will<00:01:37.520> again<00:01:38.500> overlap<00:01:39.500> every<00:01:39.799> joint

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.870 

and<00:01:49.680> we're<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.010> to<00:01:50.040> range<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.580> it's<00:01:50.730> nice

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
and we're going to range it so it's nice

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.420 
and we're going to range it so it's nice
and<00:01:51.150> square<00:01:53.660> now<00:01:54.660> I<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:55.050> used<00:01:55.290> 15<00:01:55.800> bricks<00:01:56.130> I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
and square now I have used 15 bricks I

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.610 
and square now I have used 15 bricks I
need<00:01:56.940> one<00:01:57.150> more<00:01:57.360> I'm<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
need one more I'm going to put that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.620 
need one more I'm going to put that
right<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.370> will<00:01:59.910> be<00:02:00.060> where<00:02:00.240> we<00:02:00.360> feed

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
right there that will be where we feed

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.550 
right there that will be where we feed
the<00:02:00.810> fuel<00:02:01.080> into<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.590> fire<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> now<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.200> rocket

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the fuel into the fire so now the rocket

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.990 
the fuel into the fire so now the rocket
stove<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.890> done<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.340> looks<00:02:05.400> pretty<00:02:05.850> nice

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
stove is done it looks pretty nice

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.330 
stove is done it looks pretty nice
actually<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.590> could<00:02:07.770> make<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.130> with

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
actually you could make this with

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.460 
actually you could make this with
salvaged<00:02:08.760> bricks<00:02:09.119> or<00:02:09.360> different<00:02:10.229> sized

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
salvaged bricks or different sized

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.870 
salvaged bricks or different sized
bricks<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:11.100> long<00:02:11.280> as<00:02:11.400> they're<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.850> same

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
bricks as long as they're all the same

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.000 
bricks as long as they're all the same
size<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.720> type<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.260> technique

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
size and this is the type of technique

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.620 
size and this is the type of technique
you<00:02:17.250> could<00:02:17.940> use<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.240> variety<00:02:18.330> of

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
you could use in a variety of

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.410 
you could use in a variety of
circumstances<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.940> were<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.210> situation

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
circumstances if you were in a situation

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.410 
circumstances if you were in a situation
where<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.020> tornado<00:02:22.440> had<00:02:22.620> gone<00:02:22.800> through<00:02:23.420> picking

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
where a tornado had gone through picking

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.960 
where a tornado had gone through picking
up<00:02:24.510> 16<00:02:25.020> bricks<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.590> arranging<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:26.340> stove

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
up 16 bricks and arranging this stove

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.480 
up 16 bricks and arranging this stove
would<00:02:27.660> allow<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.080> use<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.620> biomass<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
would allow you to use the biomass and

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.910 
would allow you to use the biomass and
the<00:02:29.580> debris<00:02:29.850> most<00:02:30.810> effectively<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.410> cook<00:02:31.709> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
the debris most effectively to cook and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.260 
the debris most effectively to cook and
boil<00:02:32.130> water<00:02:33.680> let's<00:02:34.680> put<00:02:35.400> some<00:02:35.610> fire<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.060> there

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
boil water let's put some fire in there

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.310 
boil water let's put some fire in there
and<00:02:36.420> see<00:02:36.570> how<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.840> works

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
and see how it works

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.760 
and see how it works
I<00:02:37.910> went<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> local<00:02:39.840> construction<00:02:40.380> site

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
I went to a local construction site

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.590 
I went to a local construction site
dumpster<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.550> salvaged<00:02:42.000> some<00:02:42.180> wood<00:02:42.360> so

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
dumpster and I salvaged some wood so

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.170 
dumpster and I salvaged some wood so
that's<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.930> I'm<00:02:43.080> using<00:02:43.290> today<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:45.120> just

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that's all I'm using today and I just

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.210 
that's all I'm using today and I just
tossed<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.170> little<00:02:46.350> bit<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.500> fire<00:02:46.740> starter

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
tossed in a little bit of fire starter

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.500 
tossed in a little bit of fire starter
and<00:02:48.350> threw<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.440> some<00:02:49.650> wood<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:49.980> here<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.220> goes

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
and threw in some wood and here it goes

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.610 
and threw in some wood and here it goes
there's<00:02:51.510> going<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:52.110> something<00:02:52.410> to

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
there's going to have to be something to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.320 
there's going to have to be something to
separate<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.280> flame<00:02:53.550> from<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.880> bottom<00:02:54.239> of

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
separate the flame from the bottom of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.180 
separate the flame from the bottom of
the<00:02:54.420> pot<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.900> might<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.560> use<00:02:55.769> something

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the pot you might have to use something

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.640 
the pot you might have to use something
like<00:02:56.340> little<00:02:57.209> pieces<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.840> brick<00:02:58.170> or<00:02:58.350> something

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
like little pieces of brick or something

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.070 
like little pieces of brick or something
like<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.910> dutch<00:03:00.209> oven<00:03:00.239> trivet<00:03:00.930> and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
like that I have a dutch oven trivet and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.890 
like that I have a dutch oven trivet and
I'm<00:03:01.170> going<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.350> put<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:05.720> I'm<00:03:06.720> going<00:03:06.840> to

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
I'm going to put that on I'm going to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.650 
I'm going to put that on I'm going to
put<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:07.140> water<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:08.030> now<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.090> height<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.570> your

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
put the water on now the height of your

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.470 
put the water on now the height of your
trivet<00:03:10.140> right<00:03:10.620> here<00:03:11.010> could<00:03:11.310> determine<00:03:11.670> if<00:03:11.970> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
trivet right here could determine if you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.080 
trivet right here could determine if you
would<00:03:12.630> simmer<00:03:12.959> or<00:03:13.230> if<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.530> would<00:03:13.739> fry

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
would simmer or if this would fry

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.090 
would simmer or if this would fry
obviously<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.390> wanted<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.860> higher

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
obviously if you wanted it to be higher

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.190 
obviously if you wanted it to be higher
you<00:03:17.250> would<00:03:17.459> reduce<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.540> height<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:19.110> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you would reduce the height just a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.199 
you would reduce the height just a
little<00:03:19.440> bit<00:03:19.620> not<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.700> point<00:03:20.910> where<00:03:21.120> it

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
little bit not to the point where it

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.550 
little bit not to the point where it
would<00:03:21.300> smother<00:03:21.600> the<00:03:21.810> fire<00:03:22.050> though<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.290> have

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
would smother the fire though you have

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.949 
would smother the fire though you have
to<00:03:22.709> have<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:23.070> ability<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.790> air<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
to have the ability for the air to

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.449 
to have the ability for the air to
circulate<00:03:25.110> through<00:03:25.620> there<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.010> up<00:03:26.160> through

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
circulate through there and up through

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.590 
circulate through there and up through
the<00:03:27.080> combustion<00:03:28.080> chamber<00:03:28.650> if<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:30.330> really

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
the combustion chamber if you really

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.150 
the combustion chamber if you really
want<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> stove<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.350> produce<00:03:31.500> some<00:03:31.830> heat<00:03:32.010> you

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
want the stove to produce some heat you

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.490 
want the stove to produce some heat you
can<00:03:32.340> toss<00:03:32.550> in<00:03:32.820> some<00:03:32.850> smaller<00:03:33.330> chunks<00:03:33.840> like

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
can toss in some smaller chunks like

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.320 
can toss in some smaller chunks like
right<00:03:34.830> in<00:03:34.980> there<00:03:35.220> wind<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.820> causing<00:03:36.060> all<00:03:36.300> sorts

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
right in there wind is causing all sorts

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.530 
right in there wind is causing all sorts
of<00:03:36.690> problems<00:03:36.750> but<00:03:37.350> it's<00:03:37.500> still<00:03:38.330> putting<00:03:39.330> out<00:03:39.510> a

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
of problems but it's still putting out a

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.479 
of problems but it's still putting out a
lot<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.810> heat<00:03:40.080> I<00:03:40.350> had<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.830> throw<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.280> few

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
lot of heat I had to throw in a few

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.449 
lot of heat I had to throw in a few
pieces<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.940> smaller<00:03:42.690> wood<00:03:43.190> directly<00:03:44.190> into<00:03:44.370> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
pieces of smaller wood directly into the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.030 
pieces of smaller wood directly into the
fire<00:03:44.670> chamber<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.450> get<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.660> going<00:03:45.959> but<00:03:46.769> that's

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
fire chamber to get it going but that's

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.720 
fire chamber to get it going but that's
okay

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
okay

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.009 
okay
because<00:03:48.060> everything<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.510> working<00:03:48.840> out<00:03:48.959> very

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
because everything is working out very

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.620 
because everything is working out very
well<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:49.709> this<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.790> survival<00:03:51.420> technique

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
well right this is a survival technique

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.920 
well right this is a survival technique
that<00:03:52.160> really<00:03:53.160> relies<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.459> Lego<00:03:54.030> technology

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
that really relies on Lego technology

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.380 
that really relies on Lego technology
know<00:03:55.830> how<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.010> stack<00:03:56.310> some<00:03:56.519> bricks<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.060> you

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
know how to stack some bricks and you

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.470 
know how to stack some bricks and you
can<00:03:57.569> make<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> rock

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
can make a rock

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.399 
can make a rock
stove<00:03:59.640> this<00:04:00.640> is<00:04:00.700> survival<00:04:01.300> common<00:04:01.659> sense<00:04:01.900> calm

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
stove this is survival common sense calm

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.460 
stove this is survival common sense calm
it's<00:04:03.370> windy<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:03.940> cold<00:04:04.209> out<00:04:04.450> here<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:05.319> have<00:04:05.440> a
