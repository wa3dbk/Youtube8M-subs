a<00:03:44.240> little<00:03:44.480> scene<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:44.959> I<00:03:45.140> said<00:03:45.410> up<00:03:45.500> here<00:03:45.530> just

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
a little scene that I said up here just

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.160 
a little scene that I said up here just
rising<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:46.700> throw<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.209> topics<00:03:47.959> that<00:03:47.989> I've

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
rising to throw the topics that I've

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.380 
rising to throw the topics that I've
made<00:03:48.430> they<00:03:49.430> actually<00:03:49.700> look<00:03:49.849> pretty<00:03:49.880> good

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
made they actually look pretty good

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.320 
made they actually look pretty good
I<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.780> how<00:03:50.900> unity<00:03:51.260> provides<00:03:51.730> a<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:53.180> an

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
I like how unity provides a to an

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.110 
I like how unity provides a to an
outline<00:03:54.010> material<00:03:55.010> you<00:03:55.550> can<00:03:55.700> code<00:03:55.849> and<00:03:56.030> make

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
outline material you can code and make

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.400 
outline material you can code and make
your<00:03:56.270> own<00:03:56.330> but<00:03:56.599> they<00:03:56.660> just<00:03:56.840> provide<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.319> with

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
your own but they just provide you with

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.250 
your own but they just provide you with
it<00:03:57.560> so<00:03:58.220> it<00:03:58.280> makes<00:03:58.430> it<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.880> lot<00:03:59.270> easier<00:03:59.330> the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
it so it makes it a lot easier the

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.820 
it so it makes it a lot easier the
shading

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
shading

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.520 
shading
kind<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.489> strange<00:04:01.790> but<00:04:02.780> I<00:04:02.840> actually<00:04:02.989> like<00:04:03.319> the

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
kind of strange but I actually like the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.770 
kind of strange but I actually like the
effect<00:04:03.920> gives<00:04:04.520> more<00:04:04.670> detail<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.239> personality

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
effect gives more detail and personality

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.470 
effect gives more detail and personality
