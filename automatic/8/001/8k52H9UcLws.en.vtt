Games VS Piracy

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.500
Video game piracy isn't exactly a new thing to the industry.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.500
It's been around since the old days of C64,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.500
to the era of digital distribution platforms, e.g. Steam, of today.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Video game piracy can be done by many different methods.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
One of the more popular ways is by using file sharing service(s), like Rapidshare.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.000
Another infamous method is done through P2P protocol - widely known as Bit Torrent.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.500
But how exactly does piracy affect the industry?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Video game piracy mostly begins with one person buying a copy.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The game is then altered - or "cracked" - to get rid of DRM, and so can be played for free.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
"Cracked" products are afterwards distributed through stated methods to be obtained free of charge, while developers get nothing in return.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Video game can also be damaged to the point of unplayable during the cracking process.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Some players may perceive such flaws to be dev's fault, and blame them for it on the net.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
With social networking sites being as big as they are today, news of a faulty game can become viral in no time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Which can potentially hurt sales.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.400
Game development usually requires massive amount of funds, 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.000
and even more so for AAA games which can easily go way beyond 17 million USD.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This means developers are in for a big loss should their games sell even a little less than expected.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.500
Developers would then have to decrease the budget or layoff staffs,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.000
which may affect game's quality,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or entirely change the company's target audience.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.500
Ultimately, it could affect the general price tag of a video game copy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.500
So how can we stop all these from happening?

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.000
It's easy!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
