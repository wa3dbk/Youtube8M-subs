think<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.770> might<00:03:03.250> even<00:03:03.460> look<00:03:03.670> for<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> Freddie

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
think you might even look for a Freddie

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.150 
think you might even look for a Freddie
Ljungberg<00:03:04.390> to<00:03:04.690> start<00:03:04.930> however<00:03:05.290> this<00:03:05.950> is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
Ljungberg to start however this is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.220 
Ljungberg to start however this is
probably<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.670> game<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.240> Natan<00:03:07.540> jaqua<00:03:07.930> he's

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
probably a game for Natan jaqua he's

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.140 
probably a game for Natan jaqua he's
coming<00:03:08.620> back<00:03:08.740> from<00:03:08.980> injury<00:03:09.160> he's<00:03:09.760> going<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.030> be

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
coming back from injury he's going to be

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.970 
coming back from injury he's going to be
up<00:03:10.270> top<00:03:10.480> I<00:03:10.720> would<00:03:10.870> expect<00:03:11.170> him<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.500> start<00:03:11.830> in

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
up top I would expect him to start in

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.590 
up top I would expect him to start in
this<00:03:12.100> one<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.790> think<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.330> game<00:03:13.540> that

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
this one and I think this is a game that

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.450 
this one and I think this is a game that
he<00:03:14.020> needs<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.350> prove<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.680> he's<00:03:14.890> back<00:03:15.250> and

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
he needs to prove that he's back and

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.800 
he needs to prove that he's back and
that<00:03:15.580> he<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:15.850> contribute<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.330> the<00:03:16.510> sound<00:03:16.720> of

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
that he can contribute to the sound of

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.870 
that he can contribute to the sound of
yeah<00:03:17.440> well<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:18.010> game<00:03:18.220> tonight<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.700> can

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.360 
you get that sort of rivalry instant
rivalry<00:03:27.880> because<00:03:28.090> of<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.739> emotion<00:03:29.739> of<00:03:29.890> just

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
rivalry because of the emotion of just

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.590 
rivalry because of the emotion of just
having<00:03:30.550> played<00:03:30.850> them<00:03:31.060> yeah<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:31.450> another

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
having played them yeah and another

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.660 
having played them yeah and another
thing<00:03:31.750> in<00:03:32.020> this<00:03:32.140> one<00:03:32.350> is<00:03:32.500> about<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.220> galaxy

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
thing in this one is about the galaxy

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.820 
thing in this one is about the galaxy
they've<00:03:33.880> looked<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.480> good<00:03:34.810> on<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.200> field<00:03:35.470> now

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
they've looked so good on the field now

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.040 
they've looked so good on the field now
they<00:03:36.070> need<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.310> translate<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.030> into<00:03:37.360> some

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
they need to translate that into some

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.840 
they need to translate that into some
sort<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.380> silverware<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:39.310> it's<00:03:39.459> important

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
sort of silverware and so it's important

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.370 
sort of silverware and so it's important
for<00:03:39.910> them<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.239> think<00:03:40.270> to<00:03:40.510> get<00:03:40.690> this<00:03:40.840> result<00:03:41.200> and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
for them I think to get this result and

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.630 
for them I think to get this result and
keep<00:03:41.530> moving<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.950> US<00:03:42.130> open<00:03:42.370> up<00:03:42.459> that

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
keep moving in the US open up that

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.280 
keep moving in the US open up that
brings<00:03:42.850> up<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.060> question<00:03:43.090> how<00:03:43.600> good<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.140> this

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
brings up a question how good can this

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.830 
brings up a question how good can this
galaxy<00:03:44.830> team<00:03:45.100> be<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.459> mean<00:03:45.670> they're<00:03:46.060> already<00:03:46.330> if

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
galaxy team be I mean they're already if

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.780 
galaxy team be I mean they're already if
they<00:03:47.050> win<00:03:47.290> tonight<00:03:47.320> that's<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.070> semi-finals

of<00:03:48.880> US<00:03:49.180> Open<00:03:49.570> Cup<00:03:49.600> so<00:03:50.140> they<00:03:50.260> have<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.380> chance<00:03:50.560> for

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
of US Open Cup so they have a chance for

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.410 
of US Open Cup so they have a chance for
hardware<00:03:51.130> there<00:03:51.340> obviously<00:03:51.580> they<00:03:52.209> have<00:03:52.390> a

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
hardware there obviously they have a

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.740 
hardware there obviously they have a
shot<00:03:53.410> at<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.650> supporters<00:03:54.550> shield<00:03:54.660> they<00:03:55.660> have

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
shot at the supporters shield they have

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.600 
shot at the supporters shield they have
a<00:03:55.810> shot<00:03:55.989> at<00:03:56.140> mls<00:03:56.470> cup<00:03:56.709> because<00:03:56.890> their<00:03:57.070> dominant

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
a shot at mls cup because their dominant

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.820 
a shot at mls cup because their dominant
can<00:03:57.820> this<00:03:57.970> team<00:03:58.269> do<00:03:58.600> some<00:03:58.870> damage<00:03:59.050> in<00:03:59.350> CONCACAF

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
can this team do some damage in CONCACAF

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.470 
can this team do some damage in CONCACAF
Champions<00:03:59.860> League<00:04:00.310> as<00:04:00.519> well<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.820> think<00:04:01.330> they

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
Champions League as well I think they

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.120 
Champions League as well I think they
could<00:04:01.810> they've<00:04:02.019> shown<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.620> they<00:04:02.769> have<00:04:02.950> the

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
could they've shown that they have the

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.979 
could they've shown that they have the
depth<00:04:03.340> when<00:04:03.580> bottle<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.150> Donovan<00:04:04.600> went<00:04:04.780> off

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
depth when bottle and Donovan went off

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.930 
depth when bottle and Donovan went off
to<00:04:05.290> South<00:04:05.680> Africa<00:04:06.130> obviously<00:04:06.610> they<00:04:06.730> showed

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
to South Africa obviously they showed

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.430 
to South Africa obviously they showed
they<00:04:07.060> had<00:04:07.180> some<00:04:07.360> depth<00:04:07.570> with<00:04:07.750> God's<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.080> Tristan

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
they had some depth with God's a Tristan

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.390 
they had some depth with God's a Tristan

think<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.720> league<00:04:28.930> that's<00:04:29.200> important<00:04:29.620> to

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
think in the league that's important to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.880 
think in the league that's important to
them<00:04:29.710> but<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.880> think<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.900> say<00:04:32.140> how<00:04:32.410> good<00:04:32.710> can

them but I think you say how good can

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.370 
them but I think you say how good can
they<00:04:32.950> be<00:04:33.220> they<00:04:33.760> could<00:04:34.030> win<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.540> ton<00:04:35.080> of<00:04:35.110> trophies

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.900 
of the nineteen seventy-four World Cup
final<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:59.380> reality<00:04:59.770> is<00:04:59.800> I<00:05:00.010> think<00:05:00.070> that<00:05:00.340> even

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
final the reality is I think that even

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.390 
final the reality is I think that even
without<00:05:01.270> Thomas<00:05:01.810> Muller<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.590> German<00:05:03.160> team

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
without Thomas Muller this German team

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.390 
without Thomas Muller this German team
has<00:05:03.820> enough<00:05:04.140> attacking<00:05:05.140> power<00:05:05.380> they're<00:05:06.040> very

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
has enough attacking power they're very

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.040 
has enough attacking power they're very
dynamic<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.210> I<00:05:07.330> think<00:05:07.540> they<00:05:07.660> can<00:05:07.780> get<00:05:07.930> in

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
dynamic and I think they can get in

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.890 
dynamic and I think they can get in
behind<00:05:08.200> what<00:05:09.010> has<00:05:09.190> been<00:05:09.430> really<00:05:09.760> a<00:05:09.910> lackluster

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
behind what has been really a lackluster

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.660 
behind what has been really a lackluster
Spanish<00:05:11.380> defense<00:05:11.800> sure<00:05:12.370> they<00:05:12.490> haven't

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
Spanish defense sure they haven't

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.340 
Spanish defense sure they haven't
allowed<00:05:12.940> many<00:05:13.120> goals<00:05:13.450> but<00:05:13.720> they<00:05:13.840> just<00:05:14.110> don't

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
allowed many goals but they just don't

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.230 
allowed many goals but they just don't
look<00:05:14.620> like<00:05:14.830> dominating<00:05:15.550> the<00:05:15.760> way<00:05:15.880> they<00:05:16.060> have

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
look like dominating the way they have

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.120 
look like dominating the way they have
in<00:05:16.420> the<00:05:16.540> past<00:05:16.750> and<00:05:17.080> i<00:05:17.380> think<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.710> with<00:05:17.950> guys

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
in the past and i think the with guys

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.130 
in the past and i think the with guys
like<00:05:18.310> Ozil<00:05:18.550> miroslav<00:05:19.390> klose<00:05:19.480> are<00:05:19.810> chasing

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
like Ozil miroslav klose are chasing

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.650 
like Ozil miroslav klose are chasing
history<00:05:20.800> trying<00:05:21.160> to<00:05:21.280> catch<00:05:21.580> Ronaldo<00:05:22.150> as<00:05:22.300> the

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
history trying to catch Ronaldo as the

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.300 
history trying to catch Ronaldo as the
all-time<00:05:22.840> leading<00:05:23.380> scorer<00:05:23.710> in<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.890> world<00:05:24.070> cup

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
all-time leading scorer in the world cup

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.220 
all-time leading scorer in the world cup
this<00:05:24.700> is<00:05:24.850> a<00:05:24.880> game<00:05:25.120> where<00:05:25.300> Germany<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:25.900> I

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
this is a game where Germany and I

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.980 
this is a game where Germany and I
forgot<00:05:26.680> to<00:05:26.800> mention<00:05:26.830> Bastian<00:05:27.790> Schweinsteiger

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
forgot to mention Bastian Schweinsteiger

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.210 
forgot to mention Bastian Schweinsteiger
who's<00:05:28.990> going<00:05:29.140> to<00:05:29.200> obviously<00:05:29.380> be<00:05:29.770> running<00:05:30.100> the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
who's going to obviously be running the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.040 
who's going to obviously be running the
midfield<00:05:30.580> for<00:05:30.640> them<00:05:30.910> I<00:05:31.120> think<00:05:31.300> with<00:05:31.720> all<00:05:31.750> of

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
midfield for them I think with all of

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.660 
midfield for them I think with all of
those<00:05:32.170> weapons<00:05:32.440> they<00:05:32.830> can<00:05:33.010> get<00:05:33.130> in<00:05:33.250> behind<00:05:33.400> the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
those weapons they can get in behind the

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.220 
those weapons they can get in behind the
defence<00:05:33.700> and<00:05:34.150> get<00:05:34.240> some<00:05:34.390> goals<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:34.750> beat

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
defence and get some goals and beat

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.280 
defence and get some goals and beat
spain<00:05:35.530> well<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.220> don't<00:05:36.790> see<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.330> being<00:05:37.660> a<00:05:37.840> goal

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 
spain well I don't see it being a goal

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.320 
spain well I don't see it being a goal
fest<00:05:38.560> although<00:05:39.010> it<00:05:39.400> very<00:05:39.670> could<00:05:39.910> be<00:05:40.060> with<00:05:40.210> the

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
fest although it very could be with the

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.420 
fest although it very could be with the
offensive<00:05:40.810> talent<00:05:41.020> on<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.320> field<00:05:41.380> but<00:05:42.070> Spain

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
offensive talent on the field but Spain

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.580 
offensive talent on the field but Spain
given<00:05:42.970> up<00:05:43.060> two<00:05:43.240> goals<00:05:43.480> all<00:05:43.750> tournament<00:05:44.320> I<00:05:44.410> just

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.720 
given up two goals all tournament I just
feel<00:05:44.770> like<00:05:44.800> they're<00:05:45.070> going<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.250> be<00:05:45.340> sure<00:05:45.580> in

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:45.730 
feel like they're going to be sure in

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.310 
feel like they're going to be sure in
the<00:05:45.820> back<00:05:46.030> it's<00:05:46.480> going<00:05:46.660> to<00:05:46.690> be<00:05:46.810> that<00:05:46.960> one

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
the back it's going to be that one

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.410 
the back it's going to be that one
squeaking<00:05:48.100> goal<00:05:48.310> on<00:05:48.580> a<00:05:48.670> set<00:05:48.970> piece<00:05:49.210> or

squeaking goal on a set piece or

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.600 
squeaking goal on a set piece or

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
something I'm going with Spain it'll be

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.190 
something I'm going with Spain it'll be
interesting<00:05:51.790> to<00:05:52.000> see<00:05:52.090> if<00:05:52.240> Torres<00:05:52.600> gets<00:05:52.750> on<00:05:53.080> the

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
interesting to see if Torres gets on the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.780 
interesting to see if Torres gets on the
field<00:05:53.440> or<00:05:53.620> if<00:05:53.710> your<00:05:53.830> rent<00:05:54.010> a<00:05:54.130> starts<00:05:54.550> for<00:05:54.760> him

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
field or if your rent a starts for him

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.430 
field or if your rent a starts for him
but<00:05:55.210> either<00:05:55.360> way<00:05:55.600> it<00:05:55.630> should<00:05:55.870> be<00:05:55.960> a<00:05:55.990> good<00:05:56.140> story

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
but either way it should be a good story

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.690 
but either way it should be a good story
should<00:05:56.560> be<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.740> spark<00:05:57.070> percent<00:05:57.400> of<00:05:57.520> the<00:05:57.580> way

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
should be a spark percent of the way

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.760 
should be a spark percent of the way
they<00:05:57.940> have<00:05:58.120> W<00:05:58.510> dia<00:05:58.750> so<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.110> mean<00:05:59.410> you<00:05:59.500> can<00:05:59.620> almost

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
they have W dia so I mean you can almost
