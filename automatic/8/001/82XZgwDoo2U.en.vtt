00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it's efficient it works so we get

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.810 
it's efficient it works so we get
sandbox<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.550> then<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.780> go<00:01:01.050> out<00:01:01.379> first<00:01:02.250> we<00:01:02.609> went

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
pounds worth of radiators and bathtubs

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.710 
pounds worth of radiators and bathtubs
so<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.020> got<00:01:22.170> those<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:23.430> fortunately<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> guy

so we got those and fortunately the guy
had<00:01:24.960> an<00:01:25.110> excavator<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.340> he<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.759> able<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.150> break

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
had an excavator so he was able to break

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.030 
had an excavator so he was able to break
them<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.659> for<00:01:27.780> us<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.170> makes<00:01:28.680> her<00:01:28.770> life<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
them up for us which makes her life a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.130 
them up for us which makes her life a
lot<00:01:29.130> easier<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.960> big<00:01:30.960> heavy

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
lot easier if we can have a big heavy

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.420 
lot easier if we can have a big heavy
machine<00:01:31.950> breaking<00:01:32.549> iron<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.360> us<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.979> so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
machine breaking iron for us and then so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.170 
machine breaking iron for us and then so
we<00:01:35.520> bring<00:01:35.670> back<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.180> unload<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:38.180> in

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
we bring back here unload it and then in

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.719 
we bring back here unload it and then in
Chicago<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.049> Chicago<00:01:40.860> crucible<00:01:41.310> we're

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
Chicago at the Chicago crucible we're

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.670 
Chicago at the Chicago crucible we're
set<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.659> make<00:01:43.140> sand<00:01:43.380> molds

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
set up so that we can make sand molds

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.030 
set up so that we can make sand molds
it's<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.280> white<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.329> fine<00:01:45.689> grade<00:01:46.020> sand<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it's a white really fine grade sand so

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.580 
it's a white really fine grade sand so
they<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.310> hold<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> lot<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> detail<00:01:48.229> we<00:01:49.229> mix<00:01:49.439> it

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
they can hold a lot of detail we mix it

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.370 
they can hold a lot of detail we mix it
with<00:01:49.740> resin<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.610> bonds<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> yeah<00:01:52.229> so

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
with resin and it bonds it and yeah so

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.810 
with resin and it bonds it and yeah so
then<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> workshop<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.250> day<00:01:53.280> people

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.950 
are carving the sand we're helping them
out<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> set<00:01:56.310> up<00:01:56.460> once<00:01:57.270> they<00:01:57.509> finish

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
out and that set up once they finish

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990 
out and that set up once they finish
their<00:01:58.079> sand<00:01:58.439> block<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.460> ready<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.790> put

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
their sand block we get ready we put

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
their sand block we get ready we put
some<00:02:00.090> graphite<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.350> iron

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
some graphite on it so that the iron

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950 
some graphite on it so that the iron
doesn't<00:02:01.920> fuse<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.640> sand<00:02:03.090> once<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.810> do<00:02:03.930> that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
doesn't fuse to the sand once we do that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.210 
doesn't fuse to the sand once we do that
we're<00:02:04.829> pretty<00:02:05.009> much<00:02:05.159> ready<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.790> go

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.090 

on<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.369> actual<00:02:09.610> day<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.090> poor<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.890> have

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
on the actual day of the poor we have

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.800 
on the actual day of the poor we have
one<00:02:12.490> group<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.760> people<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.210> is<00:02:13.360> breaking<00:02:13.780> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
one group of people that is breaking the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.240 
one group of people that is breaking the
iron<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.500> have<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.680> break<00:02:14.830> them<00:02:14.950> down<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.190> a

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
iron so we have to break them down to a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.310 
iron so we have to break them down to a
specific<00:02:15.460> size<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.870> will<00:02:16.960> fit<00:02:17.020> in<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
specific size so that it will fit in the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.040 
specific size so that it will fit in the
furnace<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.860> then<00:02:18.610> we<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.390> then<00:02:19.480> we<00:02:19.720> go<00:02:19.870> out

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
furnace and then we and then we go out

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.010 
furnace and then we and then we go out
and<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.560> sort<00:02:21.010> all<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.610> charges<00:02:22.300> to

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
and we have to sort all the charges to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.690 
and we have to sort all the charges to
get<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.350> specific<00:02:23.590> weight<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.250> all<00:02:24.520> those

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
get to a specific weight so all those

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.880 
get to a specific weight so all those
little<00:02:24.880> piles<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.930> specific<00:02:26.440> weight<00:02:26.650> and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
little piles are a specific weight and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.500 
little piles are a specific weight and
that's<00:02:27.040> called<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.310> charge<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.120> that's<00:02:28.240> each

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
that's called a charge and that's each

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.120 
that's called a charge and that's each
charge<00:02:28.840> is<00:02:29.020> that's<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.770> go<00:02:29.860> into<00:02:29.980> the

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
charge is that's going to go into the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.390 
charge is that's going to go into the
furnace<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.150> then<00:02:31.680> as<00:02:32.680> far<00:02:32.950> as<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.100> furnace

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
furnace so then as far as the furnace

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.580 
furnace so then as far as the furnace
goes<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.940> mean<00:02:34.330> it's<00:02:34.450> kind<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.750> like<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.440> know<00:02:35.470> a

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
goes I mean it's kind of like you know a

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.260 
goes I mean it's kind of like you know a
barbecue<00:02:36.130> like<00:02:36.280> when<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.490> like<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.910> charcoal

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
barbecue like when you like the charcoal

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.030 
barbecue like when you like the charcoal
like<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.780> light<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.410> at<00:02:38.560> first<00:02:38.740> but

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
like you have to light it at first but

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.500 
like you have to light it at first but
you<00:02:39.220> know<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.400> this<00:02:39.490> case<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:39.850> use<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.480> know

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
you know in this case we use you know

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.380 
you know in this case we use you know
big<00:02:41.260> torches<00:02:41.680> with<00:02:41.860> propane<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.760> takes<00:02:43.209> like

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
big torches with propane that takes like

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.090 
big torches with propane that takes like
you<00:02:43.840> know<00:02:43.930> anywhere<00:02:44.260> from<00:02:44.320> half<00:02:44.590> hour<00:02:44.770> to<00:02:44.920> 45

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
you know anywhere from half hour to 45

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.010 
you know anywhere from half hour to 45
minutes<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.730> get<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:46.030> lit<00:02:46.270> once<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:46.750> lit

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
minutes to get that lit once it's lit

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.870 
minutes to get that lit once it's lit
and<00:02:47.260> once<00:02:47.830> they<00:02:48.010> start<00:02:48.220> putting<00:02:48.340> iron<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
and once they start putting iron and

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.580 
and once they start putting iron and
then<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.870> takes<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.140> little<00:02:50.230> bit<00:02:50.410> and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
then just takes a little bit and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.190 
then just takes a little bit and
eventually<00:02:51.600> molten<00:02:52.600> metal<00:02:52.750> comes<00:02:52.900> out<00:02:53.080> and

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
eventually molten metal comes out and

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.449 
eventually molten metal comes out and
once<00:02:53.320> we<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> full<00:02:53.709> pot<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.980> metal<00:02:54.160> we<00:02:54.280> just

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
once we have a full pot of metal we just

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.940 
once we have a full pot of metal we just
start<00:02:54.610> pouring<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:54.910> molds<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.620> once<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.770> pour

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
start pouring the molds and once we pour

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.060 
start pouring the molds and once we pour
the<00:02:56.980> molds<00:02:58.140> that's<00:02:59.140> pretty<00:02:59.320> much<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.530> that<00:02:59.860> is

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
the molds that's pretty much it that is

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.940 
the molds that's pretty much it that is
the<00:03:00.209> that's<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.390> poor<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.440> there's<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.770> little

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
the that's the poor and there's a little

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.140 
the that's the poor and there's a little
trapdoor<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.520> bottom<00:03:06.790> that<00:03:06.940> keeps

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
trapdoor at the bottom that keeps

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.350 
trapdoor at the bottom that keeps
everything<00:03:07.360> in<00:03:07.570> place<00:03:08.970> yeah<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.090> we<00:03:10.150> have<00:03:10.270> to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
everything in place yeah and we have to

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.509 
everything in place yeah and we have to
keep<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.140> will<00:03:11.890> open<00:03:12.040> up<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.400> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
keep it so that it will open up so that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.470 
keep it so that it will open up so that
we<00:03:12.550> can<00:03:12.670> get<00:03:12.730> everything<00:03:12.940> out<00:03:13.120> because<00:03:13.390> we

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
we can get everything out because we

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.290 
we can get everything out because we
can't<00:03:13.690> leave<00:03:13.840> all<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> token<00:03:14.530> man<00:03:17.790> then<00:03:18.790> what

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
can't leave all the token man then what

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.190 
can't leave all the token man then what
they're<00:03:19.420> doing<00:03:19.600> right<00:03:19.720> now<00:03:19.840> is<00:03:20.019> actually

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
they're doing right now is actually

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.050 
they're doing right now is actually
taking<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.010> molds<00:03:21.190> apart<00:03:21.220> basically<00:03:21.940> we're

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
taking the molds apart basically we're

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.240 
taking the molds apart basically we're
just<00:03:22.180> cleaning<00:03:22.300> the<00:03:22.480> sand<00:03:22.690> off<00:03:22.870> and<00:03:23.160> got<00:03:24.160> to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
just cleaning the sand off and got to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.580 
just cleaning the sand off and got to
grind<00:03:24.640> down<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.850> edges<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:26.140> nobody<00:03:26.440> cuts

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
grind down the edges and so nobody cuts

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.709 
grind down the edges and so nobody cuts
himself
